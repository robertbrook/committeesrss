[[[from GM Freeze]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;1. GM Freeze is submitting the following to the discussion on “The potential value and contribution of science and GM technology to UK food security”.&#xa0;

[[[Summary]]]2. GM Freeze believes that the bias in UK policy towards GM technology is actually dangerous to UK food security because it is leading the UK to neglect the fundamental issues that underpin robust food security including:&#xa0;&#xa0;3. Emphasising knowledge-based systems, the application of appropriate technologies and the enforcement of strong regulations are the answer to these weaknesses.&#xa0;

[[[GM Freeze]]]4. GM Freeze is a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee originally established as the Five Year Freeze in 1999 to achieve and maintain a national moratorium on:

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;5. The alliance of organisations that forms GM Freeze seeks to give expression to the public’s deep concern about the pressure to introduce genetic modification in food and farming. The aim is to inform the public, media and politicians accurately about GM organisms, especially crops, their impacts and to encourage public participation in making decisions about them.&#xa0;6. The GM Freeze has produced many briefings and reports on issues connected with GM, for example most recently:&#xa0;&#xa0;7. It has also responded to many consultations in the US and EU, and has produced many news releases on a wide variety of subjects.&#xa0;

[[[The failure of GM ]]]

[[[technology to contribute to food security]]]8. GM Freeze has particularly highlighted the failure of GM research to produce viable answers or useful products after many years of promising them. We note, however, that we and many other progressive organisations around the world have moved beyond the limitations of the “food security” concept and instead work with a food sovereignty model. We urge the EFRA committee to do the same.&#xa0;&#xa0;9. The endless promises of the GM industry have helped to draw the UK down the path of GM technologies and have at the same time led the UK to neglect the many alternatives to GM, such as strategies to deal with pests through border planting to attract predators, intercropping and working with farmers to conventionally breed or recover old varieties of seed that is drought and salt tolerant. &#xa0;10. Furthermore current GM crops are now beginning to fail, with the emergence of serious problems including resistant weeds and insects and massively increased use of pesticides. GM crops reveal a clear pattern: initially they seem to save work and reduce applications of toxins, but this does not last. GM crops lead to worse problems than the ones they claim to alleviate, whereas many of the alternatives are already tried and tested over many years. &#xa0;11. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, emerging scientific evidence shows that European GM-free farming performs better than GM farming in United States.&#xa0;12. GM Freeze therefore does not believe that GM can or will contribute positively to UK food security. We note that the President of the European Natural Soyfood Manufacturers Association recently called for better consumer information on GM foods, potentially using GM-free labels across the food industry, saying, “Current EU policy does not sufficiently support the cultivation of GMO-free soy products, despite a clear demand for GMO-free food by the consumer.” This move acknowledges the considerable public resistance to GM food, which is a clear barrier to GM playing any meaningful role in UK food security.&#xa0;

[[[EFRA]]]

[[[ appears to conflate science with GM]]]13. The GM issue as stated by this EFRA consultation itself appears to conflate science with GM technology. GM Freeze believes that this is problematic. There are plenty of essential areas for the application of science for UK food security that do not involve GM. These include:&#xa0;&#xa0;14. We have suffered for years from declining nutrient levels in our soils and our food. UK food security needs to be built up from the base of healthy soils, through healthy seeds, plants and animals in order to help ensure a healthy population. However it appears that the UK Government does not believe that agroecological approaches to food security are worth pursuing, and we wonder if this is because they are less likely to attract patents and are therefore less interesting to business.&#xa0;

[[[“Potential” value of GM ]]]

[[[technology to UK food security]]]15. We have been told since the 1990s that GM technology was the future for agriculture. We are constantly promised new GM crops for drought resistance and salt tolerance. However these are still promises unfulfilled, and this does not surprise us because drought resistance and salt tolerance are complex issues involving multiple genes whose functions and interactions we do not yet fully understand. &#xa0;16. We believe these unfulfilled promises for future GM “solutions” are used to draw research down the costly, risky path of GM, so neglect other approaches that are far more likely to yield results. &#xa0;

[[[The International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) ]]]17. Fifty-seven governments approved the summaries of the IAASTD report in a final plenary in Johannesburg on 12 April 2008, with the UK approving them two months later on 9 June 20081. We are glad to note that DFID contributed over £500,000 to the Assessment. Immediately before the Plenary, DFID and DEFRA issued a joint press statement which endorsed the IAASTD process:&#xa0;“The IAASTD is a unique assessment involving governments, civil society and academics. The IAASTD reports are a very valuable and important contribution to the debate and understanding on agricultural knowledge, science and technology and its potential to reduce poverty and hunger around the world.”&#xa0;18. However the UK Government has since neglected the recommendations of this landmark report, which states:&#xa0;“The purpose of IAASTD is to assess agricultural knowledge, science and technology (AKST) in order to use AKST more effectively to reduce hunger and poverty, improve rural livelihoods, and facilitate equitable, environmentally, socially and economically sustainable development.”&#xa0;19. The IAASTD Global Synthesis for decision makers sets out 22 key findings, which we recommend highly to the EFRA Committee as a sound basis for deliberations. Important here is that IAASTD did not endorse GM crops as a solution to food insecurity: &#xa0;“The application of modern biotechnology outside containment, such as the use of genetically modified (GM) crops is much more contentious. For example data based on some years and some GM crops indicate highly variable 10-33% yield gains in some places and yield declines in others.”&#xa0;These are not the only problems emerging from GM cultivation.&#xa0;

[[[Existing problems with GM crops]]]20. In addition to the yield variability noted in the IAASTD report, we now see growing problems with current GM crops. Commercialised GM crops basically consist of herbicide tolerant (HT) crops in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and the US and insecticide expressing crops such as GM cotton planted in India, China and parts of Africa. &#xa0;21. Instead of reducing levels of herbicide applied as promised, chemical usage is increasing in GM HT crops, and more recently even with the insecticide expressing crops. The industry response is to offer new GM crops that are “stacked” with genes supposedly conferring tolerance to multiple herbicides or expressing different versions of insecticidal Bt genes. This is a pesticide treadmill that should be avoided at all costs. &#xa0;22. There are also well-documented negative social and environmental impacts of GM cultivation, which include impacts on the health of local populations in countries where local people are exposed to spraying (eg, in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay). &#xa0;23. Now we are being promised GM crops with increased nutritional elements, the most famous of which is “golden” rice. Here again a little investigation reveals that there are many sound alternatives to the use of genetic modification to produce crops with increased levels of nutrients, many of which could contribute significantly to local food sovereignty.&#xa0;24. We therefore do not believe that GM technology has anything to contribute to UK food security. We are weary of the constant claims made for GM technology, and would request that those making them are challenged to justify them. For example Secretary of State Owen Paterson said on 20 June 2013:&#xa0;“Used properly the advanced plant-breeding technique of GM promises effective ways to protect or increase crop yields. It can also combat the damaging effects of unpredictable weather and disease on crops. It has the potential to reduce fertiliser and chemical use, improve the efficiency of agricultural production and reduce post-harvest losses.”&#xa0;25. GM Freeze asks where the evidence is that GM increases yields. No GM crop has been bred for that purpose. Instead GM Freeze notes:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The rest of this consultation response]]]26. Below we set out some of our previous work that relates to this consultation. We begin with the UK Agri-tech Strategy, which demonstrates the same techno-fix bias towards GM crops and foods that we note above. We then discuss the Red Tape Challenge and finish with issues around animal feed.&#xa0;

[[[Government’s Agri-tech strategy]]]27. GM Freeze was clear that in our view the success of any UK Agri-tech Strategy depends on how it meets the real needs of people and the environment, rather than how well it just serves industry

[[[.]]]&#xa0;28. Modern intensive farming systems have failed to produce a balanced diet for everyone but have polluted our air and water, degraded soils and produced huge losses of biodiversity. The strategy needs to improve on this and come up with the best, most sustainable approaches drawing on knowledge-based systems, the application of appropriate technologies and the socio-economic and political reforms needed to get food to hungry people without excessive wastage or food miles.&#xa0;29. GM crops fail to meet these basic requirements because their existence is based on an attempt to patent and control seeds. This meets the “need” of companies to achieve repeat seed sales, but it does not further the cause of sustainable food production – as is shown by the rapid rise in weeds resistant to the chemicals used on GM crops and the subsequent rise in herbicide use and damage to species like the Monarch butterfly.&#xa0;30. In our response to the BIS consultation “Shaping a UK Agri-tech Strategy” GM Freeze recommended re-issuing the Agri-tech consultation because:

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;31. We fear that this consultation may be flawed in the same way, as the questions and topics do not address what we consider to be the fundamental issues around food security in the UK. These relate, for example, to: &#xa0;&#xa0;32. We are confining ourselves here to addressing the issue of GM, and will leave it to others to elaborate on these other vital issues.33. GM Freeze responded to the Cabinet Office consultation on its “Red Tape Challenge”, focusing on GMOs. We emphasized that regulation is not red tape, and that defining it as such must not be used as a pretext to water down essential regulation. Regulation, with associated “red tape”, plays a key role in protecting health, the environment and making society fairer. It could also be argued that the state of the economy is, in part, due to the underregulation and the unregulated behaviour of companies and individuals within the financial sector.&#xa0;The Red Tape Challenge ignores the crucial role regulation plays in protecting the health and welfare of future generations and the planet. Lack of regulation causes huge problems for future generations (and other species) who derived no benefit from the past use of poorly regulated technology, products or practices (eg, the impacts halocarbons on the ozone layer, the role of asbestos in lung disease, the BSE crisis and long-term ecological damage due to commercial activity such as the decline of fish stocks).&#xa0;34. GM Freeze believes “red tape” is an unhelpful term, which is poorly defined and can mean different things to different audiences. What are required are procedures to enforce regulations correctly, effectively and efficiently in order to achieve their objectives.&#xa0;35. GM Freeze is concerned that the attempt to conflate regulation with red tape will be used to confuse the public and facilitate bad practice. Fundamental to this is the precautionary principle, which applies to all EU environmental legislation. Failure to apply the Precautionary Principle can transfer the burden of the risk of a new technology, technique or product from the developer/permit holder to the citizens and environment. The potential harm caused by authorising a harmful product or technology could result in costs that far outweigh any economic benefits derived from the product or technique. In such situations the costs would be borne by people affected, the environment and taxpayers (eg, the National Health Service treating illness caused by the technology or the loss or severe reductions in populations of affected species). Gaps in data and scientific uncertainty should trigger the use of the Precautionary Principle, and no approval should be made until these deficiencies have been satisfactorily resolved. The use of Post Market Monitoring conducted by consent holders should not be used as a way to avoid thorough risk assessment before approval is made.&#xa0;36. Finally it is clear that attempts to denigrate regulation as red tape serves the interests of the companies that have been trying to introduce GM crops to the EU for many years but have found their progress blocked. Now we see that these crops are failing where they have been grown. This is all the more reason not to adopt them, but rather to be thankful for the clear demonstration that these are short-term “solutions” with negative long-term impacts.&#xa0;

[[[No evidence that public consultations have ever influenced policy in this area]]]37. GM Freeze noted in its response to the Agri-tech strategy consultation, as we believe it still holds, that: &#xa0;

[[[Conclusion]]]40. GM Freeze believes that the bias in UK policy towards GM technology is actually dangerous to UK food security because it is leading the UK to neglect the fundamental issues related to food security including:&#xa0;&#xa0;41. Emphasising knowledge-based systems, the application of appropriate technologies and the enforcement of strong regulations are the answer to these weaknesses.&#xa0;10 December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
