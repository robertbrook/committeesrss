"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted (in a personal capacity) by Sophie Boyron, Senior Lecturer in Law, Birmingham Law School, University of Birmingham (CRJ 08)&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn this evidence, I conc\nentrate \nlargely on issues raised by \nquestions 3, 4 and 5. \nBy way of introduction, I wish to state that the\n move to a codified constitution would not necessarily trigger a change in the\n role of the\n Britis\nh\n judiciary\n. \nI\nt would be\n possible\n to draft the provisions of the new constitution and\n ensure that the judiciary \nhas \nthe same attributions and the same constit\nutional position therein\n. \nFor the role o\nf the judiciary to change following the adoption of the \ncodified constitution\n, i\nt would mean\n one of two things: \neither\n \nthe authors\n of\n the \nconstitution took a decision\n to alter\n the role of the judiciary in the new\n document or\n despite\n the\n lack of formal change\n, the ‘codified’\n constitutional environment trigger\ned\n \nnew political and/or judicial practices and an unforeseen\n transformation of\n the role and position of the judiciary.\n If the\n second\n situation\n \nrequires a certain degree of ball gazing\n, it is important to no\nte that this evolution is\n possible\n; new constitutiona\nl settlements have been known to trigger dynamics of constitutional change over and beyond the strict text of the constitution\n.\n \nT\nhere are plenty of \ncomparative \ninstances around the world of courts transforming their role and position\n beyond the ones contai\nned\n in the constitutional document\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nWhile the move to a codified constituti\non would not necessarily change\n the role of the judiciary\n in itself\n, the adoption of a system of constitutional review has the\n potential to do so. In fact\n, t\nhe adopti\non of such a\n system raises such fundamental questions\n for the British constitution\n that it would likely transform\n it entirely. \nAlready \nin the last decade, \ns\needs of this\n transformation\n have\n be\nen\n sown\n,\n \nand the\n adoption of a system of constitutional\n review would h\nave th\ne effect of confirming\n this evolution\nary trend\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nConsequently, prior to addressing questions of constitutional design for such a system of review, it is important to identify the \nconstitutional\n conditions that need to exist for a system of constitutional\n review to function satis\nfactorily. It is these ‘\nconditions’\n or this constitutional environment that have the potential to affect\n the principle of \nparliamentary sovereignty and to transform\n the British constitution. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAs mentioned above,\n a certain constitutional envir\nonment needs to exist\n for a system of constitutional review to function and to be effective. \nHowever, to establish\n \nthis environment, some \nfundamental deci\nsio\nns\n on the character\n and content of the \ncodified constitution need to be made first\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe primacy of the codified constitutionThe adoption of a system of constitutional review r\naises\n in turn\n the question of the primacy\n \nof \nthe future constitution\n. \nIt wo\nuld be somewhat\n impossible for\n a \nfull \nsystem of constitutional review \nto function w\ne\nre the codified constitution \nnot granted\n primacy over Acts of Parliament\n.\n Only this higher status\n \nwould\n give the necessary authority to the new constitution and to the system of constitutional review to\n ensure\n \nthe \ncompliance\n of Acts of Parliament\n with the provisions of the constitution. Consequently, \nthe new\n codified\n constitution \nwould need to be placed \nat \nthe \napex of the constitutional\n order \n(or in jurisprudential parlance, \nat the top of the\n ‘hierarchy of norms’\n)\n. \n&#xa0;\nA Bill of Rights?T\nhe second issue that should \nto be addressed\n to create an effective\n environment for constitutional review is th\ne\n adoption of \na Bill of Rights.\n \nWhile\n constitutional review \ncould exist and function without a\n Bill of Rights\n, it\n would be severely curtailed\n. \nTraditionally, \nco\nnstitutional review\n \nensures\n the protection of\n \nfundamental rights and freedoms. Indeed, w\nithout\n a\n Bill of R\nights\n, the courts \nwould only be able to ensure\n compliance with the\n procedural requirements of the\n legislative procedures or\n the\n \nconstitutional\n principles\n clearly enounced in the constitution (such as \nthe p\nrinciple of \nin\ndependence of t\nhe judiciary). This wo\nuld establish\n a very\n narrow \nsystem of constitutional review and one that would \ntend to concentrate on the political system, its various mechanisms and the relationship and balance of \npower between Government, Parliament and Judiciary\n.\n Traditionally, these \nareas are regulated efficiently by constitutional practices and conventions and although \nthey would be \ncodified in the new constitution, they may not ben\nefit much from becoming the\n focus of the new system of constitutional review. \n&#xa0;\nFinally,\n were the const\nitution given primacy in the constitutional order and were a system of constitutional review \nbe adopted, these would undermine\n the main tenets of the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Not only would the courts be empowered\n to challenge the validity o\nf\n Act\ns\n of Parliament but\n,\n \nt\nhey would no longer be held to have a somewhat inferior constitutional position to Parliament. The institutional balance inherent to the principle of parliamentary \nsovereignty would be compromised\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhatever the choices made with regard to the issu\nes adumbrated above, these will\n inform the design of the system of constitutional review. \nWhen designing a system of constitutional \nreview, two main questions\n need to be addressed: the \nchoice of judicial structure and th\ne type of judicial remedies\n. \n&#xa0;\nConstitutional court v. ordinary courtsThere are two main options when deciding on th\ne judicial structure \nappropriate for a system of\n constitutional review\n: a spe\ncialized constitutional court \n(e.g. the German, Italian and Spanish systems of constitutional review)\n or a \ndiffuse system of constitutional review\n through the control of ordinary courts\n (e.g. the system of \nconstitutional review in the USA or in Greece). \n&#xa0;\nThe organisation of a \n‘\ndiffuse\n’\n system of constitutional review would not necessitate the creation of a new court and would only require\n some adjustments to\n the existing judicial processes\n and court structure\n. \nFor instance, t\nhe constitutionality of an Act \nof Parliament relevant to the case could be challenged\n in\n all\n ordinary litigations.\n  \n \n&#xa0;\nHowever\n, the majority of European countries resort\n to constitutional courts. T\nhese\n specialized courts\n \nconcentrate \nall constitutional litigation\n in one\n \ncourt and\n their\n d\necisions\n \noften\n have major poli\ntical and societal implications. Consequently,\n \nconst\nitutional courts can\n attract deep and repe\nated criticisms. W\nhen designing \nsuch a court\n, \nparticular attention\n need\ns\n to be given \nto\n \nany aspect\n that\n may\n foster legitimacy;\n in particular both \nthe m\nembership and\n appointment system\n need\ns\n to be chosen\n car\nefully\n. \nFor instance, in the context of the UK judicial system, it\n would be useful to move awa\ny from the limitations of the\n judicial appointm\ne\nnt system and allow\n some\n lay membe\nrs with relevant knowledge (\ne.g. \npolitical scientist or specialist in\n ethics\n) or professional experience (e\n.\ng\n.\n human rights campaigner of high standing)\n.\n \nFurth\nermore, the relationship of the constitutional\n cou\nrt with the ordinary courts would need to be or\nganized\n carefully\n to ensure that \ncases requiring\n a constitutional ruling are referred\n easily\n to the constitutional court.\n&#xa0;\nOn balance, the choice of a diffuse system of constitutional review may suit the Brit\nish judicial system better. Also\n, there\n has never been muc\nh enthusiasm in the past for the creation of a\n specialized public law court.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe remediesIf \nthe codifi\ned constitution were granted a higher status, then the court(s) should have the power\n to strike down an unconstitutional Act of Parl\niament. \nIn addition, the court(s) may need the power to modulate the eff\nect of their\n ruling.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, t\no \na\nvoid the need for \nthis type of \nmodulation\n, \nthe constitutionality of a b\nill\n could be checked before coming\n into\n force. This \nsystem of \npre-enactment\n review \nwould control\n \nthe bill \nonce adopted\n by Parliamen\nt and be\nfore receiving the\n Royal Assent\n. Accordingly, the court\n would be able\n able to ‘catch\n’ unconstitutional provision\ns\n before they had any legal effect\n. \nThere would be\n no need\n to remedy\n th\ne\n detrime\nntal impact\n of an unconstitutional\n \nAct of Parliament and no scope\n for the modulation of the effect of a ruling of unconstitutionality\n.\n However, the system of\n pre-enactment review\n has some \nknown drawbacks. First, the control\n is \nabstract and \nit is \ndebatable \nwhether any\n court\n in the circumstance\ns\n can really identify \nall possibl\ne \nbreaches of the constitution\n.\n \nAlso\n, \nthis control \noccurs immediately after a bi\nll has been passed\n, when the political arguments for and against the text resounds around Parliament stil\nl. \nIn this context, it can be difficult for the\n court\n charged with this review not to be tainted by ‘political’ association. It would \nbe \nall\n the mor\ne difficult if the\n system of\n pre-enactment review\n is n\not automatic but if it is\n trigger\ned \nby \nany number of\n \nelected representatives\n \n(e.g. the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the House of\n Commons, a number of MPs) as is often the case \nfor this type of revi\new.\n In fact, in many countries where it exists, pre-enactment review\n is \nre\ngarded to be last obstacle \nthe oppo\nsition can put across the path of\n bill\n. \nIn view of\n \nthe \nrather\n abstract nature of the litigation and the\n politicized environment\n in which it often operates, it \nis doubtful whether a system of pre-enactment review\n would \ntake root easily in the United Kingdom\n.\n&#xa0;\n1 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nSee instance, \nthe US Supreme Court with Marbury \nv. Madison, 5 US 137 and\n the French Constitutional Council with\n the decision on\n Freedom of Association\n C Cons. 71-44 DC 16 July 1971 \nLiberté d’association\n.  \n \nAmong these seeds one can point to the decision\n \nof\n R\n v. \nSec. of State for transport, ex p. Factortame\n [1991] 1 AC 603\n, the Human Rights Act and the debate concerning the new category of ‘constitutio\nnal statutes’\n, see Laws LJ in \nThoburn\n v. \nSunderland City Council\n [2002] EWHC 195 (Admin)\n.\n In fact, despite this evolution, \nthe principle\n of parliamentary sovereignty h\nas demonstrated great resilience\n.\n \nWhile it would be possible for the authors of the \ncodified constitution to continue using the ECHR as a replacement for an endogenous Bill of Rights, it may not be desirable. For instance, it may be politically difficult to granting to the Convention the higher constitutional status necessary to ensure co\nmpliance all other Acts of Parliament.\n In France, the Constitutional Council can postpone the effect of its ruling to give time to Parliament to replace the unconstitutional legislation. \n \nIn France, some commentators have questioned whether all breache\ns of the constitution are really identified despite a robust pre-enactment review by the Constitutional Council.\n \nFor example, in the French constitution, the right to have ordinary bills reviewed by the constitutional council is given to the President of\n the Republic, the Prime Minister, the Presidents of each chamber of Parliament, 60 members of the National Assembly (the first chamber of Parliament) or 60 members\n of the Senate (the second chamber of Parliament).\n"
