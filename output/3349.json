"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Financial Ombudsman Service [PHS0032]Thank you very much for your letter dated September 2013 inviting written evidence to\n \nyour Committee's inquiry into the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO).\nabout usI thought \nit might be helpful for me to set out the nature and context of our work to begin\n \nwith. Although our organisation shares the title of `ombudsman' with the PHSO, our\n \nprivate sector remit in respect of financial services inevitably (and rightly) means that o\nur\n \nfocus and operation is somewhat different.\nAs you know, the Financial Ombudsman Service was established under the Financial\n \nServices and Markets Act to resolve disputes between financial businesses and their\n \ncustomers. It brought together a number of pr\nedecessor ombudsman schemes under\n \none roof to create a `one stop shop' for financial services disputes. The service deals with\n \ncomplaints involving banks, insurers, advisors and other businesses regulated by the\n \nFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA), as well a\ns those made against consumer credit\n \nbusinesses currently licensed by the Office of Fair Trading. In total we cover more than\n 1\n00,000 businesses ranging from the major banks to sole traders.\nOur statutory remit is therefore somewhat different from the \nPHSO's. Unlike the PHSO, \nwe have a statutory obligation to both look at and resolve all complaints referred to us \ndirectly by consumers, except in quite limited circumstances — giving rise to significant volumes of complaints (around 500,000 currently rece\nived per year). Our role also has to be understood in the context of a wider regulatory regime for financial services — including \na statutory regulator of industry conduct — the Financial Conduct Authority — from whom we are operationally independent but w\nith whom we work closely. So while we share our \ninsight with both regulators and businesses, our focus is primarily on resolving individual \ncomplaints, rather than necessarily looking at wider issues of commercial practice or \nbehaviour in the market. Anoth\ner important difference is that, unlike the PHSO, if a \nconsumer accepts our decision then it is binding on the business concerned and \nenforceable in court subject to an upper limit on binding awards of £150,000 a case.\nThose sorts of distinctions (the\nre are of course many others) reflect the core\n \npolicy \npurpose behind our organisation — namely as part of a wider set of\n \nregulatory\n \narchitecture, to correct market failure in financial services by\n \nremoving the asymmetries of \npower between businesses and \nconsumers\n \nwhen engaged in disputes. So while there are \na number of analogies\n \nbetween our services, we operate in a very different context from \nthe PHSO\n \n— whose purpose is so closely tied to the wider delivery of public services and\n \nParliament's role in hol\nding the executive to account. Our evidence is therefore\n \ninevitably \npresented though that lens.\nIn terms of the complaints that come to us, in 2012/13 we handled 2,161,439 initial\n \nenquiries in 55 languages. 508,881 enquiries were taken on as new cases (an \nincrease\n \nof 92% on the year before) of which just under three quarters were about payment\n \nprotection insurance. Almost two thirds of last year's complaints (62%) related to the four\n \nmajor high street banking groups.\nyour questionsTurning to the specific questions you raised in your letter: \nHarmonisation of Ombudsman schemes\n1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow do you share good practice with other ombudsmen, to improve processes and\n \ncustomer service?\nWe engage with our fellow UK ombudsman schemes in a regular, \nstructured way through\n \nthe well-established Ombudsman Association, of which Caroline Wayman (our Principal\n \nOmbudsman and Legal Director) is an executive committee member. We also share best\n \npractice with other financial ombudsman schemes across the world, \nthrough both informal\n \nand formal networks. Ombudsman Association members regularly co-operate on issues\n \nof shared interest, for example the recent work on managing the impact of Alternative\n \nBusiness Structures (ABS) regulations.\nWe also enjoy warm and co-o\nperative bilateral relationships at senior staff and board level with a number of ombudsman schemes — including financial ombudsman schemes across the world.\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat are your views on the creation of a single access point for complaints to all\n \nombudsmen?\nThere is certainly opportunity to improve access to ombudsman services across the UK.\n \nAnd it is true that the fact that there are different schemes can cause consumers\n \nconfusion.\nWe regularly research consumer behaviour, as whatever access mechanism we hav\ne \nneeds to meet consumer needs. The findings we have, however, show that consumers \ndon't search for `ombudsmen' — they look for specific resolution of their issue. So, if they \nhave an issue with their bank, they are likely to contact us, or a debt charity,\n whereas if \nthey have an issue with their NHS provider they are likely to contact advice agencies, \npatient groups or the PHSO. In our case regulatory rules require clear signposting of the \nombudsman by financial businesses when they handle complaints.\nSo, while a single access point for all complaints to all ombudsmen might appear an\n \nattractive option, we would be concerned that it would simply add a new cost (of running a\n \nnew infrastructure) for a service which consumers would be unlikely to use, or se\ne benefit\n \nfrom. A single portal for ombudsman schemes may also (however inadvertently) limit the\n \nconsumer's understanding of non-ombudsman options available to them such as Citizen's\n \nAdvice, trading standards or in some cases alternative mediation schemes.\n Of course,\n \none could add those services to the portal too, but that risks becoming unwieldy.\nThe existing ombudsman schemes are good at cross-referring consumers to one another\n \non the occasions when that is necessary. With over two million customer contac\nts last\n \nyear, some of which end up being directed to other schemes, we have particularly strong\n \nexperience of this. It's also worth noting that the EU online portal for ombudsman\n \nservices — which is being implemented in parallel with the ADR directive — \nwill offer a\n \nsingle entry point for consumers who have bought goods or services online.\nWe cannot see the benefit of another 'single' portal.\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat are your views on whether or not there should be a single public services\n \nombudsman in England, as there is i\nn Scotland and Wales?\nWhile we see the intellectual case for economies of scale and ease of access on the one\n \nhand, and the benefits of specialisation on the other (see also question 6 below), in the\n \nend this is a matter that is wholly outside our \njurisdiction and we have no particular view\n \non it.\nEuropean Directive on Alternative Dispute Resolution\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat consideration have you given to the introduction of an EU Directive on ADR and \nare you taking any action in response?\nWe are pleased to note that t\nhe Directive was based to a significant extent on UK best\n \npractice, and believe that its implementation in the UK should build on the strong existing\n \narrangements for ADR of which our service is part.\nThe ADR Directive is of course significant for us. We \nhave been closely engaged with its\n \ndevelopment, and we broadly welcome its provisions. We are looking at whether any\n \nadjustments to our operations will be required as a result of the legislation which\n \ntransposes it into UK law.\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo \nwhat extent do you believ\ne the Directive will allow better and meaningful\n \ncomparisons in performance and sharing of practice across providers or agencies?\nThe Directive has two functions: the first is to harmonise basic standards and the second\n \nis to improve access. Given the very\n varied types of ADR provision both within the UK\n \nand the EU we think the publication of data mandated by Directive itself is unlikely to aid \nmeaningful comparisons between different providers.\nIt's also important to remember, as noted in the introduction \nto our evidence, that variation\n \nis not necessarily bad: different ombudsman schemes are — for good reasons — designed\n \nin different ways, meaning that even where comparison may be possible it may not\n \nalways be meaningful or instructive, either for the consu\nmer or other interested parties.\n \nWe think the numbers can be useful — but they rarely tell the whole story.\n&#xa0;\nThat said, we do place a premium on transparency (we now publish ombudsman\n \ndecisions, and have always been very open about the basis on which \nwe make decisions,\n \nand about the trends in complaints by issue and by firm) and we welcome any\n \nencouragement to transparency in ADR provision. If not telling in themselves, published\n \ndata can really help in bringing understanding to our work.\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo what exten\nt do you think the Directive presents an opportunity to remodel the existing system of ADR to resolve possible existing overlaps, shortfalls and conflicts?\nThe ADR Directive is certainly an opportunity to look at the system we have and decide\n \nwhether it's \nthe sort of system that parliament wants for the UK. And there is no doubt that\n \noverlaps and shortfalls exist. For example, if you're buying a house then your lawyer will\n \nbe covered by one ombudsman, your mortgage provider another, and your estate agent\n \nby\n yet another. There are gaps too — no ombudsman, for example, covers advice to\n \nswitch occupational pension schemes.\nWe do have a good record of addressing these gaps and overlaps, in collaboration with\n \nother ombudsman schemes where necessary. Overall, the \nUK's ADR system functions\n \nfairly well and the Directive won't necessarily force reform either.\nThat said, the Directive and the domestic legislation it spawns do represent a good\n \nopportunity for the government to take stock of the ADR landscape, and to ask\n some\n \nquestions about what approach we think is best for consumers and industry. There is a\n \ncase for the current landscape, characterised by a large number of discrete and specialist\n \nombudsman services to whom regulators and the industry can relate and dev\nelop close\n \nrelationships, and most of whom operate in a way that looks a little like the courts. We\n \ncan see the appeal of this network of smaller, specialised schemes.\nBut we can also see the logic of a landscape in which networks of fewer and larger\n \nschemes operate. As well as being easier to navigate for consumers, they benefit from\n \neconomies of scale that give them increased versatility and resilience to peaks (and\n \ntroughs) in demand — including those caused by mass complaints like PPI and changes i\nn\n \nmarket or consumer behaviour, which can be hard to forecast. Bigger schemes can also \napply their learning and expertise across sectors and invest in outreach and insight, while \nadjusting more easily to changes in scope and jurisdiction.\nOur own experienc\ne suggests that some of the best of both worlds may be possible. With \nwork spanning two regulators, we have experience of managing work from more than one \njurisdiction, tailoring rules and approaches where necessary depending on the relevant \nregulatory env\nironment, and more generally handling the technical and cultural \ndifferences between sectors described elsewhere in this evidence. Other ombudsman \nschemes have similar experience.\nFinally, in terms of the Directive, it's important to note that its provisio\nns on access are geared towards the relationships between consumers and traders. We don't have the \nexperience to comment on far its approach might usefully translate to the slightly different \ncontext of public sector ombudsmanry.\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow can those involved in \ndispute resolution, but who aren't covered by the Directive, \nensure that they are meeting the same expected standards of quality as those who \nare covered by it?\n&#xa0;\nAs stressed in my answer to question 5, it's important to note that different ombudsman \nschemes do different things. Some resolve business-to-business disputes, while others \nhandle consumer-to-business ones. Some deal with very complex cases requiring \nspecialist knowledge and detailed research, while others handle relatively straightforward \nm\natters (and of course some — like us — do both). Some are obliged to handle all \ncomplaints that come to them, while others are not. Some (like PHSO and us) have an \nobligation to share their insights with regulators and others, while others don't. And every\n \nscheme has different stakeholders with often very different requirements and \nexpectations.\nTherefore, while high standards across the board are important for all of us, it isn't clear \nthat one could or should impose precise definitions of what constitutes\n high standards for \napplication across the full range of schemes. Instead, it makes sense for the Directive to \nimpose basic standards at a high level — which is exactly what it does. Then, more \ndetailed standards should be determined by the relevant author\nity on a sector-by-sector \nbasis, through the specification (and, where applicable, tendering) of individual \nombudsman schemes. This specific standard-setting will be the real driver of standards, and will apply just as much to schemes outside the scope of \nthe Directive as within it.\nIt's also important that flexibility should be shown within individual schemes as well as \nbetween \nthem: a simple case can and should be dealt with quickly, whoever is dealing \nwith it, while more complex cases should get the time\n and attention they need. Ultimately this is in the consumer's interest: inflexible standards will always have to be set at a level \nthat's reasonable for the slowest, most complex cases, which would be unacceptably \nfrustrating for consumers and businesses \ninvolved with simple complaints.\n8. \nHow can the government ensure against the proliferation of excessive numbers of\ndifferent dispute resolution bodies and mechanisms (and should it be doing so)?\nIn my answer to question 6, I said we believe the overall approach taken by Government \nto shaping the ADR landscape should depend on what factors it wishes to prioritise in the \nprovision of ADR services for consumers. Relative proliferation might be desira\nble if we \nthought consumers would benefit most from specialised services, with strong but narrow \nindustry and regulator relationships. Alternatively, consolidation may be best if we thought \nconsumers would benefit most from a marketplace that shared learni\nng, was more \nresilient to mass complaints and could achieve economies of scale.\nIn any case, if Government does take the opportunity to re-shape the ADR landscape it must be careful to preserve the one overriding principle of all ombudsmen — i.e. their ind\nependence. As with any quasi-judicial body, an ombudsman relies on there being \nconfidence (among both consumers and traders) that the scheme is genuinely impartial. \nSo in contemplating any future changes to the ADR set up, it's essential that services are \nnot subject to any funding structures that incentivise partisanship, or the perception of it. \nAn ombudsman must not give the impression of having been captured by a financial \ninterest to find in favour of one group or the other.\n&#xa0;\nTherefore, while a polluter-pays model which provides good value for money remains the \nmost desirable approach, the use of competition as a means of achieving value for money \nneeds to be considered carefully. For example, any competitive process whereby \nom\nbudsmen compete to handle an individual business's complaints is likely to lead to a \nrace to the bottom as far as consumers are concerned. Even if there is no change in the \nsubstance of decisions, it's clear that a service's processes and approaches will b\ne \ngeared to suit its customer (the business) rather than the consumer, which risks deterring \nconsumers from complaining. It would also introduce incentives against an ombudsman making tough decisions which are unpopular with the industry concerned.\nI hope \nthese answers are useful for your inquiry. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
