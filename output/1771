[normal]Actively engage with Parish Councils and Local Area Forums throughout the Vale

[normal]Liaising with Passenger Focus groups on strategic issues as appropriate

[normal]Actively engag
[normal]e with national transport organisations where appropriate
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]AVTUG has a committee of 10 and meeting attendance varying from 25 to 45.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]AVTUG’s response to the committee’s points:[bold]How do Government and Local Authorities identify demand for passenger [bold]transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?[bold]There is a need for longer term planning than pre
[normal]sently exists. Buckinghamshire C
[normal]ounty 
[normal]C
[normal]ouncil has no long term plan for transport.
[normal]AVTUG identify 4 categories of 
[normal]demand for travel:
[normal]Medical 
[normal]Shopping
[normal]Friends
[normal]Relatives
[normal]AVTUG recognises the social and economic benefits that access to tranport brings to both individuals and communities.
[normal]To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with di[bold]sabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?[bold]Insufficiently
[normal] – for example
[normal]:
[normal]Dial a ride at its worst can charge up to £30 
[normal]for a 
[normal]return 
[normal]fare to
[normal] travel between an outlying
[normal] village and the county town. The situation is particu
[normal]larly difficult in the northern
[normal], less populated, part of Aylesbury Vale.
[normal]Marsh village lost its bus service and 5 car
[normal]-
[normal]less households 
[normal]were left without any means of 
[normal]travelling out from their small 
[normal]community.
[normal]A new secondary school, on a new estate on the edge of Aylesbury town, is due to open in September 2013. As of early August no transport arrangements had been announced for its new students.
[normal]There is a perception that profits come before service
[normal] to the public.
[normal]What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?[bold]The cost of providing them.
[normal]The lack of volunteers
[normal] .This is not due to apath
[normal]y, more volunteer fatigue. Buckinghamshire
[normal] 
[normal]already 
[normal]boasts twice the national average of volunteers in the community.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How cou[bold]ld Community Transport be improved?[bold]Larger communities, such as Wendover and Winslow already have community buses. This does not appear to be the solution for smaller more isolated communities given costs and volunteer 
[normal]issues referred to above.
[normal]Local Area 
[normal]Fora already offer small cash incentives to local transport initiatives but these are necessarily limited.
[normal]To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?[bold]Please see refe
[normal]rence to Dial a Ride services above. They are demand led, but their costs can be prohibitive. In such situations they are no answer to social isolation.
[normal]What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How ca[bold]n these services be made more affordable?[bold]A long-term plan for transport by the county council would be a useful start. At present planning for the future is apparently too often influenced by more immediate financial considerations.
