defaultAVTUG has a committee of 10 and meeting attendance varying from 25 to 45.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAVTUG’s response to the committee’s points:defaultHow do Government and Local Authorities identify demand for passenger defaulttransport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?defaultThere is a need for longer term planning than pre
defaultsently exists. Buckinghamshire C
defaultounty 
defaultC
defaultouncil has no long term plan for transport.
defaultAVTUG identify 4 categories of 
defaultdemand for travel:
defaultMedical 
defaultShopping
defaultFriends
defaultRelatives
defaultAVTUG recognises the social and economic benefits that access to tranport brings to both individuals and communities.
defaultTo what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with didefaultsabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?defaultInsufficiently
default – for example
default:
defaultDial a ride at its worst can charge up to £30 
defaultfor a 
defaultreturn 
defaultfare to
default travel between an outlying
default village and the county town. The situation is particu
defaultlarly difficult in the northern
default, less populated, part of Aylesbury Vale.
defaultMarsh village lost its bus service and 5 car
default-
defaultless households 
defaultwere left without any means of 
defaulttravelling out from their small 
defaultcommunity.
defaultA new secondary school, on a new estate on the edge of Aylesbury town, is due to open in September 2013. As of early August no transport arrangements had been announced for its new students.
defaultThere is a perception that profits come before service
default to the public.
defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?defaultThe cost of providing them.
defaultThe lack of volunteers
default .This is not due to apath
defaulty, more volunteer fatigue. Buckinghamshire
default 
defaultalready 
defaultboasts twice the national average of volunteers in the community.
default&#xa0;defaultHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How coudefaultld Community Transport be improved?defaultLarger communities, such as Wendover and Winslow already have community buses. This does not appear to be the solution for smaller more isolated communities given costs and volunteer 
defaultissues referred to above.
defaultLocal Area 
defaultFora already offer small cash incentives to local transport initiatives but these are necessarily limited.
defaultTo what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?defaultPlease see refe
defaultrence to Dial a Ride services above. They are demand led, but their costs can be prohibitive. In such situations they are no answer to social isolation.
defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How cadefaultn these services be made more affordable?defaultA long-term plan for transport by the county council would be a useful start. At present planning for the future is apparently too often influenced by more immediate financial considerations.
