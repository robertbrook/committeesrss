defaultThe 
defaultHouse of Commons Science and Technology Committee (hereinafter the S &amp; T C
defaultommittee
default)
default has announced its intention to hold an enquiry into what the public understand about climate, where people look for their information, and how that may impact on climate change policy
default; and it has invited written submissions. Such is the nature of the present document.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultThe invitation requires that each submission 
defaultshould 
defaultinclude a declaration of interest
default.
default I served in the 
defaultForeign Office 
default(

defaultFCO

default from 1948 to 1973, and was
default,
default from 1968 to 1970
default,
default Head of the 
defaultScience &amp; Technology 
defaultDepartment
default,
default which handled FCO interests in all

default. I served in 
defaultsenior positions 
defaultas an Official of 
defaultthe European Commission from 1973 to 1986
default;
default and was for the last 5 of these years 
default- which included the period of the

defaultHead of the Directorate General for Energy

defaultIn 
defaultits call for submissions
default,
default the Committee
"default drew attention to its own Report ""Devil’s bargain? Energy risks and the public"""
default (Session 2012-13)
default. That Report was fundamentally flawed. At no stage did it attempt to define the extent to which climate change is man-made. This 
defaulthas to be

"defaultThe published Terms of Reference of the S &amp; T Committee's Enquiry record that ""In 2006", 81% of surveyed 
defaultUK
default citizens were fairly or very concerned about climate change
default,
default compared with 76% in 2,"009 in an identical tracking survey"". "
defaultEven more striking are the results of a survey by GlobeScan Radar
default, published in February, 2013,
default of nearly 23,000 people in 22 countries, including the UK, which found that, since 2009," the proportion of people viewing climate change as ""very serious"" has fallen from 62% to 49%. In these circumstances", one would have expected that the very first question the S &amp; T Committee would place 
"defaultbefore the Enquiry would be ""Is"
