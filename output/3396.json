"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Cuadrilla (ESG 31)  &#xa0;\nCuadrilla\n \nappreciates\n the opportunity\n \nto give evidence \nto the House of \nCommons Welsh \nAffairs \nCommittee as part of its inquiry into\n \nEnergy generation in Wales: Shale Gas\n \nand\n is pleased to make \nthe following written submission\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe House of Lords Economic Affairs committee is running a concurrent inquiry into shale gas to which Cuadrilla has recently submitted evidence. There are some areas of mutual focus in the two inquiries and consequently some of the evidence below \nhas also \nbeen provided to the House of Lords committee\n. \n&#xa0;\nIntroduction to Cuadrilla\n&#xa0;\nCuadrilla has attracted much media focus on exploration of shale gas in the UK and is proud to be the first-mover in what could prove to be a very economically beneficial industry \nfor the UK. In our view a UK shale gas industry could managed correctly, be instrumental in providing highly skilled jobs in \nareas which badly need them, building energy security, \nsupplying tax revenues for the exchequer as \nNorth Sea revenues diminish, \nmee\nting demand for energy for electricity, hea\nting and industrial use, and in \nplaying an important role in the UK’s future energy mix. \n&#xa0;\nCuadrilla is a small, specialist, British SME with \nconsiderable expertise \nin geology and unconventional\n&#xa0;\noil and gas engine\nering and drilling.\n&#xa0;\n We are in the vanguard of\n&#xa0;\nunconventional oil and gas exploration in Britain\n.\n Together with our partners Centrica and A.J. Lucas we hold a 1200 KM2 \nexploration \nlicence in the Bowland basin in Lancashire.\n&#xa0;\n Cuadrilla plans to drill,\n&#xa0;\nhydra\nulically fracture and flow test a small number of exploratory wells to show how much of the huge quantity of natural ga\ns in place in the Bowland shale\n \ncould be \ncommercially recoverable.\n&#xa0;\nSummary\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence\n1. The importance of gas to the UK’s overall energy needs and the potential role shale gas could play within it;1.1\n Gas is an important \nconstituent\n part of the UK’s\n energy mix and will continue to \nbe so in terms of \nelectricity generation\n, domestic \nheating\n, cooking and industry\n for the foreseeable future\n.\n \n1.2. \nAs a method of electricity generation, gas is better for th\ne environment than coal and is crucial as a transitional fuel for the UK on its road to a low carbon economy. \nThe Climate Change Committee \n(CCC) \nrecently \npublished its position on shale gas, stating that \n‘t\nhe need to reduce our emissions implies a reductio\nn over time in the quantity of fossil fuels being burned. This is even more true if carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies do not prove viable. However, UK shale gas production could be compatible with meeting our emissions targets\n’. According to th\ne CCC, this is because \nshale gas lifecycle emissions could be lower than those of imported LNG, a fact that has also been reinforced by DECC’s chief scientist.\n Therefore gas has a necessary role to play in electricity generation and can assist the UK in me\neting its legally binding climate targets.     \n \n  \n1.3\n \nThe lesser discussed side of the UK’s gas demand is domestic heating, cooking and industry. \nThe debate on Britain’s energy needs almost invariably defaults to the supply of electricity, the need to \ndecarbonise our electricity generation and the thr\neat of the “lights going out”. \nIn the context of this debate it is very important to note that \nover \ntwo thirds of UK gas demand has nothing to do with electricity generation and is in fact used for domestic\n heating, cooking and industry.\n&#xa0;\n Over 90% of \nUK homes use gas for heating. \nIn the absence of a credible plan to replace this heating demand, then, irrespective of what happens in the electricity supply market, gas is going to have a major role to play in B\nritain’s energy supply for the next thirty years or more.  \n1.4\n Consequently, \ng\niven the decline in Britain’s reserves of gas from the North Sea and increasing dependence on imported gas in the form of LNG from Qatar and pipeline gas from Russia and Norway \n,\n the debate should focus on not whether or not the UK will\n need gas but rather where \nthat gas \nwill \nbe sourced from. \nCuadrilla believes that shale gas could produce a significant amount of gas, reducing import dependency and improving security of supply.  \nThe UK is of course only entering the exploration phase for shale, so development models are at present hypothetical and reliant on a number of external factors. \n1.5\n \nCurrently the t\notal UK gas demand\n is \nsome 3 trillion cubic feet (tcf) per annum. The British Geological survey has estimated that in the North of England alone the Bowland shale contains, most likely, 1,300 tcf of gas.  If just 10% of that gas could be recovered that represents over 40 years \nof domestic supply. By 2030, without shale gas, it is forecast by DECC that the UK will be importing some three quarters of its gas needs.  \nThe Institute of Directors report published in May 2013 indicated that \n76% of the UK’s gas is likely to be imported \nby 2030, costing £15.6 billion. In the IoD’s central scenario, shale gas production could reduce gas imports to 37% in 2030, and the cost of imports could fall to £7.5 billion.\n&#xa0;\nThis would assist with the UK’s balance of payments and support energy security\n.\n2. The potential for shale gas exploration and commercial level extraction in Wales;2.1 \nCuadrilla does not have a licence to explore for shale gas in Wales. The British Geological Survey will be better suited to answering this question accurately. \n3. The potential environmental and climate change impact of extraction and use of the gas; 3.1 \nCuadrilla\n strongly believe\ns\n t\nhat hydraulic fracturing of \nshale rock\n in the Bowland Basin\n, over 6,000 feet below the surface, can be conducted with minimum cost to the surrounding environment. \n&#xa0;\n3.2 Water management is important in this context\n. Despite some media reports to the contrary, there have been no proven cases of hydraulic fracturing\n fluid contaminating groundwater. Cuadrilla plans to use in Lancashire a fracturing fluid that will be non-hazardous to groundwater and \ncontains\n very \nfew chemical additives any of which will require the prior approval of the Environment Agency and\n will be \npublically disclosed. \nThe water that flows back to the surface from the shale rock with the produced gas has also been assessed as non-hazardous by the Environment Agency although it does contain very low levels of naturally occurring radioactivity.  Initi\nally this water will be taken for treatment at EA approved waste treatment facilities but over time we would expect to be able to recycle flow back water and re-use it for hydraulic fracturing.  \n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nWell integrity is \nalso \nvital, and much can be done at t\nhe design stage to ensure that a well is fit for purpose to prevent\nany loss of gas or liquid\n. Cuadrilla’s wells are designed to the highest international standards. \nEach vertical well we drill has several layers of steel casing, the layers of which always \nextend beyond the depths at which the aquifer is found. \n&#xa0;\n3.4 \nOur well designs are overseen by an independent well examiner, before being submitted to the HSE. Once the HSE has reviewed the design, and we have received all further planning applications and\n permissions, we are free to proceed with the construction of the well. We are confident about our well design.\n&#xa0;\n3.5 \nThe potential flaring of natural gas from shale is an area that has also been inaccurately reported on with descriptions of thousands of fl\nares lighting up the countryside.  Flaring is carried out in the exploration phase for a limited duration (typically 30 to 90 days), on a small number of exploration wells and with the volume to be flared per well restricted and regulated by both DECC and \nthe Environment Agency.  This is because in the exploration phase wells are not connected to the gas grid.  During any subsequent production phase when a gas grid connection will have been established at each producing site then there should be no requirem\nent to flare as wells are drilled and produced.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n \nWith regard to methane emissions and carbon footprint, \nt\nhere is a growing scientific consensus that shale gas has a role to play in contributing to reduction of CO2 in the UK.  The \nreport commissioned by\n the Department of Energ\ny and Climate Change and led by\n the department’s Chief Scienti\nst, Professor David Mackay\n, published on 9 September (\nPotential greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas extraction and use: A study by Professor David J C MacKay FRS and Dr.\n \nTimothy J Stone CBE\n)  is very interesting in this regard.\n&#xa0;\n The r\neport concluded that shale gas’s \noverall carbon footprint is comparable to gas extracted from conventional sources (e.g. the North Sea), lower than that of imported \nLNG \nand significantly (four to five times) lower than coal.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.7 The most recent research relating to the safety of shale e\nxtractio\nn was published by Public Health England in October. The \nreport\n found that \nf\nracking for shale gas is safe as long as operations are well-regulated and well-run\n and \nthat the risks to public health from exposure to emissions from shale gas extraction are low\n. \nThe report provides welcome reassurance to people\n about hydraulic fracturing \nand should dispel scaremongering about its safety\n.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.8\n \nIn short there will be \nsome \ne\nnvironmental \nimpacts \nin relation to the industrial process, truck movements etc. These environmental impacts need to be viewed in context and not be exaggerated especially in relation to the possibility of water contamination, emissions or seismicity. \n4. Whether the current regulatory regime covering such activity is adequate;4.1 The onshore oil and gas industry has a great deal of heritage in the UK. It is a fallacy posited by some that the UK lacks experience in the sector and that the regulatory system\n is not up to the ta\nsk. \nIn the UK \n2000 \nonshore \nwells have since been drilled, with 200 hydraulically fractured. The UK is also home to Europe’s largest onshore oil field in Wytch Farm. \n&#xa0;\n4.2 \nCuadrilla is confident that the regulatory framework in the UK is \nsufficiently robust to ensure safe and responsible exploitation of shale gas. T\nhere is a clear scientific and academic consensus, underlined here in the UK by the Royal Society and the Royal\n Academy of Engineering joint report (\nhttp://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/shale-gas-extraction/report/\n), and by other prominent academic experts that unconventional oi\nl and gas exploration and production can be carried out entirely safely in the UK.  Concerns that have been raised around water and air contamination and seismicity can all be managed by strong regulation and industry best practice. \n&#xa0;\n4.3 \nThe Government ar\ngues and we agree that the oil and gas regulatory process in the UK is already the strongest in the world. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1 \nAs stated, Cuadrilla does not have a licence to explore for shale \ngas \nin Wales and currently has not undergone any financial modelling specific to Wales. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHaving said this, it is fair to say that if the\n geology is good and there is the right political and investment environment then the benefits for Wales in relation to energy security, job creation and capital investment could be substantial. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
