"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from ElecInfo Ltd DCLG Electrical Competent Person SchemesMay I start by stating I have an interest in NAPIT, as a duly elected representative of the NAPIT Trade Association nationally and for \nElectricSafe\n.   I am not permitted by NAPIT Group to express the views of the NAPIT members I represent\n, or that of \nElectricSafe\n in public\n. \nThe  information below is my personal opinion based on speaking to Electrical contractors, Electricians (The Trade) and their customers the Public.\nI have watched with dismay as the Committee has tried to extract from the DCLG Part P Competent Person Schemes what they actually provide to the public. The information below is provided to assist the committee in that process.\n“Competent Person Schemes are independent bodies authorised by DCLG for a particular purpose. They are accountable to their members but the Department does not have the resources or control mechanisms to ensure that what a competent person scheme operator says or does is always accurate or representative of the views of its members.”\nAt the 27\nth\n February, 2012 oral evidence session, the Minister Andrew \nStunell\n would not fully support the statement.\nQ85 Mark Pawsey: Wouldn’t you agree, Minister, that Part P has been working, because the incidence of fires attributed to mains wiring, which I understand Part P relates to, has declined from 1,057 in 2004 to 872 in 2008? Isn’t that an indication that Part P has been effective?\nAndrew Stunell: It is certainly an indication that something has been effective. Several things have worked to achieve that. It is certainly not part of our case that Part P has not been effective; it is about whether it has been \nproportionate. Actually, the much more widespread use of circuit breakers has probably had quite a lot to do with that as well. Of course, I do not think the figures distinguish whether the balance of fires that are still occurring is mostly in property that has been subject to Part P or, in fact, in property that has not been touched since 2005 and to which Part P would not apply. I certainly acknowledge that there has been an improvement, but we need to be careful in attributing specific improvement to specific measures.\nSo who sets standards of competence for electricians, the EAS committee does, this committee has been mentioned several times. The Schemes themselves set the standards in this committee, it is not an Institution of Engineering and Technology Committee (IET) they do not approve the standards, they only provide administration and secretarial support.\nThe debate about the two new registers is about Money. The \nElectricSafe\n register is open and the Electrical Safety Register is closed to their members only, the government should take ownership of the name, but they are unwilling, I presume there are legal restraints on who carries the responsibility for Schemes actions which is understandable.\nThe Schemes have had many opportunities to presented the full picture, but have declined for their own reasons, the above is presented to help the Committee.  The trade appreciates the work the committee has done to uncover the various aspects of the dangerously flawed system.  My trade has had enough, I would welcome the opportunity to assist the Committee further. \nWe are funding the whole sorry mess and feel that are funding should contribute to a more accountable system for public safety.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nTable 3 in \nFire statistics Grea\nt\n Britain 2011 to 2012: tables 1a-16\n (excel spreadsheet) published on the \nCommunities and Local Governme\nn\nt Department website\n&#xa0;\n"
