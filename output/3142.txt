[[[UKR 39]]]Roger Wade is CEO of Boxpark Shoreditch, the World’s 1st Pop Up Mall. Boxpark has successfully rebuilt a High Street in Hackney, London, and has a unique mix of Events, Independent brands and Pop Up Retailers. The Government should be encouraging pop up units across Britain and offering business rates relief for qualifying small business tenants. This is potentially a sustainable solution to revitalising our empty high streets. Pop ups are the future breeding ground for next generation of Independent Retailers.We recommend a qualifying small business tenant can claim up to 3 months rates relief once per calendar year. The qualifying business could be administered by an Independent Pop Up organisation like We Are Pop Up, Appear Here, Pop Up Britain or similar body. The current business rates relief scheme allows landlords to qualify for up to 3 months rates relief if they let empty units BUT the small business tenants are still responsible for paying rates if the rateable value is above £6000. This system is totally one sided because it does not encourage small businesses to rent empty shops. The suggested scheme encourages both the landlord and tenant to fill empty units. The long-term objective is to encourage small businesses to trial pop up stores. After a 3-month period the tenant will be then liable for commercial rental terms and business rates.The benefits are the following; the small business tenant can test out business concepts at relatively low set up costs. The landlord can fill empty units and qualify for up to 3 months business rates relief and hopefully develop a long-term tenant. The government can fill empty stores and hopefully after 3 months generate long-term business rates.

[[[Digital High Street]]]

[[[:]]] Provide free public Wi-Fi on our High Street and Town Centres, allowing customers to use their mobiles to browse and locate local Independent stores and develop an email database of local visitors, creating a connected community of retailers and customers.The aim of this Boxpark proposal is to develop three complementary, and sustainable inititives which if successful could be applied to High Streets and Town Centres across Britain. The business rates relief will encourage small independents to fill empty stores and reduce the high cost of starting a retail business. Once the retailers have started we need to help them develop their business and compete in this Digital age, by developing a digital marketplace of connected local independent retailers. Finally we need to connect with the customer, and develop free Wi-Fi on the High Street, allowing customers to view local products available, and buy or share products instore, online or mobile.Boxpark are prepared to run a pilot scheme on a not for profit basis, and work with the Shoreditch Digital Community, Hackney Council, GLA or Government to develop these initiatives further.&#xa0;
