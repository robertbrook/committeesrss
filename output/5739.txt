&#xa0;Supplementary written evidence from Chief Constable Martin Richards QPM, Sussex Police [PCC Progress 50]&#xa0;&#xa0;I am writing in response to your letter dated 17th January 2014 which was received in my office on 28th January 2014. In this letter you request the information that I had agreed to provide relating to Police Information Notices (PINs) during my evidence to the Committee on 7th January 2014.&#xa0;I am aware that a response has been provided to the Committee providing the number of PINs issued by Sussex Police during 2013. However your subsequent letter asks for the number of PINs that have been issued for the last two years. For the sake of completeness, I can confirm that in 2012 Sussex Police issued 1796 PINs, and in 2013 we issued 2006 PINs.&#xa0;&#xa0;
