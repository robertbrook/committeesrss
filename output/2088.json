"&#xa0;\nInsolvency Lawyers’ Association – Written evidence&#xa0;\nThe Insolvency Lawyers’ Association (the\n \"\nILA\") provides a forum for c 450 full, associate, overseas and academic members who practice insolvency law.  The membership comprises a broad \nrepresentation of regional and City solicitors, barristers and academics and overseas lawyers. The Technical Committee of the ILA (the \"\nCommittee\") is responsible for identifying and reporting to members on key developments in case law and legislative reform in the insolvency and restructuring market place. \nThe Committee welcomes the opportunity to provide a response in relation to the Call for Evidence. In doing so the Committee has limited its response to aspects of the draft Deregulation Bill that relate to insolvency matters, namely Clauses 9 and 11 and Schedule 5. Before looking at those specific sections, the Committee should point out that it is fully supportive of the policy behind the measures which are designed to remove unnecessary burdens on businesses, individuals and public bodies alike. Now taking each of the specific insolvency related measure in turn:\nAuthorisation of insolvency Practitioners (Clause 9)The stated aim of this provision is to increase accessibility and improve competition between insolvency practitioners. We expect that you will hear directly from insolvency practitioners as interested parties in this part of the Bill.  We therefore limit our comments to some general observations, namely that by introducing a tiered system of authorisations, it may in fact be more expensive for those regulating insolvency practitioners to operate and monitor.  It may also make it more difficult for those entering into the market, who will have to specify at an early stage which aspects they are to focus on, putting them at a disadvantage to those who are already authorised to act and will be fully authorised.   It may also have the effect of discouraging competition, for example, in that corporate insolvency work remains the preserve of very large practices.  Whilst we appreciate that the proposals are made with the aims of lowering the costs of training and ongoing regulation for those wishing to specialise, it would be unfortunate if that narrowing of expertise could also potentially result in a lowering of standards at the entry level, which would not benefit the industry.        \nInsolvency and company law: miscellaneous (Clause 11) and Schedule 5This clause simply refers to the operative provisions which are set out in Schedule 5 and are divided into seven parts.\nPart 1: Deeds of Arrangement We agree that the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914 should be repealed and serves little practical purpose.\nPart 2: Administration of companiesParagraph 5 – This change provides clarification as to the prohibition on the appointment of administrators, which previously has given rise to the court having to consider the point in a \ncouple of reported cases.  We agree with this proposal on the basis that it should avoid further applications to the court.\nParagraph 6 –We welcome the suggested amendments to paragraph 26 of Schedule B1 which has been the subject of numerous cases relating to the validity of appointment for out of court administrators. The proposed changes however should be extended to also address the issue that those who receive notice as prescribed by Rule 2.20(2) do not have to consent to the appointment.  This aspect can be addressed by way of an amendment to Rule 2.20, and we would endorse the suggestion put forward by the FMLC's paper on the Appointment of Administrators by Companies and Directors (Issue 173) at paragraph 5.4.  \nParagraph 7 –Whilst we are not aware of the issue concerning the discharge of administrators addressed by the changes to paragraph 98, we do not see any harm in the changes suggested and they may well prevent such an issue arising in practice in the future.\nPart 3: Winding up of companiesParagraph 9 – we agree that section 151 IA 1986 ought to be repealed as being of no practical use. \nParagraph 10 –the proposed amendment to section 174 in relation to the release of the liquidator where a winding up order has been rescinded seems sensible.\nPart 4: DisqualificationParagraph 11 seeks to amend the powers of the Secretary of State to obtain information directly in relation to the director's conduct from \"any person\" rather than the appointed officeholder. Whilst we recognise the importance of obtaining information in relation to disqualification proceedings (as articulated in \nRe Pantmaenog Timber Co Ltd (in liquidation); Official Receiver v Meade-King (a firm) and others [2003] UKHL 49), and we also note the reasons for the intended change are to relinquish the administrative burdens placed on insolvency practitioners and allow for a more efficient investigation against delinquent directors, we are concerned that it is a significant change to the usual approach in the context of civil proceedings where ordering disclosure against (potentially non- parties) is determined on a \"by exception\" basis and is not something that the court orders routinely. The Secretary of State has the ability to seek information from \"any person\" at present pursuant to CPR 31.17(3) and we cannot see how a wider power as envisaged in the Bill can be justified. We note that there is a discussion paper \"\nTransparency &amp; Trust: Enhancing the transparency of UK company ownership and increasing trust in UK business\n\" issued by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills dated July 2013 which is also seeking views on further changes to the directors' disqualification regime including a possible extension of the time period for pursuing directors from 2 to 5 years and we query whether the investigatory powers of the Secretary of State would be more properly be dealt with in that context rather than as a matter of \"deregulation\".  We also note that in the context of the \"\nRed Tape Challenge – changes to insolvency law to reduce unnecessary regulation and simply if procedures\n\" consultation issued on 18 July 2013 there are also proposals for changes in the reporting provisions in relation to directors’ conduct to address some of the administrative burdens in this regard.  We make also a general \ncomment that considering the different aspects of the disqualification regime on a piecemeal basis in the various consultations appears to be less than an efficient way of proceeding.\nPart 5: BankruptcyParagraphs 13 and 14 which amend section 286 IA 1986 to allow the court to appoint insolvency practitioners as interim receivers seems sensible.  \nParagraph 15 which removes the mandatory requirement for a bankrupt individual to provide a statement of affairs where a bankruptcy order has been made on a creditor's petition unless requested to do so by the Official Receiver, appears to be acceptable. \nParagraph 16 includes protective provisions for banks against potential claims by trustees in bankruptcy in relation to after-acquired property.  We welcome this clarification, and its aim of encouraging banks to offer accounts to undischarged bankrupts.\nPart 6: Authorisation of Insolvency PractitionersWe see merit in these repeals and a more consistent approach with ensuring insolvency practitioners are authorised by one of the recognised professional bodies.  However we refer to our general comments in relation to clause 9 above, in respect of different categories of authorisation and the logistics of operating a three tier system, in particular whether this in fact will result in removing unnecessary burdens, and instead may add to them. \nPart 7: Liabilities of administrators, administrative receivers of companies and preferential debts of companies and individualsWe understand that this clause is designed to repeal the priority for employees’ wages for a type of contract that no longer exists and therefore is no longer required.  We agree that the limited changes suggested in relation to sections 19, 44, paragraph 99 of Schedule B1 and paragraphs 15 of Schedule 6 should be made in this respect. \n&#xa0;\n16 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n- \n1\n-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
