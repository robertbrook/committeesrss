[normal]Written evidence from the Pensions Ombudsman [PHS0033][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for your September letter about PASC's enquiries into complaints handling, in which 
[normal]you ask 
[normal]for my views on eight questions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Before I respond to the questions, I should perhaps make it clear that I am replying personally and 
[normal]in my capacity as the holder of the joint posts of Pensions Ombudsman and Pension Protection 
[normal]Fund Ombudsman. I am also presently Chair of the Ombudsman Association (formerly known as 
[normal]the British and Irish Ombudsman Association). I am not representing the Association's views in 
[normal]this letter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]. How do you share good practice with other Ombudsmen, t
[normal]o 
[normal]improve processes 
[normal]and customer 
[normal]service?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have contacts with other ombudsmen's offices at several levels in the organisation. We 
[normal]informally benchmark what we do against comparable ombudsmen through awareness of 
[normal]their and our KPIs. More formal benchmarki
[normal]ng is difficult because of differences in 
[normal]jurisdictions, size of office, overall purpose etc. We use our network of friends in other 
[normal]bodies to gain awareness of work that they are doing and inform them of our work.
[normal] We are active in the Ombudsman Association, which holds operational seminars and workshops that 
[normal]give further insight (for example there is a seminar on quality in early December, with 
[normal]presentations from five offices).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]. 
[normal]What are your views on the creatio
[normal]n of a single access point for complaints 
[normal]to 
[normal]all ombudsmen? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I do not think as single access point is practicable, for the following reasons.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst most ombudsmen's jurisdiction can be simply expressed - "Housing", "Legal 
[normal]Services", "Pensions", "Local Gove
[normal]rnment" etc - actual jurisdictions are often highly 
[normal]complex, particularly at the margins. And in matters such as discretion *ether to 
[normal]investigate, pre-requisites for acceptance, time limits and so-on there are significant 
[normal]differences. There is a separate q
[normal]uestion about whether these complexities are desirable, 
[normal]but while they exist a single access point could not properly deal with every office's remi
[normal]t 
[normal]and powers without 
[normal]dividing up its expertise and replicating, at least in part, present 
[normal]arrangements of specialists in each ombudsman's work — even if at a single location, either 
[normal]real or virtual. That being so, the sought for benefit of single access is lost. In effect the 
[normal]single 
[normal]access point would be a conglomerate of the front ends of each office, with the same
[normal] 
[normal]boundary questions and cross referrals as exist at present.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As an associated point, the different jurisdictions mean that different information is needed to decide 
[normal]whether a complaint can be dealt with, so the application process could not be 
[normal]easily harmonised.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Existing statutory jurisdictions may place limits on delegation of decisions and 
[normal]discretions about jurisdiction, so that they can only be made by the office's
[normal] own staff. Non statutory 
[normal]schemes might need rule changes which they could not be compelled to make — and no 
[normal]office could be compelled to participate in the single access point. So legislation would be 
[normal]necessary to achieve comprehensive coverage. Without c
[normal]omprehensive coverage the 
[normal]effectiveness of a single access point would be impaired.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A solution to the difficulties above might be that the single access point would do no more 
[normal]than point towards the ombudsman likely to be able to deal with the matter. But
[normal] then each 
[normal]ombudsman's office would have to follow up with much the same work as at present. So the 
[normal]single access point would add an extra tier. It would be little more than an optional portal —which may well be worth considering but is probably not what t
[normal]he Committee had in mind in 
[normal]asking the question.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. 
[normal]What are your views on whether or not there should be a single public services ombudsman in 
[normal]England, as there is in Scotland and Wales?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would be in favour. There is sufficient similarity of jurisdiction fo
[normal]r there to be benefits in 
[normal]terms of efficiency, ease of access and clarity for the public. The arrangement works well in 
[normal]Scotland and Wales. The one impediment to clarity is that there would be some no-
[normal]devolved matters concerning Scotland and Wales that nee
[normal]d a home. Whilst the English public services ombudsman might seem the logical place for them (because they are 
[normal]presently with PHSO) that is not the only solution.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal] 
[normal]What consideration have you given to the introduction of an EU 
[normal]Directive on ADR 
[normal]and are you 
[normal]taking any action in response.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are at the early stages of considering its impact on us (but very aware that
[normal] 
[normal]implementation is in early 2015). We have raised it with our sponsor department (DWP). Our present view is that our procedures and jurisdiction a
[normal]re compliant (or can easily be 
[normal]made to be). The bigger questions are (a) whether there are relevant contracts and services 
[normal]not covered by ADR entities at present which should be brought within our scope and (b) whether processes adopted by new ADR entities
[normal] in addition to the Directive's requirements will change the public's expectations of our own service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal] 
[normal]To 
[normal]what
[normal] extent do you think the Directive will allow better and meaningful comparisons in 
[normal]performance and sharing of practice across providers or agencie
[normal]s?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It would if there was proliferation of ombudsmen with similar characteriStics. (I mention 
[normal]above the difficulties of benchmarking amongst ombudsmen with very different 
[normal]characteristics). But proliferation is not in the public interest (see below).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. 
[normal]To 
[normal]what extent the Directive presents an opportunity to remodel the existing
[normal] 
[normal]system of ADR
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]resolve possible existing overlaps, shortfalls and conflicts?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On its own there is a risk that the Directive will result in proliferation with 
[normal]additional
[normal] 
[normal]overlaps, shortfalls and conflicts. In my view there needs to be a clear 
[normal]stance that the 
[normal]Government does not expect that there should not be more than one ADR provider in any
[normal] 
[normal]business sector and that
[normal] 
[normal]where there are sectoral similarities there s
[normal]hould be a single 
[normal]provider across sectors. Existing providers should be used where possible (but not in such a 
[normal]way as to encourage their jurisdictions to reach into very different services). See answer to question 8, below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. 
[normal]How can those involved in disput
[normal]e resolution, but who aren't covered by the Directive, ensure that 
[normal]they 
[normal]are meeting the same expected standards of quality as those who are covered by it?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The question assumes that the expected standards under the directive are higher than those 
[normal]that would
[normal] apply without it. I'm not at all sure that premise is correct — certainly amongst 
[normal]ombudsman schemes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. 
[normal]How can the government ensure against the proliferation 
[normal]of excessive 
[normal]numbers 
[normal]of 
[normal]different dispute 
[normal]resolution bodies and mechanisms (and should it be doing
[normal] so)?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]See my answer to question 6 above. It is less than clear that the Government can do more
[normal] 
[normal]than discourage proliferation, since the directive does not place limits on the number of 
[normal]schemes registered with the "competent authority(ies)". However opinion formers, such as 
[normal]media and consumer bodies are likely to oppose the idea of competi
[normal]tive ADR entities and 
[normal]the Government should adopt the same position. Suppliers of goods and services are likely 
[normal]to be supportive too, since a simpler landscape, with entities maximising economies of scale, 
[normal]is in their interests.
