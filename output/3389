defaultWritten evidence from the Pensions Ombudsman [PHS0033]default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThank you for your September letter about PASC's enquiries into complaints handling, in which 
defaultyou ask 
defaultfor my views on eight questions.
default&#xa0;
defaultBefore I respond to the questions, I should perhaps make it clear that I am replying personally and 
defaultin my capacity as the holder of the joint posts of Pensions Ombudsman and Pension Protection 
defaultFund Ombudsman. I am also presently Chair of the Ombudsman Association (formerly known as 
defaultthe British and Irish Ombudsman Association). I am not representing the Association's views in 
defaultthis letter.
default&#xa0;

default. How do you share good practice with other Ombudsmen, t
defaulto 
defaultimprove processes 
defaultand customer 
defaultservice?
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have contacts with other ombudsmen's offices at several levels in the organisation. We 
defaultinformally benchmark what we do against comparable ombudsmen through awareness of 
defaulttheir and our KPIs. More formal benchmarki
defaultng is difficult because of differences in 
defaultjurisdictions, size of office, overall purpose etc. We use our network of friends in other 
defaultbodies to gain awareness of work that they are doing and inform them of our work.
default We are active in the Ombudsman Association, which holds operational seminars and workshops that 
defaultgive further insight (for example there is a seminar on quality in early December, with 
defaultpresentations from five offices).
default&#xa0;

defaultWhat are your views on the creatio
defaultn of a single access point for complaints 
defaultto 
defaultall ombudsmen? 
default&#xa0;
defaultI do not think as single access point is practicable, for the following reasons.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst most ombudsmen's jurisdiction can be simply expressed - "Housing", "Legal 
defaultServices", "Pensions", "Local Gove
defaultrnment" etc - actual jurisdictions are often highly 
defaultcomplex, particularly at the margins. And in matters such as discretion *ether to 
defaultinvestigate, pre-requisites for acceptance, time limits and so-on there are significant 
defaultdifferences. There is a separate q
defaultuestion about whether these complexities are desirable, 
defaultbut while they exist a single access point could not properly deal with every office's remi
defaultt 
defaultand powers without 
defaultdividing up its expertise and replicating, at least in part, present 
defaultarrangements of specialists in each ombudsman's work — even if at a single location, either 
defaultreal or virtual. That being so, the sought for benefit of single access is lost. In effect the 
defaultsingle 
defaultaccess point would be a conglomerate of the front ends of each office, with the same
default 
defaultboundary questions and cross referrals as exist at present.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs an associated point, the different jurisdictions mean that different information is needed to decide 
defaultwhether a complaint can be dealt with, so the application process could not be 
defaulteasily harmonised.
default&#xa0;
defaultExisting statutory jurisdictions may place limits on delegation of decisions and 
defaultdiscretions about jurisdiction, so that they can only be made by the office's
default own staff. Non statutory 
defaultschemes might need rule changes which they could not be compelled to make — and no 
defaultoffice could be compelled to participate in the single access point. So legislation would be 
defaultnecessary to achieve comprehensive coverage. Without c
defaultomprehensive coverage the 
defaulteffectiveness of a single access point would be impaired.
default&#xa0;
defaultA solution to the difficulties above might be that the single access point would do no more 
defaultthan point towards the ombudsman likely to be able to deal with the matter. But
default then each 
defaultombudsman's office would have to follow up with much the same work as at present. So the 
defaultsingle access point would add an extra tier. It would be little more than an optional portal —which may well be worth considering but is probably not what t
defaulthe Committee had in mind in 
defaultasking the question.
default&#xa0;
default3. 
defaultWhat are your views on whether or not there should be a single public services ombudsman in 
defaultEngland, as there is in Scotland and Wales?
default&#xa0;
defaultI would be in favour. There is sufficient similarity of jurisdiction fo
defaultr there to be benefits in 
defaultterms of efficiency, ease of access and clarity for the public. The arrangement works well in 
defaultScotland and Wales. The one impediment to clarity is that there would be some no-
defaultdevolved matters concerning Scotland and Wales that nee
defaultd a home. Whilst the English public services ombudsman might seem the logical place for them (because they are 
defaultpresently with PHSO) that is not the only solution.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default 
defaultWhat consideration have you given to the introduction of an EU 
defaultDirective on ADR 
defaultand are you 
defaulttaking any action in response.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are at the early stages of considering its impact on us (but very aware that
default 
defaultimplementation is in early 2015). We have raised it with our sponsor department (DWP). Our present view is that our procedures and jurisdiction a
defaultre compliant (or can easily be 
defaultmade to be). The bigger questions are (a) whether there are relevant contracts and services 
defaultnot covered by ADR entities at present which should be brought within our scope and (b) whether processes adopted by new ADR entities
default in addition to the Directive's requirements will change the public's expectations of our own service.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default 
defaultTo 
defaultwhat
default extent do you think the Directive will allow better and meaningful comparisons in 
defaultperformance and sharing of practice across providers or agencie
defaults?
default&#xa0;
defaultIt would if there was proliferation of ombudsmen with similar characteriStics. (I mention 
defaultabove the difficulties of benchmarking amongst ombudsmen with very different 
defaultcharacteristics). But proliferation is not in the public interest (see below).
default&#xa0;
default6. 
defaultTo 
defaultwhat extent the Directive presents an opportunity to remodel the existing
default 
defaultsystem of ADR
default 
defaultto
default 
defaultresolve possible existing overlaps, shortfalls and conflicts?
default&#xa0;
defaultOn its own there is a risk that the Directive will result in proliferation with 
defaultadditional
default 
defaultoverlaps, shortfalls and conflicts. In my view there needs to be a clear 
defaultstance that the 
defaultGovernment does not expect that there should not be more than one ADR provider in any
default 
defaultbusiness sector and that
default 
defaultwhere there are sectoral similarities there s
defaulthould be a single 
defaultprovider across sectors. Existing providers should be used where possible (but not in such a 
defaultway as to encourage their jurisdictions to reach into very different services). See answer to question 8, below.
default&#xa0;
default7. 
defaultHow can those involved in disput
defaulte resolution, but who aren't covered by the Directive, ensure that 
defaultthey 
defaultare meeting the same expected standards of quality as those who are covered by it?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe question assumes that the expected standards under the directive are higher than those 
defaultthat would
default apply without it. I'm not at all sure that premise is correct — certainly amongst 
defaultombudsman schemes.
default&#xa0;
default8. 
defaultHow can the government ensure against the proliferation 
defaultof excessive 
defaultnumbers 
defaultof 
defaultdifferent dispute 
defaultresolution bodies and mechanisms (and should it be doing
default so)?
default&#xa0;
defaultSee my answer to question 6 above. It is less than clear that the Government can do more
default 
defaultthan discourage proliferation, since the directive does not place limits on the number of 
defaultschemes registered with the "competent authority(ies)". However opinion formers, such as 
defaultmedia and consumer bodies are likely to oppose the idea of competi
defaulttive ADR entities and 
defaultthe Government should adopt the same position. Suppliers of goods and services are likely 
defaultto be supportive too, since a simpler landscape, with entities maximising economies of scale, 
defaultis in their interests.
