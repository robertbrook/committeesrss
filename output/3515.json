"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from Inspector Michael White, Chair, Wiltshire Police Federation Joint Branch Board [CST0010]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0; \nI am currently the chair of the Wiltshire Police Branch of the Police Federation of England and \nWales\n.  My previous recent roles within Wiltshire Police provide me with background experience which may provide alternative perspectives which ma\ny be of use to the enquiry.  The role I currently undertake also helps me combine my strategic knowledge with that of the views and experiences of frontline officers.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0; \nPrior to joining Wiltshire Police\n \nI gained a degree in Mathematics, Statistics and Compu\nting.  I have now been a police officer for over twenty five years.  The majority of this time has been spent in uniform working within the local policing environment.   \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0; \nIn 2005 I\n became an Inspector in the force control room.  As such I have significant\n operational experience of the recording of reported incidents and the initial investigation of such reports.\n  In early 2009 \nI \nmoved into the force performance team.  During my time in the performance team I had significant involvement in:\ni.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

\nSummary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0; \nPoor understanding of strategic performance \nmanagement \nby senior police managers lead\ning to dysfunctional behaviours (Paragraph 3)\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0; \nEvidence of misuse of \niQuanta\n \ndata to drive performance.\n (Paragraph 4)\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0; \nHMIC seeking evidence only on the under recording of crime not the accurate recording of crime.\n (Paragraph \n5\n)\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0; \nEvidence of over recording of crimes \nin cases of common assault. \n(Paragraph \n6\n)\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0; \nThe\n impacts of the over\n recording of crime.\n (Paragraph \n7\n)\n&#xa0;\n3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPerformance Management&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0; \nIn April 2010 Wiltshire Police introduced a balanced scorecard as a performance management tool.  The intention of this system was to ‘take the numbers’ away from senior managers.  The reason for \nthis was to encourage a culture of looking forward and ‘making things better than they otherwise would have been.’\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0; \nThis replaced a system where force performance was measured thorough a small number of \nyear to date \nKey Performance Indicators (KPI).  The\nse KPI’s were set against targets which were, in general, binary comparison with previous years data.  In addition \niQuanta\n data with comparison to Wiltshire’s family of forces was used mostly to give context to areas where KPI’s had worsened.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0; \nIt\n is critic\nal to understand how senior managers \nincorrectly \nuse recorded crime statistics to measure and improve performance.\n  Below \nis an \nexample I witnessed in Wiltshire Police.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0; \nDuring\n 2011Violent crime, both volume and detection rates, were identified at an issue\n in our County division.  Pressure was brought to bear on the performance team to identify ‘how much of a \nnumerical \nreduction’ would be required for this to no longer be an issue.  The hierarchical nature of the police made it impossible to resist\n providin\ng \nthis \ninformation \neven though we felt it \nc\nould \nrisk\n dysfunctional behaviour.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0; \nRather than focus on activities that would have a positive impact on future performance (e.g. improving the quality of investigations or focussed activity to target Night Time E\nconomy (NTE) violence) resource w\nas put into reviewing all Year t\no Date undetected violent crime.  \n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0; \nThe purpose was to identify administrative oversights, including incorrect crime classification, crimes not being recorded as detected or crimes that had b\neen identified as being ‘no crime’ not having been recorded as such .  In my opinion this had little or no impact in reducing crime or improving service delivery to victims of crime.  This activity, I believe, was undertaken full-time by two members of sta\nff for at least a month.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n&#xa0; \nReviewing previously completed crimes was a tactic often employed by managers in Wiltshire Police during my tenure within the force performance team.\n  I suspect Wiltshire Police are not unique in utilising this tactic.\n   \n&#xa0;\n4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMisue of iQuanta Data.&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0; \nThe guidance for \niQuanta\n states that forces should use the data to compare themselves against the average of most similar forces (MSF). \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0; \nSenior managers up to Chief Officer level \nblatantly ignored this guidance despite representations from within the performance team.  They \ndemand\ned to\n be told ‘what number they were in their family of forces’.\n  If they were\n second they wanted to be first.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0; \n \nThrough adopting this approach managers would again bring pressure to bear on improving the numbers rather than improving the level of performance.  \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0; \nA lack of understanding of twelve month\n/three month\n rolling data also lead to insufficient time being giv\nen to initiatives to reduce crime to achieve results.  Instant results were expected/demanded from operational colleagues.\n&#xa0;\n5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHMIC Inspection – The Crime Scene&#xa0;5.1\n&#xa0; \nDuring the visit to Wiltshire Police by HMIC in 2011 \nin support of their thematic inspection ‘Cr\nime Scene’ \naround 120 incidents\n were assessed to see if they had been correctly recorded as a crime.\n&#xa0;5.2\n&#xa0; \n \nIt was clear that the only issues raised were where an incident that they felt should have been recording as a crime hadn’t been.\n&#xa0;5.3\n&#xa0; \nI raised directly with\n the inspectors why they had not identified incidents that had been recorded crime where there was credible evidence to the contrary.\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0; \nThe view from the lead Inspector (Superintendent Steve Wallace – Hants Police) was that if a victim thought it was a crim\ne then it should be recorded as such.  Proportionality would come in the investigative stage following an incident being recorded as a crime.  \n&#xa0;\n5.5\n&#xa0; \nSuperintendent Wallace cited his previous experience as a crime registrar in Hampshire Police.\n&#xa0;5.6\n&#xa0; \nThe ACPO report\n – Understanding Crime Recording also raises the issue that HMIC and crime registrars interpret the question of ‘when to record’ in this way.\n&#xa0;\n5.7\n&#xa0; \nThe\n view was also shar\ned by our force crime registrar.\n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOver recording of crimes.&#xa0;6.1\n&#xa0; \nOn becoming Chief Constable \nof Wiltshire Brian Moore set out to make Wiltshire the “Safest in the Country”.  This became interpreted internally to a more measurable ‘lowest rates of violent crime in the country’.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0; \nDuring the summer of 2010, in my role as Performance Manager, I identi\nfied that Wiltshire Police had significantly higher rates of \n‘\nno crime\n’\n for less serious assaults than the other ‘top ten forces’ with the lowest violent crime rates.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0; \nAnalysis showed that in\n \nexcess\n of 2\n0\n% of these had been recorded as ‘no crimes’ within f\nive days of the initial report.  At the time force procedures were such that the additional verifiable information (AVI) required to achieve a ‘no crime’ decision often needed to be in documentary form e.g. statement. \n&#xa0;\n6.4\n&#xa0; \nIt became clear to me that for \nthese\n crimes the AVI would have been available following basic and straightforward enquiries.  I further hypothesised there was a high level of probability that AVI \neither had been or \ncould have been established within the 3x24 hour period allowed by NCRS to ma\nke a decision as to whether to record as a crime.  \n&#xa0;\n6.5\n&#xa0; \nI further hypothesised there was a high probability that there were other crimes \nwith information \nwhich, whilst \nit\n would not satisfy the requirement of AVI, would have ‘credible evidence to the contrary’\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.6\n&#xa0; \nOne of the key differences with reported common assaults\n, as compared to other crime types, is\n that in the \noverwhelming\n majority of cases the ‘offender’ is known\n, and named,\n by the victim.  This provides an opportunity to quickly identify an alternati\nve version of events (as there invariably is) and ethically apply the NCRS threshold test\ns\n e.g.\n do the circumstances amount to a crime in law AND that there \nis \nno\n credible evidence to the contrary.\n&#xa0;\n6.7\n&#xa0; \nAnalysis of a significant sample of common assaults was c\narried out by myself and a temporary Inspector on our team who had extensive experience as a detective\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.8\n&#xa0; \nWe took a deliberately literal inte\nrpretation of the words of NCRS specifically around the balance of probabilities that it was more likely than not th\nat the incident was as the result of a criminal act and whether there was any other credible evidence.  \n&#xa0;\n6.9\n&#xa0; \nThere does however seem to be a contradiction with NCRS which states it is for the police to determine whether a crime has been committed but states t\nhat in most cases the belief by the victim that a crime has occurred is sufficient to justify its recording.\n&#xa0;\n6.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur analysis showed that in around 40% of the cases we examined there was other evidence that gave an alternative version of events that could be \ndeemed credible.  \n&#xa0;\n6.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is not to suggest that 40% had been incorrectly recorded.  What we concluded however was that there was a significant risk that crimes were being re\ncorded that shouldn’t have been due to a lack of recognition of credible evidence \nto the contrary.\n  \n&#xa0;\n6.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn many cases the incidents occur when only the victim and offender are present and there is an absence of forensic evidence.  This presents the police with a significant dilemma. \n&#xa0;\n6.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo verify our findings we sought an independent operat\nional Detective Sergeant to also make an independent assessment of the same incidents.  The findings of t\nhis DS supported our findings.\n&#xa0;\n6.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimilar issues are also raised in the NPIA – Understanding Crime Recording\n \nwhich is available on the College of Policin\ng Website.\n&#xa0;\n6.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Understanding Crime Recording report encourages ‘greater use of professional judgement in relation to all aspects of the crime recording process and in particular around what constitutes ‘credible evidence to the contrary’ and ‘additional v\nerifiable information’.\n&#xa0;\n7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImpacts of the over recording of crime.&#xa0;7.1\n&#xa0; \nThe \nover \nrecording of \ncrime \ncan have significant impacts on individuals \nand police resources.  It can risk public confidence in the police.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n&#xa0; \nQuite rightly there is an expectation that police will deal with identified suspects expeditiously.  Often the method of ‘dealing with’ suspects of violent crime is to invoke the power of arrest.  \n&#xa0;\n7.3\n&#xa0; \nWithin Wiltshire Police once a violent crime ha\nd\n been rec\norded as such and a suspect named and linked to that crime there \nwas\n a performance culture linked to ‘customer satisfaction’ and  ‘detection rates’ which place\nd\n insurmountable pressure on officers to make arrests.\n&#xa0;\n7.4\n&#xa0; \nAs a local Joint Branch Board we are \ncurrently supporting an ex-officer who has suffered significant psychological damage as a result of an unnecessary arrest related to a dubious decision making process in relation to an allegation of fraud.  This has had a significant on her life.  Often as\n police officers we forget the impact that an arrest can have\n on individuals\n.  \n&#xa0;\n7.5\n&#xa0; \nWhen incidents are not recorded as crimes there is less pressure\n to make arrests\n.  As a result investigating officers have more scope to use professional judgement\n in the inve\nstigation.\n&#xa0;\n7.6\n&#xa0; \nConversely with increased opportunities for use of professional judgement comes an increased risk that crimes that should have been recorded as crimes haven’t\n been\n.\n  Clear strategies need to be in place to mitigate these risks.\n&#xa0;\n7.7\n&#xa0; \nThe culture of \nWiltshire police \nhad a \ntend\nency\n \nfor strategic \nfocus \nto be \non the outcomes of \nthe \ninvestigations \ninto recorded crime \nrather than the quality and integrity of investigations\n into reported incidents\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n7.8\n&#xa0; \nIn respect of recorded crime this\n \nimproved in late 2011 w\nith an understanding that victim satisfaction survey results had identified low levels of satisfaction with the quality of the investigations.  \n&#xa0;\n7.9\n&#xa0; \nA plan to improve quality of investigations was implemented and showed positive results.  \nThe same focus was n\not given to the investigation of incidents\n. \n \n \n&#xa0;\n7.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is\n constant pressure at all levels of management to improve detection rates\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n7.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs Wiltshire’s single point of contact for the National Crime mapping system when it went live I received numerous ‘complaints’ from people about the level of crime in their neighbourhoods.  It became evident that people had concerns that high crime levels\n may affect property prices.  \n&#xa0;\n7.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of the other concerns that I have is around enhanced vetting.  Where people are named as suspects against recorded crimes there can be a requirement to disclose.\n&#xa0;\n7.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn one example I was made aware of related to\n a decision \nfor disclosure that had been referred to the Assistant Chief Constable for a determination.\n&#xa0;\n7.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDuring an enhanced CRB check on an individual it became apparent that he was the ‘suspect’ in an allegation of child abuse (physical).  The circumstances were that\n the allegation had been made by his ex-wife some time after they had separated.  The reporting person wished no further action.  The \nreport however \nwas recorded as a crime and the ‘suspect’\n was never approached or advised of the allegation. \n&#xa0;\n7.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe absence of an investigation and the failure to identify any potential evidence to the contrary could have had a significant impact on the job prospects of the accused.  \n&#xa0;\n7.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn my view this risks undermining one of the foundations of our criminal justice \nsystem of being ‘innocent until proven guilty.’\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
