[normal]Written [bold]Evidence [bold]from[bold] [bold]Simon [bold]Guilfoyle[bold] [CST0026][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Personal Statement[bold]In submitting this evidence, it is not my intention to simply add to the examples of mis-reporting of crime incidences that the Committee 
[normal]has already considered
[normal]. Furthermore, I do not intend to address all six questions, rather
[normal] to
[normal] offer a perspective specifically in relation to Question 2:
[normal]“What are the factors
[normal] that can influence police mis-recording of crime?”
[normal]My answer 
[normal]draws upon
[normal] on academic research into UK police performance management 
[normal]that I am currently conducting
[normal] as part of my PhD studies at Warwic
[normal]k Business School, as well as 
[normal]my professional experience as a serving
[normal] police
[normal] officer of 18 years. I 
[normal]wish to clarify however, that 
[normal]the
[normal] e
[normal]vidence is presented
[normal] on my own behalf, rather
[normal] than on
[normal] behalf of my force, West Midlands Police.
[normal] 
[normal]My aim is to provide an insight into the root causes of police mis-recording of crime, to enable greater understand
[normal]ing
[normal] of the factors responsible
[normal],
[normal] and to e
[normal]ncourage debate about how
[normal] future reoccurrences can be prevented.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction and Summary[bold]1.
[normal] 
[normal]This paper will examine the factors that influence police mis-recording of crime, addressing the following themes in sequence:
[normal]Context[bold]2. In or
[normal]der to appreciate the impact of current day police performance practices and resultant behaviour, it is necessary to understand the evolution and recent history of UK police performance management; what follows is a brief summary. 
[normal]3. 
[normal]The roots of modern d
[normal]ay police performance management in the UK can be traced to the early 1980s, and 
[normal]the drive
[normal] to demonstrate efficiency, economy and effectiveness. This heralded the beginning of a paradigmatic shift towards managerialism across the UK police service, which c
[normal]ame into being as part of wider public service reforms of the era, known as 
[normal]New Public Management (NPM). (See Hood, 1991, 
[normal]1995, 
[normal]1996, 1998; Pollitt and Bouckaert, 2000; Pollitt, 2002
[normal]; Guilfoyle, 2012)
[normal]4. 
[normal]NPM-based practices intensified throughout t
[normal]he 1990s
[normal] and into the 2000s. In 1994, t
[normal]he 
[normal]Police and Magistrates Cou
[normal]rt Act (Home Office, 1994)
[normal] conferred autho
[normal]rity upon the Home Secretary to,
[normal] “…to direct police authorities to es
[normal]tablish levels of performance (‘
[normal]performance targets
[normal]’
[normal]) to be aimed at in seeking to ac
[normal]hieve the objective”. (Home Office, 1994, p.16) 
[normal]This marked a shift toward centralised control through the application of targets, which came to characterise police performance management during subsequent years.
[normal]5. 
[normal]Post 1997
[normal], 
[normal]NPM-orientated performance no
[normal]rms were further consolidated through the vigorous application of
[normal] performance indicators, numerical targets, 
[normal]‘league tables’
[normal], audit and inspection, 
[normal]and 
[normal]the holding to account of individuals for perceived ‘poor’ performance. (Loveday, 1998; 2005)
[normal] As part of
[normal] the 
[normal]1998 Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR), 366 Public Service Agreements (PSAs) were introduced across the public sector, which included over 600 performance targets. (Chief S
[normal]ecretary to the Treasury, 1998a,
[normal] 1998b; James, 2004)
[normal]6. 
[normal]This was followed by the 
[normal]Police Reform Act of 2002 (Home Office, 2002), which 
[normal]heralded
[normal] a 
[normal]further 
[normal]intensification of NPM-based practices
[normal]. (
[normal]Jones
[normal], 2
[normal]003
[normal]) The Act:
[normal]“…provided the Home Secretary with powers to set national police priorities, remove chief office
[normal]rs and directly intervene in the management of local police services”. (Loveday, 2006, p.284)
[normal]7. 
[normal]Interventionist tactics adopted by bodies set up
[normal] to scrutinise forces
[normal] (for example, the 
[normal]Prime Minister’s Delivery Unit (PMDU)
[normal] and
[normal] the 
[normal]Police Standards Unit (PS
[normal]U)
[normal])
[normal], 
[normal]to assess
[normal] performance against targets
[normal],
[normal] and expose ‘poor performers’
[normal] continued throughout the
[normal] first decade of the 21
[normal]st
[normal] Century. 
[normal](Hood and Dixon, 2010)
[normal] Forces were assessed against criteria set out within the new 
[normal]‘Policing Performance Assessment 
[normal]Framework’ (PPAF) (Home Office, 2005),
[normal] 
[normal]which was superseded by
[normal] the 
[normal]‘
[normal]Assessment of Policing and Community Safety
[normal]’
[normal] framework (APACS), amongst others.
[normal] 
[normal](Home Office, 2007)
[normal]8. Following the abolition of APACS in 2010, government policy has moved away from centr
[normal]ally-imposed numerical targets, although they are still widely-applied within police forces, as well as by a number of PCCs. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary
[normal] (HMIC) also retains peer comparison
[normal] methodology 
[normal]that is 
[normal]based on a ‘league table’ approa
[normal]ch, which ranks forces against each other. Therefore, despite this policy shift at the national level, the legacy of 
[normal]NPM-orientated
[normal] practices 
[normal]has helped perpetuate a
[normal] dominant mode of performance management that is ingrained within the police psyche.
[normal]9. 
[normal]This is the context within which gaming and other dysfunctional behaviour associated with police mis-recording of crime has occurred.
[normal]Police Performance Measurement and Its Prevailing Characteristics[bold]10. Effective performance measurement and management sys
[normal]tems are necessary for multiple reasons. Davis (2012) emphasises:
[normal]“Performance measures are a primary method of ensuring that the police are held accountable in democratic societies”. (
[normal]Davis, 2012, 
[normal]p.3)
[normal]11. 
[normal]Evidence of performance is necessary to ensure a
[normal]c
[normal]countability and transparency
[normal], which is vital in fostering policy legit
[normal]imacy.
[normal] Using the right measures in the right way also helps managers understand how the system is performing, thereby enabling a cycle of continuous improvement. (See Deming, 1986, 1994
[normal])
[normal]12. Due to the difficulty in quantifying outcomes in complex public service environments, police performance information has tended
[normal] to focus on quantitative numerical dat
[normal]a and is heavily reliant upon proxy measures. This carries significant risks when at
[normal]tempting to assess performance, but is further hampered by common practices relating to how the data is routinely presented and used. Coupled with perverse incentives associated with numerical targets and league tables, these practices significantly increa
[normal]se the likelihood of 
[normal]gaming, such as in the case of crime being mis-reported. 
[normal]13. 
[normal]In UK policing, there are three dominant components that contribute towards this risk. I refer to them as the ‘three pillars’ of traditional police performance management. T
[normal]hey are:
[normal]14. 
[normal]Taken in isolation, each has the potential to 
[normal]severely distort activity, damaging service delivery and inadvertently encouraging dysfunctional responses. They will now be examined in turn.
[normal]Binary Comparisons[bold]1
[normal]5
[normal]. The
[normal] practice
[normal] of making binary comparisons
[normal] involves comparing two isolated numeric values, 
[normal]then interpreting the difference between them as though it were a trend. 
[normal]Such c
[normal]omparisons are routinely made with
[normal] 
[normal]last week, last month, last quarter, the average, the cumulative year-to-date figure, and so on. The outcome is that a single numeric value or
[normal] percentage change is 
[normal]presente
[normal]d as though it represents a confirmed trajectory within the data.
[normal]1
[normal]6
[normal]. 
[normal]The following 
[normal]examples
[normal] are typical:
[normal]“…
[normal]crime has been reduced by 10% across the force area. This is 3,963 fewer victims of crime compared to the previous 12 
[normal]months...” (North Yorkshire Police, 2013)
[normal]“The number of house burglaries reported to police fell by 36 per cent during Operation Brightshadow, which ran from Monday, October 3 to Sunday, October 9, compared to the week before”. (Essex Police, 2013a)
[normal]17.
[normal] 
[normal]B
[normal]inary comparisons tend to be used because of their si
[normal]mplicity. They appear to convey 
[normal]information about ‘direction of travel’, and make for easy-to-consume quasi-statistical performance information. The danger of using them, however, is that they are 
[normal]too
[normal] si
[normal]mplistic. 
[normal]Bird 
[normal]et al
[normal] (2005) warn that the
[normal]ir
[normal] use encourage
[normal]s
[normal] over-interpretation 
[normal]of very minor changes amidst
[normal] data, leading to false conclusions. They strongly caution against the practice, noting:
[normal]“Very particularly the practice of concentrating on a compar
[normal]ison with the most recent value, this year’s results compared with last year’s, may be very misleading for reasons including regression to the mean”. (2005, p.14)
[normal]18
[normal]. 
[normal]Essentially, the inadequacies associated with binary comparisons make the approach fundam
[normal]entally incapable of conveying any useful information
[normal] whatsoever
[normal].
[normal] Despite this, the practice is probably the single most common method of presenting performance data in UK policing. 
[normal]The practice also invites
[normal] unintended behavioural changes
[normal], which
[normal] occur because assumptions about performance based on a binary comparison are often accompanied by implicit exhortations to improve. 
[normal]A typical example would be where crime appears to have increased, when in fact data presented in a time series may indicate
[normal] it is stable. Performance pressures associated with 
[normal]such 
[normal]an apparently increasing crime rate are one of the factors
[normal] directly
[normal] responsible for mis-recording of crime. 
[normal]Tabular Peer Comparisons (‘[bold]League Tables[bold]’)[bold]1
[normal]9
[normal]. 
[normal]League tables form part of commonly-used a
[normal]pproaches for assessing comparative performance, yet are vulnerable to methodological instabilities which undermine their efficacy; their use can also lead to unwarranted conclusions being drawn about performance, and act as an unintended catalyst for unhe
[normal]althy internalised competition and dysfunctional responses.
[normal] (Jacobs and Goddard, 
[normal]2007
[normal]; Goldstein and Spiegelhalter, 1996; Bird 
[normal]et al
[normal] 2005)
[normal]20
[normal]. 
[normal]Th
[normal]e rationale behind 
[normal]their application in policing
[normal] 
[normal]is outlined 
[normal]as follows:
[normal]“The intention is not to ‘set’ one 
[normal]individual force against another nor to use the performance indicators as a proxy for increasing inter-force competition, but rather to broaden the scope of management tools open to senior officers in the context of improving individual force performance”.
[normal] (Barton and Beynon
[normal],
[normal] 2011, p.363)
[normal]2
[normal]1. 
[normal]Nevertheless, the probability of gaming (such as 
[normal]deliberately under-recording crime) is heightened when league tables are used as a tool to compare peers.
[normal] 
[normal]Hood (2007)
[normal], for example
[normal] warns:
[normal]“Like target systems, they are 
[normal]likely to produce output distortions as producers learn to find ways that move their organizations up the league tables in ways that do not reflect the intentions of those who framed the rankings, or ignore non-measured activities”. (
[normal]2007, 
[normal]p.101)
[normal]22.
[normal] 
[normal]Behav
[normal]ioural changes are an inevitable consequence of league tables. When they are used in a performance environment alongside the expectation of continual crime reduction, the incentives and pressures integral to the league table approach can influence behaviou
[normal]r to the extent that the 
[normal]de facto
[normal] purpose for activity becomes to avoid low league table rankings.
[normal]2
[normal]3
[normal]. 
[normal]De Maillard and Savage (2012) note:
[normal]“…the core rationale for police performance tables is more a reflection of a strategy of ‘naming and shaming’ - an 
[normal]attempt to drive up performance by identifying the best and worst performing police organisations”. (2012, p.367)
[normal]2
[normal]4
[normal]. Whilst the intention of policy makers would be that organisations are spurred on by these poor rankings to improve actual performance, the
[normal] evidence points towards widespread gaming and other dysfunctional behaviour being induced as a direct consequence. (See Bevan and Hood, 2006; Hood, 2007; Rothstein 2008)
[normal] It is suggested that the widespread practice of using league tables in UK police perf
[normal]ormance management is one of
[normal] the contributory factors in
[normal] case
[normal]s
[normal] of police mis-recording of crime.
[normal]Numerical Targets[bold]2
[normal]5
[normal]. 
[normal]The use of numerical targets in police performance management systems is still endemic, and it is my claim that they are the “…single mos
[normal]t pernicious element of conventional management practice…” (Guilfoyle, 2013, p.163) Nevertheless, 
[normal]exponents claim 
[normal]numerical 
[normal]t
[normal]argets 
[normal]can
[normal] enhance managerial responsibility, motivate workers, and foster public accountability. (Capon 
[normal]et al
[normal], 1987; Jennings and Haist, 2004) 
[normal]NPM 
[normal]reformers and 
[normal]proponent
[normal]s 
[normal]of Goal-Setting Theory 
[normal]c
[normal]laim that
[normal] target
[normal]-driven performance management 
[normal]can improve performance,
[normal] 
[normal]as well as 
[normal]enhance transparency, accountability and legitimacy. (
[normal]Locke, 1968; Locke 
[normal]et al
[normal], 1981, 
[normal]1989; Locke and Latham, 
[normal]2002, 2006; 
[normal]Hoque 
[normal]et al
[normal] 2004)
[normal]2
[normal]6
[normal]. 
[normal]A wide range of r
[normal]esearch suggests
[normal] however,
[normal] that 
[normal]target
[normal]s 
[normal]do not
[normal] improve p
[normal]erformance in complex operating
[normal] environments. 
[normal]Moreover,
[normal] some studies indicate
[normal] targets can actually impede performance. (
[normal]Kanfer
[normal] and Ackerman
[normal], 
[normal]1989) Earley 
[normal]et al
[normal] (1989) conclude targets do not improve performance for complex tasks. 
[normal]Similarly
[normal], Horton and Smith (1988) and Mackenzie and Hamilton-Smith (2010) point out complex systems do not respond well to target-
[normal]driven 
[normal]performance ma
[normal]nagement, whilst Loveday (2006)
[normal] argues
[normal]:
[normal]“…public services… are often best described as complex human activity systems; these cannot be managed by crude performance targets”. (2006, p.287) 
[normal]2
[normal]7
[normal]. 
[normal]Numerical targets 
[normal]undermine the effectiveness of police performance management systems 
[normal]because
[normal] they are
[normal] 
[normal]completely 
[normal]arbitrary
[normal]; 
[normal]neither do they
[normal] provide a method nor
[normal] capacity for achieving organisational aims. Moreover, they 
[normal]act as a trigger for 
[normal]behavioural change; indeed,
[normal] the
[normal]ir 
[normal]purpose
[normal] is to change behaviour. Bevan and Hood (2006) observe:
[normal]“Governance by targets rests on the assumption that targets change the behaviour of individuals and organizations…” (2006, p.8)
[normal]28
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]here is a growing body of evidence that indicates many of
[normal] the behavioural changes triggered by target-driven performance management are damaging and dysfunctional.
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]See Deming, 1986, 1994; Smith, 1990, 1995; Pidd, 2005; Bevan and Hood, 2006; Hood, 2006, 2007; Loveday, 2006, 2008; Rothstein, 2008) 
[normal]Notably, 
[normal]Goodha
[normal]rt’
[normal]s eponymous Law (1975) states:
[normal]“Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes”.
[normal] 
[normal](Goodhart, 1975)
[normal]2
[normal]9
[normal]. 
[normal]The inference is that in the case of target-driven performance management, pressure to meet targets 
[normal]leads to
[normal] counterproductive reactions, leading to statistical and behavioural distortions.
[normal] This is precisely what drives police mis-recording of crime; as lo
[normal]ng as targets remain for crime reduction, the risk of this type of behaviour remains high. 
[normal]This is because
[normal]:
[normal]“The difficulty with target setting is that despite the good intentions of the target setters, finding a successful strategy to meet targets becomes
[normal] th
[normal]e focus of the delivery manager…
[normal]” (
[normal]Ghobadian 
[normal]et al
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]2009, p.1530)
[normal] 
[normal]30
[normal]. 
[normal]Furthermore, research suggests
[normal] that implicit incentives (i.e.
[normal] rewards and sanctions) typically present within target-driven performance 
[normal]management
[normal] increase the likelihood of unethical 
[normal]behaviour
[normal]. For instance, Schweitzer 
[normal]et al
[normal] (2004) 
[normal]argue
[normal] 
[normal]specific goals (i.e. 
[normal]numerical targets
[normal])
[normal] are known to drive improper behaviour
[normal],
[normal] s
[normal]uch as falsification of records. Bandura (1999) contends
[normal] p
[normal]erformance goals can caus
[normal]e moral disengagement
[normal],
[normal] leading to unethical 
[normal]conduct
[normal], whilst Barsky (2008) explicitly warns:
[normal] “Goal difficulty and specificity are related to unethical behavior, such that exposure to increasingly difficult and specific goals will negatively impact ethical recognition, thereby increasing the likelihood of unethical behavior”.
[normal] (2008, p
[normal].70
[normal])
[normal]31
[normal]. 
[normal]It i
[normal]s important to 
[normal]recognise
[normal], however, that ‘everyday’ decisions about whether to record an incident as Offence Type ‘A’ or Offence Type ‘B’ can quite legitimately 
[normal]occur within
[normal] an 
[normal]‘
[normal]overlap 
[normal]zone’
[normal], where either offence 
[normal]classification can
[normal] theoretically 
[normal]be correct
[normal]. Therefore, whilst the Committee has heard evidence of serious offences 
[normal]allegedly 
[normal]being downgraded or mis-recorded, I would posit that much ‘under-reporting’ falls into this ‘technical’ cat
[normal]egory, where there might be
[normal] l
[normal]imited direct
[normal] impact on the public. 
[normal]3
[normal]2
[normal]. 
[normal]A
[normal] hypothetical
[normal] example 
[normal]c
[normal]ould be the case of a person who is arrested for disorderly behaviour 
[normal]in a town centre whilst drunk; t
[normal]he non-recordable offence 
[normal]of Drunk and Disorderly may be
[normal] appropriate
[normal] for dealing with the matter
[normal], as might
[normal] a recordable offence under Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986. The point
[normal],
[normal] though, is that where there exists
[normal] an implicit performance pr
[normal]essure to reduce crime, this can
[normal] introduce an incentive to classify the matt
[normal]er as D&amp;D rather than Section 5, as the 
[normal]former does not count towards crime figures.
[normal] This risks distorting the intelligence picture relating to crime patterns, which is a necessary source of information for determining operational responses.
[normal]3
[normal]3
[normal]. 
[normal]Whether
[normal] instances 
[normal]of mis-recording 
[normal]are relatively 
[normal]innocuous, or downright unethical, the 
[normal]primary 
[normal]trigger
[normal] remains
[normal] the same – numerical targets.
[normal] 
[normal]Evidence from within policing (and across the public sector) confirms targets 
[normal]are 
[normal]consistently 
[normal]responsible for generating
[normal] widespread
[normal] unintended 
[normal]consequences, 
[normal]dysfunctional behaviour and collateral damage
[normal].
[normal]Response[bold]s[bold] to the Problem[bold]3
[normal]4
[normal]. Concerns about 
[normal]such adverse consequences h
[normal]ave rightly been raised by the Committee, and it is appropriate that steps are taken to prevent reoccurrences. Traditional 
[normal]approaches to 
[normal]m
[normal]itigating 
[normal]perverse outcomes
[normal] tend to rely on audit and inspection regimes, sanctions, greater scrutiny, new policies, additional levels of authorisation and the restriction of professional judgment at the frontline. 
[normal]Hood (2006) observes that
[normal] 
[normal]government
[normal]al
[normal] response
[normal]s
[normal] to
[normal] identified
[normal] instances of gaming ha
[normal]ve
[normal] been punitive, prescriptive, 
[normal]and indicative of 
[normal]low trust
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]for example, the enactment of
[normal] more rules
[normal] and
[normal] doctrine.
[normal]35
[normal]. 
[normal]These
[normal] responses, however, are unlike
[normal]ly to prevent the types of 
[normal]mis
[normal]-
[normal]reporting of crime
[normal] abo
[normal]ut which
[normal] t
[normal]he Committee has heard evidence
[normal]. This is because the traditional approach of identifying and punishing individuals who have engaged in these behaviours does not address the underlying triggers or latent system conditions that make them likely; ev
[normal]en predictable. 
[normal]3
[normal]6
[normal]. 
[normal]In considering organisational error, 
[normal]Reason (2000) 
[normal]argues t
[normal]hat there are two main approaches to the problem;
[normal] 
[normal]namely, the 
[normal]person approach
[normal] and the 
[normal]systems approach. 
[normal]This notion is as relevant to understanding institutionalised deviant behaviour as it is in the case of 
[normal]simple 
[normal]error. 
[normal]The dominant tradition of apportioning blame to individuals is indicative of the person approach; conversely, the systems approach suggest
[normal]s that the overriding cause
[normal]s
[normal] of organizational failings 
[normal]are rooted firmly in the design of the system 
[normal]and the latent conditions prevailing 
[normal]with
[normal]in it. 
[normal]Particularly, 
[normal]Spitzer (2007) contends that the performance management climate of an organisation is the 
[normal]si
[normal]ngle greatest infl
[normal]uencing factor on culture
[normal] and behaviour
[normal].
[normal]3
[normal]7
[normal]. Therefore, it is important that the response to the examples outlined in evidence provided 
[normal]to the Committee
[normal] 
[normal]addresses
[normal] the fundamental systemic triggers and incentives 
[normal]that 
[normal]inadvertently 
[normal]encourage
[normal] 
[normal]police 
[normal]mis-recording
[normal] of crime. The evidence pertaining to the last thirty years of p
[normal]olice
[normal] performance management suggests that gaming and dysfunctional behaviour is a widespread and inevitable consequence of performance management systems that ar
[normal]e predicated on the 
[normal]‘
[normal]three pillars
[normal]’
[normal] of binary comparisons, league tables and numerical targets.
[normal] It is these ingrained practices that must be challenged, rather than merely the symptoms that manifest themselves in the 
[normal]types of 
[normal]behaviour subject to the I
[normal]nqui
[normal]ry.
[normal]Conclusion and Future Direction[bold]3
[normal]8
[normal]. 
[normal]F
[normal]inally
[normal], whilst the dysfunctional practices outlined can be traced to these three pillars, 
[normal]it is not my contention that performance management or measurement is a bad thing. It is absolutely necessary to measure 
[normal]performance in order to understand how the system is performing. Evidence of good performance fosters legitimacy and leads to organisational improvement through the sharing of good practice. S
[normal]crutiny of data
[normal] is necessary to aid transparency and accountabil
[normal]ity. Additionally, there is a practical dimension to the collation and analysis of crime data, as it enables managers to interpret trends, understand anomalies and instigate an evidence-based response to confirmed patterns. 
[normal]3
[normal]9
[normal]. 
[normal]The issue, however, is 
[normal]how
[normal] 
[normal]this has largely been done in UK policing. The use of binary comparisons, league tables and numerical targets has 
[normal]generated
[normal] a legacy of performance management systems which are dominated by characteristics known to make accurate data 
[normal]interpretatio
[normal]n impossi
[normal]ble
[normal], as well as
[normal] drive dysfunctional and even unethical behaviours that work against the system and damage public confidence.
[normal]40
[normal]. 
[normal]For this reason, I propose the removal of all numerical targets from police performance frameworks; the only way
[normal] to 
[normal]successfully
[normal] 
[normal]mitigate
[normal] police
[normal] mis-recording of crime statistics is to remove the incentive for doing so. 
[normal]It is also necessary to
[normal] rethink 
[normal]the current use of league tables which attempt to neatly separate forces into ordered rankings, as well as the use of bi
[normal]nary comparisons.
[normal] 
[normal]41
[normal]. 
[normal]As an alternative, 
[normal]I 
[normal]endorse the adoption of Systems Thinking principles, and promote
[normal] the 
[normal]wider 
[normal]use of Statistical Process Control 
[normal](SPC) 
[normal]charts as a method for unders
[normal]tanding crime data
[normal]. This
[normal] allows for 
[normal]much more sophisticated
[normal] data in
[normal]terpretation
[normal] and appreciation of systemic influences and interdependencies,
[normal] 
[normal]which
[normal] should frame performance conversations at all levels.
[normal] 
[normal]4
[normal]2
[normal]. 
[normal]The removal of the 
[normal]triggers
[normal] responsible for police mis-recording
[normal] of crime 
[normal]is the 
[normal]only 
[normal]way to effectively 
[normal]address 
[normal]the systemic latent conditions that incentivise the practice.
[normal] 
[normal]Replacing the blunt and counterproductive tools of traditional police performance management with SPC-based methodology has the potential to signal a paradigmatic shift that 
[normal]sh
[normal]ould
[normal] significantly
[normal] 
[normal]limit
[normal] gaming and dysfunctional behaviour, whilst signalling more mature and insightful performance management norms.
