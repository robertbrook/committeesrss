"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence from the Wales Office (DWB 20)&#xa0;\nExplanatory questions to HM Government\n&#xa0;\nResponses from HMG noted under each question.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Could you please provide a Keeling Schedule for the following amendments to the GOWA 2006: Clauses 2, 6 and 17 in the Bill.\n \n&#xa0;\nKeeling Schedule for GOWA 2006 at\n Annex A\n.\n&#xa0;\n2. Could you\n confirm the anticipated yield from each of the devolved taxes for Wales for the financial year 2013-14, and for each of the previous five tax years?  \n&#xa0;\nDetail for 2013-14 is not yet available; the following provides an indication of tax yield for SDLT and Landfill tax from 2007/08 to 2012/13:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSDLT Wales - HMRC national statistics releases \nhttp://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/stamp-duty.htm\nLfT Wales - HMRC experimental disaggregated figures \nhttp://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/receipts.htm\n \n2007-08\n£210m\n£38m\n2008-09\n£115m\n£43m\n2009-10\n£100m\n£40m\n2010-11\n£115m\n£48m\n2011-12\n£125m\n£49m\n2012-13\n£105m\n£50m\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Can \nthe G\novernment confirm that it intends to apply the ‘indexed deduction’ method to adjusting the block grant for the \nintroduction of devolved income\n? \n What information can it supply about the impact of applying that reduction to the Welsh block grant?  \nIf an element of income tax is devolved following a referendum, the Government intends to apply the ‘indexed deduction’ mechanism to adjust the Welsh Government block grant as recommended by the Silk Commission (and which is also being implemented in Scotland).  \nIn the first year of operating this mechanism (as well as in any preceding transitional years) an amount equivalent to the revenues generated by the Welsh rate of income tax (at 10p) will be deducted from the block grant.  If the Welsh Government sets a rate of 10p then its budget will be unchanged during these years (as the deduction will be the same as the revenues generated by the Welsh rate of income tax). Setting a Welsh rate of 11p or 9p will lead to a higher or lower budget respectively (as the deduction will still be based on the 10p forfeited by the UK Government).  \nIn year 2 onwards, the deduction from the previous year will be indexed against growth in the UK non savings non dividend (NSND) \nincome tax base,\n  \ni\n.e. if the UK NSND income tax base grows by, for example, 1% or -5%, then so will the deduction. The Welsh Government budget will therefore benefit from these new arrangements when the NSND income tax base grows more quickly in Wales than the UK average (and conversely the budget will be lower if growth is slower).  \nBy linking the Welsh Government budget to the performance of the Welsh economy, this increases accountability and provides a further incentive to create growth.  But at the same time this mechanism shields the Welsh Government budget from UK-wide effects that the UK Government is better placed to manage (as the Welsh Government budget is only affected by the relative performance of the Welsh and UK NSND income tax base).\n4. \nWhat approaches will be used to calculate \nreductions\n from the block grant for stamp duty land tax and landfill tax?  \nThe UK and Scottish Governments are currently discussing the most appropriate block grant adjustment mechanism in relation to stamp duty land tax and landfill tax.  The Scotland Bill Command Paper indicated that this would be a one-off adjustment but the precise nature of that adjustment is still to be agreed.  \nThe UK Government has now opened similar discussions with the Welsh Government, with the intention that the same mechanism can be agreed for both Wales and Scotland.\n&#xa0;\nThe\n definition of a Scottish taxpayer inserted by the\n Scotland Act 2012 \nsets out that,\n \ni\nf an individual has a main place of residence for the same amount of time, or spends the same number of days, in Scotland as in another part of the \nUK;\n they will be a Scottish taxpayer. \n&#xa0;\nThis means that the definition of a Welsh taxpayer cannot be identically drafted to the parallel provision in Scotland, as this would mean a taxpayer could be both a Welsh and Scottish taxpayer in the same year\n if\n,\n for example, their main place of residence was in each country for an equal amount of time.\n  \n&#xa0;\nOptions to resolve thi\ns issue are currently being considered\n and will be included in the final Bill.\n \n&#xa0;\n6\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Could you clarify paragraph 66 in the explanatory notes on reliefs. It seems there are discussions yet to be had between the Government and stakeholders on the devolution of reliefs. How will this process work? What powers will the Welsh Government have over reliefs under the proposals?\n \n&#xa0;\nHMRC consulted representatives from private sector \nrepresentative\n group\ns\n \non\n the impact of the Scottish rate of income tax on aspects of the UK income tax system including income tax reliefs.  The consultation \ncontributed to \nthe approach to the treatment of reliefs for Scottish taxpayers in \nHMRC’s Technical Note, published \nin \nMay 2012\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nBefore making any orders under this section, to amend \nthe application of the Welsh rate of \nincome tax\n to tax reliefs\n,\n \nthe \nUK Government would consult relevant stakeholders. \nOur starting point would be the results of the previous consultation, so we would expect that \nthe approach taken in these areas, including the treatment of tax relief for charitable donations and pension contributions would follow the proposals in the\n \nTechnical Note\n, \nsubject to\n any changes in the tax system or \nin the capability of IT systems in the interim.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe devolution of income tax reliefs is not within scope of this Bill. \nThe Welsh Government’s power relates only to the rate of income tax – we would expect the Welsh Government to be involved in \nconsultation\n in relation to reliefs, but the final decision would rest with the UK Government because of the potential for wider impacts on the income tax system as a whole.\n&#xa0;\n7\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n The draft Bill does not contain provision for devolving business rates to Wales.  Indeed, the term ‘business rates’ does not feature in the draft Bill. However, in the explanatory notes attached to the draft Bill it says “The draft Bill also implements the [Silk] Commission’s recommendation to fully devolve business rates in Wales. The Welsh Government budget would then be directly affected by revenues from business rates in Wales, reflecting the performance of the Welsh economy, rather than being determined by spending funded by business rates in England through the Barnett formula.” (p68). \n Do the proposed changes to business rates require statutory change, and if so where is this to be found \nthe draft Bill? Which clauses do this? Could you please give a detailed explanation. \nThe summary impact assessment refers in error to the inclusion of business rates in the draft Bill. We apologise unreservedly for this error. \nLegislative competence over business rates is already devolved to the National Assembly for Wales by virtue of the “local government finance” subject in heading 12 (local government) of Schedule 7 to the GoWA 2006. No further devolution of legislative competence is needed to effect the Government’s commitment to “work with the Welsh Government to fully devolve non-domestic (business) rates”\n, and so no provision is made in the draft Bill in relation to business rates.\nChanges are needed to the way in which business rates affect the Welsh Government’s budget in order to implement full devolution. At present, changes to the Welsh Government’s budget in relation to business rates are  determined through the Barnett formula, following changes in spending funded by business rates in England, and so revenues generated by Welsh business rates have no direct effect on the Welsh Government’s budget. \nDiscussions are underway between HM Treasury and the Welsh Government so that changes in business rates revenues in Wales directly affect the funds available to the Welsh Government (as is already the case in Scotland and Northern Ireland). This will link growth in the Welsh Government’s budget more closely to the performance of the Welsh economy. \nThe aim of both Governments is to implement these changes as soon as possible.\n8\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Could you clarify whether clause 11 means that the Secretary of State has the power to prevent a referendum on income tax devolution even if there has been a vote in favour in both the National Assembly for Wales and the Houses of Parliament?\nUnder clause 11 of the draft Bill, the Secretary of State may refuse to lay a draft order following a “trigger” vote passed by two thirds of the Assembly, and must give notice and reasons for that refusal to the First Minister within 180 days of receiving notification from the Assembly. This process is based on the same procedure which led to the referendum in March 2011 which led to full law-making powers for the National Assembly for Wales. Once the Order has been approved by both Houses of Parliament and the Assembly, in practice the Secretary of State has no power to prevent the Order being made by Her Majesty.\n9\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n The Welsh Government’s borrowing capacity will be increased if there is a ‘yes’ vote in a referendum on income tax devolution. In that event, what mechanism is there to decide how much the borrowing capacity should be increased by?\n \n&#xa0;\nThe Government has set out a principle linking capital borrowing powers to the level of Devolved Administrations’ independent revenue.  This would suggest that the Welsh Government’s capital borrowing limit would be increased if an element of income tax were to be devolved.  The precise increase would be a matter for a future government, but the limit could be increased to slightly more than £1bn using the borrowing/revenue ratios applied in Scotland.  The draft Wales Bill includes the power for the capital borrowing limit to be amended but not to a level below the initial £500m.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n22\n January 2013\n&#xa0;\nAnnex A&#xa0;KEELING SCHEDULEThis schedule shows how the Government of Wales Act 2006 would look if it were amended by provisions in the Draft Wales Bill as published on 18 December 2013. \nInserted text is highlighted\n and bolded.  O\nmitted text is struck through.\nThis schedule has been prepared by the Wales Office.  It is intended for illustrative purposes only; to assist the reader of the Bill to understand the changes made by the Bill.  Whilst care has been taken in its preparation it may not be full and complete in every respect.\n&#xa0;\nThe global re-naming change made by clause 4(2) (omitting the word “Assembly” from “Welsh Assembly Government”\n throughout the Government of Wales Act 2006\n) is not included in this schedule as it is self-evident. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGOVERNMENT OF WALES ACT 2006&#xa0;PART 1&#xa0;NATIONAL ASSEMBLY FOR WALES&#xa0;3 Ordinary general elections&#xa0;(1) The poll at an ordinary general election is to be held on the first Thursday in May in the \nfourth\n \nfifth calendar year following that in which the previous ordinary general election was held, unless provision is made for the day of the poll by an order under section 4.\n&#xa0;\n(2) If the poll is to be held on the first Thursday in May, the Assembly–\n(a) is dissolved by virtue of this section at the beginning of the minimum period which ends with that day, and\n(b) must meet within the period of seven days beginning immediately after the day of the poll.\n&#xa0;\n(3) In subsection (2) “the minimum period” means the period determined in accordance with an order under section 13.\n&#xa0;\n(4) In calculating any period of days for the purposes of subsection (2)(b), the following days are to be disregarded–\n(a) Saturday and Sunday,\n(b) any day which is a bank holiday in \nWales\n under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 (c. 80), and\n(c) any day appointed for public thanksgiving or mourning.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7 Candidates at general elections&#xa0;(1) At a general election a person may not be a candidate to be the Assembly constituency member for more than one Assembly constituency.\n&#xa0;\n(2) Any registered political party may submit a list of candidates for return as Assembly regional members for a particular Assembly electoral region at a general election.\n&#xa0;\n(3) The list must be submitted to the regional returning officer.\n&#xa0;\n(4) The list must not include more than twelve persons (but may include only one).\n&#xa0;\n(5) The list must not include a person–\n(a) who is included on any other list submitted for the Assembly electoral region or any list submitted for another Assembly electoral region,\n(b) who is an individual candidate to be an Assembly regional member for the Assembly electoral region or another Assembly electoral region, \nor\n(c) who is a candidate to be the Assembly constituency member for an Assembly constituency.\n(c) who is a candidate to be the Assembly constituency member for an Assembly constituency which is not included in the Assembly electoral region, or(d) who is a candidate to be the Assembly constituency member for an Assembly constituency included in the Assembly electoral region but is not a candidate of the party.&#xa0;\n(6) A person may not be an individual candidate to be an Assembly regional member for the Assembly electoral region if that person is–\n(a) included on a list submitted by a registered political party for the Assembly electoral region or another Assembly electoral region,\n(b) an individual candidate to be an Assembly regional member for another Assembly\n \nelectoral region, \nor \n(c) a candidate to be the Assembly constituency member for an Assembly constituency\n(c) a candidate to be the Assembly constituency member for an Assembly constituency which is not included in the Assembly electoral region, or (d) a candidate of any registered political party to be the Assembly constituency member for an Assembly constituency included in the Assembly electoral region.&#xa0;\n(7) In this Act “regional returning officer”, in relation to an Assembly electoral region, means the person designated as the regional returning officer for the Assembly electoral region in accordance with an order under section 13.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9 Allocation of seats to electoral region members&#xa0;(1) The first seat for the Assembly electoral region is to be allocated to the party or individual candidate with the highest electoral region figure.\n&#xa0;\n(2) The second and subsequent seats for the Assembly electoral region are to be allocated to the party or individual candidate with the highest electoral region figure after any recalculation required by subsection (3) has been carried out.\n&#xa0;\n(3) This subsection requires a recalculation under paragraph (b) of section 8(3) in relation to a party–\n(a) for the first application of subsection (2), if the application of subsection (1) resulted in the allocation of an Assembly seat to the party, or\n(b) for any subsequent application of subsection (2), if the previous application of that subsection did so, and a recalculation is to be carried out after adding one to the aggregate mentioned in that paragraph.\n&#xa0;\n(4) An individual candidate already returned as an \nAssembly constituency member or Assembly regional member is to be disregarded.\n&#xa0;\n(5) Seats for the Assembly electoral region which are allocated to a party are to be filled by the persons on the party's list in the order in which they appear on the list \n(disregarding anyone already returned as an Assembly constituency member, including anyone whose return is void).&#xa0;\n(6) Once a party's list has been exhausted \nby the return of persons included on it as Assembly regional members by the previous application of subsection (1) or (2)\n \n(by the return of persons included on it as Assembly constituency members or by the previous application of subsection (1) or (2)), the party is to be disregarded.\n&#xa0;\n(7) If (on the application of subsection (1) or any application of subsection (2)) the highest electoral region figure is the electoral region figure of two or more parties or individual candidates, the subsection applies to each of them.\n&#xa0;\n(8) However, if subsection (7) would mean that more than the full number of seats for the Assembly electoral region were allocated, subsection (1) or (2) does not apply until–\n(a) a recalculation has been carried out under section 8(3)(b) after adding one to the number of votes given for each party with that electoral region figure, and\n(b) one has been added to the number of votes given for each individual candidate with that electoral region figure.\n&#xa0;\n(9) If, after that, the highest electoral region figure is still the electoral region figure of two or more parties or individual candidates, the regional returning officer must decide between them by lots.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n11 Electoral region vacancies&#xa0;(1) This section applies if the seat of an Assembly regional member returned for an Assembly electoral region is vacant.\n&#xa0;\n(2) If the Assembly regional member was returned (under section 9 or this section) from the list of a registered political party, the regional returning officer must notify to the Presiding Officer the name of the person who is to fill the vacancy.\n&#xa0;\n(3) A person's name may only be so notified if the person–\n(a) is included on the list submitted by the registered political party for the last general\n \nelection,\n(b) is willing to serve as an Assembly regional member for the Assembly electoral region, and\n(c) is not a person to whom subsection (4) applies.\n&#xa0;\n(4) This subsection applies to a person if–\n(a) the person is not a member of the registered political party, and\n(b) the registered political party gives notice to the regional returning officer that the person's name is not to be notified to the Presiding Officer as the name of the person who is to fill the vacancy.\n&#xa0;\n(5) But if there is more than one person who satisfies the conditions in subsection (3), the regional returning officer may only notify the name of whichever of them was the higher, or the highest, on that list.\n&#xa0;\n(6) A person whose name is notified under subsection (2) is to be treated as having been declared to be returned as an Assembly regional member for the Assembly electoral region on the day on which notification of the person's name is received by the Presiding Officer.\n&#xa0;\n(7) The seat remains vacant until the next general election–\n(a) if the Assembly regional member was returned as an individual candidate, or\n(b) if that Assembly regional member was returned from the list of a registered political party but there is no-one who satisfies the conditions in subsection (3).\n&#xa0;\n(8) For the purposes of this section, a person included on the list submitted by a registered political party for the last general election who–\n(a) was returned as an Assembly regional member under section 9 at that election (even if the return was void),\n(b) has subsequently been a candidate in an election held under section 10 (whether or not returned), or\n(c) has subsequently been returned under this section (even if the return was void),\n(a) was returned as an Assembly member at that election (even if the return was void), or (b) has subsequently been returned under section 10 or this section (even if the return was void),is treated on and after the return of the person\n, or of the successful candidate at the election,\n as not having been included on the list.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n16 Disqualification from being Assembly member&#xa0;\n(1) A person is disqualified from being an Assembly member if that person–\n&#xa0;\n(za) is a member of the House of Commons (but see sections 17A and 17B),(a) is disqualified from being a member of the House of Commons under paragraphs (a) to (e) of section 1(1) of the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 (c. 24) (judges, civil servants, members of the armed forces, members of police forces and members of foreign legislatures),\n(b) holds any of the offices for the time being designated by Order in Council as offices disqualifying persons from being Assembly members,\n(c) holds the office of Auditor General,\n(d) holds the office of Public Services Ombudsman for \nWales\n, or\n(e) is employed as a member of the staff of the Assembly.\n&#xa0;\n(2) Subject to section 17(1) and (2), a person is also disqualified from being an Assembly member if that person is disqualified otherwise than under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 (c. 24) (either generally or in relation to a particular constituency) from being a member of the House of Commons or from sitting and voting in it.\n&#xa0;\n(3) For the purposes of subsection (2) the references to the Republic of Ireland in section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1981 (c. 34) (disqualification of offenders detained in, or unlawfully at large from detention in, the British Islands or the Republic of Ireland) are to be treated as references to any member State (other than the United Kingdom).\n&#xa0;\n(4) A person who holds office as lord-lieutenant, lieutenant or high sheriff of any area in Wales is disqualified from being an Assembly member for any Assembly constituency or Assembly electoral region wholly or partly included in that area.\n&#xa0;\n(5) An Order in Council under paragraph (b) of subsection (1)–\n(a) may designate particular offices or offices of any description, and\n(b) may designate an office by reference to any characteristic of a person holding it,\nand in that paragraph and this subsection “office” includes any post or employment.\n&#xa0;\n(6) No recommendation is to be made to Her Majesty in Council to make an Order in Council under subsection (1)(b) unless a draft of the statutory instrument containing the Order in Council has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, the Assembly.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n17A Exception from disqualification by virtue of being an MP: recently elected members&#xa0;(1) A person returned at an election as an Assembly member is not disqualified under section 16(1)(za) (disqualification by virtue of being an MP) at any time in the period of 8 days beginning with the day the person is so returned.&#xa0;(2) Subsection (3) applies where a person–(a) is returned at an election as an Assembly member,(b) on being so returned is a candidate for election to the House of Commons, and(c) is subsequently returned at that election as a member of that House.&#xa0;(3) The person is not disqualified under section 16(1)(za) at any time in the period of 8 days beginning with the day the person is returned as a member of the House of Commons.&#xa0;(4) A person is a “candidate for election to the House of Commons” if the person’s nomination paper for election as a member of the House of Commons has been delivered to the returning officer under rule 6 of Schedule 1 to the Representation of the People Act 1983 (parliamentary election rules).&#xa0;&#xa0;17B Exception from disqualification by virtue of being an MP: general election within 6 months&#xa0;(1) This section applies if–(a) an Assembly member is returned as a member of the House of Commons, and(b) the expected day of the next general election is within the period of 6 months beginning with the day the person is so returned (“the return day”).&#xa0;(2) The member is not disqualified under section 16(1)(za) (disqualification by virtue of being an MP) at any time in the period–(a) beginning with the return day, and(b) ending immediately before the day of the next general election.&#xa0;(3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b) the expected day of the next general election is to be determined by reference to the circumstances as at the beginning of the return day (“the relevant time”).&#xa0;(4) Where, at the relevant time, section 5(2) or (3) (extraordinary general elections) applies–(a) if an Order in Council under section 5(4) has been made, the expected day is the day on which the poll is required to be held in accordance with that Order;(b) if no Order in Council under section 5(4) has been made but a day has been proposed under section 5(1), that is the expected day;(c) otherwise, treat the expected day as being within the period mentioned in subsection (1)(b).&#xa0;(5) For the purpose of determining the expected day, no account is to be taken of the possibility of–(a) an order under section 4 (power to vary date of ordinary general election) being made after the relevant time, or(b) section 5(2) or (3) (extraordinary general elections) first applying after that time.&#xa0;(6) References in this section to the “day” of the election are to the day on which the poll at the election is held.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPART 2&#xa0;WELSH ASSEMBLY GOVERNMENT&#xa0;\n45 Welsh Assembly Government&#xa0;(1)There is to be a Welsh \nAssembly\n \nGovernment, or Llywodraeth \nCynulliad\n \nCymru, whose members are— \n(a)\n \nthe First Minister or Prif Weinidog (see sections 46 and 47), \n(b)\n \nthe Welsh Ministers, or Gweinidogion Cymru, appointed under section 48, \n(c)\n \nthe Counsel General to the Welsh \nAssembly\n \nGovernment or Cwnsler Cyffredinol i Lywodraeth \nCynulliad\n \nCymru (see section 49) (referred to in this Act as “the Counsel General”), and \n(d)\n \nthe Deputy Welsh Ministers or Dirprwy Weinidogion Cymru (see section 50). \n&#xa0;\n(2) In this Act and in any other enactment or instrument the First Minister and the Welsh Ministers appointed under section 48 are referred to collectively as the Welsh Ministers.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;46 The First Minister&#xa0;\n(1) The First Minister is to be appointed by Her Majesty after nomination in accordance with section 47.\n&#xa0;\n(2) The First Minister holds office at Her Majesty's pleasure.\n&#xa0;\n(3) The First Minister may at any time tender resignation to Her Majesty and ceases to hold office as First Minister when it is accepted.\n&#xa0;\n(4) A person ceases to hold office as the First Minister if another person is appointed to that office.\n&#xa0;\n(5) The functions of the First Minister are exercisable by a person designated by the Presiding Officer if–\n(a) the office of the First Minister is vacant,\n(b) the First Minister is for any reason unable to act, or\n(c) the First Minister has ceased to be an Assembly member \notherwise than by reason of a dissolution.&#xa0;\n(6) A person may not be designated to exercise the functions of the First Minister unless the person is–\n(a) an Assembly member, or\n(b) if the Assembly has been dissolved, a person who ceased to be an Assembly member by reason of the dissolution.\n&#xa0;\n(7) A person may be designated to exercise the functions of the First Minister only on the recommendation of the Welsh Ministers (unless there is no-one holding office as a Welsh Minister appointed under section 48).\n&#xa0;\n(8) If a person is designated to exercise the functions of the First Minister, the designation continues to have effect even if the Assembly is dissolved.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPART 4&#xa0;ACTS OF THE ASSEMBLY&#xa0;\n108 Legislative competence&#xa0;\n(1) Subject to the provisions of this Part, an Act of the Assembly may make any provision that could be made by an Act of Parliament.\n&#xa0;\n(2) An Act of the Assembly is not law so far as any provision of the Act is outside the Assembly's legislative competence.\n&#xa0;\n(3) A provision of an Act of the Assembly is within the Assembly's legislative competence only if it falls within subsection (4) or (5).\n&#xa0;\n(4) A provision of an Act of the Assembly falls within this subsection if–\n(a) it relates to one or more of the subjects listed under any of the headings in Part 1 of Schedule 7 and\n, subject to subsection (4A), does not fall within any of the exceptions specified in that Part of that Schedule (whether or not under that heading or any of those headings), and\n(b) it neither applies otherwise than in relation to \nWales\n nor confers, imposes, modifies or removes (or gives power to confer, impose, modify or remove) functions exercisable otherwise than in relation to \nWales\n.\n&#xa0;\n(4A) Provision relating to a devolved tax (which is listed under the heading “Taxation” in Part 1 of Schedule 7) is not outside the Assembly’s legislative competence by reason only of the fact that it falls within an exception specified under another heading in that Part of that Schedule.&#xa0;\n(5) A provision of an Act of the Assembly falls within this subsection if–\n(a) it provides for the enforcement of a provision (of that or any other Act of the Assembly) which falls within subsection (4) or a provision of an Assembly Measure or it is otherwise appropriate for making such a provision effective, or \n(b) it is otherwise incidental to, or consequential on, such a provision.\n&#xa0;\n(6) But a provision which falls within subsection (4) or (5) is outside the Assembly's legislative competence if–\n(a) it breaches any of the restrictions in Part 2 of Schedule 7, having regard to any exception in Part 3 of that Schedule from those restrictions,\n(b) it extends otherwise than only to \nEngland\n and \nWales\n, or \n(c) it is incompatible with the Convention rights or with EU law.\n&#xa0;\n(7) For the purposes of this section the question whether a provision of an Act of the Assembly relates to one or more of the subjects listed in Part 1 of Schedule 7 (or falls within any of the exceptions specified in that Part of that Schedule) is to be determined by reference to the purpose of the provision, having regard (among other things) to its effect in all the circumstances.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n111 Proceedings on Bills&#xa0;(1) The standing orders must include provision–\n(a) for general debate on a Bill with an opportunity for Assembly members to vote on its general principles,\n(b) for the consideration of, and an opportunity for Assembly members to vote on, the\ndetails of a Bill, and (c) for a final stage at which a Bill can be passed or rejected.\n&#xa0;\n(2) Subsection (1) does not prevent the standing orders making provision to enable the Assembly to expedite proceedings in relation to a particular Bill.\n&#xa0;\n(3) The standing orders may make provision different from that required by subsection (1) for the procedure applicable to Bills of any of the following kinds–\n(a) Bills which restate the law,\n(b) Bills which repeal or revoke spent enactments, and\n(c) private Bills.\n&#xa0;\n(4) The standing orders must include provision for securing that the Assembly may only pass a Bill containing provisions which would, if contained in a Bill for an Act of Parliament, require the consent of Her Majesty or the Duke of Cornwall if such consent has been signified in accordance with the standing orders.\n&#xa0;\n(5) The standing orders must include provision for securing that the Assembly may only pass a Bill if the text of the Bill is in both English and Welsh, unless the circumstances are such as are specified by the standing orders as any in which the text need not be in both languages.\n&#xa0;\n(6) The standing orders must provide for an opportunity for the reconsideration of a Bill after its passing if (and only if)–\n(a) the Supreme Court decides on a reference made in relation to the Bill under section 112 that the Bill or any provision of it would not be within the Assembly's legislative competence,\n(b) a reference made in relation to the Bill

power to set a rate of income tax to be paid by Welsh taxpayers, and(b) Chapters 3 and 4 specify the taxes about which the Assembly may make provision in the exercise of the power conferred by section 107(1).&#xa0;(2) The power to make provision about a devolved tax is subject to the restrictions imposed by–(a) subsection (3), and(b) the other provisions of this Part.&#xa0;(3) A devolved tax may not be imposed where to do so would be incompatible with any international obligations.&#xa0;(4) In this Act “devolved tax” means a tax specified in this Part as a devolved tax.&#xa0;&#xa0;116B Power to add new devolved taxes&#xa0;(1) Her Majesty may by Order in Council amend this Part so as to–(a) specify, as an additional devolved tax, a tax of any description, or(b) make any other modifications of the provisions relating to devolved taxes which She considers appropriate.&#xa0;(2) An Order in Council under this section may make such modifications of–(a) any enactment (including any enactment comprised in or made under this Act) or prerogative instrument, or(b) any other instrument or document, as Her Majesty considers appropriate in connection with the provision made by the Order.&#xa0;(3) No recommendation is to be made to Her Majesty in Council to make an Order in Council under this section unless a draft of the statutory instrument containing the Order has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament and the Assembly.&#xa0;(4) The amendment of this Part by an Order in Council under this section does not affect–(a) the validity of an Act of the Assembly passed before the amendment comes into force, or(b) the previous or continuing operation of such an Act of the Assembly.&#xa0;&#xa0;CHAPTER 2&#xa0;INCOME TAX&#xa0;\n116C Power to set Welsh rate for Welsh taxpayers&#xa0;(1) The Assembly may by resolution (a “Welsh rate resolution”) set the Welsh rate for the purpose of calculating the rates of income tax to be paid by Welsh taxpayers.&#xa0;(2) Section 6(2B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for the calculation of those rates.&#xa0;(3) A Welsh rate resolution applies–(a) for only one tax year, and(b) for the whole of that year.&#xa0;(4) A Welsh rate resolution may specify only one rate.&#xa0;(5) The Welsh rate must be a whole number or half a whole number.&#xa0;(6) A Welsh rate resolution–(a) must specify the tax year for which it applies,(b) must be made before the start of that tax year, and(c) must not be made more than 12 months before the start of that year.&#xa0;(7) If a Welsh rate resolution is cancelled before the start of the tax year for which it is to apply–(a) the Income Tax Acts have effect for that year as if the resolution had never been passed, and(b) the resolution may be replaced by another Welsh rate resolution.&#xa0;(8) The standing orders must provide that only the First Minister or a Welsh Minister appointed under section 48 may move a motion for a Welsh rate resolution.&#xa0;&#xa0;116D Welsh taxpayers&#xa0;(1) In any tax year, a Welsh taxpayer is an individual (T) who, for that year–(a) is resident in the UK for income tax purposes (see Schedule 45 to the Finance Act 2013), and(b) meets condition A, B or C.&#xa0;(2) T meets condition A if T has a close connection with Wales (see section 116E).&#xa0;(3) T meets condition B if–(a) T does not have a close connection with England, Scotland or Northern Ireland (see section 116E), and(b) T spends more days of that year in Wales than in any other part of the UK (see section 116F).&#xa0;(4) T meets condition C if, for the whole or any part of the year, T is–(a) a member of Parliament for a constituency in Wales,(b) a member of the European Parliament for Wales, or(c) an Assembly member.&#xa0;(5) In this Chapter “the UK” means the United Kingdom.&#xa0;&#xa0;116E Close connection with Wales or another part of the UK&#xa0;(1) To find whether, for any year, T has a close connection with any part of the UK see–(a) subsection (2) (where T has only one place of residence in the UK), or(b) subsection (3) (where T has 2 or more places of residence in the UK).&#xa0;(2) T has a close connection with a part of the UK if in that year–(a) T has only one place of residence in the UK,(b) that place of residence is in that part of the UK, and(c) for at least part of the year, T lives at that place.&#xa0;(3) T has a close connection with a part of the UK if in that year–(a) T has 2 or more places of residence in the UK,(b) for at least part of the year, T’s main place of residence in the UK is in that part of the UK,(c) the times in the year when T’s main place of residence is in that part of the UK comprise (in aggregate) at least as much of the year as the times when T’s main place of residence is in any one other part of the UK, and(d) for at least part of the year, T lives at a place of residence in that part of the UK.&#xa0;\n(4) In this section “place” includes a place on board a vessel or other means of transport.&#xa0;&#xa0;116F Days spent in Wales or another part of the UK&#xa0;(1) T spends more days of a year in Wales than in any other part of the UK if (and only if) –(a) the number of days in the year on which T is in Wales at the end of the day equals or exceeds(b) the number of days in the year on which T is in any other part of the UK at the end of the day.&#xa0;(2) But T is not to be treated as being in the UK at the end of a day if–(a) on that day T arrives in the UK as a passenger,(b) T departs from the UK on the next day, and(c) during the time between arrival and departure T does not engage in activities which are to a substantial extent unrelated to T’s passage through the UK.&#xa0;&#xa0;116G Supplemental powers to modify enactments&#xa0;(1) The Treasury may by order provide that subsections (2A), (2B) and (2D) of section 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are to be disapplied, or that their effect is to be modified, in relation to any enactment.&#xa0;(2) The Treasury may by order make such modifications of any enactment as they consider necessary or expedient in consequence of or in connection with–(a) the power of the Assembly to set a rate under section 116C;(b) the making of a Welsh rate resolution;(c) an order under subsection (1).&#xa0;(3) An order under subsection (2) may, in particular, provide that a Welsh rate resolution does not require any change in the amounts repayable or deductible under PAYE regulations between–(a) the beginning of the tax year for which the resolution has effect, and(b) such date (falling after the date of the resolution) as may be specified in the order.&#xa0;(4) An order under this section may, to the extent that the Treasury consider it to be appropriate, take effect retrospectively from the beginning of the tax year in which the order is made.&#xa0;(5) No order is to be made under this section unless a draft of the statutory instrument containing it has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, the House of Commons.&#xa0;(6) Subsection (5) does not apply to an order under subsection (2) which makes only such provision as is mentioned in subsection (3); a statutory instrument containing such an order is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the House of Commons.&#xa0;116H Reimbursement of expenses&#xa0;The Welsh Ministers may reimburse any Minister of the Crown or government department for administrative expenses incurred by virtue of this Chapter at any time after the passing of the Wales Act 2014 by the Minister or department.&#xa0;&#xa0;116I Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General&#xa0;(1) The Comptroller and Auditor General must for each financial year prepare a report on the matters set out in subsection (2).&#xa0;(2) Those matters are–(a) the adequacy of any of HMRC’s rules and procedures put in place, in consequence of the Welsh rate provisions, for the purpose of ensuring the proper assessment and collection of income tax charged at rates determined under those provisions,(b) whether the rules and procedures described in paragraph (a) are being complied with,(c) the correctness of the sums brought to account by HMRC which relate to income tax which is attributable to a Welsh rate resolution, and(d) the accuracy and fairness of the amounts which are reimbursed to HMRC under section 116H (having been identified by it as administrative expenses incurred as a result of the charging of income tax as mentioned in paragraph (a)).&#xa0;(3) The “Welsh rate provisions” are–(a) this Chapter, and(b) the amendments made by section 9 of the Wales Act 2014.&#xa0;(4) A report under this section may also include an assessment of the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which HMRC has used its resources in carrying out relevant functions.&#xa0;\n(5) “Relevant functions” are functions of HMRC in the performance of which HMRC incurs administrative expenses which are reimbursed to HMRC under section 116H (having been identified by it as administrative expenses incurred as a result of the charging of income tax as mentioned in subsection (2)(a)).&#xa0;(6) HMRC must give the Comptroller and Auditor General such information as the Comptroller and Auditor General may reasonably require for the purposes of preparing a report under this section.&#xa0;(7) A report prepared under this section must be laid before the Assembly not later than 31 January of the financial year following that to which the report relates.&#xa0;(8) In this section “HMRC” means Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.&#xa0;&#xa0;CHAPTER 3&#xa0;TAX ON TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING INTERESTS IN LAND&#xa0;116J Tax on transactions involving interests in land&#xa0;(1) A tax charged on any of the following transactions is a devolved tax–(a) the acquisition of an estate, interest, right or power in or over land in Wales;(b) the acquisition of the benefit of an obligation, restriction or condition affecting the value of any such estate, interest, right or power.&#xa0;(2) The tax may be chargeable–(a) whether or not there is any instrument effecting the transaction,(b) if there is such an instrument, regardless of where it is executed, and(c) regardless of where any party to the transaction is or is resident.&#xa0;116K Certain transactions not taxable&#xa0;(1) Tax may not be imposed
