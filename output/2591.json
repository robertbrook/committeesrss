"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Information Commissioner’s Office [OLS0052]&#xa0;\nThank you for giving the Information Commissioner’s Office \n(ICO) \nthe opportunity to submit evidence \nto your inquiry. Your inquiry is timely, given that the abuse of \nchildren via the \nonline services \nthey use \nis \nbecoming a matter of increasing concern. \nWe should explain that as the regulator for the Data Protection Act 1998 (the \nDPA\n), our statutory interest in this matter lies in the processing of personal data. This takes place where, for example, a company hosts information that identifies someone on i\nts website or where one individual posts information about another on a social networking site. However, as we explain later, our ability to police postings done by private individuals is \nreally \nvery limited.  \nIn our submission we have decided to focus on\n a limited number of key areas, rather than to explore all the data protection issues that can arise in the context of \nchildren’s \nonline safety. These are:\n&#xa0;\n1. The DPA’s domestic purposes exemption.Section 36 of the DPA says that personal data processed by an individual only for the purposes of that individual’s personal, family or hous\nehold affairs (including recreational purposes) are exempt from the data protection principles and other parts of the Act. \nThis means, for example, where one child posts information that is inaccurate (and quite possibly hurtful and malicious) about anothe\nr as part of a personal online spat, there is nothing \naction the \nICO can\n take against the child that posted the information – i.e. we cannot use our normal powers\n to order the correction of the inaccurate data. \nHowever, the \norganisation that hosts the information cannot itself benefit from the DPA’s domestic purposes exemption – we discuss the implications of this later. \nThe ICO is not calling for a change to the law here. We recognise the importance of the current exemption\n in terms of individuals’ freedom of expression and their need to process personal data for their own reasons without the threat of regulatory intervention.  We also recognise the \n- \nperhaps insurmountable\n -\n logistical challenge of the ICO being expected to\n police \nthe enormous amount of personal data that private citizens post about each other through social-networking and other means. We doubt if any organisation could take on this task effectively.\n We also recognise that organisations running services such\n as social networking sites \ncannot be expected to check all the information that individuals post about themselves or each other. \nIt seems to the ICO \nthat the best way to protect individuals who are the victims of abusive postings is for the online servic\ne industries – particularly social networking sites and search engines – to be encouraged to develop more effective ways of allowing individuals to have content about them ‘taken down’ or rendered unsearchable. \nW\ne recognise the practical problems here in t\nhat we do not think it is realistic to expect service providers to vet \nall the \ncontent they \nhost\n,\n and recent relevant case-law would generally seem to support this approach. \n(See for example the recent Court of Justice of the European Union: \nAdvocate Gener\nal’s Opinion in Case C-131/12\n, \nGoogle Spain SL, Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, Mario Costeja González\n. Note the final judgement here has not yet been handed down.) \nHowever, we do think ‘the industry’ should do \nmore \nto be responsive \nto the wishes of \nprivate \nindividuals to have content about them moderated where it is clearly\n causing them distress. (This is quite different to public figures being able to hide negative stor\ni\nes about themselves.)\n \n \nHowever, we are aware of the legal \nuncertainty and technological difficulty here.  We know from our own experience of dealing with determined, well-resourced individuals with access to a great deal of legal and technological resource that, once posted, it may be impossible to remove informa\ntion from the internet effectively.\n \nContent taken down from one site often ends up being posted on another. \nHowever, we believe that it is often possible to limit the damage caused by information posted online, if not to eliminate it completely. \n \nWe urge t\nhe industry to do more to develop more effective means of facilitating redress for aggrieved individuals. \nWe hope that as the information age develops\n,\n the legal landscape will become much clearer in terms of the responsibility of online service providers\n \nfor information \nthat they host\n,\n but which private individuals post. We also hope that the technologies that are so impressive in terms of making content searchable and accessible can be used to protect individuals in respect of content that should never h\nave appeared online in the first place. ICO will continue to engage with ‘the industry’ to further these objectives. \nICO has recently published guidance on social networking and online forums – it is available here: \nhttp://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/guidance_index/~/media/documents/library/Data_Protection/Detaile\nd_specialist_guides/social-networking-and-online-forums-dpa-guidance.ashx\n2. Privacy notices and explaining personal data issues to children and others‘Privacy notice’ has become the prevalent term in the UK and elsewhere for the information \nthat \norganisations are required by law to make available to people to tell them, in short, what will happen to any information they provide to an organisation. This is clearly an important component of online safety for children and other\ns\n because a properly dr\nafted, accessible privacy notice should allow individuals to make properly-informed information-choices.  A privacy notice \nmight allow a child to decide not \nto\n provide his or her personal information to a particular website because of the way it intends to\n use the information. \n \nP\nrivacy notices can only take us \nso\n far \nthough,\n \nand we suspect that privacy notices largely go unread by adults, let alon\ne\n children. However, for older, more mentally competent children they do have a part to play – provided they ar\ne truthful, accessible\n, explain the implications of using a service in a particular way\n and \nare \nwritten in language that \nthe\n service’s intended users – or their parents or guardians \n- \ncan understand.\nPrivacy notices can be particularly useful when combined\n with relevant privacy-choices. This might be the case where a user cannot navigate through a website unless he or she actively agrees – or declines to agree – to a particular use or disclosure of his or her personal data. However, as we have said, this on\nly takes us \nso \nfar and it is unrealistic to expect younger children to make meaningful choices here – although obviously parents or guardians could do this for their charges.  \nThis is also why it is\n extremely\n important that services aimed at – or \navailable\n to – children are offered with privacy-friendly default settings. This would mean, for example, that service users have to make an active decision to share information about themselves\n, rather than the sharing \ntaking place\n unless it is ‘turned off’. \nThe I\nCO very much favours a ‘privacy by default’ approach, particularly where children’s data is concerned. \nWhere services are aimed at children\n,\n perhaps more important than the privacy notice is the underlying fairness, safety and transparency of the service \nbeing offered – regarding matters such as the disclosure of personal data to third parties, or its use for marketing purpose\ns\n.\n \nWe certainly encourage the development of industry best-practice in the area of online services aimed at children, so that there \nis no confusion – or any unpleasant surprises – when a child uses one of these services. \nClearly, marketing that takes place on sites aimed at children should be age-appropriate. \n3. Age verification.One approach \nto the protection of children online is to prohibit certain organisations from offering certain types of service to children below a certain age. (This is the approach proposed in the European Commission’s data protection reform package.) We can see the ap\npeal of the approach in terms of its simplicity – \nsocial networking sites should not be allowed to offer their services to \nchildren under 13\n, for example. However, this approach \nis fraught with practical difficulty and do\nes not tally well with the UK’s leg\nal system which generally relies on a child’s competence, rather than just his or her age, in order to assess whether he or she can make a decision about something. (That said, age-restricted goods are denied to individuals purely on the basis of their age\n, a\nlthough we know from ‘bricks and mortar’ contexts how relatively\n easy\n it is for individuals under 18 to obtain alcohol, for example.\n)   \nHowever, it is clear that children of the same age have different levels of understanding, and that even quite young\n children might be able to make informed choices over relatively straightforward propositions. We do think that a too rigid, age-based approach could unfairly restrict children’s take up of on-line services and could deny them the informational learning ex\nperiences that will stand them in good stead in later life. \nWe also recognise the\n perhaps insurmountable\n difficulty of introducing a reliable online age verification system – or a \nrobust \nsystem for obtaining authentic parental consent\n. We are concerned that the introduction of such systems could result in service providers collecting large amounts of ‘hard’ personal information about children and their parents – information they would not ordinarily collect. \nIn terms of age verificati\non, we know that i\nt is \nusually \nvery easy to register as a user on a site based on a fake identity. A 12 year old can pretend to be 21 and set\n \nup a profile on most social networking sites. As a result, children have been able to find their way onto sites th\nat were intended for adults and vice versa.\nAt first glance, governments, child protection agencies and parents may be pacified by the promise that a single technology will dramatically reduce their child’s risk online and protect them from inappropriate s\nites and \nun\nsavoury characters on the Internet. However, the reality is that age verification is very difficult because a nationally available infrastructure is not available in the UK. If parents and policy architects focus solely on social networking sites, or any s\ningle technology solution, then the mark for \ninternet \nsafety \nwill be \nmissed.\nThere is no quick fix or silver bullet solution to child safety concerns around age verification, especially with the ever changing digital landscape. Tools are available for stak\neholders to promote and encourage better, safer online collaboration and communication for children\n.\n \nH\nowever, the reliance on a single technology or approach has limitations and possibly is unworkable. \nWe suggest a\nn alternative strategy \nof \na layered approa\nch deployed alongside educational advice, \nappropriate \nparental \nresponsibility and supervision\n, mentoring children in using the Internet safely, ISP involvement, industry protocols, \nwebsite\n developers embedding age verification and most importantly \nusing th\ne full range of existing\n legislation \n– including data protection law - \nto \nprotect children effectively.\n (We have not majored here on the undoubted importance of parental responsibility and supervision. However, we recognise that this is becoming more diffi\ncult to provide as we move away\n rapidly from the shared family PC to the personal portable device.)\nThe Internet offers countless benefits and learning opportunities for children. It lays the foundation for communication opportunities that ha\nve\n never been \nexperienced by mankind in our history. Because of the endless benefits it is in society’s best interest to help as many children get online. However, we must \nnot focus too much\n on age verification as a potential silver bullet\n, but rather\n focus on a layered\n approach\n,\n allowing children to become ethical, resilient citizens and contributing towards society in a positive manner.\nChapter 2 of the ICO’s ‘Personal Information On-line’ code of practice contains more information about the ICO’s approach to children’\ns personal data. It is available here: \nhttp://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/topic_guides/online/personal_information_online\nIt is worth noting that the European Commission’s proposal for a new data protection regulation has several provi\nsions intended to protect children’s personal data. In the original text a child was defined as any person below the age of 18 years. However this definition has been removed from the latest draft. \nICO’s\n activities fall into to two basic types – enforcement and education. \nWe will not go into \nall\n the aspects of our enforcement activity here. However, we do have powers that can require organisation\ns\n processing\n personal data about children to change their p\nractices in order to comply with the requirements of data protection law. We can also serve a civil monetary penalty of up to £500,000 for a breach. We deal with relatively few enforcement cases relating to children’s data – although a growing problem seem\ns to be ‘scam’ text messages being sent to individuals – including children – where the recipient is\n invited to\n call a particular premium-rate number in response. Dealing with this type of problem is a major element of our enforcement activity.\n ICO has bee\nn very active here \n– we submitted evidence and \nappeared recently before your Committee to \ndiscuss the problem of spam messages. Please follow this link for more information about the ICO’s work in this area:\n \nhttp://www.ico.org.uk/news/blog/2013/more-progress-in-fight-against-cold-calls-and-spam-texts\n \nW\ne would urge parents, teachers - and of course children themselves - to bring it to our attention when they believe that information about children is being collected, used or shared \ninappropriately, or where there is evidence that it is not being kept suf\nficiently secure, for example. We are confident that well-targeted enforcement activity could help to encourage good practice across the board and to marginalise companies that do not handle children’s data with sufficient respect. \nIn terms of the educati\non of children in respect of their information rights, the ICO has been extremely active over the years and plans further activity in the future. \nIn January 2013 the ICO commission\ned a set of education materials\n covering information rights that were \ninten\nded to give \nteachers a creative and engaging set of lesson plans for use in the classroom. The objective has been to raise some key issues with children and young people, so that from a young age they can become aware of their information rights, understan\nd the potential threats to their privacy, and know how to protect themselves on the internet and elsewhere.\n This is still at an early stage but we are pleased with the initial results. \nAfter pilot lessons at several schools throughout the UK in March and \nMay 2013, nine lesson plan outlines – five for primary schools, four for secondary - have been fully developed and are made available from the ICO’s website www.ico.org.uk/schools.\n \nSince August 18 2013\n,\n \nover \n3800\n \nof these education packs \nh\nave been download\ned\n. \nPre and post lesson evaluation among Key Stage 4 pupils attending High Storrs School in Sheffield showed that awareness of how to protect personal information increased from 59% to 75%, following the lessons. \nWhen appointing the supplier to produce th\ne materials, the ICO insisted that they were designed and developed by teachers still working in schools today and, crucially, were tailored to specific areas of the national curriculum.\nThe lesson plans explore what is meant by personal data, what \ninforma\ntion \ncan be shared and wh\nich information \nchildren should keep safe. The activities help teachers introduce children to their rights and responsibilities relating to data protection and freedom of information, and \nexplain \nwhere to go for help if they have a\n concern. The materials allow teachers flexibility in their approach and encourage active learning, with many opportunities for students to discuss and question. \nThere are five lesson plans for use in Primary Schools. They are:\nLesson Plan 1 – What is per\nsonal \ninformation?\nLearning objective: Children will understand what is meant by ‘personal information’.\nLP2 – Who needs to know and why\n? \nLearning objective: Children will consider the personal information that it might be appropriate to provide to a gi\nven person.\nLP3 – Opting out \nLearning objective: Children will become aware of how to ‘opt out’\n from particular uses, sharing etc. of their information\n. They will understand that information they provide could be used for a variety of purposes.\nLP4 – \nHow to react to unsolicited messages\nLearning objective: Children will consider how they should react to unsolicited emails and text messages that request personal information.\nLP5 – Rights and Regulations\nLearning objective: Children will understand that\n laws and regulations exist to protect us and to give us the right to access appropriate information.\nThere are four lesson plans for use in Secondary Schools. They are:\nLP1 – Strictly Private – what is personal data\nLearning objective: By the end of the \nsession, students will be able to:  \nLP2 – Private versus public\nLearning objective: By the end o\nf the session students will:\nLP3 – Is there something I should \nknow? \nExercising our rights \nLearning objective: By the end of the session students will:\nLP4 – No secrets – Freedom of Information\nLearning objective: By the end of the session students will:\nWe are very proud of our achievements thus far in terms of educating children about their information rights and informational safety. We are convinced that the education of\n children about these issues is crucial in terms of giving them the informational self-defence they will need as children and of course as adults. It is all too easy for children just to provide their details when asked to do so online, or to subscribe to \na service because they want the ‘goodies’ \nwithout thinking through the privacy implications of their actions. However, we are confident that our educational outreach work will help to foster the critical, questioning attitudes that children’s online safety\n depends on to such a great extent. \nWe thank the Committee for the opportunity to provide our views on this extremely important topic. We will of course be happy to provide any further information it requires from us. \nThe point we would like to reiterate \nis that the issue of children’s safety online is a complex and multi-faceted one. There is no single solution and the best we can do is to make sure \nthat the various organisation – including the ICO – that have a responsibility in this area prioritise the \nprotection of children and co-ordinate their efforts to reduce the risks and enable the benefits of the online world for young people. \nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
