The written evidence below is a summary of the responses to a an email sent out to all female Fellows in addition to recent attendees at the Inaugural \nMeeting organise\nd\n by the Women in Materials Steering Group\n in April 2013\n.\n&#xa0;\nIt is evident that positive changes have taken place in attitudes towards, and opportunities available, to women pursuing STEM careers. However prejudices remain and the ‘glass ceiling’ is perceived to still exist. Much of the problem still relates to the \nstereotyping of females at a young age, the lack of encouragement to study STEM subjects and the subsequent experience of working as a female in a male dominated field. For those with families the main obstacles are the compromise that has to be made when \ntwo individuals wish to pursue professional careers, the need for flexibility around childcare responsibilities and the cost of childcare. These could be addressed by the provision of affordable, conveniently placed childcare and flexible hour contracts. I\nn all cases there is a strong need for transparency within promotion procedures and encouragement \nand support to enable\n females\n to\n climb the career ladder. The introduction of a mentoring scheme could help address this issue.\n&#xa0;\nThe general consensus is that high achieving women often get overlooked for promotion. An observation is that women are less outwardly ambitious and less good at self-p\nromotion than their male equivalents.  Often females will ‘’wait to be asked’’ as opposed to putting themselves forward in the belief that if they keep their heads down and do a \ngood \njob, their ability will be noticed and promotion will follow. This can be\n interpreted wrongly as a lack of ambition or personal awareness of potential.\n&#xa0;\nThe evidence is that \nvisibility\n within the workplace \ncan \ninfluence \nwhether \none is \nchosen for promotion\n. \nOn this point, although technically the opportunities are equally open t\no men and women, and there are some very good women in senior roles, there is still a critical mass of managers who sub-consciously recruit those like themselves, which results in a series of management clones.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIf the manager is male, and works in a parti\ncular way or style, he will tend to promote those with a similar style\n that he recognises\n, rather than accepting that it would be possible do the job equally well with a different style. There is also the feeling of exclusion from\n certain areas within the \nworkplace, eg\n the friendships \nbetween male colleagues \nand the accompanying bonhomie which can inhibit promotion opportunities if the \nfemale member of staff \nis not seen as ‘’one of the boys’’.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWomen can be more focussed \nthan men \non achieving a balance between their personal life and career and as a consequence \nare \nmore often in a position of compromising\n one or both\n. \nThe further up the ladder one rises the more “out of hours” socialising/networking is required. Women are poor at t\nhis \nand frequently have primary responsibility for children or elderly relatives - women prioritise these domestic responsibilities rather than networking\n&#xa0;\nIt needs to be recognised that it is extremely difficult for two professionals to develop their care\ners equit\nably (i.e husband and wife) as \nboth cannot necessarily relocate to take on new jobs/promotions. As the role of the female can often be seen as that of the main carer in a family situation, the female \nwill be the one to compromise on\n promotion oppo\nrtunities.\n&#xa0;\nThe culture that ‘’employing women was a complete \nwaste of time, since they will \nget married and leave just as they became useful’’ is still in evidence. This can be coupled with the male perception that ‘’all women behave in the same \nway \nas th\ne most air-headed female they know’’.\n&#xa0;Women are the child-bearers and parenthood can bring with it career limitations relating to the ability to travel abroad for work and less capacity to work long hours to meet impending\n deadlines, due to caring  commitments. Th\nis can compromise both work and\n family life. \nIt is perceived that o\nne of the key features \nan individual is\n judged \non for promotion is flexibility\n \nand if they are tied to nursery/\nschool hours, they cannot be as flex\nible as a person without those external commitments.\n \nIf there is more than one child, the choice to stay \nat home is stacked even more in \nfavour of not working due to the extremely high costs associated with child-care in the UK\n.\n&#xa0;\nWomen can feel their career has stagnated since having children and can also feel \nthat \nbecoming a parent has put up \nfurther barriers to promotion based on the demands of the next career steps, e.g. international recognition if travel has been restricted. T\nhis can be seen as impacting on visibility and ultimately career progression which in turn can lead to disillusionment.\n&#xa0;\n Many women find that it is difficult to become a ‘returner’ and the longer they are out of professional employment the more difficult it becomes to retu\nrn. Some \nmay be the same age as their colleagues but they will not have the same level of experience. T\nhey do not have the same confidence as male counterparts and their honest\ny\n about their ability to return can be interpreted as a lack of confidence. For some women this situation is resolved by moving into other areas like HR\n where they perceive the demand\ns to be less stressful\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWomen are seen as leaving academia for a number of\n reasons and their destinations are variable. For those who go into industry, to quote one respondent’’ \nThere are clearly beneficial consequences of scientifically trained women applying their \nskills in a wide variety of different employment sectors. This generates wealth, growth and enhances skills in the broader UK e\nconomy. Although some graduates/\nPhDs will continue to be employed in technical roles using the technical skills directly, many wi\nll apply these skills to a broader business or public sector role which is also beneficial.’’\nAn observation is that some females with a technical background move into marketing to take adv\nantage of their creative skills. O\nthers start up thei\nr own business\nes or become self\nemployed con\nsultants offering specialist ex\npertise \nbut also giving them a more flexible approach to their working life.\nThe Committee is directed to the following sources where data on \nPhD student\n destinations can be found \nhttp://www.vitae.ac.uk/CMS/files/upload/Vitae-WDRD-by-subject-Jun-09.pdf\n. Another report also lists a wide range of relevant data sources\n(\nhttp://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/career-choices-and-impact-on-graduates-report_tcm8-6388.pdf\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nUniversity careers offices often hold destination data for graduates that could be examined.  One respondent \ndecided not to study for a PhD after completing \nan \nMEng citing one factor as the predom\ninance of male examples used within\n&#xa0;\nher \nfirst\n \ndegree\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBoth parents undertaking joint responsibility for childcare is unusual. Traditionally it is still \nthe husband \nwho \ntakes on the role of primary breadwinner and therefore the hours available \nfor the woman to\n work need to fit arou\nnd the timetable of first the child and secondly the husband\n – even when nursery care is available. The logistics of childcare provision and working hours can be difficult to balance. In general, it was felt that finding a job that fitted around childcare \nseriously restricted the hours available to work. As a consequence, women gradu\nates often take on the role of \nteaching assistants, as the hours fit in with family life and school holidays. This can be seen as having a positive benefit in that this might be\n a way of influencing the next generation to at least embark on a STEM career.\n&#xa0;\nIt was felt that \nthe \nopportunity \nexists for re\nintroducing\n,\n \nto the workplace\n,\n \nSTEM academics and graduates who are approaching the point where childcare responsibilities are\n diminishing. However many STEM graduates choose more local\nly available\n options \nas they lack confidence to return to the STEM area in which they previously worked. This is an issue for those returning to work after maternity leave as well as those who have\n been taking a career break whilst bringing up a family.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe problem of retaining females in STEM subject areas is s\neen as being related to \nthe insecurity of short term contracts, the perception that future promotion opportunities would be biased against females and that they would not be treated fairly and as equals. The situation was seen as being further aggravated b\ny the ‘two-body’ problem – ie the difficulty of two partners in a relationship seeking professional jobs in a similar geographic location; often compromise\n is needed and this tends\n to be made by the female.\n&#xa0;\nIt was felt that g\nuidelines \non promotion\n opportunities \nshould be transparent \nand \nvisible forcing\n organisations to promote based on ability, not visibility\n.\n Women need to be made aware of career paths that are open to them and universities should evaluate all criteria for career progression to en\nsure they reflect women’s strengths and experiences. This could be facilitated \nb\ny introducing CPD programmes so that where certain skill sets are\n required\n, these are identified early and training or other experience \nis \nbuilt up as needed\n.\nOne respondent em\nphasised that STEM careers are much wider than academic careers alone and that the higher education sector has a responsibility to ensure that graduates and PhDs regardless of gender are employable and consider broader options than academic careers alone. \nIt was felt that gender stereotyping could be broken down by students at all stages from school onwards being made aware of the range of employment opportunities available and that schools and universities ensure that where possible they make women availab\nle at careers events.\n&#xa0;The need \nfor universities to promote fam\nily-friendly work practices t\no both mal\ne and female staff \nwas recognised in addition to \nthe need to develop a \nculture of flexible working. The latter would \nallow both flexi-time and the ability to work from home combined with term only contracts which would allow both parents to balance family commitments and work more easily.\n&#xa0;\nAn overriding response was the plea for affordable childcare. There is little ince\nntive to return to work if your entire salary is used to meet childcare costs \n&#xa0;\nThere was also a suggestion that Universities could target more mature females.  It was felt that Universities tend to always target the young, and leave behind a large market \nof older \npeople that they could tap into\n by promoting mature students, introducing flexibility in terms of study options and distance learning. The need for ‘one to one care’ of potential \nreturners \nwas identified as was the need to tailor courses to suit \nindustry and career prospects.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOverall it was felt that this was a question to which it was difficult \nto respond.\n&#xa0;\nOne suggestion was that there should be better careers advice from school and throughout subsequent employment.\n Based on the evidence that girls do better in STEM subjects when taught in single sex classes the possibility of single sex sixth forms was suggested. However as there appears to be more peer pressure against girls doing STEM subjects in mixed sex schools\n this may be too little too late.\nAt University level the\n provision of more funding for longer-term fellowships\n was seen as the way forward. It should be emphasised that these would need to be\n advertised widely to raise awareness among\n all women in academia, and be \nopen to both \nmale and female applicants \nto prevent them being\n seen as a second-class option.\n&#xa0;\nThe overriding request was for d\nedicated childcare facilities at academic institutions\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
