&#xa0;Written evidence from Kirkby Thore Parish Council (TIC 080)&#xa0;Kirkby Thore is a small rural community situated in Eden valley in the east of Cumbria.&#xa0; The village is situated just off the main A66 trunk road approx 10 miles from Penrith and 5 miles from Appleby in Westmorland.&#xa0; The community is made up of approximately 350 dwellings, 60 of which are designated as social housing.&#xa0; The village has a small shop and post office.&#xa0; There is little local employment to which people would not have to use some form of transport.&#xa0;The village is served by the 563 bus service which operates between Kirkby Stephen and Penrith.&#xa0; The route has 10 services in each direction during the week.&#xa0; The service generally stops at the bus stop situated on the A66 which is at least 1 mile from the vast majority of properties.&#xa0; There are 4 services (2 in each direction) that call in to the village itself.&#xa0; &#xa0;Kirkby Thore Parish Council successful campaigned to increase the number of services calling into the village from 2 to 4 in 2012.&#xa0; Although the Parish Council initially underwrote the cost of these extra services their popularity has deemed them to be self financing.&#xa0;The Parish Council believes that the key to rural transport is the improvement of bus services and that to deliver transport&#xa0;improvements a number of issues and authorities will need to work together.&#xa0; This is something that the Parish Council is actively trying to achieve. &#xa0;The Parish Council is still campaigning for more bus services to call in to the village and believes if a number of agencies worked together it would benefit the community as a whole.&#xa0; If more buses (Cumbria County Council) called into the village less people would need to cross the busy A66, near to a difficult junction with poor visibility, to get to the bus shelter (Highways Agency).&#xa0; If the all the bus services called in to the village and none stopped on the A66 the bus shelter and layby could be used as part of a junction improvement (Highways Agency).&#xa0; If more bus services called into the village more people would be able to access employment (Reduction in Benefits).&#xa0; If more bus services called in to the village the housing association would find it easier to fill properties being vacated as a result of the bedroom tax. (Eden Housing Association).&#xa0;In addition the Eden Local Development Plan has identified sites within the Parish where a potential 152 additional properties could be built - a 43% increase in the size of the village.&#xa0; This Plan however does not detail any additional services or improvements that the community could expect if such an increase should occur.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Parish Council hopes that the example and issues described above relating to Kirkby Thore will help demonstrate that the issues rural communities face are complex and many; with transport being at the centre of achieving many other benefits, however,&#xa0;addressing issues in isolation will not deliver the results rural communities need to survive.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
