defaultMemorandum by Patrick defaultSeyddefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default(1) Televised debates involving party leaders provide an important means of enhancing public understanding and knowledge of political issues and are an opportunity for the public to hold those leaders accountable.  The debates also enable those standing for public office to express their views directly to the public.  Their importance is such that rather than the debates being arranged by a small group of party professionals and broadcasters, as at the moment, an institution should be specifically created which is responsible for the debates and is open to publi
defaultc accountability and scrutiny. 
default&#xa0;
default(2) The Electoral Commission’s responsibility is ‘to support well-run elections and referendums in the 
defaultUK
default …’ and it would therefore seem appropriate that this body be accorded responsibility for the administration and format of future televised leaders’ debates.  A specific sub-committee of the Electoral Commission should be established with the responsibility of overseeing all matters pertaining to the debates.  The sub-committee would be required to produce a report on all matters relating to the party leaders’ debates within a clearly specified period of time after the General Election and this report should be used to generate public debate and comment.
default&#xa0;
default(3) With regard to the Select Committee on Communications concern that the public interest is of primary importance in determining th
defaulte administration of the debates.
default&#xa0;
default(4) Participation in the debates should be based upon a clear formula.  For example, participation could be determined on the basis of a formula comprising a party’s percentage support in the previous General Election plus a party’s average percentage support in opinion polls in the 12 months immediately preceding the forthcoming General Election.
default&#xa0;
default(5) The duration of the debates should be determined in such a way as to maximise serious discussion and minimise mere sound bites.  For example, in the past two French presidential debates the major TV channels (TV1/TV2) devoted 3 hours to the debates giving adequate time for discussion of the most significant domestic and international issues.  Once the duration has been decided the number/length of debates would be determined in discussion with the broadcasters.
default&#xa0;
default(6) The location of the debates should be determined by the fact that the purpose of a General Election is to elect MPs to the UK Parliament.  In other words, the debate or debates should be organised wherever in the 
defaultUK
default is thought to be most appropriate.  Specific leaders’ debates in 
defaultScotland
default, 
defaultWales
default and 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default should not be part of the General Election format (these would be appropriate for the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Assembly elections).
default&#xa0;
default(7) The organising principles for the leaders’ debates should be based upon the Question Time/Any Questions formats, namely a senior broadcaster should chair the 
defaultdebates, preselected questions submitted by the public should be chosen for debate (with guidance on the general subject topics to be chosen coming from the ranking of ‘most important issues’ in the pre-election opinion polls), and the debates should take place before a selected public audience.
default&#xa0;
default(8) Section 333 of the Communications Act 2003 requires OFCOM to ensure that Party Political Broadcasts/Party Election Broadcasts are included in every licensed public service television channel and every national radio service.  A similar obligation should be statutorily required to transmit the leaders’ debates.  Satellite broadcasters, such as SKY, should be invited to participate in the leaders’ debates but would be under no obligation to do so.
