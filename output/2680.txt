In addition to this consultation on the Technical Housing Standards Review, Government ran consultations in 2007 and 2010-11. Details of these can be found here: www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/greenerbuildings/sustainablehomes/consultations Such as Element Energy 2013 study on ‘Costs of building to the Code for Sustainable Homes’, which drew learning from 5 local authorities who have implemented CfSH via policy: www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/EP059%20Costs%20of%20building%20to%20the%20Code%20for%20Sustainable%20Homes%20(Sept%202013)%20(draft).pdf  The Merton Rule was the first local planning policy to set a requirement for renewable energy generation in new buildings, developed by Merton Borough Council in 2003. The rule required any new residential development of more than 10 units, or any commercial building over 1,000m2, to generate at least 10% of its energy needs from on-site renewable energy equipment: www.merton.gov.uk/environment/planning/planningpolicy/mertonrule.htm Plymouth Renewable Energy Strategic Viability Study (2007): www.plymouth.gov.uk/homepage/environmentandplanning/planning/planningpolicy/ldf/ldfbackgroundreports.htm Plymouth Local Development Framework 2007, Chapter 11 Natural Environment: www.plymouth.gov.uk/core_strategy_4web_11_chapter_11.pdf Report available to download here: www.bristol.gov.uk/page/bristol-citywide-sustainable-energy-study Bristol City Council Core Strategy policies BCS14 and BCS15, adopted June 2011: www.bristol.gov.uk/page/planning-and-building-regulations/planning-core-strategy Report available here: www.cse.org.uk/pdf/west_sussex_sustainable_energy_study.pdf Revised Draft Adur Local Plan 2013: www.adur-worthing.gov.uk/adur-local-plan-consultation/ Mid Sussex District Plan, Submission May 2013: www.midsussex.gov.uk/media/BP1_SubmissionDistrictPlanMay2013.pdf Arun District Council Submitted Local Plan 2013: www.arun.gov.uk/main.cfm?type=LOCALPLAN2&amp;objectid=6221&amp;searchtermredirect=Local%20Plan%202013%20-%202028%20and%20beyond#LP Horsham District Planning Framework Preferred Strategy 2013: www.horsham.gov.uk/environment/planning_policy/14379.aspx Chichester District Council Draft Local Plan Key Policies – Preferred Approach 2013: www.chichester.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=21805 Renewable Energy and Sustainable Construction Study 2010: www.teignbridge.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=33316&amp;p=0 Renewable Energy Capacity Study 2013: www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/info/856/local_plan_2006-2026_formerly_ldf/1013/renewable_energy_capacity_study
