[[[Written evidence from Dr Carl Reynolds (GMC022)]]]I am a respiratory physician and an academic. I have previously written in the British Medical Journal[1][2] on the topic of conflict of interest, am co-founder of Bad Guidelines, a successful campaign for guidance on interactions between healthcare professionals and the pharmaceutical industry to be evidence based[3], and part of a campaign for medical education accredited free from industry influence called Conflict Free Conferences[4].I am writing to draw attention to two areas where intervention from the GMC would be beneficial to both doctors and patients.

[[[Conflict of interest and routine research]]]As a physician I care deeply about providing the best treatment I can to my patients. In many areas of medicine establishing what the best treatment is hard in itself either because of an abundance of conflicting evidence or a lack of evidence altogether.Unfortunately, this is made even harder because a lack of means to track conflict of interest for health care professionals creates difficulty in identifying instances where educational and academic resources may be being deliberately biased to a commercial end. A register of doctors' conflicts of interest would make critical appraisal of such resources much easier.The GMC may consider making part of register available, specifically the list of doctors names, specialties, and GMC numbers to allow others to keep track of these conflicts of interests in a similar way to existing websites such as www.theyworkforyou.com do for politicians.It is a lost opportunity when the potential learning from situations where there is genuinely no evidence available that one treatment will be better than another is not captured through pragmatic randomised controlled trials or other means. The GMC should consider reinstating a recommendation to encourage such research[6]Creating a register for doctorsâ€™ conflicts of interest and encouraging research in routine care would both bode well with the first of the GMC's duties of a doctor:"MAKE THE CARE OF YOUR PATIENT YOUR FIRST CONCERN; Protect and promote the health of patients and the public; Respect patients' right to confidentiality; Never discriminate unfairly against patients or colleagues;"as well as Beauchamp and Childress's primary principle of medical ethics "Respect for autonomy: respecting the decision-making capacities of autonomous persons; enabling individuals to make reasoned informed choices."and intervention here would be most welcome.
