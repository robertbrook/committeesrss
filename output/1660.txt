[[[Why the Part L decision is flawed]]]Firstly, at consultation stage the cost of the ‘halfway point’ policy was stated to be £453 million (i.e. it would cost house builders that amount to comply with it). This figure was based on out-of-date figures, for example the costs for installing solar PV have fallen by approximately 45% since this time. The real cost to house builders would in fact be £317 million. In the published changes DECC acknowledges the latest solar PV costs in the new non-domestic buildings analysis and yet the less ambitious target was still preferred.Secondly, the benefits to private consumers were ignored. The Impact Assessment for options for the 2013 building regulations openly failed to take into account the benefits to consumers of the policy, contrary to the rules in the Treasury ‘green book’, which specifies that all costs and benefits

[[[ ]]]should be assessed. This meant that benefits to consumers of fuel savings of £375 million were ignored.If these figures are used instead, they show that the halfway approach would benefit society by £58m (£375m benefit - £317m costs) as shown in the graph below:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Benefits of increased deployment for Ground Source Heat Pumps]]]&#xa0;To demonstrate the benefits of increased deployment for GSHPs, the chart below shows the 2020 annual resource costs rate per technology. Annual resource cost measures the annual net incremental costs of installing a renewable heating system instead of a conventional one. The costs take into account the annual operational benefits (if any) but exclude any subsidy, thereby identifying, in the absence of any market interventions, an underlying merit order of options available in meeting a particular policy objective. With sensible assumptions about price reductions from now to 2020, GSHPs are a valuable investment and provide a cheaper way of producing renewable energy than some other technologies already supported by Government through other schemes such as the Renewables Obligation. There is therefore a strong case to increase the subsidies paid to GSHPs, even if initially that subsidy is higher than some other technologies used to meet the renewables target, in order to ensure their proper deployment as a cost effective means for the country overall in meeting the renewables target.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We are therefore supportive of an approach to the tariff cap which considers both the Carbon Floor Price (CPF) and Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) as part of the calculation of the cap, as this brings the price of support up to levels which would be more effective for driving the uptake of GSHPs. GSHPs are an important technology to deliver Government Heat Strategy projections and drive EU targets, and it is therefore right to offer a level of support to drive the market for this technology, and in turn bring the capital costs of installation down.  &#xa0;

[[[ tariff review]]]&#xa0;The below chart employs industry data to show the required tariff to achieve a 12% RoR. The chart shows that the average tariff for all heat output (8.4p/kWh) falls slightly above the proposed range suggesting that the tariff needs to be at least at the upper end of the proposed range. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Range45kW to 500kW&#xa0;SPF3.6&#xa0;Gas counterfactual90% efficiency&#xa0;Gas price3.40 p/kWh&#xa0;Electricity price9.90 p/kWh&#xa0;Load factor21%&#xa0;Target RoR12%&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
