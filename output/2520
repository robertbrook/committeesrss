default“Every person within the jurisdiction enjoys the equal protection of our laws. There is no distinction between British nationals and others. He who is subject to English law is entitled to its protect

defaultL
defaultegal Aid eligibility is based on this very principle: it is currently available for all, regardless of their country of residence, provided their case raises an issue in the legal system of England and Wales and comes within the narrow 
defaultscope of Legal Aid. 
defaultThis is the ‘connection’ necessary 
defaultand appropriate 
defaultfor eligibility

default requirements have not yet been decided upon. However, individuals who do not already have evidence of UK nationality may have to pay a fee for a copy of their birth certificate or other documentation if they do not have easy access to them. Claimants may 
defaultalso experience a delay in their cases whilst documentation is sought.” 
defaultThe residence test in practice: 
defaultinternational 
defaultfamily cases  
default“What I find so depressing is that the case highlig
defaulthts the difficulties increasingly encountered by the judiciary at all levels when dealing with 
defaultlitigants in person. Two problems in particular are revealed. The first is how to bring order to 
defaultthe
default chaos which litigants in person invariably – and wholly unde
defaultrstandably – manage to create in putting forward their claims and defences. Judges should not have to micro-manage cases, coaxing and cajoling the parties to focus on the issues that need to be resolved. Judge Thornton did a brilliant job in that regard ye
defaultt, as this case shows, that can be disproportionately time-consuming. 
defaultIt may be saving the Legal Services Commission which no longer offers Legal Aid for this kind of litigation but saving expenditure in one public department in this instance simply increa
defaultses it in the courts. The expense of three judges of the Court of Appeal dealing with this kind of appeal is enormous. The consequences by way of delay of other appeals which need to be heard are unquantifiable. The appeal would certainly never have occurr
defaulted if the litigants had been represented.
default defaultWith more and more self-represented litigants, this problem is not going to go away. We may have to accept that we live in austere times, but as I come to the end of eighteen years service in this court, I shall no
defaultt refrain from expressing my conviction that justice will be ill served indeed by this emasculation of Legal Aid” (emphasis added)
defaultThe residence test in practice: victims of crime, abuse and wrongdoing 
default“proper protection and support for vic
defaulttims of crime is a fundamental part of a civilised justice system. 
defaultand committed itself to “action” to “ensure that victims get the support they need to cope with the aftermath”. 
defaultBut, despite improvements over the last two decades, the system has continu
defaulted to fall short in helping victims recover from crime, supporting them through the stresses of investigation and trial, and providing the right support at the right time.

defaultDiscrimination 
defaultAbsence of justification 
default“3.42 We are concerned that individuals with little or no connection to this 
defaultcountry are currently able to claim Legal Aid to bring civil legal actions at UK taxpayers’ expense. These may be people who have never set foot in England or Wales, or those 
defaultwho have never paid taxes in the UK, but who are yet able to benefit financially from the civil Legal Aid scheme. Alternatively these may be people who are in the country but whose connection is tenuous because they are simply here on a visa as visitors, o
defaultr because they have temporary admission. 
default3.43 We need to introduce a common sense test to address this anomalous situation, which we believe is currently unfair to the UK taxpayer. We believe that limited public funds for civil Legal Aid should be targete
defaultd at those who have a strong connection to the UK.”
defaultand secondly to deter ‘forum shopping’: 
default“3.44 We are also concerned that the availability of Legal Aid for cases brought in this country, irrespective of the person’s connection with this country, may encourage people to bring disputes here.”
