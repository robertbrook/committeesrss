defaultBackgrounddefaultThe British Police are still the envy of the world. 
defaultThe Service has clear ethical and professional standards and values which are set out in the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Statement of Common Purpose and Values (1992) the Oath of Office and more recently the draft Code of Ethics produced by the College of Policing (2013). However the accurate recording of crime has consistently been an area of concern and debate both inside and outside the Service.
defaultIn July 2000, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) published the results of a thematic inspection on police crime recording (On the Record 2000) which set out the

defaulte. These rules provide a national standard for recording and counting notifiable offences
default. 
defaultA number of national forums were then formed, such as the National Crime Recording Steering Group (NCRSG) which updates the HOCR annually to reflect changes in legislation, to improve clarity and to promote consistency between Police Forces. It consists of members from the Home Office Statistics Unit, Force Crime Registrars and Statistics Officers, representatives of ACPO and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) as well as other bodies such as the Crown Prosecution Service and Police Federation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2012, the independent Crime Statistics Advisory Committee (CSAC) was established following a recommendation from the National Statistician's Review of Crime Statistics.  The Committee functions as a strategic, high level advisory body offering independent advice to the Home Secretary, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and HMIC on matters related to the measurement of crime and the collection and presentation of crime data for England and Wales.
defaultHMIC’s inspection of crime statistics in 2012 ‘
defaultThe crime scene: A review of police crime and incident reports
default’ importantly formed the view that the public rely on crime and incident data to judge how well their local police force is performing.
default&#xa0;
defaultSummary of Evidencedefault&#xa0;
defaultAnswers to the Questions Posed by the Committeedefault&#xa0;
default1.default              defaultAre crimes being recorded by the police when they should be? Are crimes being categorised correctly?default&#xa0;
defaultHistorical Context
default&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultThe NCRS and HOCR provide clear national rules, standards and guidance for crime recording and categorisation. There is evidence from repeated HMIC Inspections and engagement with individual Forces that there is inconsistency across the Country in how these rules are applied. This was confirmed by 
defaultHMIC’s most recent inspection of Kent Police (2013)
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultIt should, however, be acknowledged that the vast majority of crimes are recorded in line with national standards. Forces employ Crime Registrars and Designated Decision Makers to ensure that the HOCRs and upheld accurately and consistently. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultIn their final external audit published in September 2007, the Audit Commission noted that ‘The police have continued to make significant improvements in crime recording performance and now have better quality crime data than ever before.’ The Commission assessed 38 of the 43 forces as ‘Good’ or ‘Excellent’ for crime data quality, five as ‘Fair’ and none as ‘Poor’.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultIn 2011, HMIC carried out a review of police crime and incident reports across England and Wales and found that three quarters of forces were judged to have made correct crime recording decisions 90% or more of the time, with an average of 92% of incidents correctly finalised, indicating a good national standard (HMIC, ‘The Crime Scene’, 2012). 
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default              
defaultIn 2013, the ONS described the system for recording crime in England and Wales as ‘Widely recognised by international standards to be one of the best in the world’ and noted that few other jurisdictions had attempted to develop such a standardised approach, and of those that had (such as Australia and Northern Ireland), their approach had been based around the England and Wales model (Analysis of Variation in Crime Trends, ONS, Jan 2013). 
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default              
defaultHowever, despite these successes, there are occasions when crime recording does not meet national standards. 
defaultFurther detail is provided later in this submission, but reasons for officers failing to record crime properly could be
default other 
defaultdemands on their time and performance pressures, a simple derogation of duty on behalf of the officer concerned, a belief on the part of the officer concerned that they are acting in the interest of the public, a lack of knowledge or understanding of the HOCRs, or poor and inadequate IT systems. 
default&#xa0;
defaultActing in the interest of the public by applying professional judgement
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default              
defaultIn her speech to the Superintendents Association on 10 September 2013, The Home Secretary, Teresa May, concluded with the statement:
default“
defaultIf you asked me: what is the most significant thing that this government has done for you? (The Police)  I would answer: We have given you back the power to use your own judgement”
default 
default              
defaultHowever in the area of Crime Recording many Force Crime Registrars feel they face regular conflict with officers as there is little leeway for application of professional judgement in deciding whether to record an incident as a crime or not. The majority of audits and inspections over the past ten years have been based on the hypothesis that administrative accuracy supports the highest quality of service for victims. However, it is not necessarily the case that such accuracy equates to the most victim-focussed response. This often brings Crime Registrars and their staff into direct confrontation with police officers who perceive them to be prioritising compliance with the rules over the needs of victims and the wider public. 
default1.8  
default              
defaultCrime recording procedures can sometimes be at odds with the national decision making model (NDM) adopted by ACPO in 2012. The NDM is intended to provide a value based tool, providing a simple and evidence based approach to making policing decisions. In short, it allows officers to use professional judgement and common sense based on public need. This professional judgement arguably cannot currently be applied to crime recording and this repeatedly causes tension across the Service. That said certain types of offences that involve serious harm should always be recorded as a crime and the application of officer discretion would be inappropriate. Some examples of this might include serious assault, burglary or robbery 
default1.9
default              
defaultWhilst there is greater political support for the use of professional judgment there still remain two clear arguments against applying professional judgement to crime recording. Firstly, that it may provide a green light for some officers to avoid carrying out a proper investigation and consequently deny the member of the public the right quality of service. Secondly, that the Police Service has arguably become so entrenched in target driven culture focused on crime
default 
defaultfigures that it would enable a climate in which crimes would not get recorded if doing so could have a negative impact on performance targets. 
default1.10
default              
defaultWhilst quarterly sets of crime figures are produced and crime number categories for all 43 Forces are used as a mechanism to assess Force performance, this remains a real risk.  The dilemma is whether there is an appetite to support the greater use of professional judgement in crime recording to ensure the service meets victim or public need. 
default1.11
default              
defaultInterestingly, the introduction of Police and Crime Commissioners has begun to further this debate with some PCCs challenging the target culture and promoting a greater drive towards quality of service and public confidence. Whilst it may not be universally supported in all quarters, there is an argument that to get the best out of our police service, we have to trust our staff to do their job based on the oath of office they swore when appointed. However, increasing trust also needs to be accompanied by checks and balances through supervision, audit and inspection, and appropriate sanctions where shortcomings are identified. 
default&#xa0;
default2.default              defaultWhat are the factors which can influence mis-recording of crimedefault?
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultConsultation across the Police Service reveals a wide divergence of factors that might lead to mis-recording of crime as opposed to one single issue. Caution should be applied here as many of the themes are often anecdotal as opposed to wholly evidence based, but the below list references some consistent themes that have been articulated from across the country.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.default              defaultAre the right checks in place to ensure that the systems for recording crime function effectively and accurately?default&#xa0;default3.1
default              
defaultConsultation from across the Service indicates there is variance of approach around the checking and auditing of crime recording. Each Force operates independently, with different checking systems in place. However, the most common themes are:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.default              defaultHas enough been done to ensure the integrity of crime data? What more should be done?default&#xa0;default4.1
default              
defaultThere has been a long history of activity aimed at improving the integrity of crime data. The following chronology illustrates some of these events:
default&#xa0;
default1998 – 2005 - defaultNCRS and HOCR implemented and embedded.
default&#xa0;
default2003 – 07 - defaultAudit Commission conduct annual review of crime data.
default&#xa0;default2009 - defaultHMIC publish ‘Crime Counts’ (an inspection of violent crime recording) stating most violent crime is being recorded correctly by police but some victims may have been denied the service they deserve because their allegations were not recorded as crimes.
default&#xa0;
default2011 - defaultNational Statistician’s Review of Crime Statistics for England and Wales published, with eight recommendations to improve confidence and understanding of crime statistics.
default&#xa0;default2011 - defaultCrime Statistics Advisory Committee inaugurated on recommendation of the National Statistician.
default&#xa0;
default2012 -default Responsibility for reporting and publication of Crime Statistics moved to the ONS by the Home Secretary to create greater independence.
default&#xa0;
default2012 -default HMIC publishes ‘The Crime Scene’, examining how the police record, investigate and resolve crimes and incidents of anti-social behaviour.
default&#xa0;
default2012 -default ‘Action Fraud’ empowered to directly record from the Public and financial institutions. 
default&#xa0;default2013 - defaultHMIC data integrity inspections due to commence
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultThere is again some variance in processes across the country, making it difficult to be conclusive about the integrity of crime data. However, responses from Forces across the country suggest the following actions could help improve data integrity:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.default              defaultTo what extent can policy-makers have confidence in the statistics which result from the recording of crime by police forces?default&#xa0;default5.1
default              
defaultMost forces and their FCRs have a high level of confidence in their statistics, particularly for lower volume and high risk crimes and the majority believe that at the National Level there could be confidence in the statistics. The HMIC Data Integrity Inspection will hopefully assist in explaining this. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultIssues that were raised that might create doubt were:
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultPrior to the introduction of HOCR and NCRS, the ONS found that the volume of police recorded crime (in comparable categories) was between 50-62% of the total estimated from the British Crime Survey (BCS). This suggested a large volume of crimes were not being recorded. The gap between the volume of police recorded crime and BCS crime narrowed substantially around the time of NCRS introduction. From 2002/03 the ONS found the volume of police recorded crime (in comparable categories) rose to around 90% of the BCS total and remained there until 2007/08.  
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default              
defaultHowever, from 2007/08 onwards there was a sharper fall in police recorded crime than BCS crimes. The effect of this was to increase the difference between the volume of police recorded crime and BCS crime. This trend continued until 2011/12, when the volume of police recorded crime (in comparable categories) was just under 70% of that reported to the Crime Survey (Source- Analysis of Variation in Crime Trends, ONS, Jan 2013).    
default&#xa0;
default5.6
default              
defaultIn 2012/13, crime reported to the Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) fell at a sharper rate (7%) than crime reported to the police (5%), suggesting that the figures are converging.  (NB-The CSEW replaced the BCS in 2012).
default&#xa0;
default5.7
default              
defaultThe ONS report ‘Analysis of Variation in Crime Trends’ (2013) suggested drivers for the divergence between CSEW/BCS crime and police recorded crime might include;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default6.default              defaultShould recorded crime statistics be classified as National Statistics?default&#xa0;
default6.1
default              
defaultAlthough there was recognition that this may be difficult to achieve due to inconsistencies across forces, the vast majority of responding forces agreed that Crime Statistics should be classified as national statistics
default 
defaultto provide greater confidence that the figures were true and accurate and to enhance their credibility and integrity.
