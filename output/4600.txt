[[[Comments on the Regulation of Helicopter Operations – December 2103]]]&#xa0;Commentator's Background&#xa0;Firstly, not being an Aviation professional, I need to set out my background, so that my comments can be put into context.&#xa0;I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1970, following a 4 year Student Apprenticeship with BP. I obtained Professional Engineering status at age 28, becoming an M I Mech E. &#xa0;From 1970, until 1987, I worked for BP on the design of major oil and gas projects, including the Magnus Oil Platform, Sullom Voe Oil Terminal, Abu Dhabi liquefied natural gas plant, the Miller oil platform, etc. These projects were all technically challenging and had budgets, in terms of 2013 £'s, of circa £500 million to £1+ billion. &#xa0;In the course of this work, I was part of one accident investigation team, and was also part of an internal Safety Review Team auditing the design of  BP's Buchan oil facility. During the time I spent on the various Projects, I flew, as a passenger, on various Helicopters including the Boeing Chinook, the Super Puma, etc. &#xa0;From 1987 until 2003 I worked for the Department of  Energy, and then the Department of Trade and Industry, firstly as a Senior, then Principal, Professional Technology Officer (PPTO) - providing advice and recommendations on the development of oil and gas fields. On the Exploration and Development side, I was the Department of  Energy Co-ordinator for the scrutiny of  Occidental's proposals for the Piper Bravo platform, following the tragic loss of the Piper Alpha platform, where 167 men perished. Of course there were considerable `Safety' overtones doing this work, which eventually led to the transfer of  Safety responsibility from the Safety Division of  D Energy to the HSE. Towards the end of my time in DTI, I was DTI observer on the HSE Offshore Safety review panel, which involved discussions with the Unions, the Petroleum Industry Trade body, and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, etc&#xa0;I also have some background in the design, build and operation of various radio controlled Model Aircraft, including Model helicopters, and hold two competence Certificates from the British Model Flying Association. Given this overall technical background, I have experience in Fluid Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Rotating Machinery, Stress Analysis, and the theory of Flight. I have no experience of  piloting full size Helicopters, but, as a Pupil,  I have flown Cessna 152 type light aircraft and gliders for small number of hours.&#xa0;In addition, I witnessed, from our house in Staines, on April 9th, 1968, the difficulties of  Flight 712, which passed over us with an engine on fire. I also saw the fireball go up at Heathrow; 5 people died in that incident. The cause was a fatigue failure of a low pressure compressor wheel in an engine. In a similar vein, a BP work colleague from the Magnus Project died in the Kegworth crash, again caused by an engine failure, and crew error. Whilst we lived in Farnborough in Hampshire, two helicopter pilots were killed preparing for a display. Again, when with D En, on one flight to `familiarise' a Minister, my office colleague spotted fuel leaking through the roof lining of the helicopter, as it was about to take off from the platform. Needless to say, the alarm was raised, and they all disembarked in pretty short order ! &#xa0;So I perhaps see the assertions that Aviation is a very safe form of transport with some reservations. Statistically it is fairly safe; but people are, nevertheless, still being put at risk.&#xa0;Aviation activity in the vicinity of  Harpenden&#xa0;The relevance of this is that it led to a number of communications I had with the CAA and DfT, from which I have been left with considerable concerns.&#xa0;There is a low level flightpath directly above our house, which was used by light aircraft when we first moved to Harpenden in 1987. Layered above that were the Luton Airport flightpaths, and often above that, depending on wind direction, `heavy' traffic out of Heathrow eg fully laden Boeing 747's etc. Gradually what was a fairly benign low level `Cessna 152' type flightpath became a helicopter route, especially during the `boom' years of 2000-2007. Also guests started to arrive at the nearby Luton Hoo Hotel by Helicopter. I witnessed a number of  helicopter activities which I regarded as dangerous – eg a `beat up' by a helicopter over nearby Kinsborne Green, and various `rubbernecking' circuits by Robinson R22 helicopter pilots, including one where a Cessna 152 flew in close proximity to a Robinson. The Cessna pilot probably could not see the Robinson, as his downward view would be obscured by the engine cowl of the Cessna. Likewise the Robinson pilot would have had to look upwards and backwards over his shoulder to even try to catch a glimpse of the Cessna.&#xa0;Apart from the collision risk, I was concerned that major mechanical failure of  the helicopter rotor assembly, or the gearbox, would lead to a situations where `landing clear', as required by the CAA regulations, would be impossible. This failure to `land clear' would mean that the Helicopter would crash on our housing development.&#xa0;Invariably, the CAA would comment that they could not track what had happened on the radar, and therefore could offer no comment, other than that a helicopter or plane was permitted to fly as close as 500 feet over us, which I regarded as `bonkers'. Similarly, circa 2-3 years ago, there was a photo in the Telegraph newspaper, showing a Robinson helicopter perched on a platform on the bank of the Thames near Henley (I think). Again the comment was that the CAA had inspected the site and it was found to be within the Regulations, which I found deeply worrying. (as an aside, the French apparently ban civilian helicopters from operating within the `Periphique' in Paris.)&#xa0;I also had correspondence with the CAA regarding the difficulty reading the Registration markings on Helicopters.  Given that CAA could not provide details from radar plots, and the fact that Transponders are often not used on smaller Helicopters, and the difficulties of reading the markings, I felt there was no effective safety monitoring of  any incidents occurring in the low level route above our heads.&#xa0;Even if a helicopter did not suffer main rotor or gearbox failure, I also had misgivings about Helicopters being able to safely enter the `glide' (technically autorotation) should there be fuel or (single) engine problems. From what I have read on the Internet, it would seem that it is one thing to do an autorotation practice when the pilot knows it is coming, and quite another if alarms come up and there is confusion. In fact there are apparently only a very few seconds to achieve autorotation particularly with `low inertia' rotor heads as per the Robinson R22 helicopter. Even with larger helicopters, apparently once those precious seconds have been lost, it is very difficult, in fact virtually impossible, to recover the machine into a safe autorotation, and a crash results.&#xa0;Three fellow Residents (including one who has a fixed wing Private Pilots Licence) have also had serious misgivings about the Police Helicopter in our area, as there is something called the V-H diagram, where V is velocity, and H is height, in the flight manual of all Helicopters. This diagram is also called the `Dead Man's Curve', because there are some combinations of  speed and height from which it is impossible to enter auto-rotation, and therefore a crash is inevitable. We subsequently met the Police Chief Superintendent, and the Police Flight Operations Manager, and expressed our concerns about very low level flight. So, sadly, the recent Glasgow Police helicopter accident was one that I consider was waiting to happen, given the accident statistics for helicopters. My criteria for deploying a Police Helicopter would involve the question `is life at risk' ?&#xa0;(Colin MacRae, the rally driver, was killed in a helicopter accident, and Noel Edmonds, the TV personality, gave up helicopter flying after a friend was killed in another accident. From a recent US helicopter symposium it was reported in the Press that helicopters had accidents 7.5 times in 100,000 operational hours vs 0.175 accidents on the same basis for fixed wing aircraft. By my calculator

[[[ the accident risk about 42 times greater for the helicopter.]]])&#xa0;&#xa0;North Sea activity&#xa0;Generally, North Sea Oil Platform operations personnel have significant technical training, and are highly aware of safety. As such they are more observant, and probably more critical, than the General Public. They are also aware that changing North Sea weather conditions can cause problems, and that on landing on the Platform, the helicopter has to avoid the hot exhaust plumes from Power Generation, and avoid the flare stack. drilling derrick, large cranes, etc. &#xa0;Also, many of the maintenance (and sometimes Safety) issues on North Sea Platforms are caused by rotating machinery such as gas turbines, gas compressors, main oil line pumps etc. Often these items are large precision items of many thousands of  horsepower. So, knowing the lengths that Platform personnel have to go to keep this machinery running efficiently, it is no surprise that many oil workers are more than happy to disembark their flimsy helicopter, which is also full of rotating equipment such as shafts, gas turbines, gearboxes, etc, all of which are built down to a stringent weight limit. Their flight may be in darkness, and in high winds and low visibility. Also the Helicopter is inherently more prone to damaging vibration, from rotor blade vortex `chopping', which can cause `fatigue' of components, necessitating replacement of critical components after a certain number of operational hours.&#xa0;North Sea Helicopter regulation&#xa0;Generally, and following on from my North Sea experience, I believe it is a mistake for a `sponsoring' Department, such as DfT, to oversee and possibly influence the CAA. There is always the concern when the Chancellor/Treasury wishes to expand a sector for economic benefit, that this message is subliminally passed down to a Department such as the DfT/CAA. (Possibly we shall see a political U-turn on expanding Heathrow, on the back of GDP growth, business expansion, and never mind Climate Change, Particulates, NOx, noise, etc ?).&#xa0;Finally, we have the well known issue of the Civil Servant who does not want to make waves and upset his Director General, Minister etc. This may be because of cost pressures from the Aviation sector, `Euro' involvement, and the perceived need for `light touch' regulation, as often expressed by Ministers.&#xa0;The Oil Industry goes through various cycles of `boom and bust' and cost pressures are always there, particularly in lean times. These pressures can then be passed down the supply chain to vendors such as Helicopter Operators. Thus there can often be debate with the unions such as the Transport &amp; General, for the Offshore workers, and on the other hand BALPA, representing the Pilots, and the Helicopter Operating Company. I certainly would not want to be on a Helicopter piloted by an over stressed, tired Pilot.&#xa0;Also, my concern is that although the CAA may have personnel with considerable aviation experience, maybe with the Military, that possibly these people have become conditioned to flying regimes with a much higher risk factor than for Civilian operations. I once had a Helicopter ride in Abu Dhabi with an ex Vietnam pilot, and that flight was `interesting'.&#xa0;The other potential issue is that the CAA may tend to attract and recruit  `Aviation Enthusiasts' who will possibly lean in the direction of the Aviation Industry.&#xa0;Conclusion&#xa0;I have no doubt that there are many hard working professional people in the Helicopter Operations sector, doing their very best. &#xa0;However, I do view helicopter operations as intrinsically much more dangerous than that of that fixed wing operations. As the saying goes  -`Helicopters don't fly, they just beat the air to death ...'&#xa0;Despite CAA's probable protestations, it should be investigated if  the `Safety' aspects of Helicopter Operations would be served better by them being under the wing of the HSE, or similar arm's length regime away from a sponsoring Department such as DfT.&#xa0;Finally, I consider Helicopter operations should always challenged with the question `is this flight really necessary' ? Certainly for overland transportation, where there are the Railways and Fixed wing options, maybe the answer should often be a `No' ?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013         &#xa0;&#xa0;
