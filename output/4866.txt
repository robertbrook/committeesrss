[[[Suspected crimes committed by TPIM subjects ]]]&#xa0;I am writing in response to a request from Eleanor Scarnell on 29 November for details of TPIM subjects who a) are believed to have committed a UK crime, but cannot be prosecuted for it; and b) are not believed to have committed a UK crime. &#xa0;Before she can impose a TPIM notice, the Home Secretary must have reasonable belief that the person concerned is, or has been, involved in terrorism related activity (in the UK or overseas). In all of our TPIM cases this belief, which is lower than the criminal test, has been upheld by the courts. Involvement in terrorism related activity would, of course, almost certainly constitute a UK crime. &#xa0;As required by Section 10 of the TPIM Act, before any TPIM notice is imposed, the Crown Prosecution Service reviews the evidence available and must advise the Chief Officer of Police that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute the person concerned for an offence relating to terrorism. &#xa0;So to answer the question posed; all TPIM subjects are ‘reasonably believed’ to have been involved in terrorism related activity likely to constitute a UK crime for which they cannot be prosecuted.
