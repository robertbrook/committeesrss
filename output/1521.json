"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from\n Northumberland County Council\n (\nTIC\n 40)\n&#xa0;Summary\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNorthumberland County Council covers a large area, including many isolated communities (both in urban and rural areas), hence it is replying to this Inquiry as it is very relevant\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNCC identifies demand for transport to isolated communities by evaluating demand for services that already exist  \nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe extent to which the needs of different groups of passengers can be taken into account is constrained by available budget\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe challenges a\nssociated with providing better public transport to isolated communities are varied, but the only way they can be overcome is through more, and more consistent, long-term revenue funding \ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunity Transport has a valuable role in meeting the public transp\nort needs of isolated communities but has constraints. It can be improved by better funding\nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe extent to which isolated communities should be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive services should be determined by communities themselves \ng)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe main challenge to the public transport needs of isolated communities is the need for long-term, consistent revenue funding.\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNorthumberland is a large County, comprising both r\nural and urban communities.  \nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is home to 312,000 people and covers 5013 sq km, of which 96.7% is classified as rural.   49% of the population live in rural areas\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are important contrasts between the three administrative areas of the County as per t\nhe following table\nTable 1 : Characteristics of Northumberland and bus use&#xa0;\nPop’n\nPop’n\n density (people per sq km)\n% of  households with no car*\n&#xa0;\nAnnual  \nbus passenger \nboardings\nAnnual bus passenger \nboardings\n per head of \npop’n\nSouth East \nArea\n&#xa0;\n149,000\n989\n27%\n5.9m\n39\nNorth Area\n&#xa0;\n91,000\n38\n20%\n2.2m\n24\nWest Area\n&#xa0;\n76,000\n31\n15%\n1.1m\n15\nNorthumberland total \n316,000\n62\n21%\n9.2m\n29\n&#xa0;\n*compared to the figure for England &amp; Wales of 44% of households with no car\n&#xa0;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe South East Area is thus much more urbanised and densely populated, has more households with no car and therefore generates more bus use.  Social deprivation is greater than in the other two Areas.    \ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs the Table also shows, the North and West Areas a\nre much more rural.  They contain communities that are as remote as any in England, and car ownership is higher (and bus use lower) than in the South East Area.  Overall, the North and West Areas are more prosperous but this conceals the many pockets of de\nprivation and exclusion made worse by their distance from essential services and facilities thus increasing many daily living costs.\nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAbout 80% of bus services in Northumberland are commercial, i.e. not subsidised.  These run mainly in the South East Area. \n In the West and North Areas, services are much sparser and, apart from some trunk routes, are largely subsidised by Northumberland County Council.\ng)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNorthumberland County Council (NCC) is responding to this Inquiry as it wishes to contribute to the debate o\nn public transport provision for isolated communities, because it contains many such communities in both rural and urban areas.  NCC’s “Sustainable Communities Strategy”\n1 \nhas the following “Big Partnership Issues”\n•\n&#xa0;\nMaking climate change work to our advant\nage\n•\n&#xa0;\nMaintaining and creating sustainable communities\n•\n&#xa0;\nRebalancing our economy\n•\n&#xa0;\nGiving everyone a voice and influence\n•\n&#xa0;\nProviding healthy lifestyle choices\n•\n&#xa0;\nSupporting our young people into adulthood\n•\n&#xa0;\nDelivering services differently\n&#xa0;\nDelivering all of\n these depends heavily on making sure that none of the County’s communities, whether urban or rural\n,\n experience isolation and exclusion.\n&#xa0;\nh)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNCC’s experience is that factors causing isolation differ between urban and rural communities as follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNCC \nidentifies demand for passenger transport in isolated communities mainly in a reactive manner by analysing the demand for those services which already exist, be they commercial or subsidised.  Where commercial services are scheduled for withdrawal or curta\nilment, or where subsidised services have to be reviewed due to budget constraints or retendering, NCC bases its decisions on the basis of value for money for the subsidy required (see answer to Q5 below).  We do not proactively attempt to identify demand \nfor new services which do not already exist, or set criteria for service levels based on, for example, car ownership or population, because we do not have the resources to introduce new services in this way.\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNCC cannot comment on how Central Government \nidentifies demand for passenger transport in isolated communities.  This responsibility appears to be left to bus operators and Local Transport Authorities (LTAs)\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClearly, commercial bus operators base their decisions solely on commercial criteria i.e. whether a bus service is profitable, rather\n than the needs of passengers\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLike most LTAs, NCC’s ability to take into account the needs of different groups of passengers is severely limited by budget considerations.  That part of our public transport budget that goes towards funding subsidised servic\nes in urban areas does not allow for provision greater than that based on the “400metre walking distance” rule-of-thumb described earlier.  \nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn order to provide services that offer value for money, “need” has to be expressed in terms of sufficient passenge\nr usage to justify expenditure.  Many communities express views along the lines of “this village needs a bus service” or “young people need a bus to take them into town in the evening” but without evidence of demand services cannot be provided.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNCC does, h\nowever, recognise the additional cost of running services to rural communities by having different value for money criteria for subsidising bus services as follows, on the basis that rural services will be longer than urban ones\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNCC wishes to answer the first part of this question separately for isolated \nurban\n communities and for isolated \nrural\n communities and then to answer the second part of the question for all communities.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor isolated \nurban\n communities the challenges are:\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n For isolated \nrural \nc\nommunities the challenges are:\n&#xa0;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese challenges can only be effectively overcome by allocating significant additional amounts of revenue subsidy to services.  No bus operator can be expected to run unprofitable services, while LTA budgets are already tightly s\nqueezed.  Recent changes to BSOG have further damaged the cost/income ratio of many bus services.  Past initiatives such as Rural and Urban Bus Challenge consisted only of short-term funding.  While NCC appreciates the pressure on Central Government financ\nes, it feels constrained to point out that if services to isolated communities are to be improved, there is a cost attached.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunity Transport (CT) plays a valuable role in providing transport to isolated communities (rural and urban) through\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, these advantage\ns should not be overstated.  Some costs such as fuel are no lower than for the commercial sector and CT schemes, by their very nature, are small-scale locally based organisations who may not have the capacity to take on high-frequency intensive bus service\ns    \nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe question of how can Community Transport be improved should be seen in the context of the fact that CT should be regarded as a means to an end (better passenger transport) not an end in itself.  All providers of passenger transport can be helped t\no provide improved services by consistent, secure long-term revenue funding.\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis may be up to local communities to decide\n.  Experience in Northumberland and elsewhere is very mixed.  Some communities have welcomed demand-responsive services because of their flexibility and perceived better quality and customer care, especially if they are locally-based and have some element \nof community ownership and involvement..  Other communities have rejected such services because they are perceived as “second best” or “charity”, with the need to pre-book, with 24 or 48 hours’ notice, being compared unfavourably with the “turn up and go” \nelement of a fixed route, timetabled bus service which can be accessed spontaneously.  Operation of demand-responsive services under Section 19, so they are only open to registered members, restricts the customer base and highlights the impression of separ\nateness.  Officers who have been involved with demand-responsive transport have also come across public perceptions that they are only for “old” or “disabled” people, particularly if the operators are associated with particular groups of people.  \nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNCC is a\nlso concerned that, unless properly resourced, demand responsive services may not always be able to meet all requests.  It is aware of cases in the County and elsewhere, of demand responsive services that cover a large area where requests for service at si\nmilar times, but from different parts of the operating area, cannot be met simply because the vehicle cannot be in two places at once, even though there are spare seats on the vehicle.  The resources needed to provide sufficient capacity to meet such event\nualities may be such that it is no more expensive to provide a traditional, scheduled fixed route service.\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nmain (indeed the only) challenge is that services to isolated communities have higher costs and lower income than those to communities that are easier to reach, and therefore need funding to close the gap between the two.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf isolated communities are to be \noffered better access to the services and facilities they want and need, i.e. their isolation is to be overcome, then this will require significant amounts of consistent, long-term revenue support.  As has been stated previously in this letter, short-term \nfunding opportunities with heavy emphasis on capital such as the former Rural and Urban Bus Challenge created many new, innovative schemes which often generated sufficient usage for the communities concerned to want them to continue, but did not generate s\nufficient income to cover long-term running costs.  Councils then had to decide whether to use scarce funds to pay for their continuation or allow then to disappear.  \nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome form of revenue-based, long-term financial support would seem to be the solution.  \nPerhaps there could be some form of “Isolated Communities Transport Fund” offering, through a bidding process, revenue funding for, say, five years for schemes that demonstrated effective tackling of rural or urban isolation?    \nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNCC welcomes the publicati\non of the report “Valuing the social impacts of public transport”, published in March 2013 by the Department for Transport.  Space constraints preclude a detailed analysis of this very valuable report, but its publication shortly before the current Inquiry\n is certainly timely.  However, its appearance begs the question that if Government is prepared to commission research that shows the social benefits of public transport\n2\n and in particular the value of public transport to excluded groups\n3 \nand the fact that\n those isolated from public transport cannot enjoy its benefits\n3\n then it should be prepared to back this up with funding that tackles these issues and delivers the resultant benefits shown by the report\n&#xa0;\nReferences\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
