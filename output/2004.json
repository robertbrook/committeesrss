"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Overseas Development Institute &#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe Government should include \nboth international and domestic initiatives\n in its review and measurement of energy subsidies.\n This should include support provided directly by UK departments (DFID, DECC, DEFRA, CDC, and UKEF), through development finance institutions, and other intermediaries.\n1.2.\n&#xa0; \nAs t\nhe\nre is currently no\n \nsingle \nGovernment\n department responsible for reviewing and reporting energy subsidies, the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC)\n should \nidentify a single department or inter-departmental committee to lead in measurement and reporting of UK \ndomestic and international \nsubsidies.\n1.3.\n&#xa0; \nAs a first step the Government should apply the framework suggested to this i\nnquiry \nby \nAlan Simpson\n \nto all\n \ncurrent \ndevelopment finance support to energy projects:\n1.4.\n&#xa0; \nUnder its commitment to \nsupporting low-carbon growth and adaptation in developing countries\n, the Government should\n \nseek to \nidentify \nand quantify \n‘harmful’ subsidies provided in the form of development finance.\n This includes support to fossil fuel energy projects.\n1.5.\n&#xa0; \nIn the context of G20 commitments on phasing out inefficient subsidies, there have been calls to set up an international body on fossil fuel subsidies\n. The UK has the opportunity to lead by example in tracking its own subsidies, and to call for international cooperation in defining, monitoring and tracking inefficient or high carbon subsidies.\n1.6.\n&#xa0; \nWhere ‘harmful’ or inefficient subsidies are identified these should be rationalized, and resources used to promote low carbon energy development both in the UK and internationally. This can include \nsupport\ning\n developing countries with subsidy \nreview and \nreform\n.\n1.7.\n&#xa0; \nAs subsidies have a significant impact on private investment in \nlow carbon energy, this inquiry and its resulting actions should inform the Committee’s parallel i\nnquir\ny\n on \nGreen Finance.\n1.8.\n&#xa0; \nAs subsidies are a significant and growing element of UK development cooperation, this inquiry and its resulting actions should be linked to the current inquiry by the International Development Committee on the Future of UK Development Cooperation.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Overseas Development Institute (ODI) is a leading independent think tank on international development and humanitarian issues. Our mission is to inspire and inform policy and practice which lead to the reduction of poverty, the alleviation of suffering and the achievement of sustainable livelihoods. We do this by combining high-quality applied research, practical policy advice and policy-focused dissemination and debate. We work with partners in the public and private sectors, in both developing and developed countries.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n uses the following definition for energy subsidies:\n&#xa0;\nEnergy subsidies comprise both consumer and producer subsidies. \nConsumer subsidies arise when the prices paid by consumers, including both firms (intermediate consumption) and households (final consumption), are below a benchmark price, while producer subsidies arise when prices received by suppliers are above this benchmark \n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0; \nDevelopment finance and other international support to energy projects in developing countries, impacts both prices paid by consumers and \nrevenues\n received by suppliers in those countries.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0; \nThe submission \nto this i\nnquiry by HM Treasury and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)\n, did \nnot include any reference to the UK’s support to energy projects in developing countries. \nI understand that \nthe Department for International Development \nand \nUK Export Finance \nare to provide separate \nsubmissions.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n&#xa0; \nThough not considered explicitly within the inquiry’s questions, or in the report prepared for this inquiry by Oxford Energy Associates\n, the\n role of development finance in energy su\nbsidies was raised:\n3.4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n by Zac Goldsmith during the oral evidence\n provide\nd\n by William Blyth\n, \n3.4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nd\nuring the oral evidence\n that I provided along\n with \nPeter Wooders of the Global Subsidies Initiative (GSI) and Charles Perry of SecondNature\n,\n3.4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nby Platform in its written submission\n.\n&#xa0;\nAs it applies to development finance, the Government does not appear to match up to best practice methodologies in how energy subsidies are defined and scoped.&#xa0;4.1.\n&#xa0; \nAs noted, the \nsubmission by HM Treasury and the Department for Energy and\n Climate Change (DECC) to this i\nnquiry\n, did not include the UK’s support \nfor\n energy projects in developing countries. \n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0; \nHowever, the Department for International Development (DFID), the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), UK Export Finance (UKEF), and CDC (the UK’s development finance institution) currently \nprovide financial and technical \nsupport \nfor \nenergy \nsector activities \nin developing countries. \n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0; \nThese Government departments (and investors of UK tax revenues) provide support to energy projects either directly or through Development Finance Institutions (DFIs). \nThere is a need to strengthen reporting systems, to allow a better understanding of whether this support results in \n ‘harmful’ or ‘inefficient’ subsidies.\n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0; \nEstimates of fossil fuel support from International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and National Development Banks (NDBs) range from $15 to $150 billion annually.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n&#xa0; \nExport Credit Agencies (ECAs) are bilateral organisations that provide financial services to support the overseas trade and investment activities of private domestic companies. While exact figures on ECA support for fossil-fuel projects are difficult to obtain, ECA financing often dwarfs official development assistance and, historically, a large portion of projects have been fossil-fuel related. International estimates of fossil fuel support from ECA’s ranges from $50 to $100 billion annually.\n As with IFIs, it is unlikely that all of this financing actually qualifies as a subsidy, but again, lack of disclosure prevents a more thorough analysis.\n&#xa0;\n4.6.\n&#xa0; \nAn ODI review of \nOil Change International’s ‘Shift the Subsidies’ database identified\n \nthat between 2008 and 2011 the majority\n of IFI\n energy project support was to fossil fuel projects. Over 75% of energy project support\n from IFIs\n to \nIndia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Brazil, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Egypt, Venezuela, Uzbekistan, Algeria, and Nigeria \nwas to fossil fuel projects. These are 12 of the top developing country emitters. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0; \nA basic analysis by ODI of UK finance\n to energy projects through IFIs\n identified \nmore than\n USD 3 \nbillion (or GBP 2 billion) in support\n between 2008 and 2011. Support to fossil fuel projects\n \nthrough IFIs \nwas \ntwice as large as support for \nclean energy projects\n.\n \n  \n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0; \nA\nn initial\n review by ODI of UKEF support indicates a wide range of support to energy projects, and energy intensive industries and sectors in developing countries:\n&#xa0;\nIn June 2013 - UK Export Finance announced that it will guarantee $700 million of finance for UK exports to a petrochemical facility in Saudi Arabia.\n \n&#xa0;\nIn November 2011 -UK Export Finance is guaranteeing a $1 billion line of credit for Petroleo Brasileiro Sociedade Anonima (Petrobras) to finance UK exports for Petrobras’ investment programme. The line of credit is to expand Petrobras’ oil exploration and production facilities off the east coast of Brazil.\n \n&#xa0;\n2011-12 UKEF\n \n issued guarantees for civil aerospace business amounting to £1,832\n&#xa0;\nmillion (out of £2.3 billion), generating premium of £65.6 million and supporting the delivery of\n&#xa0;\n132 aircraft in total. The aircraft were delivered to 32 airlines and operating lessors. Where the aircraft were fitted with aero-engines supplied by Rolls-Royce, ECGD support exceeded 30 per cent of the financing cost of the aircraft. \n&#xa0;\nThe most important markets for UKEF were Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Brazil, Dubai, New Zealand, Norway, Russia and Saudi Arabia. The export contracts supported were for a diverse range of sectors including mining, flight simulators, packaging, wall coverings, petrochemical engineering, logistics, automotive supplies, clean air equipment, cardboard packaging plant, buses, natural gas delivery systems, remote operating vehicles, plasma furnaces, air traffic control equipment, construction, automated tolling, telecommunications, defence vehicles, training services, industrial catalysts, water treatment plant, steel manufacture and processing and pipe manufacturing.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0; \nInformation on support \nby\n CDC\n \nand other Government d\nepartments \nfor energy projects \nis not \ndisclosed in a transparent manner (even taking into considerations of commercial confidentiality)\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe Government currently states that it does not provide ‘harmful’ subsidies. Therefore it is impossible to assess if the Government has plans or targets to reduce or eliminate ‘harmful’ subsidies; nor its progress in reducing such ‘harmful’ subsidies. However, the Government has a commitment to supporting low-carbon growth and adaptation in developing countries, under which the Government should seek to identify and eliminate ‘harmful’ subsidies provided in the form of development finance. This includes support to fossil fuel energy projects.&#xa0;\n6.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe submission by HM Treasury and the Department for Energy and \nClimate Change (DECC) to this i\nnquiry\n, states that the UK does not have any ‘harmful’ energy policies, but does not address the \nbroader \nquestion of ‘harmful’ subsidies. \n&#xa0;\nThe Government does not consider that any of its energy policies are ‘harmful’. Furthermore, energy policy (as with other Government policy) is subject to an initial impact assessment and subsequent monitoring, evaluation and review. This ensures that the Government can provide confidence and certainty while ensuring that the policy advances the Government’s objectives in a coherent way that provides best value for money. It also ensures that detrimental consequences can be quickly and effectively addressed.\n&#xa0;\n6.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe HM Trea\nsury / DECC submission to this i\nnquiry\n defines fossil fuel subsidies as follows:\n&#xa0;\nFor the purposes of G20 work on inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, the UK, along with other EU G20 members, defines a fossil fuel subsidy as any Government measure or programme with the objective or direct consequence of reducing, below world-market prices, including all costs of transport, refining and distribution, the effective cost of fossil fuels paid by final consumers, or of reducing the costs or increasing the revenues of fossil-fuel producing companies.\n&#xa0;\n6.3.\n&#xa0; \nThe UK’s 2012 submission\n to the G-20 on the Commitment to Rationalize and Phase Out Inefficient Fossil Fuel Subsidies\n states that the ‘\nUK has no inefficient fossil subsidies\n’\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.4.\n&#xa0; \nHowever, a\n basic review by ODI of IMF data\n on energy subsidies in the G20 countries indicated that the UK \nranked\n 14\nth\n \n(out of 20) \nin terms of \nthe scale of its\n support for fossil fuels (including petroleum pro\nducts, natural gas, and coal). This was e\nquivalent to almost USD 11 billion\n (GBP 7 billion)\n in \n2011. The IMF does not indicate if these subsidies are inefficient or ‘harmful’, however, \nits calculations of \nUK energy subsidies \ntakes into account\n inadequate pricing of externalities, including carbon.\n&#xa0;\n6.5.\n&#xa0; \nWhile the Government does not have targets to track or reduce ‘harmful’ subsidies either provided through \nOfficial\n Development Assistance (ODA) or other forms of development finance,\n i\nnternational support for high carbon technologies and approaches may not be consistent with the Government’s \nclear \nobjective to support low carbon climate resilient development.\n&#xa0;\nFrom HM Treasury’s Spending Round 2013\n: \nThe Government will maintain its effort on urgent action to tackle climate change by supporting low-carbon growth and adaptation in developing countries. The UK’s pool of money for climate change projects in developing countries will be increased to £969 million, funded by DFID, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)\n&#xa0;\nThe Government remains committed to supporting those people across the world whose economies are most in need of development. This is in the UK’s national interest. Tackling global issues such as economic development, effective governance, climate change, conflict and fragile states provides good value for money. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;13 September 2013&#xa0;\n6\n&#xa0;\n http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/WrittenEvidence.svc/EvidencePdf/1048\n http://www.iisd.org/gsi/sites/default/files/g20lib_oilchange_2012_phasingoutffs.pdf\n http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/8335.pdf\n http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environmental-audit-committee/inquiries/parliament-2010/green-finance/\n http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/international-development-committee/news/new-inquiry-the-future-of-uk-development-/\n http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/012813.pdf\n http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/WrittenEvidence.svc/EvidencePdf/1114\n \nhttp://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/WrittenEvidence.svc/EvidencePdf/700\n http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmenvaud/c1089-i/c108901.htm\n http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmenvaud/c61-i/c6101.htm\n http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/WrittenEvidence.svc/EvidencePdf/1038\n http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/WrittenEvidence.svc/EvidencePdf/1114\n http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/6760-uks-private-climate-finance-support-mobilising-private-sector-engagement-climate-\ncompatible-development\n http://www.boell.org/downloads/LowHangingfruit.pdf\n http://www.boell.org/downloads/LowHangingfruit.pdf\n http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/8335.pdf\n Including the WB Group, AfDB, ADB, IADB, and EBRD.\n Based on capital subscriptions\n Including the WB Group, AfDB, ADB, IADB, and EBRD.\n Fossil fuel projects include: Oil, Oil &amp; Gas, Natural Gas, Coal, and T&amp;D Fossil\n \nClean energy projects include: Solar, Wind, Demand Side EE, Geothermal, RE General, T&amp;D-Efficiency, T&amp;D-Clean, Policy Loan-Clean, Hydro Small, Efficiency General, and Clean-Financing.\n http://shiftthesubsidies.org/\n https://www.gov.uk/government/news/massive-boost-to-british-industry-in-biggest-ever-petrochemical-project\n https://www.gov.uk/government/news/business-gets-1-billion-uk-government-support-for-exports-to-brazil\n https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/annual-report-and-accounts-2011-to-2012--7\n \nhttp://www.odi.org.uk/publications/6760-uks-private-climate-finance-support-mobilising-private-sector-engagement-climate-compatible-development\n http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/WrittenEvidence.svc/EvidencePdf/1114\n http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/WrittenEvidence.svc/EvidencePdf/1114\n \nhttp://www.g20mexico.org/images/stories/canalfinan/deliverables/energy_markets/Fossil_Fuel_Subsidies.pdf\n http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/012813.pdf\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/209036/spending-round-2013-complete.pdf\n"
