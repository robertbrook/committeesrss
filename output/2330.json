"WWC00051\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) \nrepresents \nover 17,000 heads, principals, deputies, vice-principals, \nassistant heads, business managers and other senior staff of maintained and independent schools and colleges throughout the UK. ASCL has members in more than 90 per cent of secondary schools and colleges of all types, responsible for the education of more \nthan four million young people. This places the association in a unique position to consider this issue from the viewpoint of the leaders of secondary schools and of colleges.\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nASCL welcomes this inquiry and is pleased to contribute, though the time allowed\n for assembling the evidence, coinciding as it did with the summer vacation period, has meant that there has been little chance to discuss it with representative school and college leaders.\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are a few points that ASCL would wish to make, however, whic\nh can be summarised as:\n&#xa0;\n4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe most recent GCSE figures\n from the Department for Education (DfE)\n show that in 2012-12 30.5% of White British pupils on free school meals (FSM) achieved 5 A*-C gr\nades. The equivalent figure \nfor White\n British pupils not on free school meals was 62.7%. This shows clearly the effect of relative poverty.\n5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe effect was less marked in other ethnic groups. The proportions of pupils on FSM achieving 5 A*-C were: \n51.8% \nof \nAsian pupils, 45.6% of Black pupi\nls and 67.2% of Chinese pupils\n. It appears that t\nhe attainment of \nwhite students\n is polarised by social cl\nass to a greater extent than\n other ethnic groups\n, with those from w\nhite working class homes \nbeing \nthe lowest attaini\nng group.\n6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe low achievement levels of many white working class children has been masked by the success of middle class white children in the English school system\n, with analysis concentrating on ethnicity and taking insufficient account of \nsocial \nbackground\n and poverty.\n7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe situation has not improved in recent years, with a general increase in success not helping to close the gap between middle and working class children. Arguably the gap has widened. \n8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe effect may be due in part to factors o\nth\ner than\n the pove\nrty of families\n, as white working class pupils are more likely to live in disadvantaged neighbourhoo\nds with high levels of poverty.\n This is likely reinforce negative feeling and pressures.\n&#xa0;\n9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChildren spend only \na small proportion\n of their time in schools, and patterns of behaviour and expectation are \nto a large extent \nset before they \nbegin to attend school. Parental factors such as low literacy levels, feelings of marginalisation, poor engagem\nent with the community, \nlow aspirations of their children’s education\n, poor housing\n and social deprivation\n all strongly affect a child’s chance of success\n.\n \n10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA study commissioned by the Department for Education found that a wide range of “stress factors” i\nn the home resulted in a sharp dip in pupil performance at school.\n These included parental \ndivorce or constant arguing among mothers and\n fathers after the age of seven, \nhaving large numbers of brothers and sisters, parents with poor literacy skills and bei\nng frequently disciplined in the home\n.\n \n11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese factors are not limited to working class families of course, but they are correlated with low income. P\noverty \ncertainly \nplay\ns\n a major role in the underachievement of white working class pupils. Low incomes, be\nnefits and the pressure of not having any money \nundermine \nthe stability of family life. \nSchools report higher incidences of \nlow self esteem, \ndrug and alcohol abuse, poor \nmental health, safeguarding issues, learning difficulties, exclusion, prison, a lack o\nf parenting skills in families \nin socially deprived areas and caught in poverty\n.\n \nSuch middle-class ‘givens’ as \nregular bedtimes and family meals\n are clearly less likely, less possible, in such families\n.\n12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nS\nchools \nreport\n that white working class families \nare\n often \nthe hardest \ndraw into \nthe life of the school and to engage \nwith \ntheir children’s learning. \nThere is clearly a need for central government to provide \nstrong leadership in addressing issues of poverty and under-achievement\n, which has been felt to be \nabsent in recent years under government of all parties.\n&#xa0;\n13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA case study of schools in Lambeth\n found that \n‘\nthe headteachers interviewed:\n14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLikewise colleges often pride themselves on being able to help wo\nrking class students, who have perhaps reached a level of maturity that is enabling them to break away from a culture of low aspiration, onto a path to success. Many FE and sixth form colleges reach out specifically to such students explicitly to give a se\ncond chance.\n15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCircumstances differ markedly from place to place, and depending upon the social mix at the particular school\n or college\n. The situation for a white working class pupil in a school with predominantly of middle class pupils presents different ch\nallenges from that of working class pupils in a school drawing predominantly from their geographical and social area. It is important that schools are able to decide at their local level what approaches to take, tailoring them to their particular environme\nnt and priorities.\n&#xa0;\n16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs noted above young people spend relatively little of their time in education, and are strongly affected by \nthe \nhome and peer group\ns\n that surround them.\n17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe problems \nset ou\nt in paragraphs 9 to 12 above show how difficult it would\n be for schools \nand colleges \nto \nmake much progress in this area by themselves\n;\n wider intervention is needed.\n18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince 1976, when \nArnold Weinstock, managing director of the General Electric Company,\n&#xa0;\nwrot\ne a letter in the Times Education Supplement \nblaming\n teachers\n&#xa0;\nfor not preparing pupils for employment\n, there has been a tendency to assume that wider failings in society can be blamed on (and therefore potentially solved by) educ\nation. In this case the eff\nect wa\ns to suggest that unemployment is due to poor preparation for the workplace, rather than on there being too few jobs. \n19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAddressing white working class under achievement by setting new targets to schools and colleges, or altering the range and governan\nce of such institutions, or interfering with the curriculum or the qualification system, is to try to treat the symptom rather than the disease. There is a need to address more fundamental issues of inequality, and to intervene at an earlier stage in a chi\nld’s development to encourage and support \nparents to value their children's education\n.\n20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe education system, though it is part o\nf the solution to society’s\n failings, cannot correct them by itself.\n&#xa0;\n21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a feeling in schools, supported by some local studies\n that \nWhite pupils\n’\n achievement \nhas fallen in recent years while\n the \nfocus has been on other groups.\n22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile the real problems of this large group should clearly be addressed\n there is a danger that other groups will then fall back in turn. It is important to accept the point made in paragraph 15 above that it should be up to individual schools and colleges to decide how to strike a balance in their particular area.\n23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTeachers, a\nnd their leaders, want all their students to succeed, and are best placed to decide how to help them to do so.\n&#xa0;\n24\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is an issue well worth consideration, but it \nis complex and difficult. It requires very careful thought before rushing to judgem\nent about what are the true causes of the problem and what should be done to address it.\n25\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBut we can conclude that changes in the education service, though some could be made to good effect, will do far less to improve the situation than changes elsewhere i\nn society\n. In particular the very wide and widening gap between the wealth of the most and least affluent members of our society is very damaging in this respect.\n&#xa0;\n26\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI hope that this is of value to your consultation, ASCL is willing to be further consulted a\nnd to assist in any way that it can.\n&#xa0;\n September 2013\nReferencesDemie, F &amp; Lewis, K, (2011), ‘White Working Class \nAchievement: An Ethnographic Study of Barriers to Learning in Schools’.
