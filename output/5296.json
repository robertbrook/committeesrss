"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Greater Manchester Police (CYS0123)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe initially hold a\nn interactive\n walk through presentation that\n involves a bus and a HGV, which are there to illustrate the dangers of blind spots on these vehicles. We have a their respective driving trainers there to explain \nhow little can be seen from the vehicles and the other issues they have to deal with whilst they’re driving. People are encouraged to sit in the cabs and view it from the drivers\n’\n perspective.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOn th\ne back of that we have devised \na system to deal \nwith cyclists committing offences by issuing Traffic Offence Reports (currently £50 for cycling offences) then rescinding them when they attend a road safety presentation ran by ourselves and Drivesafe\n. T\nhis is means the cyclist pays NO\n fine\n,\n but we feel t\nhat issuing the TOR is the only way to get the cyclists to attend\n the presentations\n to find out the dangers they are putting themselves in, also to receive information about free \ncycle \ntraining that is provided by a\n trainer from Transport for Greater Manch\nester\n.  We are able to deliver this free of charge as \nwe use the community rooms at a local firestation which are fr\nee, Special Constables who find it a useful experience in dealing with people, issuing TOR’s, using PNC also stopping traffic.\n Any drivers \nthat are seen committing offences are deal\nt\n with by issuing a TOR so they can attend the relevant driver improvement\n scheme at a cost to themselves which currently are £79.50 or £89.00 depending\n on the course that they attend\n,\n if there is no scheme available for the offence the relevant points and fine stand. Only one driver improvement scheme can be attended for each offence in any one 3 year period.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe have run five phases of enforcement, four of them on Oxford and Wilmslo\nw Road and one in Bolton.\n&#xa0;\nPhase 1:  8/11/12/20 February \n2013\n (Oxford and Wilmslow Road)\n&#xa0;\n95 fail to stop red traffic lights\n35 no lights fitted/illuminated\n12 cycling on the footpath\n&#xa0;\nTo\ntal 142  \n \n&#xa0;\nPhase 2: 22/23/24 April 2013\n (Oxford and Wilmslow Road)\n&#xa0;\n119 fail to stop red traffic lights\n12 no lights fitted/illuminated\n18 cycling on the footpath\n1 contravening PCSO\n1 summons for careless and inconsiderate cycling \n&#xa0;\nTotal 151\n&#xa0;\nPhase 3\n:\n 17/18/19 June 2013\n(Oxford and Wilmslow Road)\n&#xa0;\n100 fail to stop red \ntraffic lights\n18 cycling on the footpath\n4 summons for careless and inconsiderate cycling\n&#xa0;\nTotal 122\nGrand total 415\nFrom the these three phases 347 cyclists attended the presentations\n&#xa0;\nPhase 4: 16/17 August (Bolton Victoria Square)\n&#xa0;\n38 cycling on \nfootpath/pedestrianised area\n&#xa0;\nTotal 38\n26 atten\nded the presentation\n&#xa0;\nPhase 5:  9/10 September 2013 (Oxford and Wilmslow Road)\n&#xa0;\n64 fail to stop red traffic lights\n19 cycling on the footpath\n&#xa0;\nTotal \n8\n3\n71 attended the presentation\n&#xa0;\nDuring the same periods we \nalso dealt with motorists committing offences\n&#xa0;\n4 vehicles seized for no insurance\n1 £200 fixed penalty for no insurance\n1 summons no driving licence\n5 vehicles warned under section 59 police reform act\n1 vehicle seized under section 59 police reform act\n15\n traffic offence reports (TOR) mobile phones\n3 TOR for stopping pedestrian crossing\n2 TOR contravene red traffic light\n3 TOR contravene no entry sign\n1 TOR contravene keep left bollard\n1 TOR glass not prescribed\n2 TOR defective tyres\n1\n5\n TOR\n fail to wear\n se\natbelt\n1 TOR defective lights\n2 summons for defective tyres\n6 fixed penalties for unnecessary obstruction\n17 summons for speeding\n1 TOR carry person in a dangerous manner\n2 cannabis street warning\n&#xa0;\nThe final figures so far from approximately 42 hours of \nenforcement over a 7 month period are:\n546 cyclists\n \n \n93 motorists\n12 cyclists have committed the same offence again and have been issued with another TOR which will have to\n be\n paid as only one presentation can be attended.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe presentations that we run \nare constantly evolving as we receive feedback from each one and try and tailor them accordingly, we have h\nad some very positive feedback \nwith a lot of people going away saying that they will consider their\n actions more now.\n Steve\n Owens\n the cycle trainer \nplays an integral part in the presentations offering advice on the varying scenarios that we show as part of the power point, giving examples of his experiences as a cyclist and ways of dealing with situations that cyclists find themselves in. At the end w\ne tell people about the free cycle training what it entails and how it can be tailored for individuals.\n&#xa0;\nWe have done all this to encourage safer cycling, push the free training and give advice to cyclist\ns\n that have had little or \nno training, 96% of the pe\nople \nthat attend the presentations have had no cycle training many of these being non drivers as well. We have also found that a lot of the cyclists we stop are international and have little or no idea of road traffic law in this country.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
