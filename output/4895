default&#xa0;
defaultQ136default              defaultChair:default Good morning
default,
default everyone.  To our witnesses, may I welcome you to this session on crime statistics?  We have a number of questions to get through; we will try to ask short questions, and if you can give us short answers it would help us enormously.  If you are going on a bit too long
default,
default I hope you will not mind if I pull you up or try to get you to focus on the question that is being asked.  Could I first of all ask you to identify yourselves for the record, please?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default My name is Stephen Shute.  I am Professor of Criminal Law and Criminal Justice at the 
defaultUniversity
default of 
defaultSussex
default, where I also head up the 
defaultSchool
default of 
defaultLaw
default, Politics and Sociology.  I am Chair of the Crime Statistics Advisory Committee and appear in that capacity.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default My name is Mike Hough.  I am Professor of Criminal Policy at 
defaultBirkbeck
default and 
defaulta member of CSAC
default,
default and I have had long association with the British Crime Survey, crime counting and police research.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ137default              defaultChair:default You will be aware of our previous evidence session.  I particularly want to start
default by
default asking what academic and independent analysis CSAC can show about the extent of 
defaultmisrecording
default of crime data.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default Perhaps I could start by addressing that question.  We rely on the work of others, in the sense that we do not commission academic work directly.  We have to rely on the body of academic work that has been done by others, although we work closely with Her 
defaultMajesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, and, indeed, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary is a member of the committee.  One of our functions is to advise HMIC on how it does its work in relation to crime data integrity.  We receive reports from them on the inspections they have done and plan to carry out in this area, and offer input into that inspection process.  Indeed, one of our members has been nominated to sit on the external reference group for the latest planned inspection of crime data integrity that will be run by HMIC next year.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ138default              defaultChair:default What is your opinion o
defaultf
default the extent of the 
defaultmisrecording
default of police recorded crime?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default It is hard to measure the extent.  
defaultMisrecording
default of crime can come about for a number of reasons.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ139default              defaultChair:default Can you just answer the question?  What is your view about the extent?  However hard it is to measure, what judgment do you arrive at
default,
default on the basis of, I accept, relatively limited information?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default We have no really hard evidence.  We have seen a divergence between the two measures of crime: police reported crime and the Crime Survey for 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default.  That might allow one to draw some assumptions about what the level of 
defaultmisrecording
default of crime might be.  We have the inspections that HMIC has done of 
defaultKent
default and we have the inspections that the Audit Commission did some years ago about 
defaultmisrecording
default.  One could assume that one will never be able to reach the point where you get 100% of crime recorded, but there are indications from HMIC that using the methodology that they use—which does not capture all crime incidents that come to a police force; it captures those that come into control rooms—in many forces we are getting 80% or 90% of crimes that are reported to police within the Home Office 
defaultcounting rules
default being recorded appropriately by the police.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default I think we know quite a lot about the extent of under-recording, which is slightly different from 
defaultmisrecording
default.  If you take a view on long-term trends, in the 1980s and 1990s
default,
default around about 50% or 60% of reported crimes found their way into police statistics.  Then with the introduction of the changes at the end of
default the
default 1990s and early 2000s
default, 
defaultthat was pushed up to 90%—90% of reported crimes got into police statistics.  From 2007 or 2008 onwards, that proportion has been falling, so now about 70% of reported crimes end up in police statistics.  Clearly the shortfall is made up partly of 
defaultmisrecording
default, 
defaultcases 
defaultwhere there is
default a
default wilful breach of rules, partly misunderstanding and partly use of discretion.  We do not know the balance of the sources of under-reporting, but we know the overall shape of what has happened over the last 25 years.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ140 default              defaultChair:default I think you have answered my follow-up, which was
default:
default what is the difference between under-recording and 
defaultmisrecording
default?  One is wilful and one is use of discretion or mistakes.  We are interested in the relationship between 
defaultmisrecording
default and under
default&#x2011;
defaultrecording
default.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default It is really hard to answer that
default,
default because it really ends up being a question of interpretation of intention.  It is whether somebody knew about the rules and wilfully broke them
default,
default did not understand the rules, or was making what they thought was a fair judgment.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ141default              defaultChair:default How much confidence do you have in the general intention of police officers to record crime accurately?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default I think that the proportion 
defaultof 
defaultwilful breaking of 
defaultthe 
defaultrules is probably quite small.  I have no evidence to prove that.  I found some of th
defaulte earlier evidence about clear
default rule-breaking behaviour worrisome.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ142default              defaultChair:default Your methodology would not actually pick that up; I am asking a question outside the scope of your expertise.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default If you put the Crime Survey against the recorded crime statistics
default, 
defaultyou cannot get the answers to that question.  You are right.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default Neither have the inspections that have been conducted to date been able to quantify the level of dishonest manipulation of the recording process by police officers and police forces around the country.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ143default              defaultChair:default Can you describe how CSAC has actually contributed to an improvement of this situation?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default Part of our brief obviously is to help to underpin public confidence in crime data and the integrity of crime data.  The main way that we have done that thus far is, as I have indicated earlier, by working with HMIC in helping to advise on the methodology that it might use, in suggesting that there ought to be systematic, regular programmes of external audit and scrutiny of what forces do, and that HMIC is the right body to do that—there is no other body that is able to perform that function—and to ensure that the methodology that they propose for future inspection is robust and fit for purpose.  That is the way that the 
defaultc
defaultommittee seeks to underpin that process.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default One of the key things we did, starting two years ago, was to shine some light on the divergence between the BCS/CSEW trend and the recorded crime stats.  We have been trying to think how one might explain that over the last two years in discussion with HMIC and ONS.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default You may have had access to the methodological note that was published by ONS.  If you do not
default,
default I would be happy to provide the Committee with a copy.  It analyses the variations in crime trends by studying comparable crime categories between the Crime Survey for 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default and police recorded crime.  
defaultIt contains a foreword from the Chair of the Crime Statistics Advisory Committee.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ144default              defaultChair:default How fair is it to say that you are interested in process, methodology and measurement
default,
default and you are not really qualified to judge about the leadership, the application of ethical practices, training of officers and that sort of thing?  How fair is it to say you are not really qualified to judge on how much that part of the picture is distorting the statistics?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default We are able to comment on some of the things that you just mentioned.  We are in a position to comment on governance structures that surround the collection and presentation of crime statistics.  For example, if it appeared to us that there was inappropriate leadership in forces and that the wrong messages were being transmitted to police officers by Chief Constables and their senior teams about the significance of crime data and why it matters that it is reliable and robust, that would be an issue for us.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ145default              defaultChair:default Can I ask you that question, then?  What do you see that causes you concern
default,
default in terms of the messages sent by leadership, governance or even Police and Crime Commissioners?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default We have seen a number of things.  We have seen the evidence that has been given to this Committee.  We have seen the reports that have come out from HMIC.  We have seen, for example, suggestions that the recording of crime by police is more robust where Force Crime Registrars are working efficiently and able to provide independent advice.  
default              defaultChair:default I am going to stop you there
default,
default because we are going to come on to that.  Do you have anything else to add, Professor Hough?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default The impact of numerical targets on police statistics is on the borders of our remit, but 
defaultit is 
defaultimportant.  Numerical targets have had a marked effect on the way that crimes are recorded.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ146default              defaultPriti Patel:default I would just like to build upon the previous question the Chair put to you both.  How has CSAC helped improve police recorded crime data at a local level?  Effectively, what would that mean to local police forces and to members of the public who obviously use crime data to benchmark their own views on what is going on in their communities
default,
default in terms of policing and crime?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default We can only really operate at arm’s length and look at the governance structures that affect local crime recording.  Stephen has talked about HMIC
default,
default and then there is the Force Crime Registrars and their relationship to the Home Office and so on.  We can only really intervene at that level to make governance tighter.  We do not have larger, more direct levers.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ147default              defaultPriti Patel:default What are those points of intervention?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default We can advise about HMIC’s inspections; we can advise about the role of Force Crime Registrars; we can talk about their relationship to the centre, whether that is the Home Office or ONS.  Things of that sort fall within our remit
default in terms of 
defaultoffer
defaulting
default advice, but we do not have an executive function.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default That is right: we do not have an executive function.  We have done a number of things to try to bolster confidence in crime data.  We can analyse trends and we can look to see if those disclose worrying aspects of the current system.  There are some concerns that come out of those trends.  We have just described the divergences between the two crime series.  We can offer advice on the way that crime data is presented
default—and 
defaulthave done
default—
defaultand the classifications that are used to sub-divide the 1,400 
defaultnotifiable
default offences into manageable categories.  We can and have offered advice on how the data ought to be 
defaultpresented in a way that is comprehensible to users and to the public more generally, and we have done.  For example, we have suggested that high-volume types of crime
default,
default such as shoplifting and bicycle theft
default,
default be extracted from larger categories and identified separately.  Similarly, we suggested that rape ought to be identified separately from the category of sexual offences
default,
default so that one can more immediately focus on that.  There are a number of things we can do, but there are obviously limitations on what we can do.  We are an advice body; we have a set of terms of reference that set out those bodies that we advise
default—
defaultin effect the producers of crime statistics
default, such as 
defaultthe Home Office and ONS
default, 
defaultand the inspectors and auditors, HMIC.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ148default              defaultKelvin Hopkins:default You have suggested the manipulation of statistics by police forces is not great, and yet in a previous session
default,
default we heard that this was much more significant than you have suggested, particularly in the Met.  That is one point
default for you to 
defaultcomment on.  The other point is that with HMIC
default,
default the Kent Police Commissioner had asked for a report on her police force and had a specific report done.  A previous report by the same 
defaultorganisation
default nationally has shown quite different results for Kent.  Doing an intensive survey
default,
default they found quite different reports than they had previously.  Is HMIC the right 
defaultorganisation
default?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default There are two parts to that question
default; 
defaultif I
default may, I
default 
defaultwill take 
defaultthem separately.  There is the question about the extent to which the police are manipulating the crime recording process, either to conform to externally
default 
defaultimposed performance targets or to improve the way that they are perceived in the locality or within the force.  That may come about through a variety of reasons.  It may not solely be down to dishonest, deliberate and intentional misapplication of the 
defaultcounting rules
default by police officers.  That may be part of it, but it may occur through other routes.  It may be that the police officers do not fully understand the Home Office 
defaultcounting rules
default and therefore misapply them.  They have not done that dishonestly; they just do not understand and do not have the skill to apply— 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ149default              defaultKelvin Hopkins:default We had specific techniques of manipulating results described to us.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default Yes.  Not all of them were necessarily the product of dishonesty.  Some of them might be used dishonestly, but some of them might arise from non
default&#x2011;
defaultdishonest
default misapplication of the rules, even within the techniques that have been described to you.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default We do not have a sight line on the quantum of dishonesty versus other, but both exist
default,
default and I would not dispute that for a moment.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default We know that some police officers are prosecuted successfully for failing to perform their duties appropriately in this area.  The question is what exactly the level of that is.  For the minute, that is something that we do not have a hard measure for.  
defaultYou asked about HMIC and whether we think that 
defaultit is 
defaultan appropriate external scrutiny body for crime data integrity and the process of recording crime statistics by the police. There are always legitimate questions to ask about what the regime for external scrutiny and audit ought to be, and who is the most appropriate body.  Of course, in this area we have had two external scrutiny bodies at work: the Audit Commission, which carried out that function for about four years, and now HMIC.  It is fair to say that HMIC was slow to step into the gap created by the cessation of Audit Commission work in 2006-
default0
default7.  We had to wait until 2009 
defaultbefore we had the first HMIC report
default,
default and we have only had two significant published reports. There is more that HMIC can do in this area, and my committee is encouraging HMIC to do more, as I indicated in my response to the Chair’s question on this.  
defaultIf you do not have HMIC doing this work, it is hard to think who else would do it.  The Audit Commission is no more.  You need an inspectorate that has standing, has authority and understands the area that they are looking at.  They have to have the appropriate skill
default 
defaultset
default, 
defaultbecause otherwise they will not be able to get to the bottom of the matter and uncover what is really going on.  You have an inspectorate now that is led, for the first time in its history, by a Chief Inspector who has not come from a police background
default; t
defaulthat is the first time 
defaultthat has happened 
defaultsince Chief Inspectors were created within HMIC.  That should give the inspectorate more distance, perspective and independence as a result.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default I thought the 
defaultKent
default report was actually a pretty tough report.  If I were Kent Police receiving that
default,
default I would think
default,
default 
default“
defaultThis is a hard report with difficult messages.
default”
default  It made me feel confident about HMIC’s ability to do that work.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ150default              defaultAlun Cairns:default Professor Shute, specifically why do you think that the police appear to be recording a lower proportion of crime reported to them than previously?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default It depends what you mean by “than previously”.  It is worth pointing out that concerns about the 
defaultmisrecording
default of crime by the police have been around since the 19th century.  In 1921
default,
default the then Inspector of Constabulary, Sir
default&#xa0;
defaultLeonard
default&#xa0;
defaultDunning, wrote in his annual report for HMIC that he was concerned that police officers were, as he put it, slewing over complaints in order to give the impression that their detection efforts were more effective than they were.  If the Committee wants that report
default,
default I would be happy to provide it with the relevant quotation.  There has been this concern for a long time.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ151default              defaultAlun Cairns:default Can I stop you there?  I want to know specifically why ONS came out with quite a strong statement and conceded that there was obviously a trend.  I want to know exactly why that is the case now, not— 
defaultProfessor Shute:default Can I just finish?  Yes, they pointed out leadership issues in that report; they also pointed out—
defaultAlun defaultCairnsdefault:default I know what they said; I want to know what you think.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default I think that they were right.  Unless, as I was indicating earlier, the leadership makes it clear that crime recording is a key, central, core function for the police, and unless those messages go out strong, clear and loud, and 
defaultare 
defaultregularly transmitted, it will be inevitable that you will find regression from officers lower down in the hierarchy.  Leadership, as with any organisation, is absolutely key.  Structures, processes and systems are really important too, as well as the right leadership messages.  I know that you are going to come to those issues in a moment, but Force Crime Registrars and the governance structures matter.  In my view, there are improvements that can be made there
default,
default and I can set 
defaultthem out
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ152default              defaultAlun Cairns:default Can I interpret all that answer as lack of leadership and lack of scope?  I am trying to be precise.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default There needs to be improvement in both those areas.  In effect, structures, systems, processes, lack of ownership of this issue and lack of leadership results in decay in the recording systems.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default Can I say why I think the two measures diverged from 2007 and 2008?  There were two or three critical things that happened: the Audit Commission stopped its audits; 
defaultSir 
defaultRonnie Flanagan’s review of red tape said the police ha
defaultd
default too much red tape; Jan
default&#xa0;
defaultBerry’s review came to much the same conclusion; and in 2008
default,
default KPIs were thinned out.  Those things all signalled to the police that 
default“
defaultrecording is not quite as important as we thought it was in 2002
default”
default.  I expected then there to be a divergence, and I am pleased to say it is one of the few predictions I have made that held up.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ153default              defaultAlun Cairns:default Exactly what needs to happen to gain consistency in the system?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default One needs to decide whether we want around 90% of crimes recorded.  Is that degree of tightness in the recording standard right?  If so, to get back to 90%
default,
default we need audits from HMIC and we need signals that, actually, what we thought was red tape is proper accountability.  There are choices to be made about how fully the crime recording system works.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ154default              defaultAlun Cairns:default In considering under-recording or 
defaultmisrecording
default, and you talked about that to the Chairman earlier, would you say wilful blindness was part of it?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default I think some of the pressures of performance targets have made people wilfully blind, which is slightly different from explicit misconduct.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ155default              defaultAlun Cairns:default Was that a yes?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default That is a complicated yes.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default I have no doubt that there has been dishonest manipulation at one end, through wilful blindness, to misunderstanding and ignorance, to the inappropriate exercise of discretion within a complicated set of rules.  The Home Office 
defaultcounting rules
default extend to 400 pages.  They need to be translated in a way that allows police officers on the ground to use them appropriately, and that is not straightforward.  All those things have combined together.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ156default              defaultAlun Cairns:default Each of you has mentioned the cessation of regular independent audits.  What contribution did the withdrawal of that make to the greater divergence in terms of the crime data?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default As has just been indicated, it is one of the explanations for why the two series started to pull apart.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default We cannot quantify it.  We cannot say it is 50% stopping of audits and 50% the signals about red tape and bureaucracy, but they were all factors.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default It is also the case that in 2000 and up to 2002, when the National Crime Recording Standards were created, wrapped around the Home Office 
defaultcounting rules
default, there was a consensus across police forces in the country that something needed to be done.  The state of affairs at that point could not continue.  Over time, though, that eroded.  It was supported by the Audit Commission, although arguably somewhat undermined by the fact the 
defaultAudit Commission described a 90% recording rate as good and a 95% recording rate as excellent.  That is how their standards worked in this area.  Nonetheless, they were out there busily reinforcing the messages at a time there was a consensus.  That eroded over time, and that was one of the things that led to this divergence.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ157default              defaultAlun Cairns:default What recommendations will CSAC be making to bring about changes in consistency because of the concerns expressed?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default I think what needs to be done is a review of the governance structures around this, including the role of Force Crime Registrars and Force Incident Registrars.  At the moment there is no generic common job description for those roles within each force.  Although there is some indication of what their role might be within the National Crime Recording Standards, it is flimsy and in my view needs to be fleshed out into the form of a common job description.  Force Crime Registrars need to have the authority within forces to ensure compliance.  That means they need appropriate grades within the force in order to be able to command that respect.  
defaultThere is a lot of evidence out there now to suggest that if Force Crime Registrars are effective
default,
default you are going to get greater compliance; you are, therefore, going to get higher levels of crime recording.  They possibly need dotted-line reporting lines into bodies outside their own forces, perhaps into the National Crime Registrar or into the National Statistician.  They need updated training and possibly accreditation, possibly carried 
defaultout 
defaultby the 
defaultNational
default 
defaultPolicing
default 
defaultCollege
default, to ensure that they have the skill
default 
defaultset that they need.  You need to ensure that they are separated out from operational line management
default,
default and
default that
default there are not too many tiers of reporting between Chief Officers in forces and the Force Crime Registrars.  A review of all that, plus more robust work by HMIC on a regular basis, giving it the external perspective, should go towards improving the position.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ158default              defaultPaul Flynn:default As the Police and Crime Commissioners are elected and will need to seek re-election, what is the difference in the pressure on Police and Crime Commissioners to fiddle the figures
default,
default rather than the Chief Constables fiddling the figures? 
defaultProfessor Shute:default I think they will have similar pressures, especially if they are setting numeric performance targets for their forces.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ159default              defaultPaul Flynn:default When you say “similar”, could you make it clearer?  Who is under the greater pressure?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default We have seen pressures on politicians to misrepresent crime data over recent years.  One of the reasons for taking the presentation of crime data out of the Home Office and placing it with an independent body, the Office for National Statistics, was to insulate the production of crime statistics from the political imperative.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ160default              defaultPaul Flynn:default This is a very interesting answer that you are giving me, Mr Shute, but could you answer the question?  Who is under greater pressure: an elected politician who is a Crime Commissioner or an unelected Chief Constable?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default I think both are under pressure.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ161default              defaultPaul Flynn:default You have said that.  Is there any difference between the two?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default They are in different places, but both have pressures to manipulate crime data to their own ends.  We have, as a committee, issued guidance to PCCs, to their analysts and to their media departments about the proper way to present crime data to ensure—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ162default              defaultPaul Flynn:default You are clearly not going to answer the question.  It is a very simple question.  Is there any difference in the pressure 
defaulton 
defaultunelected 
defaultand 
defaultelected person
defaults
default?  The elected person has to appear before the public in a couple of years’ time
default,
default and if they appear before the public and say, “I have managed to increase crime by 
defaultx
default%”, they are unlikely to be re-elected.  Is that not true?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default It is true.  
default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Would you not agree that the Police and Crime Commissioners are under greater pressure to falsify the figures than the Chief Constables?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default They are under greater pressure to do so, but they have fewer levers to make it happen, because they cannot penetrate through the—
defaultPaul Flynn:default Why is that?  What levers do they have?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default They do not have the same direct levers of command and control as the police force
defaults
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ163default              defaultPaul Flynn:default You wrote to all the candidates in the Police and Crime Commissioners election.  You then wrote to all the elected Crime Commissioners.  Why?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default Because we were aware
default that
default in the lead
default-
defaultup to elections
default,
default in the construction of manifestos
default,
default there might be a temptation on the part of aspirant PCCs to present crime data in a way that was inappropriate, and that that might lead to a decline in public confidence in crime data generally.  That has significant disadvantages
default,
default and we wanted to guard against that by informing PCCs about what steps they needed to take to ensure that they presented crime data appropriately.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ164default              defaultPaul Flynn:default In the year ending March 2012 in Wales, a small homogenous country, one of the police forces reported an increase in crime of 3%, another reported a decrease of 3%, a third recorded a decrease of 7% and the fourth recorded a decrease of 15%.  What interpretation would you place on that?  Would you suggest that there is need for any action by anyone?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default That is exactly the sort of use of crime data that we were seeking to guard against.  When somebody says that crime has gone down by 15% or increased by 15%, what do they mean?  Do they mean that police recorded crime has declined or increased by 15%?  Do they mean that crime as measured by the Crime Survey for 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default has declined or increased 15%?  Unless they clarify that, it is a misleading statistic.  It was exactly that sort of thing that we were trying to guard against.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ165default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Did you take any action when you saw those Welsh figures?  Was the top one plausible?  Was the bottom one plausible?  Would you feel that you ha
defaultd
default to intervene when there
default wa
defaults such a disparity between plus 3% and minus 15%?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default We would seek to take measures to ensure that those who use crime statistics know how to use them.  We are not responding to individual examples of inappropriate use of crime statistics.  That is not part of our function; that is not within our terms of reference.  We are interested in improving understanding
default,
default and hopefully that will drive up the appropriate use of crime statistics by those who present them to the public.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ166default              defaultPaul Flynn:default What change has taken place in the reported crime figures since Police and Crime Commissioners have taken office?
defaultProfessor Hough:default We do not know
default,
default in terms of under-reporting.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ167default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Do you know what changes have taken place in areas A, B and C
default 
defaultaround the country?  Has there been a reported decline in the levels of crime or a reported increase?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default Overall, recorded crime has continued to fall.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ168default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Indeed.  It has done for 30 years.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default I do not hold in my head the trends for individual forces.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ169default              defaultPaul Flynn:default If we take the last four years under the Chief
default&#xa0;
defaultConstables and the 12 months that we have had since, has there been a difference?  Surely you should know that.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default It has been a consistent downward trend.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ170default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Has it continued the trend on the same level that has been happening for decades?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default We could obviously look at the stats and get back to you, but I do not know off the top of my head.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ171default              defaultPaul Flynn:default You have not seen any noticeable difference between the two in the last year.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default I have not looked at four years—
defaultChair:default What difference would you expect to find?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default Over time, I really do not know if PCCs will respond to the pressures that they are under successfully to reduce recording.  I do not know, but it is a risk.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ172default              defaultPaul Flynn:default There is a question at the moment of whether the PCC election will be the last, and there is a move to replace them.  What is your view on the value of the PCCs so far, as far as influencing crime statistics 
defaultgoes
default?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default My view is it really is too early to say.  I know that is sitting on the fence, but it is too early to say.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default One needs some accountability mechanisms for the police.  We have replaced our police authorities with PCCs.  The PCCs are serving a number of functions, one of which is an important accountability function.  That is separate from whether they will be effective, through their very presence, in driving down crime within their areas.  There are a large number of PCCs; they all are going about their work in different ways.  I agree with my colleague that it is too early really to carry out a thorough review of their efficacy.  I would not want to come to a definitive judgment so soon after their election and their creation.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ173default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Have crime figures been fiddled by a large group of police forces in the last five years, in your view? 
defaultProfessor Shute:default I have tried to answer that by saying that we do not know the extent to which fiddling has gone on.  We do know that there has been quite widespread under
default&#x2011;
defaultrecording
default and 
defaultmisrecording
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ174default              defaultPaul Flynn:default There is no accurate, reliable measure for deciding whether they were fiddled or not.  That is what your evidence is this morning.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default We cannot say that.  
default              defaultPaul Flynn:default You do not know.  
defaultProfessor Hough: defaultI do not know how much 
defaultmisrecording
default there is
default,
default as opposed to just under
default&#x2011;
defaultrecording
default.  
default              defaultPaul Flynn:default We hope for a bolt of lightning from above that will reveal what the truth is on this.  
default              defaultChair:default From HMIC.  
default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Yes, there must be someone who knows.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ175default              defaultChair:default On this question of quantifying the error rate, PC
default&#xa0;
defaultJames
default&#xa0;
defaultPatrick and his fellow witnesses all seemed to agree it could be around 10%.  How reasonable do you think that estimate is?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default Of 
defaultmisrecording
default?  
default              defaultChair:default 
defaultMisrecording
default or just under-recording.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default We know in broad terms how much under-recording there is, and it is now roughly 70%.  70% of reported crimes get into police statistics.  I do not think they know
default,
default and I certainly do not know what the balance is with 
defaultmisrecording
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ176default              defaultChair:default Let me ask the question again.  They said that of the crimes walking in through the police station door, so to speak, up to 10% of those incidents were being 
defaultmisrecorded
default or under-recorded.  Do you think that is a reasonable estimate?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default I think it is an underestimate if it is 
defaultmisrecording
default and under
default&#x2011;
defaultreporting
default,
default because we know that it is a larger amount than that.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ177default              defaultChair:default What estimate would you make of the percentage of crimes that walk in through the police station door that are not recorded correctly, for one reason or another? 
defaultProfessor Hough:default I think from the ONS paper it would appear to be about 70%.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ178default              defaultChair:default 70% are 
defaultmisrecorded
default?  
default              
defaultProfessor Hough:default No, 70% of reported go unrecorded.  I can only repeat that I do not know the balance within that.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ179default              defaultChair:default I think you are answering a different question.  When something starts getting entered on
default 
defaultto the Police National Computer as a crime
default,
default and then finishes up being nodded, cuffed or whatever, they are saying that 10% finish up being 
defaultmisrecorded
default one way or another.  Do you think that is a reasonable estimate?  What is your estimate?  If it really is that you do not know, just say you do not know.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default I have said I do not know several times.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default We have no accurate handle on exactly what the proportions of wilful, deliberate 
defaultmisrecording
default are, but those numbers are possible.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ180default              defaultChair:default How reasonable is it, therefore, for us to believe our witnesses?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default I think you need to ask them where the 10% figure comes from, whether it is a guesstimate or whether it is actually statistically based.  That is all I can say.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ181default              defaultRobert Halfon:default When you answered my colleague Mr Cairns’ questions about recording statistics, you said some is genuine malpractice, some is by accident and so
default on
default.  If you had a set of scales, how much weight would you give to the malpractice side of things
default,
default compared to the other things that you mentioned?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default Weighing them against what criteria?  One case of deliberate, wilful, dishonest 
defaultmisrecording
default by a police officer is a very serious matter.  The very people who are meant to enforce the rules in this country ought not to be breaking the rules when it comes to the recording of crime, so one case is a very serious matter.  If it is a widespread practice
default,
default that is an even more serious matter.   
default&#xa0;
defaultQ182default              defaultRobert Halfon:default You said that when they were recording statistics, some were malpractice, some were because of Government targets, some were genuine errors and so on.  I am asking you, if you had a set of scales in front of you, what percentage you would put in the malpractice section of the reporting
default.
default  
defaultProfessor Shute:default If I have interpreted it correctly
default,
default that is exactly the same question as the Chair was asking me a moment ago, in which I indicated that we do not have good statistical information to answer that question.  We have some impressionistic views, and you have had evidence before you along those lines.  If the other witnesses have some research study or a way of grounding that in reliable statistical data
default,
default they should present it to you.  We do not have it and we do not know of its existence.   
default&#xa0;
defaultQ183default              defaultRobert Halfon:default What is your instinct?  Do you think there is a
default 
defaultpreponderance
default,
default or do you think it is for the other reasons that you set out?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default My hunch is that
default,
default in 
defaultmisrecording
default,
default malpractice is a minority.  That is a hunch, but that is where I am.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default My hunch would be the same.  These are complicated rules for the recording of crime.  As I said, it is a 400-page manual.  It requires interpretation and translation.  There is a deficit of expertise in forces to provide that translation.  Therefore, there are systemic reasons for thinking there is quite a lot of misinterpretation and mistake
default&#x2011;
defaultdriven
default activity.  I would expect that that outstrips deliberate, wilful dishonesty.  It is a guess, though.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ184default              defaultChair:default To what extent is there knowledge of that accidental recording and then blindness towards
default it
default, because actually it is rather convenient for crime statistics to be recorded a bit lower than they actually are?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default I am sure there is some of that.  For busy front
default-
defaultline officers and in busy control rooms
default,
default there is also perhaps not sufficient attention paid to the niceties of Home Office 
defaultcounting rules
default and the National Crime Recording Standards.  They have other things that they feel deserve more of their attention.  That is all about some of the issues we came to earlier
default—
defaultleadership and the right messages being transmitted down throughout the force.  There is a whole variety of pressures.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ185default              defaultPaul Flynn:default It is crime statistics on which police promotions
default, 
defaultdecisions on massive spending
default, 
defaultand whole policies of Government are based, and you are telling us that all the information we have is at best impressionistic.  We have no clear guide to the accuracy of crime statistics provided by the police.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default I do not think I said that.  What I did say was we do not know how much of the under-recording and, particularly, the 
defaultmisrecording
default is down to wilful, dishonest activity by police officers or, indeed, wilful blindness, rather than simply errors or failures to interpret the rules appropriately.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ186default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Are you happy with that situation?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default I am absolutely not happy if crime statistics are used inappropriately and if we cannot rely on them.  For all the reasons that you said, and a host of other reasons, it is absolutely central that crime statistics in this country be trustworthy and command confidence
default, so
default that they can form the basis for proper decisions about how resources are allocated and so on.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ187default              defaultRobert Halfon:default Can I ask you a general question about the British Crime Survey?  Am I right in saying 
defaultthat 
defaultit does not include crimes against young people?  Is that right?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default It includes people 16 and over in the main sample, and then there is a subsidiary sample of people 12 to 15, up to the age of 16.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ188default              defaultRobert Halfon:default What would you say is the flaw in that survey?  People always say that it is not accurate and does not properly reflect—
defaultProfessor Hough:default It is not precise, but also its coverage is not comprehensive
default,
default in that it does not include crimes against businesses, organisations and people in prison.  There are large numbers of gaps, but it is a robust indicator of how much crime there is against people and their private property.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default It is also the case that the sample is not sufficiently large to allow one to disaggregate it by force area.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ189default              defaultRobert Halfon:default Who actually does it?  You just see it reported.  Who is responsible for the British Crime Survey?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default ONS oversee it.  They contract the fieldwork to a company who does the interviewing
default,
default and analysis comes back in-house, largely.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ190default              defaultRobert Halfon:default Would you make recommendations for changing it and making it better, to encompass some of the things that you just highlighted?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default Its scope can be extended.  For example, cyber crime needs to be captured more fully.  There is work being done, but it could be done more fully.  If there were buckets of money, I would want estimates that were viable at individual police-force level.  At the moment, though, I cannot see that happening.  It is just too expensive.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ191default              defaultRobert Halfon:default Whenever it comes out, if it shows a crime going down, people say there are too many flaws in the survey so it is not really worth it.  Do you think it does give a useful snapshot?    
defaultProfessor Hough:default I think it gives a good snapshot and a better indicator of trends.  If I had to choose—and I am obviously 
defaultparti
default 
defaultpris
default,
default because I have been involved in the Crime Survey for a long time—its trend is more reliable than the trend in police statistics. 
defaultOn 
defaultwhat is happening now, I would say the police are over-stating the rate of decrease in crime.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ192default              defaultRobert Halfon:default Why is the trend more reliable?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default Because the methods of collecting are not affected by reporting changes and recording changes.  What we have seen
default in 
defaultthe years from 2007 onwards are changes in recording practice.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default Key performance indicators for the police can affect the recording of crime by the police, but the Crime Survey for 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default will not be affected by that.  We are fortunate in th
defaultis
default country
default,
default in that we have a variety of sources for the data on crime and we can look at trends over time.  Not all countries—arguably no other country—are in as good a 
defaultposition as we are to try to estimate what is going on.  That is so valuable for all the reasons that were indicated a moment ago.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ193default              defaultRobert Halfon:default Are you saying that the more reliable indicator for crime statistics is the British Crime Survey
default,
default and that is what people should look at, rather than the police recorded crime?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default I would say it is definitely more reliable.  It is less precise; it gives estimates with errors, but it is a better indicator of what the underlying trend is for crimes against people and their properties.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ194default              defaultRobert Halfon:default It is more strategic.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default Yes, it is broad-view.  You have to spend a lot of money to get the narrow, focused view.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default It covers crimes that people have experienced but they have never reported to the police.  Police recorded crime is blind to that. 
defaultRobert Halfon:default Because it does not include non-reported crime.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default Yes.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ195default              defaultRobert Halfon:default Does the Home Office share that view?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default You would have to ask them, but they have said you need the two measures to understand what is going on.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ196default              defaultRobert Halfon:default Do they use both measures equally
default,
default in terms of the way they 
defaultanalyse
default crime?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default If they want to look at the force level, the Crime Survey for 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default does not enable a force estimate.  You have to look at what is going on at—
defaultProfessor Shute:default The only way of rectifying that would be to have a very much larger sample and, of course, there is an added cost.  The only other thing I would say is that the crime survey needs to be carried out regularly in order to allow trends over time to be measured.  You need continuity of funding for the Crime Survey.  If it were to be withdrawn, that would be a serious problem.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ197default              defaultRobert Halfon:default Does the Home Office measure both forms equally and look at both properly, or does it give more weight to one survey 
defaultthan to 
defaultthe other?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default I do not think I can answer.  They present the findings together in one volume.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ198default              defaultRobert Halfon:default But in terms of their own analysis and in the development of policy formulation.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default I would hope they do a synthesis of the two, but it is a question for them.   
defaultProfessor Shute:default As far as I know
default,
default they do.  I would be surprised if they were not giving each the weight that 
defaultit 
defaultdeserve
defaults
default in the areas where they can inform policy and practice.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ199default              defaultRobert Halfon:default defaultWhen 
defaultthe police 
defaultdo their own recorded crime statistics, do they look at the Crime Survey, give an equal weight and bring the two together in any way?   
defaultProfessor Hough:default I would hope they know what the national picture is from the Crime Survey
default,
default and interpret their own trends in the light of that.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ200default              defaultRobert Halfon:default From what you were saying earlier, because there is the difference, if the police come up with one thing and they see that the British Crime Survey comes up with a completely different thing, do they then look at it and try to rebalance what they have come up with?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default One would hope that they are looking at the documents being produced on the variation in crime trends to cast a light on police recording practices in their force.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ201default              defaultRobert Halfon:default Do they ensure that the British Crime Survey reflects their own analysis of statistics and the recorded crime statistics, in essence? 
defaultProfessor Shute:default If they do not, I would have thought they ha
defaultd
default a problem.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ202default              defaultRobert Halfon:default Do they?  Given all the problems you and others are putting out, and 
defaultgiven that you 
defaultsay that there is a divergence of crime stats from the two different statistic gatherings—the Crime Survey and the recorded statistics—
defaultthat
default suggests that they do not give proper weight to the British Crime Survey when they gather together their own statistics.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default I do not know if they have examined under-recording at the force level, but that is what the divergence would prompt me to do.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ203default              defaultChair:default I just have one final question.  You have been very helpful, and I have personally really enjoyed your very frank evidence.  Thank you very much.  If you were advising the National Statistician or the UK Statistics Authority on whether recorded crime should enjoy the designation of national statistics, what would your advice be?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default Yes, it is important.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ204default              defaultChair:default Obviously they are important, but are they accurate enough?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default 
default We are not the assessment body.  They have to make that assessment.  If they conclude that they are not accurate enough and they are not worthy of that 
defaultkitemark
default, it should be removed.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ205default              defaultChair:default I was asking what your view is.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default I think it would be a very sad state of affairs if we ended up in that position.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ206default              defaultChair:default What is your view?  How would you advise the National Statistician?  In your view, are these statistics reliable enough to enjoy the designation—the royal seal of approval of national statistics?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default I would not wish to pre-empt their careful evaluation of that issue against the relevant criteria.  You have to go through that process.  It would be a mistake to state ex ante what an ex post conclusion would be.  
defaultProfessor Hough:default If they were downgraded, the system would collapse.  We would not have—
defaultChair:default That is not a reason for not withdrawing the designation.  
defaultProfessor Shute:default Of course not.  The designation should be withdrawn if, as measured against the criteria, they do not meet the requirements for national statistics.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ207default              defaultChair:default In your view, do they meet the criteria?  
defaultProfessor Shute:default My view is that it would be wrong for me
default,
default ex ante
default,
default to come to a conclusion.  You have to go through that process.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ208default              defaultChair:default I am bound to say, having thanked you for your evidence
default—
defaultProfessor Hough, do you have anything to add?  
defaultProfessor Hough:default I would be sorry to see them lose their status.  
default              defaultChair:default I think we all would, but I note that you have not given them a ringing endorsement.  You have not said, “Of course not”, so I will leave it at that.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ209default              defaultKelvin Hopkins:default There is one last question from me.  Professor
default&#xa0;
defaultShute, you recommended a return to regular annual external audits and robust regimes.  The concern I have is that the inspection organisation, HMIC or whichever it might be, might be too cosy with the police.  Where we have seen inspections or regulators that are too cosy with the organisation they are supposed to 
defaultbe 
defaultregulating or inspecting, we have problems.  How would you ensure that it is a robust regime and a regime that also leads in the end to putting victims as the primary concern? 
defaultProfessor Shute:default Yes, absolutely.  There is always that fear with inspectorates that they become too close to the inspected bodies.  Sometimes academics refer to that as capture: they become captured by the bodies that they inspect.  At the same time, of course, they need the relevant expertise, and if they are too distant from the practice they cannot turn over the stones because they do not know where to look.  You always have to get that balance right.  If you ask for a personal view, I think it is a welcome development that the Chief Inspector for the first time in the history of the inspectorate is now drawn from somebody who has not been a serving police officer in the past.  You also have currently, on the Inspectorate, inspectors who similarly do not have a police background.  If you go back a number of years
default,
default that was not the case.  The methodology needs to be right.  The Crime Statistics Advisory Committee is in a position to offer advice on methodology.  It is part of our function and remit, and we take that very seriously.  If, over time, an inspectorate shows itself incapable of exercising the degree of independence and robust scrutiny that is required, then that is a real 
defaultproblem for an inspectorate and you have to look at whether it is delivering what is asked of it.  
default&#xa0;
default              defaultChair:default We must draw a line.  Thank you very much indeed for your evidence.  We look forward to our next witness.  Thank you very much.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultWitness: 
defaultChief Constable Jeff Farrardefault, National Lead on Crime Statistics, acting on behalf of 
defaultt
defaulthe Association of Chief Police Officers
default, gave evidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ210default              defaultChair:default Welcome to this second session this morning on crime statistics.  I wonder if our new witness could identify himself for the record, please.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: Thank you, Chair.  I am the Chief Constable of Gwent Police and I am the National Policing Lead on Crime Statistics.  I am also a member of CSAC.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ211default              defaultChair:default Could I jump straight into your evidence, in which you have said that there is little leeway for application of professional judgment in deciding whether to record an incident as a crime or not
default? 
defaultYou go on to say, “This often brings Crime Registrars and their staff into direct confrontation with police officers who perceive them to be prioritising compliance with the rules over the needs of victims and the wider public”.  Can you explain what you mean by that?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: Chair, I think there are a number of points about why crime would not be recorded in compliance with Home Office 
defaultcounting rules
default.  Public interest might be one, but there are a number of other issues around IT systems, performance pressures, lack of competence and training of officers, failure to do their duty
default,
default and just human error.  
defaultThere are lots of reasons why stuff might not be recorded properly, but let me give you one example.  It is one from my own force, where a memb
defaulter of the public finds their 11-
defaultyear
default-
defaultold stealing from their purse.  They phone the police for some help; they want some service; they want their child to be told that is not the right thing to do and to remember that for the rest of their lives.  This is a daily occurrence for the police.  This is the type of thing that we do frequently, and there are a number of examples.  A police officer turns up, speaks to the child, gives them something to remember and hopefully puts them on the right path for the rest of their life.  That is a crime and in the Home Office 
defaultcounting rules
default should be recorded as a crime, and there should be a crime outcome.  That crime outcome could be a caution; it could be prosecution; it could be community resolution, but there should be a crime outcome.  That then goes into the system.  The reality is: would that member of the public have phoned us if they thought that was the approach we were going to take?  
defaultThese may be a very small number of incidents, but I know from an audit that I have done in my own force that those incidents where we have failed to comply with Home Office 
defaultcounting rules
default have been for two reasons.  One is because they genuinely thought they were helping the public to deliver a service.  The second is that they had a lack of knowledge or understanding of Home Office 
defaultcounting rules
default.  That was the sole reason for those failures.  There are lots of reasons why it can happen, but it is really important that we allow officers to 
defaultuse common sense, albeit there has to be a line and we still need to make sure that they are complying with Home Office 
defaultcounting rules
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ212default              defaultChair:default I have to say, Chief Constable, that this is a very novel piece of evidence you are giving us, because nobody else has suggested that there is any significant under-recording of crime at the victim’s request.  On the contrary, the evidence is completely the opposite.  I find this assertion that there is any statistically significant under
default&#x2011;
defaultrecording
default of crime for the reasons you have suggested to be rather difficult to believe.  How statistically significant do you think it is that crime is under-recorded for these reasons?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I think it is probably on the margins.  It is not the main amount of crime that will come into us, but it does stop officers doing what they are there to do, which is deliver the service to the public.  If I can explain how I have compiled the written evidence: this is the written evidence from all 43 forces.  They were all asked to comment.  The evidence I present in my written submission is not just the evidence of Jeff Farrar sitting here.  It is from the 43 forces in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default, and the submissions that have come back to me.  That is a recurring theme around service as opposed to compliance.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ213default              defaultChair:default Can I quote Mick 
defaultCreedon
default, the Chief Constable of Derbyshire
default? He 
defaultsaid, “My fear is that inadvertently we are all still putting pressure on officers to do all they can to manipulate and create crime reductions”.  That is rather at odds with your evidence.  I do not think your evidence reflects Chief Constable 
defaultCreedon’s
default view.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: The point I talk about on use of discretion and public interest is just one part of many reasons why crime might not have been recorded properly.  I was there when Mick
default&#xa0;
defaultCreedon
default made those points, and the points he made are based on his view of what he has seen.  I would say that nobody joins the police service to record crime inappropriately.  They just do not.  They join to help the public.  If there is a pressure to 
defaultmisrecord
default crime, the question has to be: is that driven by targets or numbers?  If it is driven by targets and numbers, are we asking people to do the wrong things?  That is a question for the service because there is an inconsistency across the service in how that is being done.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ214default              defaultChair:default What is the role of the national policing lead on crime statistics?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It is a really interesting one
default,
default because I have been doing this role for the last 12 months, and it is not my day job.  I am a Chief Constable in a force in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default.  I am not paid any extra money for doing the role; I am not required to do the role.  I do it because I would like to get greater consistency across crime statistics in the 
defaultUK
default.  I think if the one thing I achieve in this role is greater consistency, then I will have achieved something.  That is what I see as my role: it is getting a concerted effort across the service to get a picture of what is happening across the 43 forces.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ215default              defaultChair:default How consistent do you think the understanding amongst chief officers is that there are risks to data integrity posed by the target cultures under which police forces have been operating for a couple of decades now?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: Every force in the country will tell you there is a risk of a target culture driving the wrong behaviour.  That is inevitable.  The work that HMIC will do and has done in the 
defaultpast has shown us that is absolutely clear.  The work that they will do next year on the crime
default 
defaultrecording reviews will be hugely helpful.  If you ask me that question, I run Gwent
default&#xa0;
defaultPolice through a very ethical and value-driven approach
default, but
default on a quarterly basis there will be, for want of a better term, a league table of numbers that will be produced
default. 
defaultIt is human behaviour that you are inevitably going to look at where your force is in that list.  
defaultThe reality—and in the conversations I have had with the Police and Crime Commissioner we are like-minded on this—is that we absolutely need to be driven towards increased quality of service for the people of Gwent
default,
default and that needs to be our overriding driving issue rather than following numbers.  My experience, certainly from going to public meetings, is that the public do not want to hear numbers; they want to hear how we are delivering the service to them.  That is really important.  Once the service is judged, whether that be through ministerial direction, the media or other sources based on numbers, there is a real danger that you can end up driving the wrong culture.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ216default              defaultChair:default You refer in your evidence to the role of FCRs—which, if I remember correctly, stands for Force Crime Registrars—and we have heard how inconsistent their role is across different forces.  What is ACPO doing about this?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I have been around the whole country and I have seen every single Force Crime Registrar, bar
default in
default one region.  One of the things that was stark to me was the difference in status, the difference in role—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ217default              defaultChair:default What are you doing about it?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I have already met with the national policing college, and they are now starting to put in place the national training and accreditation for Force Crime Registrars.  The stuff that comes out from the HMIC inspection will be hugely helpful in directing that.  I have already written to every Chief Constable in the country about the engagement they have with their FCR, the role of their FCR and the status that they should have in the organisation.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ218default              defaultChair:default What are your top three recommendations to all Chief
default&#xa0;
defaultConstables?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I jotted a couple down before we came in.  The code of ethics and what that drives us towards is very important 
defaultfor 
defaultthe leadership of the service
default. 
defaultTraining
default, not only for 
defaultForce Crime Registrars
default—that training 
defaultwill be set up nationally
default&#xad;
default&#xad;
default—
defaultbut for 
defaultfront
default-line staff in understanding the Home Office 
defaultcounting rules
default is very, very important
default. 
defaultConsistency of IT and ensuring that that is capturing crime recording 
defaultare 
defaultessential for us.  
defaultOn the status and role of FCRs, there is a real danger if you put someone in that role who is an in-service officer who is aspiring to go to a higher rank, the chance that they will have an open door to their chief officer is more problematic.  It is not insurmountable, because it does work well in some areas, but my recommendation would be that, to get consistency on that and independence, it is difficult to put an aspiring sergeant or inspector in that role.  I have two final 
defaultpoints.
default  
defaultThe first is that 
defaultinternal scrutiny and audit needs to be much clearer across the service.  
default              
defaultChair:default Is this about FCRs?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: No, I think—
defaultChair:default I would be grateful if you stuck to the question I am asking.  I asked for your top three recommendations about what Chief Constables should do about their status and their relationships with FCRs.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I think they need to play a really important part in scrutiny and internal audit.  Some already do, but it is not consistent.  Their training needs to be national and accredited, which we have already lined up.  They need an open door to a chief officer to sign off crime statistics—that is not a chief officer who has a responsibility for the operational area of reducing crime because there can be a difference— 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ219default              defaultChair:default What rank is an FCR?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: They vary.  In some forces—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ220default              defaultChair:default What rank should they be?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I do not think they should be a police officer, personally, but they are police officers in many forces.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ136default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What rank should that police officer have?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I do not think it matters what rank they have, as long as they have the access to a chief officer and the right status within the organisation.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ221default              defaultChair:default So it would be okay for a sergeant to do it.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: Sergeants do 
defaultdo
default it.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ222default              defaultChair:default That is okay, is it?
defaultJeff Farrardefault: Some do it very well.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ223default              defaultChair:default Do you think a sergeant has sufficient authority throughout a large constabulary to create the right atmosphere around the authority of these guidelines and procedures.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: That is what I started with.  I do not think a police officer should be in that role, personally.  I think with an aspiring police officer, it is very difficult for them to identify failings.  It becomes harder.  It does work well in some forces around the country that I have been to.  They do have sergeants who perform that role very effectively, but it is an inherent risk if you are going to put a sergeant or inspector in that role as opposed to somebody who is more independent.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ224default              defaultKelvin Hopkins:default You mentioned ethics in your previous question and the College of Policing is proposing a new code of ethics.  How do you think that could be used specifically to improve accurate crime recording?  Will this reach right down to the police constable on the beat?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It is a really welcome step, but it is not something completely new, in that we have had a statement of common purpose for the last 20 years; we have had our oath that we 
defaultswear when we join office.  It all talks around integrity, standards and what is expected in the service.  I do think it would be a very positive step around setting the standards that are required for the service.  It is going to be underpinned by legislation and the reality is it will be a benchmark for which we should be judged as a service.  It is a really positive step for us.    
default&#xa0;
defaultQ225default              defaultKelvin Hopkins:default Will there not be something of a conflict at times with the natural solidarity of police forces?  They have to work together in sometimes dangerous situations.  The lads are going to be loyal to each other.  At the same time, they have to behave and report ethically.  How far down the chain of command will your concern about ethics go?  Will it be on the bobby on the beat?
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It is about leadership.  The vast majority of people who serve us as police officers join because they care about their communities; they are ethical; they are fair; they have integrity.  We will always get the odd individual who does not aspire to that or does not comply with that.  My experience of people I have worked with for more than 30 years in the police service is they join the service for the right reasons.  I think it is about strong leadership; it is about ensuring people understand that code of ethics, that it is clear and it is driven by the values of the service and by individual services.  It needs to be a value-driven organisation.  If that is not in place then you are always going to have problems.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ226default              defaultKelvin Hopkins:default The other conflict is within targets.  Targets inevitably are a concern of the leadership.  If the leadership is saying, “We’ve got to get up that table of performance in the country.  If we report too many of our crimes we are going to go down rather than up,” in a sense, are you going see police constables saying, “I don’t care where we are on that table.  We are going to report every crime and make sure the public knows that we are being truthful”?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I think that is the evidence around the country already.  If you look at the evidence you have had presented to the Committee already, there are people who want to do the job and serve the public.  Again, it is back to my question.  Nobody joins the service intent on misreporting crime statistics, so why would it happen?  Yes, if you have an arbitrary target, inevitably if people feel they are going to be judged by not reaching that target then you can end up with unintended consequences.  For example, I am working as an inspector in a locality; I am being asked to reduce bicycle theft by 10%.  This month it looks like I am going to reduce 
defaultit 
defaultby 18%.  What do I do?  Do I tell people to slow down because next month I will be judged again?  If I am only reaching 6%
default,
default what do I do, if I have tried everything ethically to reduce that crime appropriately?  
defaultThe message I send in my own force is it is not about the numbers; it is about the service that we actually provide and that is what is important.  I think there is inevitability, though.  Even if you do not have a superintendant or a chief officer who is saying, “I want you to reach that target”, it will get subtly translated in different ways as we go down the organisation.  When the service is judged by an inspection process that uses a league table or when it is judged by a media headline, there is inevitability that it can drive the wrong behaviour.  It takes somebody with strong moral fibre to stand up to that and say, “No, I am doing the right thing for our locality”.  The service needs some help on that.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ227default              defaultKelvin Hopkins:default The gap between the independent recorded crime and police recorded crime is substantial.  We have to narrow that gap, 
defaultdo 
defaultwe not?  Do we not have 
defaultto have Chief Constables in particular, and those at every level, saying that even if we do not pursue the crime to prosecution or whatever, it has to be recorded
default,
default and 
defaultthat 
defaultevery report to the police of a crime has to be recorded and be available for public inspection?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It is a really interesting point, because 
defaultAmerica
default, which 
defaultis five times the size of us
default,
default records 
defaultonly 
default50% of the amount of crime that we record in the 
defaultUK
default.  There is no other country in the world that records as much crime as the 
defaultUK
default, yet would you say that we have more crime than elsewhere in the world?  I do not think so
default,
default if you look at some of the other countries.  Mike talked about it: we still know that 60% of crime does not get reported.  Peter 
defaultFahy
default gave evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee last week
default,
default or the week before
default,
default and he 
defaultsaid asked whether, 
defaultif we walk down the street and see somebody sneezing
default,
default that 
defaultshould 
defaultbe recorded by the health service as poor health
default.
default  We are going to have crime in society that does not always get recorded.  A really important point is, regardless of what it is recorded as, what service does that member of the public get when the
defaulty
default report that to the police
default? 
defaultThat is a critical factor.  My experience is that victims do not necessarily care how something is recorded; they care about what service they get.  That is really important
default,
default and I wholeheartedly agree with the point you made in your question.  The public deserve that
default,
default and they deserve nothing less.  If we are not doing that
default,
default we are abrogating our responsibility.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ228default              defaultChair:default Can I be clear that what we are talking about is not the kind of crime that is not recorded
default because it is not reported
default?  What we are concerned about is crime that is reported and then for some reason or another is not recorded correctly.  How do you have confidence that that 18% reduction in cycle thefts in your constabulary is accurate?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: In my force, for example, I have about 25 analysts.  The 
defaultquestion 
defaultwas 
defaultasked 
defaultearlier
default: 
defaultwhat do we do with the data?  They pore over that data because, actually, how do I employ resources effectively if I am not using that analysis effectively?  If somebody reports to me that there is an 18% reduction in crime, my first question is, “Is that a reporting issue or are we reducing crime?”  I will go into the detail underneath it to look at what the analysis says, look at what sorts of information we are getting in and what we are getting from our local PACT meeting about what people are saying about crime in their locality.  That is the view my colleagues across ACPO.  They would be doing exactly the same thing.  If they are not, they are really not doing their job effectively.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ229default              defaultChair:default When somebody reports a cycle theft, it is usually because they want to claim the insurance and, usually, the police officer will give a crime number so that they can go to the insurance company.  Presumably there is a bit of pressure on your officers now to investigate these a little bit more
default,
default and perhaps to suggest to the victim that he left it somewhere or that a relative has borrowed it, or there is some other issue.  How do you know that it is an 18% reduction in cycle theft?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It is a really important point.  It is my point about checking those figures and not just taking 
defaultit 
defaulton face value 
defaultthat there 
defaultis an 18% reduction.  It is looking at the reasons why.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ230default              defaultChair:default How do you check the figures?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: Checking the figures—the first thing is: are we driven by the figures or are we driven by the service?  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ231defaultChair:default How do you check the figures? 
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I will check my crime-recording figures in a number of different ways.  My Assistant Chief Constable runs an auditing group that has the Police and Crime Commissioner’s deputy on.  There is that scrutiny.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ232default              defaultChair:default We know there is an auditing group.  Can you answer the question?  How do you check the figures?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I am not sure what you are asking me.  I am saying I will do audit; I will do intelligent check on it.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ233default              defaultChair:default How does the audit operate?  What does the auditor do?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: For example, the FCR will routinely pick out incidents, particularly those that appear to be a crime on reporting and are not then recorded as a crime, to check the reasons why.  Every force in the country has an element of audit around how they check that what is being reported 
defaultas appearing
default to be a crime 
defaultbut 
defaultis not being recorded as a crime is there.  That is the stuff that is coming through as incidents.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ234default              defaultChair:default Sorry; you have not answered the question.  How do you check the accuracy of a single reported crime?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: That is the way it is done.  It is done through the Force Crime Registrar.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ235default              defaultChair:default I do not have a clue.  You have not given me any idea 
defaultof 
defaulthow you verify the truth of a cycle-theft statistic.  How do you do it?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: The incident gets reported, either to a patrolling officer, to a police station or by phone.  
default              defaultChair:default Yes, that is the initial recording.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It then comes into a computerised system, which will vary across forces.  Within that system
default,
default there will be an auditing bureau, which is run by the Force Crime Registrar, that will audit and check those crimes.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ236default              defaultChair:default What are they auditing?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: They are looking to see whether they are compliant with the Home Office 
defaultcounting rules
default and the National Crime Recording Standards.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ237default              defaultChair:default What does that mean in terms of—  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: If they are not in compliance with those rules—
defaultChair:default How do they check how the rules have been complied with?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: They look at the incident; they look at the circumstances around it.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ238default              defaultChair:default Whom do they talk to?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: They will talk to the officer in the case?  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ239default              defaultChair:default Ah, thank you.  We are getting somewhere.  What sort of conversation takes place?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It will depend on the nature of the—
defaultChair:default The cycle theft.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It will depend on the nature of the crime.  If that has been reported as a theft of a pedal cycle, within most forces they would have a crime management unit that would look at whether the investigative opportunities were exploited, so that everything was done that could be done to investigate that case to make sure that we detected that crime.  There would be a conversation with that constable or sergeant to ensure that those lines of enquiry have been done.  That is what will be done with the individual crime, but it will vary across forces.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ240default              defaultChair:default In conversations I have had with various police officers since we initially took our evidence from James Patrick and others, I have been left in no doubt
default about 
defaultwhat actually happens.  A police officer will enter a crime on
default 
defaultto the police system
default, 
defaultand then there will be some arbitraging.  How often do you find that a crime has been altered?  When you look at the computer logs, how often do you find the crime has been changed?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I can give you the details from my own force.  Of crimes that are recorded, those that end up as no crime—becoming a crime and then being removed 
defaultas 
defaulta crime, so there is additional variable information that says, “This shouldn’t be a crime”—was 1.7% last year.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ241default              defaultChair:default Across your force?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: That is in my own particular force.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ242default              defaultChair:default That was to no crime.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: That was to no crime.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ243default              defaultChair:default What about from cycle theft to lost property
default,
default or cycle theft to something else
default?
default  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I do not have the specific data with me.  I would be more than happy to give you that in writing at a later stage.  It is a very small number that go to no crime. 
defaultChair:default 
defaultOr where a 
defaultbreak-
defaultin is 
defaultreduced to criminal damage
default?
default  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I think you are much more likely to have cases that do not get into the system in the first place
default,
default where we do not record them
default. 
defaultFor an officer then to have to record that as a no crime is a significant amount of checking.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ244default              defaultChair:default When you are auditing, how do you find the crimes that were never put into the system in the first place?  It is no good looking at the figures
default,
default because they are not there.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: That is the difficulty if you do not have them coming in.  If they come in through your telephone system
default,
default you have them recorded as an incident.  That incident can then be checked.  If they report it to me on the streets or to my public protection team who interview a victim who discloses a number of sexual offences, or somebody walks into the police station and it is not recorded on our incident system, it is one of the things that HMIC has picked out on the forthcoming inspections as a real issue for us.  How do you ensure that they come into the system in the first place?  There is a risk there. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ245default              defaultChair:default How much do you look at records of people who have been into the police station and then go back to the victim?  How often do you go back to the victim of a crime to find out whether they feel the crime has been recorded properly?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: Interestingly, in the review that I have just conducted in my force
default,
default we did exactly that.  Of 1,000 crimes over a 10-day period
default,
default we took 50 that appeared to have been crimes that had not been recorded as such. 
defaultTwenty-five
default had not been recorded as such
default,
default and there was a genuine reason why, in line with national crime recording standards
default; for 
default25
default, there was not
default.  We went back to the victims and said, “What sort of service did you have?” and well over 90% said they thought they had an excellent service.  We do 
defaultdo
default those samples across the service, but again, as I started 
defaultby saying
default, it is inconsistent.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ246default              defaultChair:default 10% of your sample, randomly selected I presume, said they had not had a good service and you had not recorded their crime.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: Yes.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ247default              defaultChair:default That rather bears out what we have been told—that there is a problem—does it not?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: If we are saying, “Are we ever going to record all crime
default,
default 100%
default,
default to a perfect standard?”, I would put it back into the context of looking at how stuff is recorded
default—
defaultnot just across crime recording
default,
default but other crime data within the UK, 
defaultand in 
defaultother countries, and the standard is still pretty tough.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ248default              defaultChair:default Looking at your draft code of ethics—honesty and integrity, fairness, equality, diversity, lawfulness and all these others—when you find that 10% of your sample is complaining, bearing in mind you are telling me 
defaultthat for 
default50% of that sample
default, there
default should have 
defaultbeen a 
defaultcrime 
defaultrecorded but there was not
default, but the public are not complaining about it, what conversation do you have with the officers concerned who 
defaultmisrecorded
default that crime?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: The context of that is it was 1,000
default,
default and we took 50, 25
default of which 
defaultwere done properly
default,
default and 25 
defaultof which 
defaultwere not.  They were public interest, like I said at the start of my evidence, and a lack of knowledge and understanding of the rules.   
default&#xa0;
defaultQ249default              defaultChair:default The same applies.  What conversations do you have with the officers concerned who 
defaultmisrecorded
default that crime?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: If we identify shortcomings that are misconduct, we would deal with it under misconduct.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ250default              defaultChair:default Is it necessarily misconduct?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It might be a neglect of duty, yes.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ251default              defaultChair:default It might be, but it is in the culture, is it not?  This target culture has been around for a long time.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: We have had targets for some time, but I was in the service back in the late 1980s and 1990s, where we had limited performance management; we had no targets.  If you had asked me the questions you are asking me today then, it would not have been as good as it is now.  However, I really do think there is a place for performance management in the service.  My own personal view: is there a place for targets?  I think they can drive the wrong behaviour.  There are not any targets in my own particular force.  It is varied across the country.  If you have a personal target
default,
default it will achieve things
default; 
defaultif I want to run the marathon
default,
default I will have a personal target.  Once you make those organisational targets
default,
default they can drive the wrong behaviour
default,
default and you have seen evidence that it does potentially drive the wrong behaviour.  I think it is really important for us as a service to recognise 
defaultthat 
defaultwe do have to deliver the best possible service to the public.  There has to be performance management around that.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ252default              defaultChair:default How do you make it clear that, whatever aspirations you set in your policing policy in the force, the code of ethics is actually far more important?  How do you make that clear?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: If you spoke to officers in my force
default,
default they would tell you that the one thing I put up on the wall is our purpose, which is 
defaultto 
defaultprotect and reassur
defaulte
default people, and our values.  People talk to me about technical skill
default. 
defaultIf it is not done in a responsive way that is fair, 
defaultif 
defaultpeople 
defaultdo not 
defaulttrust you
default,
default and you are 
defaultnot 
defaultcaring, if you are not doing those things
default 
defaultand 
defaultusing the 
defaultvalues set 
defaultout in 
defaultthe code of ethics—Alex has asked us all, going across the whole service, to sign up to those values
default—
defaultall the rest of it does not really matter.  That is the code that we need to be held to
default,
default and I think that is really important.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ253default              defaultChair:default How do you know that your officers are actually subscribing to those values and believe in them?  I know quite a lot of policemen.  There is quite a lot of cynicism, is there not?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: There can be.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ254default              defaultChair:default How do you make sure that you have really inspired people with those values?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I think you have to value that behaviour.  Where are the examples in your service of valuing people who stood up to those values and that commitment?  That has to be a strong part of the performance measurement
default,
default 
defaultas is being 
defaultan employer of choice, as opposed to judging people based on numbers.  If I have an inspector who does not know whether their crime has gone up or down and does not know what they are doing about it, they are 
defaultnot doing their job.  That is a very different thing to an inspector who is not meeting their 10% target this month.  The subtleties get lost.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ255default              defaultKelvin Hopkins:default I have two concerns.  There is the question of violence, particularly sexual violence; writing down crimes
default,
default from rape to sexual assault or whatever
default,
default is a serious concern.  That has been brought to 
defaultour attention in 
defaultprevious sessions.  Would one simple way of dealing
default with
default this be to have all first reports recorded, so whatever people say is recorded at one point, and then what you finally decide is going to be the crime is recorded separately?  You might get 100 crimes reported a week
default,
default and all of those are recorded as they come in at the first contact
default; 
defaultthe second point might be 
defaultthat 
default75 of them proceed to be an offence.  Then we would know how many of those alleged initial thoughts about crime are being reduced
default,
default and what the percentage is.  At the moment we only get the 75 of them.  Could we not have that different approach?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: When the National Crime Recording Standards were introduced in 2002, there was this question about prima facie, which was to take everything on face value, to balance the probabilities.  It is not a universally held view amongst all my peers, but I think for certain types of offences
default,
default you have to have a prima facie case.  If somebody says, “I’ve been raped”, we record it as a rape.  We do not investigate that immediately and ask them why they said they ha
defaultd
default been raped, and look not to record it in the system.  Certain types of offences
default,
default like rape, in my view, should be recorded as rape, and if there is additional variable information that says it is not a rape at a later stage
default,
default then it should be no crime.  I do not think there should be any way around that in the service.  
defaultHowever, let me give you an example of criminal damage
default. 
defaultMy previous chief went out on patrol, 
defaultand 
defaultwent to a house 
defaultwhere 
defaultthe lady said, “I’d like to report criminal damage”.  If we took that on prima facie
default,
default we would record it
default,
default it would go into the system
default,
default and there would be a lot of bureaucracy around it
default. 
defaultThe glass was on the outside.  He said to her, “How did it get damaged
default,
default then
default?
default” “Well, I kicked the window myself in a temper, but if I 
defaultdon’t 
defaultget a crime number
default,
default I can’t get it replaced by the local authority
default.
default”  That is not a crime.  It might be a crime by her.
default              defaultChair:default It sounds like fraud to me.   
defaultJeff Farrardefault: But it is not a crime in the genuine sense.  For some types of offences
default,
default I think there is room for balance of probability.  For certain types of offences
default,
default like the ones you have talked about, I think it should be a prima facie case
default,
default and we should just be recording it; we should not be asking those questions.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ256default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Can I first of all congratulate you on your appointment
default,
default and say that your distinguished work on Operation Jasmine is appreciated by all Gwent MPs?  You might find the questions I am going to ask you challenging, but I really wish you well
default,
default for your sake and for the sake of the people of Gwent.  Could we go into your appointment
default,
default first of all?  The Police and Crime Commissioner, when he was interviewed on 3
default&#xa0;
defaultJuly by the Home Affairs Committee
default,
default was asked about how many candidates were likely to apply for your job, in view of the fact that Carmel Napier was pressurised to resign
default,
default and she was the second Chief Constable who had been pressurised to resign in my period in this House.  He said that he expected a large number of candidates to apply for the job.  In the event, how many were there? 
defaultJeff Farrardefault: There was only one candidate, but there are lots of reasons for that.  One of the things across the service is if you have a strong internal candidate
default,
default there are often not a lot of applicants.  There are other reasons, Mr Flynn.  The first is that we know that 
defaultWales
default has never been popular
default, in terms of 
defaultattract
defaulting
default chief officers to come into 
defaultWales
default, for lots of reasons.  I think it is a time in the service when, if you look across the whole of the service, there is one applicant for many job across many forces
default,
default and there are lots of reasons for that.  To read that into the PCC would probably be unfair.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ257default              defaultPaul Flynn:default I am aware this is not unique, but these were special circumstances.  If we can go back into the very interesting story of crime figures in Gwent, I quoted earlier the year when one Welsh police force recorded a 3% increase and Gwent recorded a 15% reduction.  Damian Green said in Westminster Hall that in the period from June
default&#xa0;
default2010 to June 2013, crime in Gwent went down by 29%.  In the past year since the election of the Police and Crime Commissioner, it has fallen by a further 4%.  You were a serving officer during that period.  Do you have any comment to make about those figures, and do you find them plausible now?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: Absolutely.  You have to look at the historical trend
default,
default and where we have come from.  Gwent Police went through a reorganisation in 2009 that changed everybody’s job, from the Deputy Chief Constable right down to PCSOs.  It was a wholesale change.  
default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Could I just say—
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It would be helpful for me to give you a little bit of context, because if you look at the historical change at that time, in 2009, Gwent was the only police force in the country that had seen an increase in crime.  If you try and compare us with other Welsh forces, Dyfed Powys, for as long as I can remember, has always been the lowest recorded crime in the 
defaultUK
default.  It is top.  At that time
default,
default Gwent Police was 42nd out of 43, so you are not comparing apples with apples.  For us to reduce crime by 30%, we had a long way to go.  I think other forces in 
defaultWales
default, particularly Dyfed Powys, did not have that distance to travel, so to expect them to make the same reductions as us would have been unfair.  We are not comparing the same things.  
defaultQ259default              defaultPaul Flynn:default You accept the figure that Gwent Police reduced crime by 29% in three years
default,
default and then by a further 4%.  Do you find that entirely believable? 
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I can tell you the work that went on in the force during that three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear period and it—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ260default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Do you believe it?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: When you say, “Do you believe it”—
defaultPaul Flynn:default do you accept what the Police and Crime Commissioner said in his campaign
default—
defaultthat he was concerned about possible inaccuracies in the crime figures?  He has said it since.  Are you in disagreement with the Police and Crime Commissioner because of those figures?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: The Crime Commissioner and I are absolutely like-minded about what we want to do in Gwent Police
default,
default and that is to provide the best possible service to the public.  When he travelled around the county
default,
default in a lot of meetings
default,
default people were saying that their engagement 
defaultwith the police was not what they thought it should be.  We have really turned that around.  I do think he made a very valid point about engagement with the community, understanding community needs and delivering what they want.  That is why I did the internal audit for the service
default,
default and it has brought up the issues I talked about earlier.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ261default              defaultPaul Flynn:default HMIC said the Gwent crime figures showed 120 incidents that they were concerned about, and 
defaultgave 
default“cause for concern”.  Ian Johnston said, “I think that in Gwent we were so focused on reducing the recorded crime that we got away from providing the service for the people who pay the wages”.  He was clearly unhappy with those figures.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: On the focus of the force that he talked about
default,
default and the priorities around quality of service to the people of Gwent
default,
default he is absolutely right.  There has been a very strong shift in focus in the last six months
default in which 
defaultI have been in post as Chief Constable.  That issue around—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ262default              defaultPaul Flynn:default We are not talking about that.  We are talking about the period when you were a serving officer in Gwent
default. 
defaultThere was an astronomical increase—the highest increase in the whole of England and Wales
default—
defaultthe 15% figure
default. 
defaultWas that the truth
default, 
defaultor were those figures unreliable, inaccurate or fiddled?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I have talked about the reliability of figures throughout.  
defaultPaul Flynn:default I have some oth
defaulter questions to ask you on that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ263default              defaultChair:default May I help for a minute?  Chief Constable, how could you demonstrate why we should have confidence in that very large crime reduction?  Did you conduct an audit during that period?  Was there an external audit of that figure?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: HMIC did an inspection during that 18-month period, but I would say—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ264default              defaultChair:default What did it show?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It showed that we are up there as good
default,
default in relation to compliance around crime recording.  That is what was in their audit during that period.  
default              defaultPaul Flynn:default But there—
defaultJeff Farrardefault: Paul, I know you know this, but there was a huge amount of incredibly positive, hard work by our staff in focusing on those people who were committing crime in Gwent, 
defaultand 
defaultin changing the way that we structured the way that we did that.  A lot of that hard work was widely attributed to those crime reductions. Would there have been 
defaultmisrecording
default in there?  Yes, undoubtedly.  I have already said that there would be.  Do I think it was wholesale manipulation of the figures?  No, I really do not.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ265default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Why can you not tell the Committee what the HMIC said?  They said
default,
default about the crimes
default,
default “17 had been wrongly closed without a crime being raised, which indicates that crime recording in Gwent gives some cause for concern”.  They were unhappy about those figures.  The candidate for Police and Crime Commissioner was unhappy, and you are saying that they are okay; these figures were alright.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I am not saying they are okay, but if you look at those 17 and the reasons why they were 
defaultmisrecorded
default, there was no evidence in any of those that that was due to a culture that was driven through performance pressures.  It was all to do with the stuff I have talked about, which is lack of knowledge and awareness, IT systems, public interest and all of that in there.  It again broadens the reasons why that figure is never going to be 100% accurate.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ266default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Do you think the previous Chief Constable, Carmel
default&#xa0;
defaultNapier, did all that she could to guarantee the accuracy of those figures?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I think Carmel Napier was a very hard-working Chief Constable.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ267default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Then why was she sacked?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: She wanted the right thing for the people of Gwent, and I think Carmel
default&#xa0;
defaultNapier and Ian Johnston have both given evidence to the Home Affairs Committee about the period of time when she was the Chief Constable and he was the PCC.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ268default              defaultPaul Flynn:default I was present at their examination.  She did say, “We set up, under the Police Authority, a data quality and assurance group, which took the feedback from 2011 HMIC inspection of the force in relation to crime recording”.  She said, “As Chief Constable, I put all the mechanisms I could possibly put in place to make sure that both our incident and crime and anti-social behaviour recordings were as accurate as they could be”.
default  What more can you do now?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: You have already heard of what I have done.  I have trained front
default-
defaultline staff in relation to knowledge of the Home Office 
defaultcounting rules
default; they all get trained on appointment in relation to knowledge of the law, so they have had specific training around Home Office 
defaultcounting rules
default and what the standards are.  I have made it very clear to people what my expectation is around ethical crime recording and the standards I expect.  My Force Crime Registrar has a direct link into me
default,
default and in the audit group that I have set up
default,
default I have included the PCC’s office; we have had a conversation around it
default,
default and you have seen the evidence of that from the report that is public today around the inspection in the force.  I am open to any direction on what else I could do, but we have done everything we possibly can.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ269default              defaultPaul Flynn:default Were you acquainted with Ian Johnston before his election?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: He was a serving superintendent at the same time I was a serving superintendent.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ270default              defaultPaul Flynn:default If we look at the future on this and the past evidence we had, Mr Johnston is now a politician, not a serving policemen.  To get re-elected, he has to do what all politicians do and please the electorate.  He has already signed off on the fact that there was a 29% reduction in Gwent.  Add to that another 4% reduction.  Is the likelihood now not that if more accuracy is put into figures
default,
default it is likely to record an increase in crime?  Is he not under pressure to avoid that?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I am absolutely determined that crime within Gwent will be ethically recorded
default,
default and I will do everything I possibly can to do that.  That is a conversation that I know is shared by my Chief Constable colleagues.  If that means increased recording of crime
default,
default then so be it.  The one thing I would say about the Police and Crime Commissioner is never once 
defaulthave I had a conversation with him about re-election, 
defaultand 
defaultnever once have I had a conversation with him about numbers on crime
default—
defaultkeeping them down.  Every conversation I have had with the Police and Crime Commissioner has been about doing the right thing for the people of Gwent.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ271default              defaultPaul Flynn:default We have invited Ian Johnston to come to this Committee, but he was on leave at the time, as you are aware.  You have seen the evidence that we have had.  It is very powerful evidence that there are strong reasons
default, relating to 
defaultpromotion, getting resources and so on
default,
default to artificially report the crime figures—in fact
default,
default to report them as being lower than they are.  How do you react to that evidence that we had in our previous session?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It is interesting that you have heard evidence from a number of officers in the Metropolitan service—I know a chief officer from the Metropolitan Police who will be coming here—and some people who have not been in the service for some time.  On that point about promotion for inflating figures, I can talk personally on this, and for me that would be a reason not to promote someone.  I am running promotion boards in all ranks in my force at the moment
default,
default and if you asked, people would tell you that if you came forward with, “Look how I have reduced these numbers”, that would not be something that would be a feather in your cap.  It would be the contrary
default,
default if they were not ethically done in the right way.  
defaultOn what you have heard previously, I would say that I have talked to a lot of ACPO colleagues and others around the service since your first hearing.  Unequivocally, people have been aghast at some of the things that were said.  Take the comments on nodding, skewing and cuffing
default. 
defaultCuffing has generally been a term used in the service about somebody who is lazy and does not do their job; they cuff something.  That is not managerially driven, but just not doing their job
default. On the other terms, e
defaultvery single chief office
defaultr
default I have bumped into ha
defaults
default unanimously said
default that nodding 
defaultwas just completely unfamiliar to any colleagues. The description underneath it of nodding at houses could not hap
defaultpen now.  You have to do a PACE-
defaultcompliant interview; you could not write off crimes in that way.  The system would not allow you to do it.  
defaultOn s
defaultkewing
default, 
defaultI think my colleagues would tell you that 
defaultthat is 
defaultbehaviour they do every day.  They identify, based on the data they have, where crime trends are
default,
default and they deploy resources accordingly.  The evidence I heard on that was that there is something wrong with that, but actually that is what every police force does every day.  They move their resources around
default,
default based on demand within their particular area.  Skewing, nodding and cuffing really are terms that are completely alien to me and to my colleagues.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ272default              defaultPaul Flynn:default I have just one question.  Are you under more pressure now, with the regime of the Police and Crime Commissioner, to fulfil your work in order to get public approval by reducing those crimes that the public perceive to be the most important, rather than pursue your professional objectives of reducing those crimes that do the most damage? 
defaultJeff Farrardefault: You have known me a long time
default; 
defaulta lot of people have known me a long time.  I have 30 years’ service, and if I thought I was under that undue pressure
default,
default I would not be in the service—absolutely not.  Every conversation I have had with the Police and Crime 
defaultCommissioner is about doing the right thing.  That is the only service I could work in.  I would leave the service if I felt that undue pressure and I was not able to do that.  
default              defaultPaul Flynn:default I am grateful to you for that. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ273default              defaultChair:default Your last HMIC audit of crime statistics was in 2011.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: Yes.  
defaultChair:default What proportion of those 
defaultthat 
defaultthey audited turned out to be 
defaultmisrecorded
default?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I think it was 17. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ274default              defaultChair:default Out of?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I cannot remember the figure off the top of my head.  
defaultChair:default It is the proportion that matters, isn’t it?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It was about 10%. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ275default              defaultChair:default About 10%—which is exactly the evidence we heard from Police Constable James Patrick and the others.  It is exactly in line with the expectation.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: But within those 17, there were lots of reasons why they may be 
defaultmisrecorded
default—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ276default              defaultChair:default I understand that, but if 10% of crimes are not being recorded properly, is that not a cause for concern?  It was in 2011.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It is a cause for concern.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ277default              defaultChair:default But, you see, some of what you are saying suggests you are perhaps too keen to justify what is good and to explain what is good, and perhaps not keen enough to accept that there is a problem, albeit in a minority of cases.  To your credit, it seems to me you are making great endeavours to correct that in exactly the right kind of way.  Would it not be better for all the chief officers to accept that the compelling evidence we heard last month was indeed compelling
default?
default  It was backed by other independent witnesses, such as the Essex Police and Crime Commissioner, who said that even if we are trying to correct this, it is going to have a long tail on it.  You are correcting a culture.  How much would you say you are challenging and correcting an established culture with your
default code of ethics, with your good 
defaultpractice guide
default,
default and removing it?  Is that not what you are doing? 
defaultJeff Farrardefault: Absolutely.  On the evidence you have heard previously, I know a lot of my Chief Constable colleagues were aghast at those circumstances, and they did not recognise that within their locality.  It might be very difficult to assume, based on the evidence of some officers, whether there is veracity in that or not, that that is replicated across 43
default&#xa0;
defaultforces, because we are all very different.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ278default              defaultChair:default How unexpected is it, when confronted with an ugly truth, that Chief Constables will go into a huddle and explain to themselves that, “Well, actually, it’s not 
defaultnearly as bad as that, is it, 
defaultfellas
default?”  How unexpected is that?  Is that not what organisations do?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: I cannot comment for every Chief Constable in the country on that, but what I would say is my experience is that is not the way they would respond to something like this.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ279default              defaultChair:default How confident do you think all Chief Constables can be that they are actually being told the truth, and that you are being told the truth?  It is a very hard thing to accept bad stuff like this in the organisation.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: There is an inconsistency across the service in the message the chief officers send to their staff and to FCRs.  In some forces, the Force Crime Registrar regularly meets with
default the
default Deputy Chief Constable or Chief Constable.  In some forces, the Chief Constable or the Deputy Chief Constable might not even know their name or if they walk past them in the corridor.  
defaultChair:default Really?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: That would be the truth of it, yes, accepting that a force my size is a small force.  I have 2,500 people.  In a force that has 50,000 or 80,000 people, you would expect that to be different.  That is a really important point about engagement.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ280default              defaultChair:default We are running out of time here, but I asked you earlier what recommendations you would make about FCRs, and you said you had jotted down a few points.  It would be very helpful for this Committee if ACPO would go away and think about this, and perhaps send us a more considered note about how FCRs should be treated by Chief Constables, the kinds of relationships they have with Chief Constables and how the FCR should be part of the leadership, so that the ethical leadership and the statistical leadership are as one.  Is that not what we want? 
defaultJeff Farrardefault: Absolutely.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ281default              defaultChair:default That is not really what you have explained to me today.  I do not think your policy is very well-developed.  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It would be very helpful if I shared the letter I wrote to Chief Constables probably about eight or nine months ago around Force Crime Registrars and their role.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ282default              defaultChair:default What responses did you get to that letter?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It varied from different forces.  When I visited their Force Crime Registrars, a number of people thanked me and said that it had prompted it in their chief officers’ minds.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ283default              defaultChair:default How fair or unfair is it to say there may be a cultural problem in the attitude to FCRs right 
defaultat 
defaultthe top of some constabularies?  
defaultJeff Farrardefault: It is what I started with: it is hugely inconsistent across the 43 forces.  
default&#xa0;
default              defaultChair:default You have been very helpful to us today, Chief Constable.  We have asked you some pretty tough questions and you have been very honest with us.  I am grateful for that.  
defaultThank you very much indeed.  If you want to send us any further points for evidence, please do so.
