[normal]Unsafe abortion[bold] that each year causes around
[normal] 5 million women to suffer temporary or permanent disability
[normal],
[normal] with rates highest amongst poor and rural women. One in four women who undergo an unsafe abortion is likely to develop temporary o
[normal]r
[normal] lifelong disability requiring medical care.
[normal] Women who are dis
[normal]abled as a result of an unsafe abortion 
[normal]can
[normal] face 
[normal]particularly 
[normal]high levels of stigma 
[normal]or can
[normal] lack access to appropriate levels of care and support
[normal].
[normal] Disability 
[normal]resulting 
[normal]from unsafe abortion is preventable
[normal],
[normal] and can and should be prevented through the promotion of sex education, family planning, safe abortion services to the full
[normal]est
[normal] extent of the law and post
[normal]-
[normal]abortion care in all cases.

[normal]O[bold]bstetric fistula[bold], a hole in the birth canal
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]has severe physical and soc
[normal]ial consequences and a devastating impact on women
[normal], 
[normal]particularly
[normal] young 
[normal]women and girls
[normal] who are at most at risk.
[normal] 
[normal]The WHO estimates that more than two million 
[normal]young 
[normal]women 
[normal]live 
[normal]with
[normal] untreated obstetric
[normal] fistula in 
[normal]Asia and sub-Saharan Africa
[normal],
[normal] with 
[normal]50,000 to 10
[normal]0,000 new cases each year.
[normal] Obstetric fistula is preventable and
[normal] can largely be avoided by delaying t
[normal]he first pregnancy, preventing female genital mutilation/c
[normal]utting 
[normal]and 
[normal]ensuring 
[normal]timely access to obstetric care.

[normal]Persons with disabilities have the same SR
[normal]H needs as other people. Yet they often face barriers to information and services. The ignorance and attitudes of society and individuals, including health-care providers
[normal], raise most of these barriers -
[normal] not the disabilities themselves. In fact, existing se
[normal]rvices usually can be adapted easily to accommodate persons with disabilities. Increasing awareness is the first and biggest step. Beyond that, much can be accomplished through resourcefulness and involving persons with disabilities in programme design and
[normal] monitoring.
