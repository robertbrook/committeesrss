[[[Executive Summary]]]&#xa0;Over 63 years,&#xa0;UNRWA has become an agency that perpetuates the refugee problem rather than contributing to its resolution.UNRWA does not work to settle refugees; instead, by registering each day ever more grandchildren and great-grandchildren who have never been displaced from their homes or employment, artificially adding them to the tally of “refugees,” it adds to number of refugees nursing grievances. By now, these descendants comprise over 90 percent of UNRWA refugees.Further, UNRWA violates the Refugee Convention by insisting that nearly two million people who have been given citizenship in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon (and who constitute 40% of UNRWA’s beneficiaries) are still refugees.As a result of such practices, instead of going down through resettlement and natural attrition, the number of UNRWA refugees has steadily grown since 1949, from 750,000 to almost 5 million. At this rate, UNRWA refugees will exceed 8 million by 2030 and 20 million by 2060, its camps and schools endlessly promoting the futile dream that these millions of descendants someday will “return” to their ancestors’ homes in Israel. When even Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas acknowledges that sending five million Palestinians would mean “the end of Israel,” it’s clear that UNRWA obstructs conflict resolution.&#xa0;Can the elements of UNRWA useful to Israel be retained without perpetuating the refugee status? Yes, but this requires distinguishing UNRWA’s role as a social service agency from its role producing ever-more refugees.&#xa0;Section III.A.2 and Section III.B of UNRWA’s Consolidated Eligibility &amp; Registration Instructions allow it to provide social services to Palestinians without defining them as refugees. UNRWA donors, starting with the United Kingdom, should stop being accomplices to UNRWA’s perpetuation of the refugee status.The U.K.&#xa0;should treat UNRWA as a vehicle to deliver social services, nothing more. It should insist that UNRWA beneficiaries who either were never displaced or who already have citizenship in other countries, although perhaps eligible for UNRWA services, are not refugees. Establishing this distinction reduces a key irritant in Arab-Israeli relations.

[[[Submission]]]&#xa0;              (1) Led by the United States, the founders of the United Nations Relief and Works Administration (UNRWA), the agency tasked with oversight of the Palestine refugees, conceived of it as a temporary instrument to help relieve the plight of the Arab refugees displaced by the struggle over Israel’s creation in 1948. But over the ensuing sixty-three years, UNRWA has evolved into an agency that perpetuates the refugee problem as a source of conflict rather than contributing to its resolution. Its refugee camps and educational programs keep alive the impossible dream that millions of descendants of the original refugees will “return” to today’s Israel. Its social service delivery programs create permanent dependency and impede local integration into the societies and countries where its beneficiaries have resided for decades. Unlike its sister agency, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), which is responsible for millions of non-Palestinian refugees worldwide, it does not have an active program for “local integration” of refugees where they now reside nor “resettlement” in third countries. This special issue will explore the extent to which it has complied with its original mandate and ways and means for its reform.(2) It was not always the case that UNRWA stood in the way of local integration and resettlement. In its early years, particularly from 1949 to 1960, UNRWA followed a declared policy of “reintegration” of Palestinian refugees into the normal life of the Middle East, a term understood to include resettling large numbers of them outside Israel(3) UNRWA’s reintegration program was endorsed by U.N. General Assembly Resolution 393 (V), enacted on December 2, 1950. It called for “the reintegration of the refugees into the economic life of the Near East, either by repatriation or resettlement,” which “is essential in preparation for the time when international assistance is no longer available, and for the realization of conditions of peace and stability in the area.” The resolution also instructed UNRWA “to establish a reintegration fund ... for the permanent re-establishment of refugees and their removal from relief.”(4) In November 1951,&#xa0;UNRWA’s second director, John Blandford, Jr., proposed a three-year, $200 million program to reintegrate 150,000–200,000 refugees into their Arab host countries. Blandford’s plan was endorsed by U.N. General Assembly Resolution&#xa0;513&#xa0;of January 26, 1952, which tasked UNRWA “to explore with the governments ... their assuming administration of reintegration projects at the earliest possible date.” Seven years later, the concept was reaffirmed by U.N. secretary general Dag Hammarskjold, who called for the “reintegration” of refugees “into the economic life of the area.”&#xa0; (7) Today, neither UNRWA’s “Medium Term Strategy 2010-2015,” nor the official “Framework for Cooperation between UNRWA and the Government of the United States,” mention reintegration at all, nor do congressional appropriations of funds for UNRWA make allocations for reintegration as they did in earlier years.(8) Former UNRWA general counsel James G. Lindsay remarked that “neither the donors nor the General Assembly has pressed UNRWA on ‘reintegration’ in quite some time.” Lance Bartholomeusz, former head of the International Law Division of UNRWA, said, “This part of the mandate probably ended by 1960 when reference to ‘reintegration’ was dropped from General Assembly resolutions relating to UNRWA, reflecting some acknowledgment that this objective had been defeated.” And Peter Hansen, former commissioner general of UNRWA, said in 2004, “The agency’s mandate has repeatedly been refined and shaped by other General Assembly resolutions, which have allowed it to shift its focus from reintegration efforts in its early years to human development projects through to this very day.”(9) And so UNRWA abandoned its original mission of relief extension and conflict resolution, evolving into an agency for the perpetuation of unsettled claims against Israel for millions of persons born in the years attending the founding of Israel in 1948.(10) At its inception on May 1, 1950, UNRWA served approximately 750,000 persons whom it considered Palestine refugees. Due to natural attrition, many of those original refugees are no longer alive today and should have been removed from UNRWA’s registration rolls. Yet the number of “refugees” now registered with UNRWA has grown exponentially instead of declining, with almost 5,000,000 persons registered as Palestinian refugees—seven times as many as those registered sixty-two years ago.(11) This has been made possible through the addition of descendants of refugees (along the male line) to UNRWA’s refugee rolls, regardless of how much time has passed. Today, the vast majority of those classified by UNRWA as Palestinian refugees are in fact descendants of refugees, not persons who were ever refugees themselves. These are grandchildren and great-grandchildren born in Jordan, the West Bank, Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria—not in pre-1948 Palestine.(12) According to a projection published by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees extrapolating from UNRWA’s past growth rates, by 2030 UNRWA’s refugee list will expand another 70 percent to 8.5 million. In fact, at the same growth rate, by 2060 there will be four times as many Palestinian refugees as there are today and twenty five times the number registered by UNRWA in 1950—though none of the original Palestinian refugees are likely to be alive by then.&#xa0;              

[[[Projected growth of UNRWA Refugee Rolls]]]1950               750,0002010              4,880,3772020              6,432,5672030              8,478,434 2040              11,174,981 2050              14,729,159 2060              19,413,735 &#xa0;(13) This represents a drastic break with UNRWA’s early practice. In 1950, its first director told the General Assembly that the “agency has decided that a refugee is a needy person, who, as a result of the war in Palestine, has lost his home and his means of livelihood.” His definition made no reference to descendants.(14) Not until 1965, fifteen years after its creation, did an UNRWA commissioner general decide, against objections from the United States government, to create “an extension of eligibility, subject to need, to the third generation of refugees (that is, to children of persons who were themselves born after 14 May 1948).” And even then, he extended eligibility only to the third generation, the grandchildren. According to Benjamin Schiff, Commissioner General Laurence Michelmore’s motive was driven by a short term budget imperative to “enlist the host-states’ assistance in cut&#xad;ting the rolls ... he had offered a trade: If the governments would help rectify the rolls, he would be willing to ... add third-generation refugees to the rolls.”(15) In 1982, thirty-two years after its creation, UNRWA took another step forward by extending eligibility to all generations of descendants. It did so by obtaining a General Assembly Resolution instructing UNRWA “to issue identification cards to all Palestine refugees and their descendants” without any limitation on how many generations of descendancy this practice would continue. This momentous decision was adopted without a specific debate or separate vote in the General Assembly.(16) UNRWA went still further in 1992 by adding a provision that those descendants of Palestine refugee males who “are eligible to register for UNRWA services” and are registered with UNRWA, should be “referred to as Registered Refugees or as Registered Palestine Refugees” [AU: emphasis added? ??] though they do not meet UNRWA’s own standard of having lived in Palestine prior to May 1948. They are not persons “whose normal place of residence was Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948, [and] who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict.” In fact, fewer than 10 percent of today’s UNRWA-classified refugees were born before 1948.(17) Under U.S. law, a Palestinian who sought admission to the United States as a refugee on the grounds that his/her grandfather was a refugee would be ineligible for refugee status. The law specifically declares that a grandchild is ineligible for derivative refugee status. The standard form used by the Department of Homeland Security-U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services states that “A petition may not be approved [AU: emphasis added? Yes, added by me] for the following persons: ... (6) A parent, sister, brother, grandparent, grandchild, nephew, niece, uncle, aunt, cousin, or in-law.”  Other developed countries employ similar definitions.(18) Clearly, UNRWA’s definition of descendants of refugees as refugees is artificial and misleading and undermines any possibility of resolving the refugee problem in future peace negotiations. It manufactures fictional refugees who vastly outnumber the actual remaining 1948 and 1967 refugees. The real refugees are today only a small fraction of the five million nominal refugees registered with UNRWA. And five million is such a huge number that even Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas has acknowledged that asking Israel to repatriate this number “would mean the end of Israel.” (19) The United Kingdom is a signatory to and a strong supporter of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, as are 143 other nations.  That convention states that a person shall no longer be considered a refugee if “(3) He has acquired a new nationality and enjoys the protection of the country of his new nationality.” The United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR), charged with implementing the refugee convention for all refugees in the world other than those Palestinians covered by UNRWA, is guided by this principle as is the European Union, which provides that a “third country national or a stateless person shall cease to be a refugee, if he or she: ... (c) has acquired a new nationality, and enjoys the protection of the country of his or her new nationality.” When UNHCR refugees get citizenship in another country, they are taken off its list. But when UNRWA “refugees” get new citizenships, they are still considered refugees.(20) Most recipients of UNRWA services in Jordan have been given citizenship in that country, but UNRWA continues to define them as refugees. Of the two million Palestinian refugees registered in Jordan, all but 167,000 have citizenship under Jordanian law, which grants citizenship to “[a]ny person who, not being Jewish, possessed Palestinian nationality before 15 May 1948 and was a regular resident in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan between 20 December 1949 and 16 February 1954.” In addition, the law states: “The children of a Jordanian man shall be Jordanian wherever they are born.” Yet a great grandchild of a Jordanian citizen who was a Palestinian refugee, born tomorrow morning in Amman, is entitled to UNRWA refugee status for life.(21) Another peculiar practice of UNRWA is to classify its beneficiaries living in the West Bank and Gaza as refugees although the Palestinian Authority (PA) classifies them as citizens living in their “homeland” according to the Palestinian Basic Law of 2003: “No Palestinian may be deported from the homeland, prevented or prohibited from returning to or leaving it, deprived of his citizenship, or handed over to any foreign entity … Palestinian citizenship shall be regulated by law.” The PA also issues passports to its citizens, in accordance with the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles of September 13, 1993.(22) Almost the entire international community view UNRWA beneficiaries in the West Bank and Gaza as future citizens of the prospective Palestinian state, who already live in their homeland. U.S. President Bill Clinton told a Palestinian negotiating team at in December 2000,The solution [to the refugee problem] will have to be consistent with ... the state of Palestine as the homeland of the Palestinian people and the state of Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people ... The Palestinian state would be the focal point for Palestinians who choose to return to the area ...We need to adopt a formulation on the right of return that will make clear that there is no specific right of return to Israel itself … Return to the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and areas acquired in the land swap would be the right of all Palestinian refugees.   (24) For his part, President Obama argued in June 2011 that a “lasting peace will involve two states for two peoples: Israel as a Jewish state and the homeland for the Jewish people, and the state of Palestine as the homeland for the Palestinian people.” In January 2008, while a presidential hopeful, Obama said, “The right of return [to Israel] is something that is not an option in a literal sense.”(25) Even PA president Abbas told his negotiations support unit: “On numbers of refugees, it is illogical to ask Israel to take five million, or indeed one million. That would mean the end of Israel. … All refugees can get Palestinian citizenship [all five million], if they want to [for example, Palestinian refugees in Jordan may not wish so, while for refugees in Lebanon there is a need.]” Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, told Mitchell that the “Palestinians will need to know that 5 million refugees will not go back” to Israel. Abbas gave the U.S. mediators a paper proposing only a “symbolic number of refugees return” to Israel.(26) Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are already residing in their own self-proclaimed homeland, building by their own account the instruments of their future state. Yet UNRWA colludes in the practice of defining them artificially as refugees, encouraging unending claims against Israel that perpetuate conflict.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; U.N.
