[normal]It is important to note that the illicit trade in tobacco is not just a result of smuggled product. Illicit trade and subsequent tax losses can be a result of smuggling, re-direction, false declaration, and theft; of either counterfeit or genuine product. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]There is much debate surrounding tax losses and health issues caused by the illicit trade of tobacco in the UK each year. There is undoubtedly clear activity in the illicit market but until the UK implements a program to identify and manage the tobacco supply chain; losses will only be estimated, uncontrolled and illicit trade will continue and most likely rise.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Studies regarding illicit trade of tobacco in the UK show varied results but they all broadly mirror the global situation.  
[normal]Although since 2000 the Government’s action has successfully reduced the market share of illicit tobacco, 
[normal]the UK illegal market still remains above the average of other EU Member States
[normal]. 
[normal]Estimations made between
[normal] 2009 to 2012 by HMRC, 
[normal]Euromonitor
[normal], KPMG and the TMA place the UK illicit trade market in tobacco to be
[normal] 
[normal]the region of
[normal] 10% and 2
[normal]0
[normal]%
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The above e
[normal]stimated losses of £2 billion per year
[normal] are reflected in
[normal] a recent study by KPMG in 2012
[normal], which
[normal] estimated the UK illicit trade market at 16.4%
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The illicit trade in tobacco 
[normal]products is a global issue and
[normal] impacts 
[normal]UK 
[normal]government revenues, funds criminal and potentially terrorist activity and has the capacity to seriously affect the health of UK citizens through access to cheap cigarettes and highly toxic counterfeit products. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is the first international treaty negotiated by the WHO. It was adopted by the World Health Assembly on 21 May 2003 and entered into force on 27 February 2005. 
[normal]The WHO FCTC was developed in response to the globalisation of the tobacco epidemic and is an evidence-based treaty that reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standard of health. The Convention represents a milestone for the promotion of public health and provides new legal dimensions for international health cooperation.
[normal]The UK signed the WHO FCTC treaty on the 16
[normal]th
[normal] June 2006 and is now welcomed to adopt Protocols to the convention. The Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, the first Protocol to the Convention, was adopted on 12 November 2012 at the fifth session of the Conference of the Parties in Seoul, Republic of Korea, and is currently open for signature by the Parties to the WHO FCTC. So far 22 countries have signed the Protocol and this is increasing at a rate of approximately one per week, the UK has not yet signed. 
[normal]This Protocol aims at eliminating all forms of illicit trade in tobacco products by requiring Parties to take measures to control the supply chain of tobacco products effectively and to cooperate internationally on a wide range of matters. With a view to enabling tracking and tracing of tobacco products to curb illicit trade, the Protocol recommends that unique, secure and non-removable identification markings such as codes or stamps are affixed to tobacco products. Furthermore the Protocol requires that these obligations are not performed by the tobacco industry, but by an independent third party.
[normal]A Government Revenue Solution, commonly known as a ‘Tax Stamp’ involves 
[normal]marks
[normal] applied to cigarettes packaging and alcohol that provide evidence that 
[normal]tax has been paid
[normal] and helps to authenticate the product.  The stamp
[normal] or mark
[normal] helps 
[normal]governments 
[normal]to confirm the 
[normal]likelihood of authenticity quickly and easily
[normal]. In addition to a physical mark, a digital solution is implemented so that UK Government can interrogate and validate the data provided.
[normal]In line with the Protocol requirements these programmes offer a unique code that can be 
[normal]interrogated in real-time
[normal] and provide a complete history of the stamp and product. Furthermore the program will assist in the management and control of the supply chain and enable enforcement agencies like Border Force to meet operational targets.
[normal]Statistics show that implementing a Government Revenue Solution will meet Protocol requirements and help curb the illicit trade in tobacco. A technical report by the WHO’s Tobacco Free Initiative, states that 
[normal]in order to minimize tax evasion, up-to-date technologies should be adopted, and in particular a state-of-the-art monitoring, tracking and tracing system, including tax stamps
[normal].
[normal]The World Bank also recommends the use of tax stamps or markings amongst other initiatives....”
[normal] governments can adopt effective policies to control smuggling. Such policies include prominent tax stamps and local-language warnings on cigarette packs, as well as the aggressive enforcement and consistent application of tough penalties to deter smugglers”
[normal]In order to determine how best to tackle the issue of illicit trade in tobacco, De La Rue recommends that the UK Government should review and consider implementation of the WHO FCTC Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products. In addition, the UK Government should consider the wide range of programmes already implemented in other countries with evidenced benefits. 
[normal]Outside of the Protocol many countries have existing programs for tobacco, alcohol and pharmaceuticals. In 2011 there were over 120 billion tobacco stamps in use, with over 70 governments having tobacco tax stamp programmes in place to fight their specific issue of illicit trade.
[normal]Our experience is that the introduction of a Government Revenue Solution, combined with the steps proposed below, reduces illicit trade by an average of 10%, sometimes many times more. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are a number of ways to achieve this in a strategic and coordinated approach: 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]a. Tax policies and processes [bold]-  Ensuring that tax policies do not inadvertently create a market for illicit products
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b. Licensing &amp; controls [bold]              
[normal]- Preventing “leakage” from illicit markets into the genuine supply chain 
[normal]-  Ensuring that only authorised operators are involved 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c. Reducing demand [bold]              
[normal]- Removing the incentive to start smoking and providing cessation programmes 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]d. Law enforcement [bold]- Providing law enforcement teams with the frameworks, resources, technologies and intelligence required to target illicit operators 
[normal] - Ensuring that the penalties for illicit trade act as a deterrent 
[normal]- A coordinated approach that incorporates the latest policy thinking and technologies will help to reduce illicit trade. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Each of the above would have different costs and also revenue and social ramifications. De La Rue would not to seek to 
[normal]advis
[normal]e on some of the above.
