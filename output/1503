[normal]Written evidence from Leslie Bowman a councillor within Seaton Valley, Northumberland (TIC 035)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for the privilege to write this report on public transport and other related services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am Leslie Bowman a councillor within Seaton Valley, Northumberland. I do not officially represent the residents or the Seaton Valley Council in this 
[normal]report, but as someone who lives and works within this part of Northumberland and has an ear for the people of this area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Outline[bold]This area of South East Northumberland is poorly served by public transport and all pervious national and local government an
[normal]d has not provided a good sound framework for good, safe, relevant public transport service to this community of 5 villages. Example: Although we are not far from national rails services we have no links with bus services. Most of the bus routes have not c
[normal]hanged much since the 1930s even though people lives and work place have.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Public transport is provided by bus services operated mainly by Arr
[normal]iva and on one route by Go North 
[normal]East
[normal]. We have no rail service in the valley.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Action Required[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Bus Services[bold]&#xa0;[bold]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal] get many complaints about the Arriva
[normal] bus services as they are cut
[normal]ting
[normal] back o
[normal]n routes and isolating villages in the process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We need more bus companies in the
[normal] area to shake Arriva who has 95
[normal]% of the bus services and yes they must make a profit but must 
[normal]also service the community.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Cost of fares is extremely expensive and for families it must be back breaking.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We need a system of ONE ticket for all bus journeys
[normal] ( Transfare )
[normal] to get to your destinations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We need bus services to National Rail connecti
[normal]ons like 
[normal]Morpeth Station [bold]which provides mainline services to London and places south. Edinburgh and Scotland.
[normal] We have none.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We also need connections with 
[normal]a
[normal] rail service at 
[normal]Cramlington Station[bold] and Tyne and Wear Metro System.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We also need a connection with our local 
[normal]International 
[normal]airport 
[normal]Newcastle Airport [bold]([bold]NCL[bold].
[normal])
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The connections above sho
[normal]uld be for ALL of Seaton Valley not just the parts the bus companies 
[normal]like to have to make profits.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The residents of 
[normal]one village
[normal] would love a service to and from 
[normal]Cramlington[bold] and Station
[normal] as they do no
[normal]t have any service there at all. 
[normal]They never 
[normal]have done and will never see it happen under this present system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The quality of the buses must improve. They are to be quiet, comfortable, 
[normal]cooled in the summer with air con and cosy in the winter when bitter cold outside with air quality improvements.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We need bus actual running times at bus stops, just like many cities. More so because routes are longer than cities and traffic problem can wr
[normal]eck havoc on bus time tables. 
[normal]Mobile
[normal] phone apps with real time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We should be thinking Green Buses. Electric etc.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]All buses should be disable friendly
[normal] ie. 
[normal]Mobi
[normal]lity, Blind, Deaf, and other
[normal] less able persons
[normal]. 
[normal]At the moment 99% of bus services are NOT
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We n
[normal]eed bus shelters
[normal] and more of them, which
[normal] are clean, dry, good repair, with seating, lighting for nights and the winter months. Fitted with real time transport times. And a bin.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We need a rail service in Seaton Valley.
[normal] We have a famous line
[normal] going through 3 of our 5 villages
[normal] 
[normal]that was 
[normal]closed to
[normal] passengers
[normal] in the 1960s
[normal] (50 years ago)
[normal]. It is a mineral line at the moment and could be put back into passenger use with little cost, providing confections to Newcastle, Blyth, Bedlington, Ashington, an
[normal]d the county town of Northumberland and Mainline Station
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]Morpeth
[normal].
