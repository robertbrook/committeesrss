[[[1. Executive summary]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[2. Demographic change and prevention]]]&#xa0;2.1 The NHS is keeping people alive for longer. This is a success story for public health and the heath service and it should be celebrated. But it does mean there is rapidly increasing demand from the growing number of people living with long term, multiple conditions, at a time when the NHS budget is flat in real terms. For example the population of over 65s is projected to grow by 50 per cent over the next two decades.&#xa0;2.2 The effect of lifestyle choices, including smoking, alcohol abuse and obesity, on public health and wellbeing have also increased pressures on the NHS. The cost for treating diseases associated with these lifestyle choices is estimated at a cumulative £17.9 billion each year - almost a fifth of the annual NHS budget. They have also led to an increase in some long-term conditions. For example, the NHS spends almost £10 billion each year on treating diabetes, of which 80 per cent is spent on managing avoidable diabetic complications. &#xa0;2.3 The pressure resulting from these demographic changes is already apparent. The increased demand on accident and emergency services means patients are facing longer waiting times in many places. Demographic changes have also placed increased pressure on the social care system. Large numbers of people are experiencing delays in being transferred to the right sort of care. This can be distressing for patients and has a significant financial cost. &#xa0;2.4 The NHS therefore needs to adapt. In this submission we argue adaption involves developing services in the community and organising care more around an individual's needs. This will mean integrated care, including joining up NHS and social care. Equally the Government needs to find a long term solution to the funding problems which face social care. Significant long term changes are needed to improve the range and reach of social care so that people are supported to be as well and as independent as possible, for as long as they are able.&#xa0;2.5 More needs to be done to manage the demand facing the NHS in order to lessen the pressures on the service. A key part of this will be greater investment in prevention and early intervention services. While local authorities now commission most public health services, there is still a role in this for the NHS. Significant initiatives led by both NHS providers and commissioners have strengthened early intervention efforts in areas such as psychiatric liaison, alcohol and falls prevention. However, our members have clearly stated this sort of work has often been driven by certain individuals and it is not yet something built into the NHS system. We must ensure these initiatives become the norm across the health service.&#xa0;2.6 We are calling for the introduction of services which aim to take a whole person and community approach to improving health. These could for example include a combination of smoking cessation, weight management, or psychological well-being interventions such stress management. NHS organisations and local authorities should also work together through health and wellbeing boards to provide wellness services which take a whole person and community approach to improving health. &#xa0;2.7 Our joint report with Altogether Better, an organisation which creates and supports community champions,

[[[ ]]]Community health champions: creating new relationships with patients and communities,highlights one approach to community care where voluntary "champions" receive training to help their friends, families, neighbours, communities and work colleagues lead healthier lives. Evidence from this work shows an increase in confidence, improvements in physical and mental health and lifestyle, and increased knowledge of health issues. It has also been shown to have a positive return on investment. &#xa0;2.8 The NHS also needs to maximise the opportunities healthcare professionals have with individuals and communities to improve their health and well-being (the so-called “every contact counts” approach). We recommend that:&#xa0;2.9 Good child health is essential to the future health of the adult population. However, England has one of the highest mortality rates in Europe for those aged 0 to 14. The level of obesity among children remains high, with 19 per cent of children aged ten to 11 years defined as obese, and continues to rise. Planned care for long term conditions 'gives cause for concern' with many preventable asthma admissions and poor diabetic control. Improving child health would include making a preventative system a cross-government priority. Our report Children and young people’s health and wellbeing in changing times sets out in more detail the recommendations we have for improving child health. &#xa0;2.10 For young people with long term conditions, the transition to adult health services is a difficult time. Transition needs to be built into care pathways as a process rather than a discrete event. Local leadership on improving transition is also needed, for example, through a designated transition lead in each local area and clinical champions within provider organisations.&#xa0;2.11 Draft legislation on reform of provision for children and young people with Special Educational Needs includes provision for joint Education, Health and Care plans to secure personalised services across health, education and other relevant areas for children with a high level of need. For this policy to work well, all parties will need to understand the potential benefits of such policies and implement them in ways designed to secure these benefits. We were therefore pleased that pathfinders for this policy were extended, as it had been challenging for the NHS to engage with them during a period when PCTs were closing and CCGs becoming established.

[[[Integrating]]]

[[[ care around the needs ]]]

[[[of]]]

[[[ the individual]]]&#xa0;3.1 People with long term conditions interact with the health service in a different way than those with a single episode of care, such as a broken leg. Those with long term conditions will have more frequent contact with the NHS, often interacting with multiple parts of the system over a sustained period of time. Given many long term conditions cannot be "cured", the focus will be more on managing the condition and helping people to stay as well as possible for as long as possible. &#xa0;3.2 This all means that the health service needs to interact in a different way with patients than in the past and a key part of this will be to ensure that the various parts of the system are joined up to ensure that the patients' interactions with the system (or 'care pathway') are properly coordinated. This approach needs to make better use of resources and improve people's experiences by delivering the right care in the right place. This greater integration of care needs to involve not just NHS services but also local authority provision, particularly social care. It also means engaging better with patients as people with an active role to play in improving and maintaining their own health, not simply passive recipients of care. We welcome the narrative for integrated care recently set out by National Voices, which is helpful in setting out what is meant by the term integration and the recent announcement by the Government on integration 'pioneer' sites. &#xa0;3.3 A range of models have been developed by local leaders to fit local needs. The North West London Integrated Care pilot which we outline later in this submission is one example of the NHS implementing an innovative model of care which meets the needs of those with long term conditions. However, more needs to be done to ensure there is widespread adoption of these models. Our previous joint submission with ADASS and the Local Government Association to the Committee's public expenditure inquiry highlighted recommendations for ensuring this is the case. To help ensure integrated care is adopted at scale and pace our recommendations include:&#xa0;&#xa0;3.4 While there are a number of examples of integrated care which have proven benefits, the evidence base around which models work best in which context and how integration can be priced needs to be strengthened. A greater understanding of this will be essential for commissioners as they need to ensure that services are evidence based and improve patient outcomes. There are particular challenges around potentially complicated procurement and contracting arrangements which will need to be worked through if models of integrated care are to be more widely adopted. &#xa0;3.5 If properly supported in their development the new health and wellbeing boards could play a key role in securing integrated care. The fastest progress towards making integration happen is being achieved by boards that are attempting to understand and influence the delivery as well as the commissioning of services. Joint working in which providers are actively involved in service design and development and work closely with commissioners to secure the outcomes needed, is beneficial. In response to the potential tensions this creates in terms of board function and governance some boards are experimenting with different options for involving providers.&#xa0;3.6 As demonstrated below, self-care through technology is an increasingly important tool, allowing patients to mange their own care from home. Empowering a greater number of patients to manage their own long term conditions is also benefiting frontline staff by freeing up more of their time for caring. &#xa0;

[[[proving care through ]]]

[[[telehealth]]]&#xa0;Liverpool Community Health has combined an integrated care model with telehealth to provide care for people with long term conditions. The aim is to reach patients with a chronic disease much earlier in the process and avoid admissions to hospitals by giving patients and carers greater control. &#xa0;Patients who were identified as high risk were given a set-top box for their TV which transmitted data, such as heart rate and blood pressure, to a multidisciplinary health team, including a GP and community matron. The box allowed the team to monitor the data and make visits if there were any early warning signs of the patient's condition worsening. It led to a 73 per cent drop in emergency admissions for acute coronary syndrome and a 38 per cent reduction in bed days compared to previous years.&#xa0;3.7 If people are to manage long term conditions more effectively then care will need to be personalised around people's individual needs. Personal health budgets could be one way of doing this. Our work shows that take-up of personal health budgets should be driven by genuine demand from patients rather than quotas, learning the lessons from the continuing rollout of personal budgets in social care. Good advice and support for patients will be essential. &#xa0;3.8 Consideration could be given to joining up local authority personal budgets with personal health budget. Potentially this could enable integration at an individual, rather than structural level. As well as improving patient experience, aligning processes at the individual level, even if the staff, budgets and organisations remain separate, could save frontline staff significant time. The joint NHS Confederation and ADASS briefing Joint personal budgets: a new solution to integrated care? considers further the issues that need to be examined before joint personal budgets could be used at scale. &#xa0;

[[[ with long term conditions]]]&#xa0;4.1 A system-wide approach is required to facilitate the necessary shift in the balance of care to local settings, improve care coordination and make better use of limited resources. This will require risks and rewards to be shared and organisational interests set aside, for the greater benefit of the local health economy. A major shift in resources is needed to enable the transfer of care into community settings. Community services are often better suited to the needs of people with long term conditions as they enable staff to develop a holistic view of the needs of each individual and provide personalised and continuous, rather than episodic, care.&#xa0;4.2 We also need to develop payment systems that incentivise prevention, early intervention, early supported discharge and more integrated working. We would encourage the government, NHS England and other leaders in the health service to make this a key priority. &#xa0;4.3 With central Government funding unlikely to significantly increase in coming years, the NHS will need to make best use of the money already available to it in order to invest redesigning services. This could mean redistributing funds as done in the below example of an integrated care model, or considering using some of the money currently held in contingency funds. We need transparency around the reinvestment of existing savings such as from the ring fenced 2 per cent of clinical commissioning groups budgets or 30 per cent management tariff into demand management. For example, the North West London integrated care pilot, whose start up costs were funded by savings from the marginal tariff, has already begun to reduce admissions to accident and emergency departments, specifically for older people with diabetes. &#xa0;

[[[Case study – The North West London Integrated Care Pilot (ICP)]]]&#xa0;The North West London Integrated Care Pilot (ICP) was launched in June 2011 and brings together more than 100 general practices, 2 acute care trusts, 5 primary care trusts, 2 mental health care trusts, 3 community health trusts, 5 local authorities, and 2 voluntary sector organizations (Age UK and Diabetes UK) to improve the coordination of care for a pilot population of 550 000 people. &#xa0;The ICP was developed in response to variations in the quality of care and a rising deficit across the local health economy. The clinicians involved decided two areas of focus for integrated care: people older than 75 years and those with diabetes. These groups were experiencing a high level of avoidable admissions and variable care, there was known best practice and improved outcomes would be measureable.&#xa0;The ICP developed a unique model of clinicians working together in multi-disciplinary groups within a multi-disciplinary system. The multi disciplinary group (MDG) risk stratified the patients identified for the pilot, developed shared protocols for care across organisations, discussed these protocols and developed care plans with patients, mapped available care and addressed gaps in provision, introduced case conferences for patients with particularly complex needs or significant problems, and reviewed overall performance of the pilot.&#xa0;£7m investment was provided by London SHA channelling the funds from the 30% marginal tariff on 'excess' emergency admissions to hospital. This provided for an operational team, an information tool (to support risk stratification, care planning, sharing of medical information and evaluation), care coordination and incentive for providers to save. &#xa0;Some benefits have been seen relatively early in the pilot, though it is anticipated the full benefits would become apparent over a 5-10 year timescale. Based on analysis of the impact to date, the ICP hopes to reduce emergency admissions for people over 75 with diabetes by 10%. Patients are also experiencing better coordinated care across different providers. The aspiration for the pilot is to scale up to the whole local population, focusing on the 20% that drive 80% of cost.&#xa0;4.4 There is widespread agreement that more care in people's homes and communities, wherever clinically appropriate, is the right approach and can more effectively help support those with long-term conditions. Shifting care away from an acute setting and into the community was the second most frequently chosen priority area for respondents to the NHS Confederation's 2012 members survey at 63 per cent. A survey published by the Department of Health in 2012 found that 66 per cent of the members of the public polled in the survey agreed that moving services into the community can raise standards. &#xa0;4.5 As outlined in our 2013 briefing on the role for community healthcare in transforming local care, the community health sector is already driving the transformation of local care systems. Innovative community healthcare providers are enabling people to stay healthy and independent and avoid crises that lead to unplanned hospital admissions. Community services are moving the focus away from traditional models of healthcare in acute settings to nurse-led rehabilitation in, or closer to, peoples' homes, the provision of 'hospital at home' services such as diagnostics and chemotherapy, and community-based end of life care. Central to the community health model are prevention, early intervention and enabling timely discharge or transfer from hospital to improve recovery. The below case study highlights the strength of a community approach to a long term condition. &#xa0;

[[[Case study – community service for respiratory disease]]]A community-based respiratory team was set up in Hammersmith and Fulham to improve care for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The service put in place specialist support to primary care services, workplace-based training, a community based rehabilitation programme and community clinics. It also supports patients after their discharge from hospital and helped them self-manage their care. Benefits from this include reduced first and follow-up appointments, saving £170,000, 19 per cent reduction in admission to hospital for COPD and a 66 per reduction in readmissions. &#xa0;4.6 More needs to be done to achieve the scale and pace of change in order to meet the challenges of a long term condition. The Government and national bodies needs to examine how the current way NHS organisations are paid for their activity can be reformed to incentivise shifting more care into the community. The NHS also needs to redesign the way we currently plan and provide services, in order to shift more care from a hospital setting into the community and people's own homes. Such an approach will improve the quality of care provided to patients with long term conditions and has the potential to save money. &#xa0;4.7 It is important that a collaborative, whole system approach is taken to commissioning the services needed to support people to manage their long term conditions. Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) cannot do this alone. They need to be supported at a system level to work with local authority commissioners and NHS England. We remain concerned about the lack of clarity around how CCGs will work jointly with specialist commissioning housed in NHS England. We urge NHS England to set its plans out as a matter of urgency. &#xa0;4.8 Equally secondary providers and commissioners will need to work more closely together to play an active role in facilitating care in community settings and enabling people with long-term conditions to self manage. In addition, commissioners will need to demonstrate that the way they are commissioning achieves good outcomes for patients. Good evidence which demonstrates that care in community settings improves patient outcomes and saves money in the long run will therefore be essential. &#xa0;4.9 In the face of potentially unpopular decisions, health and wellbeing boards have an important advocacy role in making the case for change, especially where service reconfiguration and service closure is involved. However, though significant advances have been made at this early stage of the Boards' development, there remain considerable challenges to realising this potential. Board members will need strong communication and political skills. In addition, most boards already have a partnership of shared respect and understanding, but to effectively support service redesign they will need to go beyond this to become a cohesive, unified body in which overall strategic priorities are put above personal or organisational interests.

[[[The interaction between mental health conditions and long-term physical health conditions]]]&#xa0;5.1 People with long-term physical health conditions will often have psychological and emotional needs resulting from illness-related symptoms, disability associated with the physical illness, or the impact of living with more than one physical condition at any time. For example, depression is at least twice as common in people with diabetes, with an estimated 41 per cent of people with diabetes having poor psychological wellbeing, and many with psychological needs that do not meet the criteria for a formal diagnosis. Evidence shows that depression exacerbates the complications and adverse consequences of diabetes, in part because patients have difficulties with manage their diabetes. &#xa0;5.2 The NHS therefore needs to ensure that services are designed and delivered around the needs of an individual as a whole. It is important the mental health and the rest of the system work in a joined up way, particularly in developing and delivering integrated care for people with long term conditions. &#xa0;5.3 Failing to recognise the link has economic costs - healthcare costs are higher and productivity is lower due to reduced work performance, increased absenteeism and withdrawal from the labour force. For example, in the UK, individuals with co-morbid depression and diabetes are four times more likely to have difficulties in self-managing their health and seven times more likely to have days off work compared to people with diabetes alone. Evidence shows that addressing psychological needs of diabetic people through a range of interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or anti-depressant therapy include: reduced psychological distress and anxiety; improved mood and quality of life; improved relationships with health professionals and significant others; and improved eating-related behaviours such as purging and body image symptoms&#xa0;5.4 We believe there is considerable potential to improve quality of life and quality of care, and to generate service efficiencies and cost savings in this area. Our Mental Health Network has published a document which sets out the interactions between a number of physical and mental long term conditions. The document details a range of case studies which shows the work a large number of NHS organisations are doing to address both the mental and physical health needs of patients with long term conditions, and the benefits this work has. &#xa0;5.5 The report highlights that many individuals do not receive care that addresses both their physical and psychological needs. More needs to be done to recognise this and treat the whole person, rather than specific conditions. The report argues for a shift in the way we provide care to address this, and in particular more emphasis put on the self management of long term conditions. It also echoes the recommendation made by the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Psychiatry for all primary care staff to have psychological awareness training in order to provide whole person care.
