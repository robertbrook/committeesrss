"&#xa0;\nWritten e\nvidence \nfrom\n Transport for London\n (LTD0029)\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nTransport for London \n(TfL) \nwas \nestablished \nin 2000 and is the integrated body responsible for the Capital's transport system. Its main role is to \nimplement the Mayor\n of London's Transport Strategy \nand \nto \ndeliver and \nmanage transport services across the Capital for which the Mayor has responsibility.\n \nThese services include: London's buses, Lond\non Underground, Docklands Light\n Railway\n, London Overgroun\nd, Tramlink, London River Services and Victoria Coach Station. \nWe are \nthe owner and operator of the largest integrated transport network in Europe.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nTfL is a statutory corporation regulated under local government finance rules. \nA functional body of the\n \nG\nreater \nL\nondon \nA\nuthority\n (GLA), \nour responsibilities are set out in \nthe \nG\nreater \nL\nondon \nA\nuthority \nAct \n1999 \nand \nwe \nha\nve\n \nseveral \nsubsidiary companies incorporated under the Companies Act 2006.\n  \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nThe \nDepartment for Transport (DfT) is responsible for \nour \nfunding settlement and the GLA\n \nacts as a conduit for grants from the DfT to \nus\n.\n On 1 April 2013, part of our \ngeneral grant was replaced with retained business rates, under the Local Government Finance Act 201\n2 arrangements, payable by \nthe \nGLA.  \nThe Mayor \napproves \nour \nborrowing limit\n,\n \nin accordance with the Local Government Prudential Borrowing regime, \nand is responsible for setting \nthe general level and structure of \nfares in London. \n3.1\n              \nThe biggest transport infrastructure project currently underway in London, and notably in Europe, is Crossrail. It is a good example of a scheme that is being \ndelivered successfully \nin a multi-bo\nundary and multi-stakeholder environment.\n The delivery of such a project is dependent on strong stakeholder support\n, integrated planning\n and \nformal funding agreements\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nCrossrail is a new railway\n \nfor London and the South\n \nEast of England which\n,\n when complete in 2019\n,\n will be 118km in length, connecting Maidenhead \nand Heathrow Airport \nin the West \nwith \nShenfield and Abbey Wood in the East. It will consist of 38 stations and \nis \nexpected \nto \ncost £14.8bn to build. The Crossrail project is co-sponsore\nd by \nus\n and the DfT and \nis \nfunded from several sources, including Government grant, borrowing and other contributions\n, including contributions from businesses\n. Crossrail Ltd (CRL), \na wholly owned subsidiary of TfL, \nis \nresponsible fo\nr the delivery of the \nproject. CRL has its own Board, \nconsisting of \na majority of independent non-executives, to supervise the delivery of the project on time and to budget.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nThere was a strong business case for the project that \ndemonstrate\nd\n the need for a\n new cross-London\n route to alleviate\n \ncapacity constraints\n, relieve overcrowding on existing Tube and train services\n and \nreduce \njourney times\n. \nCrossrail will also provide a £42bn boost to the economy, generate thousands of jobs and facilitate business activity along the Hea\nthrow\n – the \nCity\n – Canary\n Wharf corridor.\n The investment \nin the \nscheme\n will unlock \ngrowth and development that w\nould\n \nnot \notherwise take place\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nThe success of the project depend\ned largely on\n a feasible\n long\n-\nterm\n \nfunding package being \nput \nin place. \nFunding was derived from\n \nthree\n primary\n funding sources\n: \nthe Government, fare payers and business\n, contribut\ning\n roughly \nequal p\nroportions\n.\n This is the first time major infrastructure has \nobtained \na significant business contribution.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nCrossrail \nha\ns\n strong political support at both Mayoral and Governmental levels. There \ni\ns also \nwidespr\nead public and business support\n, which meant that \nthe introduc\ntion\n \nof \nnew project-specific tax\nes\n, \nBusiness Rates Supplement \n(BRS) \nand Community Infrastructure Levy\n (CIL\n)\n,\n w\nas\n \nachievable\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nT\nhe taxation mechanisms\n, however,\n used to capture the contribution from businesses\n,\n cover the geographical area of Greater London only\n.  This \nmean\ns\n that businesses located outside the boundary, although benefiting from Crossrail, do not contribute towards its funding. Ideally, the construction cost should be borne by all who benefit from the project. This is easier to achieve in a suburban setting, w\nhere the extent of benefit across the transport route is easier to identify than on a project that crosses not only local authority, but also many regional boundaries, such as H\nigh \nS\npeed \n2.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nI\nt is also important to build \nlinks with the local communitie\ns that are affected by the \ntransport \nconstruction\n works in order to obtain local support for the project. This may \ninvolve \nagreeing local priorities and infrastructure schemes that complement the main project\n, often from other funding streams\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.8\n              \nThe project to extend the Northern \nl\nine from Kennington to Ba\nttersea Power Station \nalso demonstrates the importance of cooperation between national, regional and local \ng\novernment\n to deliver \na \nrobust \nfinancing and funding package\n. The package will include \nt\nhe \nGLA borrowing the\n initial financing requirement, \nand central Government and the London Boroughs of Wandsworth and Lambeth \nproviding the development-\nrelated \nfunding streams \nwhich\n will go towards repaying the upfront finance. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4.1\n              \nOur \nperspective on the funding arrangements\n \nfor major local transport schemes is likely to be quite diffe\nrent to most local authorities given \nTfL’s \nfunding context. \nOur \nfunding \ncurrently come\ns\n from three key sources:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nMajor schemes, such as the Sub-Surface Railway\n \nUpgrade and other parts of the London Underground Investment Programme\n,\n are funded by a mix of \nfares \nrevenue, \nGovernment grants\n and our \nprudential borrowing. \nA \nsubstantial revenue base\n provides an income stream to service debt obligations and hence make\ns\n debt\n-\nraising possible.\n \nCurrent\n \nfunding \narrangements fund\n both\n \nrenewal an\nd maintenance of existing transport provision and also, to some extent,\n \ninvest\nment\n in \nincreasing \ntransport capacity for the \nfuture. \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nOur \ngrants are set\n out in a funding settlement agreed\n \nduring\n Spend\ning Reviews\n. \nThese settlements provide some long\n-\nterm capital guidelines, \nwhich \nallow for sensible investment planning\n. Th\ne\ns\ne\n provide capital certainty for the first time and allow \nus \nto drive efficiencies through the Business Plan. While long-term profiles are extremely useful, change of Government and \nwider economic pressures and policies ha\nve\n led to changes to funding settlements in the past.\n \n \n4.4\n              \nSince \n1 April 2013, the Government \nhas \nallowed \nlocal authorities\n \nto retain part of the non-domestic rates receipts locally. At the same time, certain grants, \nincluding our \ngeneral transport grant, were \ncut\n. The new system gives \nlocal authorities\n \nmore incentive to promote business growth in order to increase the business\n rates receipts payable. \nAlthough it is meant to provide greater fiscal independence, the system creates a more complicated relationship with \nthe\n Government, which is still in control of the overall non-domestic rates policy \nand has the freedom to reset th\ne system at any time. This makes it difficult for local authorities to plan for long-term transport investment that relies on retained business rates for funding and/or financing.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nIn London, the growth in business rates is retained by the Mayor and al\nlocated according to his priorities. \nWhilst there is a risk that business rates receipts will not grow at a rate that fully compensate\ns\n \nfor \nthe reduction in central Government grants, there is also an opportunity to benefit from \nincreases in \nbusiness rates. \nProvided that the Government maintains stability in its retained business rates policy, \nthe GLA\n, together with other local authorities,\n \nwill have \nmore control over its \nfunding at a local\n level\n.  This is \nwelcomed by us\n, as part of the GLA \ng\nr\noup.\n&#xa0;\n4.6\n              \nWhilst the current investment programme in \nour \nBusiness Plan \nis estimated to\n meet the growth in London\n’s\n transport needs in \nthe \nshort-term, delivery of additional major transport projects that would both increase network capacity and unlock growth potential of certain areas of London \nis \ndifficult\n in a constrained funding environment\n. Government funding is limited and London\n’s \ntaxat\nion powers\n do not currently exceed the part-devolution of the business rates income.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.7\n              \nIn the past, we \nha\nve\n \nsuccessfully used a number of alternative funding sources to raise funding for specific projects, Crossrail being an example. CIL, Section 106 d\neveloper agreements and direct developer contributions played an important\n, but to date not the deciding,\n \nrole \nin ensuring that a viable funding package could be put together. \nThese funding options represent a step change from previous arrangements and \nprovide established mechanisms for generating revenues in the future\n where applicable.\n&#xa0;\n4.8\n              \nT\nhe \nNorthern line \nextension is the first example of a major scheme that is planned to be \nfunded \nentirely \nthrough \nthird \nparties – property developers and business ra\ntes payers. However, in the event \nthat development fails to occur and/or business rate \nreceipts\n do not materialise as planned,\n it is the \npublic sector \nthat will be required to bear the \nfunding \nrisk. The need \nfor the public sector \nto underwrite \nsuch third p\narty\n funding\n mechanisms\n undoubtedly limits the appetite of local authorities to undertake major transport projects that do not rely on Government grants as a primary source of funding.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.9\n              \nWe \nbelieve that\n,\n although some innovation in transport project funding has occurred\n, which \nis a move in the right direction, more can be done. What will help \nl\nocal \na\nuthorities\n to \nseek alternative funding sources\n \nto fund major transport \nprojects\n is greater devolution of ta\nxation powers and/or a Government guarantee of project funding\n in \ncertain scenarios\n.\n \nFinance \ncan be \nraised \nwithout sustainable\n \nfunding sources to repay the initial inv\nestment\n,\n however,\n this \nis of limited value.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;5.1\n              \nI\nt is important to understand what is meant by private sector investment.  New \nthird\n \nparty funding from the private sector, for instance through business contributions or the business rates supplement, does permit higher investment.  The provision of finance from the private sector does not, unless it brings greater efficiency\n,\n or a bette\nr risk allocation\n, \noffset the higher cost of capital.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nBefore \nwe \nobtained \nborrowing powers in 2003 under the Local Government Act, the main form of attracting private sector investment into \nsignificant \ntransport projects \nwas the \nPrivate Finance Initiative (PFI). \nFrom 2000\n, \nwe\n managed 13 PFI\ns (some of which \nwe \ninherited from predecessor organisations)\n, with a combined value of £18bn. \nSince 2003, we \nha\nve\n \nhad \ngreater access to alternative funding sources\n, coupled with a significant r\nevenue base\n, and\n therefore ha\nve\n greater flexibility \nto consider \nthe \nwider financing options\n a\nvailable\n. \nAs a natural consequence of this\n, we \nha\nve\n moved\n away from extensive use of \nPFIs\n, in part\n \nbecause the cost of both debt and equity finance from the \nprivate sector has increased substantially\n (particularly since the financial crisis), whil\ne\n the level of risk transfer remains constant\n.  H\nence it is \nour \nview that additional financing \npremia \ndo not offer\n value for money to the public sector\n as compared wi\nth alternative funding models\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nIn 2012, the Government relaunched PFI as the \nPrivate\n Finance 2 (PF2) initiative, looking to address the imbalances of risks and rewards under the PFI contract model. However, \nwe\n believe \nthat \nthe reforms did not go far \nenough to address the issues\n of financing \npremia \ncurrently being charged by the private sector and the\n \nlevel \nof innovation\n that a private sector PFI partner \nwould be \nfree to introduce fo\nr transport projects in London\n,\n \ngiven the \nconstraints required to ensu\nre London’s transport system \nremains \nintegrated\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nFor major projects, \nwe \ndevelop a funding and financing package on a project-by-project basis, looking at the best mix of public and private investment. Some projects lend themselves more easily to private sector investment than others. Currently, there \nare \ndifferent private \nfund\ning and financing sources\n that we \nmay draw upon: \nPFI, direct borrowing from capital markets, \nCIL, BRS, S\nection \n106 agreements, Tax Increment Financing (TIF) and sponsorship. \n&#xa0;\n5.5\n              \nIn order to attract private sector investment, \na project must\n \nprovide the \npr\nivate sector \na return\n from its investment. For example, in the \ncase of the \nEmirates \nAir Line\n, a substantial amount of sponsorship was secured for the project and\n,\n in exchange, certain commercial rights were passed to the \nsponsor\n. \nIn the Crossrail project, both the developer and the general business community recognised the economic boost that the new \ntransport link \nwill generate, and were\n,\n therefore\n,\n more willing to contribute funds towards the scheme in the form of additional tax \nrevenues and developer-specific contributions.\n In PFI projects, private financiers earn a predefined level of return \nfor taking on specific project risks.\n&#xa0;\n5.6\n              \nIn general, our \nexperience is that there is\n significant\n investor appetite for infrastructure pro\njects and\n,\n in particular\n,\n \nfor \ntransport \nschemes\n. Investors are looking for low risk long-term investment opportunities and infrastructure project\ns\n, especially transport, provide the right investment environment.\n \nT\nhis may not always\n \nbe value for money\n,\n \nhowever, \nas compared with Government funding or \nour\n \nown \nborrowing, when risk transfer \nto the private sector \nis limited and scope for innovation is low.\n \nThe p\nrivate sector will still expect a reasonable return and security of its investment\n \nand will look fo\nr projects that can demonstrate \nboth\n. This can be achieved \nonly \nif the \nGovernment \nacts as \na guarantor for the private sector investment return\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.7\n              \nT\nhere are limits \nto the extent to which private sector investment can be used\n effectively\n - not least because of the impact that such in\nvestment may have against our \nborrowing limits and more broadly, Public Sector Net Debt\n;\n but also\n \nif\n  private investment \nis generated over time,\n rather than upfront \nto finance a project’s construction\n. \nThe org\nanisation’s balance sheet constrains the amount of up-front finance that is available, even if funding can be secured \nover the long-term\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.8\n              \nA more radical examination of alternative funding streams was presented by the London Finance Commission i\nn its \nMay 2013 report, ‘Raising the Capital’\n.\n \n \nThe \nCommission put forward a case for fewer borrowing constraints and greater devolved tax powers for London, which would \nenable \nLondon Government \nto invest more comprehensively without the need\n for ad hoc, project-by-project \nfinancing arrangements.\n The Commission’s recommendation was to devolve both domestic and non-domestic taxes to London and pass the responsibility for setting the tax rates and authority over all matters including revaluation\n, banding and discounts to the regional level of Government. \nThe report also recommended \nlifting\n \nthe \nGLA’s borrowing constraints. Such a reform would increase the number of alternative funding streams available to London and could provide sources of both f\ninancing and funding infrastructure projects without the need\n \nfor central Government funding and \nwith more reliance on the private sector.\n  \nT\nhe \nCity Centred\n \ncampaign \nhas brought together the Mayor, London Councils and the Core Cities (Birmingham, Bristol, \nLeeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nott\ningham, Sheffield) to jointly press \nfor fiscal devolution to England’s cities\n,\n which would allow for increased power and freedom to fund local transport infrastructure projects.\n  \nGreater devolution to London and\n other major cities may be an avenue the Committee will want to explore.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n6\n&#xa0;\n London Finance Commission, \n‘\nRaising the \nCapital\n’\n, May 2013: \nhttp://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/business-economy/publications/raising-the-capital\n \n"
