"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Global Trading UK Limited.1.1  Global Trading UK Limited is a family-run packaging company based in Preston in the North West of England. The company has been providing innovative packaging solutions to UK supermarkets and high-street retailers for over 35 years. We are currently a leading supplier of recyclable, reusable, bio-renewable and compostable packaging.\n2.1  One of the products that we are concerned will be affected by the forthcoming bag levy is the Compostable Carrier-Liner. This is a strong, lightweight shopping bag which is specially designed to be reused as a food waste kitchen caddy-liner. \n2.2  Global helped to develop this product at the request of The Co-operative and the bags are currently  on sale at most Co-op stores in England and Scotland where food waste collections take place. The Co-op sells the bag at cost (for 6p). Sales to date have been in the region of 5.9 million bags per annum, although in 2014 the number of stockist was increased to 600 stores. The projected sales figure is now 15 million bags per annum.  \n2.3  By offering customers the option to buy this dual-purpose bag at the till, several million fewer plastic carrier bags are distributed annually by The Co-op.  The bag has features which make it highly popular as a caddy-liner and its availability has been proven to increase participation and retention rates in council food waste collection programmes.\n2.4  To build on the popularity of The Co-op bag, Global recently set up the Green Carrier Scheme (GCS). This is a new initiative to make carrier-liners more widely available at smaller shops and convenience stores throughout the UK. Under the scheme, councils will subsidise the 6p cost price of the bags to make them available to buy for just 3 or 4 pence. This is a third of the price of caddy-liners sold on a roll. Local retailers recruited into the scheme can make a small profit on the sale of each bag and can also save money by not buying as many conventional plastic bags.\n2.5  We believe that the GCS will:\n2.6  The GCS project has the support of several compostable film manufacturers including \nNovamont\n (Mater-Bi) BASF (Eco-\nVio\n) and \nBiotec\n (\nBioplast\n 500). The bags are currently made in Italy but could easily be made in the UK and this option is currently being investigated.\n2.7  Global (and The Co-operative) are concerned that the current bag levy regulations do not classify carrier-liners as reusable bags, because the secondary use (caddy-liner) is not a repetition of the original use (shopping). This interpretation of the word reusable means that carrier-liners could be treated as single-use carriers and subject to the charge.\n3.1  We are requesting that carrier-liners are classified as reusable bags and granted exemption from the forthcoming single-use bag levy. Our proposal is based on the grounds that they:\n3.2  We would recommend the following provisos:\n5.1   Global Trading UK Limited declares an interest as the current supplier of this product to The Co-operative. If the GCS concept proves to be successful, it is likely that councils would be required to tender for carrier-liner supplies. Global therefore plan to operate the GCS as a separate not-for-profit business and charge for consultancy, supply tender management (for quality control) order processing facilities, marketing and food-waste education.\n6.1   The food waste collected by Britain’s councils is sold to industrial composting companies who use it to create compost and bio-gas. Unfortunately, if the waste is contaminated with even small fragments of plastic it becomes worthless. Contaminated batches are generally sent to landfill which incurs a biodegradable-waste charge (at the council's expense) and the council can also face a fine from the composting company. \n6.2   The tolerance level for plastic in food waste has recently been reduced to 0.5 percent, so contamination is becoming a serious problem for an increasing number of local authorities. \n7.1   Councils have a number of options to help minimise contamination issues: \na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIssue a ‘starter pack’ of compostable kitchen caddy-liners, then ask residents to buy them. This encourages initial participation, but retention rates can suffer in the long term.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDistribute compostable liners free of charge. Doing this also encourages initial participation, but there are drawbacks in the medium to long term: \n&#xa0;\n8.1   In 2006, The Co-operative commissioned packaging supplier Global Trading UK Limited to create a compostable carrier bag which could be reused as a food waste caddy liner. Global worked with bio-plastic manufacturer \nNovamont\n \nS.p.A\n and developed the dual-purpose product. The bag was designed to be slightly smaller than a conventional supermarket carrier to ensure that it fitted caddies properly. The \nNovamont\n material used for the bag is a market leading compostable film, so it meets with the approval of most UK industrial composting processors.\n8.2   The product benefits:\n8.3   The Co-op sell the bags responsibly and they are only on sale in stores where food waste collection takes place and where it is known that the council will accept certified compostable liners. \n9.1   In 2007 Oldham Council entered into an informal price and availability agreement with the Co-operative and asked residents to buy the compostable carriers to use as caddy-liners. This resulted in a higher than expected participation and retention rate for their food waste programme. The partnership between the council and a retailer was the first of its kind and in 2010 the project won two environmental packaging awards. \n10.1   Although the availability of the Co-operative Compostable Carrier is increasing each year, it has become clear that the project would benefit from being extended to other retailers. Oldham Council was keen to pilot this idea, so in November 2013 Global launched The Green Carrier Scheme (GCS). The scheme is designed to appeal to councils with high plastic contamination rates, high disposal costs and low food waste revenue. The council would mitigate this by subsidising the cost of compostable carrier-liners to make them extremely affordable for residents and then incentivise local retailers to sell them.\n10.2   The benefits for councils are:\n10.3   Participating retailers can:\n10.4   The role of the GCS is to:\n11.1   In November 2013, Oldham Council started a trial of the Green Carrier Scheme. Food waste rejected due to plastic contamination costs the council £211.00 per tonne. The estimated total cost of rejected loads and loss of food waste revenue is £400,000 each year.\n11.2   \nTrial Method\n11.3   \nTrial Results (Westwood area)\n11.4   Participant \nFeedback\nA copy of the full report\n from Oldham Council is available on request.\n12.1   Although a compostable carrier-liner has the same shape as a plastic carrier bag, it has a dedicated secondary purpose which offers many environmental and commercial benefits. We hope that the process to grant exemptions for the levy will take these factors into account and allow the product to be sold without any additional charge.\nwww.greencarrierscheme.org\nwww.responsiblepackaging.co.uk\nwww.gtuk.co.uk\n23 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
