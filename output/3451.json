RUMA is an alliance of 23 organisations representing every stage of the \"farm to fork\" process.  RUMA promotes a co-ordinated and integrated approach to best practice in the use of medicines on farm by providing free responsible use guidelines for farmers and veterinary surgeons.  More information on RUMA can be found on the RUMA website \nwww.ruma.org.uk\n and a full list of members is a\nppended\n. \n&#xa0;\n2. RUMA believes that antimicrobial resistance is an important and complex issue that needs to be addressed globally as a one health issue in order to conserve the antibiotics that currently play a vital role in protecting human and animal health and ensuring the supply of safe food.\n&#xa0;\n3. RUMA is concerned that a precautionary approach, restricting antibiotic use in food-producing animals, which ignores sound scientific risk assessment is unlikely to lead to reductions in resistance in humans but could have serious negative effects on animal welfare and on the ability of farmers to produce good quality food from healthy animals. \n&#xa0;\n4. Food producing animals, just like people, are susceptible to bacterial infection and disease regardless of the system of farming.  P\nrompt and targeted treatment under strict veterinary direction enables effective control of disease and protection of animal health and welfare and food safety in all farming systems.  \nIt is, therefore, essential that antibiotics are available for food-producing animals to be used responsibly to prevent them facing unnecessary pain and suffering in the face of disease, and to ensure that food comes from healthy animals and is, therefore, safe for humans.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n5. Antibiotics may only be used on a farm in the UK if they have been prescribed by a veterinary surgeon.  They are used as:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTreatment of a sick animal or group of animals, when the diagnosis of disease or infection has been made.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTreatment of a group of animals after the diagnosis of clinical disease in part of the group, with the aim of preventing the spread of disease to animals in close contact and at risk and which may already be (sub-clinically) infected.\n&#xa0;\n(A useful comparison with human medicines would be where a child in a classroom is diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis necessitating urgent treatment of all other in-contact children).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTreatment of an animal or a group of animals, before clinical signs of disease, in order to prevent the occurrence of disease or infection.\n&#xa0;\nPreventive treatment with antibiotics should: \nonly be applied to animals diagnosed at high risk of bacterial disease, and  \nonly occur under prescription by a veterinarian on the basis of epidemiological and clinical knowledge, and \nnot be applied routinely, and\nnot be used to compensate for poor hygiene or for inadequate husbandry conditions.\n&#xa0;\n(A useful comparison with human medicines would be where a patient is given antibiotics before surgery to address the increased bacterial challenge during and after the operation).\n&#xa0;\n6. Like all medicines, antibiotics should be used responsibly, which means:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7. The current range of antibiotics authorised for use in animals provides a key element in the veterinary surgeon’s ability to treat disease and we believe that this range of antibiotics, including those considered to be CIAs, should remain available for veterinary use.  However, CIAs should not be used preventively or as first line treatment \nunless\n there is clear scientific justification to do so and, preferably, after the sensitivity of the bacteria causing the infection has been tested\n&#xa0;\n8. RUMA’s comments on the terms of reference, on which written evidence is sought, are set out in the following paragraphs.\n&#xa0;\n9. How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?\n9.1 It has been known for a long time that some bacteria can develop resistance to some antibiotics.  Indeed, there is evidence that bacteria have been developing resistance naturally for millions of years.  Since the development of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections resistance to these antibiotics has developed as the organisms are challenged.\n&#xa0;\n9.2 Despite using the broader term Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), the European Commission, European Parliament, EU Governments, WHO and OIE are primarily concerned about the efficacy of antibiotics to treat humans and whether the use of antibiotics in animals increases the risk of untreatable resistant bacteria in humans.  The Commission is considering what, if any, changes to make to the Veterinary Medicines Directive (2001/82) and the Medicated Feed Additives Directive (90/167) to reduce any risks to human treatment.\n&#xa0;\n9.3 Increase in the incidences of resistant bacteria causing clinical problems in human medicine both in hospital and the community.\n&#xa0;\n9.4 There is evidence that resistance can transfer between animal species but the consensus among the experts is that the main cause of resistance in humans is the overuse/inappropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine e.g. prescribing antibiotics for viral infections such as flu and cold where, of course, they have no effect on the virus, not completing the course of treatment, prescribing the wrong antibiotic for the bacteria involved.  The Department of Health 5 year strategy on Antimicrobial Resistance said \n‘Increasing scientific evidence suggests that the clinical issues with antimicrobial resistance that we face in human medicine are primarily the result of antibiotic use in people, rather than antibiotics in animals’.\n1\n&#xa0;\n9.5 As the UK’s CMO Professor Dame Sally Davies said in her annual report published in March 2013 “antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to modern health and we face a future without cures for infection if antibiotics are not used responsibly”.  This threat is being tackled by various initiatives in UK hospitals and GP surgeries to improve prescribing practices and reduce disease transmission and significant reductions in resistance rates e.g. MRSA in hospitals, have been reported.\n&#xa0;\n9.6 Although nothing specific has been reported in the UK, there have been isolated incidences where the resistance in humans has been directly linked to animal bacteria.  However, recent research has now questioned the validity of such claims.  A publication by Mather et al has shown that, contrary to popular belief, local domestic animals are unlikely to be the major source of antibiotic resistant Salmonella in humans. The result comes from a detailed study of DNA from more than 370 Salmonella samples collected over a 22 year period \n2\n.  Nevertheless, the animal sector cannot be complacent in its use of antibiotics but controls on this use need to be proportionate to the risks involved to humans and the benefits to animal health and welfare.\n&#xa0;\n9.7 There has also been an increase in reports of animal derived bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics although many reports are from research that uses a different, lower, cut off point to determine resistance.  This is known as the epidemiological cut off value (ECV).   \nIn most reports, human resistance\n is measured by the percentage of bacteria that are clinically resistant to one or more antibiotics.  This is known as the clinical breakpoint (CBP).\n&#xa0;\n9.8 Measurement of animal resistance\n depends on whether the pathogen causes disease in animals or whether the pathogen causes disease only when transferred to humans.\n- Resistance of \nanimal pathogens\n is commonly assessed by veterinarians on the basis of appropriate clinical break points\n- Resistance of \nhuman pathogens in animals\n is more frequently measured by the percentage of bacteria that are less susceptible to one or more antibiotics at the epidemiological cut off value (ECV).  The ECV is a laboratory measurement of reduced susceptibility and is set at a lower level than the clinical breakpoint and so treatment with the antibiotic(s) would still be effective even though the ECV indicates some reduction in susceptibility.\nIn real terms, the ECV is measuring reduced susceptibility, not actual clinical resistance (or clinical breakpoint).  The use of the term ‘resistance’ when speaking of ECVs triggers alarm bells in the minds of those who are not familiar with the differences between ECVs and CBPs.  \n&#xa0;\n9.9 Measuring resistance levels in human pathogens originating in animals using ECVs effectively leads to those resistance levels appearing to be higher than they really are when compared to resistance levels in humans, as the scientific methodology is different. This is highlighted by the European Union Summary Report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food in 2011\n \n(\nEFSA Journal 2013; 11(5):3196 [359 pp]) which for some bacteria found “\nlittle or no resistance is reported using the CLSI clinical breakpoint in any isolates from food or animals, whereas the situation is often quite different when the EUCAST epidemiological cut-off value is applied to the same isolates to determine resistance”.\n&#xa0;\n9.10 Harmonised techniques are needed across Europe (and worldwide) and across animals and people to allow for meaningful comparisons to be made. Currently, it is difficult to compare resistance levels in humans and animals, because the different methodology used means levels cannot really be compared with each other. \n&#xa0;\n9.11 Actions have been taken in some member states to limit antibiotic use in animals to reduce resistance in humans.  Latest reports from Denmark confirm the trends over the past few years and show that Campylobacter resistance to fluoroquinolones in man acquired domestically continues to rise despite severe restrictions on the use of this antimicrobial in veterinary medicine (DANMAP \n2012). The Netherlands (MARAN 2013 Nethmap Report) have shown reductions in animal use but continuing increase in human resistance.\n&#xa0;\n10. What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?\n10.1 We know that resistant bacteria can transfer between animal species but it is unclear how much of this happens and what the impact is on human medicine. More work is required into the pathways in which resistance is transmitted\n4\n.\n&#xa0;\n10.2 Are we able to reverse resistance once it has developed?  There is evidence to suggest that resistance in certain serovars of certain bacteria does become lower when exposure to the antibiotic concerned is reduced\n3\n.  More work in this area may identify other ways of reversing resistance.\n&#xa0;\n11. Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?\n11.1 The Chatham House Conference on AMR in October 2013 heard of the need to encourage more research into new antibiotics and alternatives.  There has been a significant reduction in the number of new antibiotics developed in the last decade and there are few products in the pipeline.  Product development is very expensive and cannot be left to the private sector as the return on investment is insufficient.  Public/private partnerships are required to provide the economic incentives for the development of new antibiotics and alternative treatments e.g. vaccines and bacteriophages, and the regulatory system needs reviewing to ensure that unjustified controls in view of the clinical crisis are removed.\n&#xa0;\n11.2 The European Veterinary Medicines Directive is currently under review with draft legislation expected early in 2014. One area being considered is antibiotic resistance. As a result of the radical measures being proposed by some to restrict or ban the use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine, veterinary medicines companies have been operating in an uncertain environment. The UK 5 year strategy recognises that regulatory uncertainty acts as a disincentive to new investment. Companies need regulatory certainty so that they can plan their businesses, including their research and development pipeline.  Other measures that could create a more favourable environment for the development of new antibiotics or alternatives to antibiotics include increased data protection, allowing companies a longer time period to achieve a return on their investment before generic copies of their products could be made, and a more harmonised European regulatory system for veterinary medicines.  Another option is private/public partnerships to develop new classes of antibiotics.  Similar arrangements are in place to encourage companies to invest in exotic notifiable disease vaccine banks where the vaccines may not be used, except for exceptional circumstances, yet the development of these medicines is needed. \n&#xa0;\n11.3 Practical (pen side) and affordable diagnostic tests to allow vets (and doctors) to determine antibiotic susceptibility quickly and, therefore, which one to use, improving the evidence base for selection of the correct antibiotic. \n&#xa0;\n11.4 There is a need for intensified research activity to develop alternatives to antimicrobial use.  In particular, more vaccine development to prevent disease and the need to use antimicrobial treatments and more research into alternatives, such as bacteriophages, so that antimicrobial use is reduced.  This research must include food producing animals so that vets have access to products that can be used in animals without creating risks to consumers.\n&#xa0;\n12. What measures (including behavioural change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens?\n12.1 Professional and public education on the responsible use of antibiotics in all sectors e.g. \n&#xa0;\n13. What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?\n13.1 Resistance is a global issue and bacteria can transfer between countries easily in humans, animals, food, feed etc.   WHO, OIE and EC are working together and UK is playing an active role in developing strategies and action plans.  For example, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate chairs the EU’s Heads of Medicines [Regulatory] Agencies’ Veterinary Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance. The Chatham House Conference heard that action plans have to respect the starting point in developing countries as applying ideal controls, especially on prescription and supply of antibiotics, can be impractical.  The Chennai Declaration (www.chennaideclaration.org) in India applies controls only to the supply and use of CIAs after attempts to control all antibiotic use failed. \n&#xa0;\n13.2 The Transatlantic Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance was tasked with increasing the mutual understanding of US and EU activities and programmes relating to antimicrobial issues, and promoting information exchange, coordination and co-operation between the US and the EU.\n&#xa0;\n13.3 RUMA, through its member organisations, is working with its EU counterparts to promote the responsible use of medicines in agriculture across the EU and was instrumental in the establishment of the European Platform for Responsible Use of Medicines in Animals (EPRUMA).  \n&#xa0;\n14. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?\n14.1 The strategy is an excellent well balanced document that identifies proportionate action in all sectors to control AMR development.\n&#xa0;\n14.2 More detail is needed on how the activities of organisations such as RUMA could raise their profile and carry out more training on disease prevention and responsible use and how this could be funded, including state support as is provided in the human medical sector. Regulatory authorities should look at ways to gather additional data about the usage of antibiotics at an individual vet practice and farm level in an efficient, user friendly and low cost manner.  The veterinary sector is different from the human medical sector, in that there is not one source of the majority of the required data i.e. the NHS. The development of a simple system for gathering data at the individual vet practice and farm level would assist with the aims of the strategy but this must be done in an efficient manner as it is dependent on a large number of small businesses assisting the authorities in their aims. \n&#xa0;\nReferences: \n&#xa0;\n1.  Point 2.1, page 8, Department of Health UK 5 Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy 2013 to 2018. \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-5-year-antimicrobial-resistance-strategy-2013-to-2018\n  \n&#xa0;\n2.
