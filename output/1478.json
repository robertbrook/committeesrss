"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Kimberly Gilmpour (WSC106)Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?\n&#xa0;\nThe number of women in STEM academic careers decline as women move up the career ladder for both professional and personal reasons.  There are limited senior women to \nact as mentors and role models for junior women. This is particularly true for senior women with children. Many senior women chose not to have children and therefore the predominant role model if that of a childless scientist. This may not be true, but it \nis the perceived image. Also, scientific research often requires working at odd hours and this is not always compatible with having children or other (older parents) caring responsibilities.\nWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? \nWhat are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?\nMany women transition to careers where they can use their scientific skills in a different context. These careers include journalism; medical w\nriting/editing, working for a pharmaceutical/clinical trials company where they can work fixed hours, and teaching. Their scientific skills re useful/required in all these sectors.\nWhat should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women\n graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?\nCancer research UK when it was ICRF had a maternity program where a woman took 4 months full pay maternity leave, then returned to work ½ time on full pay for an addition\nal 2 months before returning back full-time. \nThis encouraged woman\n to take slightly shorted maternity leave and \nencouraged\n them to write papers, startup cell lines/mouse experiments during the 2 month ½ time transition periord. It also meant that women did\nn’t ‘fall behind’ their male colleagues when they \nhad\n \nchildren.\nWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? \nThe government should encourage alternative patterns of work and leave. Currently women fe\nel they should to take 6-9 months maternity leave and few companies offer financial incentive for women taking shorter leave periods. Greater flexibility of sharing leave with the other partner (not just some of it, but all of it) would help. \nAugust 201\n3\n&#xa0;\n"
