"LGO 14\nSubmission from Mr &amp; Mrs G Thomas&#xa0;\nI wish to \nsubmit written evidence to the select committee enquiry on the consequences of the local government Ombudsman giving incorrect information.\n&#xa0;\nWe have lived at the above address for 12 years and entry to our property is down a very narrow lane. The lane is \npart publicly maintained highway and part forestry track with a prescriptive rights-of-way.\n&#xa0;\nIn October 2011 our neighbour built a boundary wall which encroached onto the lane reducing the width by over 20% and now impedes the emergency services.\n&#xa0;\nWe inform\ned the authorities and a cessation of works was issued in the December\n 2011\n. After 7 months of inaction I was advised by my local authority to follow the Highways Act 1980. In October 2012  I phoned the Local Government Ombudsman for advice.\n&#xa0;\nI was advised \nto follow the complaints procedure through my local authority and if the issue was not resolved or I was not happy with the outcome then I could make an official complaint to the Ombudsman.\n&#xa0;\nListed below are the results of this procedure.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n17-10-12. Stage 1 complaint\n2.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n18-10-12. Acknowledgement\n3.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n30-10-12. Apologies for no action\n4.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n02-11-12. Acknowledgement\n5.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n14-11-12. Stage 1 reply\n6.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n15-01-13. Stage 2 complaint.\n7.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n15-01-13. Acknowledgement.\n8.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n17-01-13. Acknowledgement\n9.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n29-01-13. Stage 2 reply.\n10.\n&#xa0;\n \n11-02-13. Stage 3 complaint.\n11.\n&#xa0;\n \n11-02-13. Acknowledgement\n12.\n&#xa0;\n \n15-03-13. Stage 3 reply.\n13.\n&#xa0;\n \n07-03-13. Complaint to Ombudsman.\n14.\n&#xa0;\n \n14-04-13. Acknowledgement\n15.\n&#xa0;\n \n14-04-13. Completed complai\nnt form\n16.\n&#xa0;\n \n15-04-13. Allocation of complaint\n17.\n&#xa0;\n \n30-04-13. Letter of fact sheet\n18.\n&#xa0;\n \n30-04-13. Letter from investigating officer.\n19.\n&#xa0;\n \n30-04-13. Fact sheet G2.\n20.\n&#xa0;\n \n21-05-13. E-mail provisional review\n21.\n&#xa0;\n \n21-05-13. Letter provisional review\n22.\n&#xa0;\n \n21-05-\n13. Provisional view\n23.\n&#xa0;\n \n23-05-13. E-mail from investigating officer.\n24.\n&#xa0;\n \n23-05-13. Reply to investigating officer.\n25.\n&#xa0;\n \n23-05-13. Supporting statement.\n&#xa0;\nThe above covered a period of over seven months and contains 51 A4 documents involving many \ndepartments incurring costs to the public purse and costs to myself.\n&#xa0;\nThe result of this complaints procedure was that my complaint was outside the Ombudsman’s adjudication.\n&#xa0;\nI would like to offer this evidence to the select committee review on the grounds \nthat a large amount of money, both mine and the public’s, could have been saved if I had been given the correct advice on 17th October 2012.\n&#xa0;\nAfter experiencing the above, and the waste of time, energy and public money, I have come to the conclusion that \nif a member of the general public has a complaint against their local authority then there should be a mechanism in place to determine if the local government Ombudsman can investigate that complaint. \n&#xa0;\nBy following the advice of the local authority I prev\nented the Local Government Ombudsman being able to investigate my case. In turn the Ombudsman advised me to follow a procedure that was outside his jurisdiction. He did not advise me of this loss of right or tell me about Fact Sheet G2 (which I finally rec\neived 30\nth\n April 2013, 6 months after I first approached the Ombudsman) before I started my complaints procedure.\n&#xa0;\nIf the select committee require any supporting evidence to the above statement I will be more than happy to supply it.\n&#xa0;\nIf the select committe\ne would like me to give oral evidence I will also be more than happy to accommodate.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nListed below is all the documented evidence in date order.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt ha\ns now been over two years and this unlawful, wilful, obstruction of our Lane still remains. It seems I can do nothing about this and it has cost me £7500 to find this out because of incorrect advice from Government departments. Is this fair? \n&#xa0;\nExclusive summary&#xa0;\nReport a crime - lose your home\n&#xa0;\nThe Local Authority can give you information that will exclude the Local Government Ombudsman’s right to investigate your complaint and then the Ombudsman can do the same thing. This has resulted in my case, in me be\ning about to lose my home.\n&#xa0;\n16th November 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
