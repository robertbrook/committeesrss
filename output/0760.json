"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the ME Association (LTC 13)&#xa0;1 The ME AssociationTh\nis is the submission from Th\ne ME Association (MEA)\n. The MEA is a national charity that provides information and \nsupport for people who have ME (\nmyalgic\n encephalomyelitis/encephalopathy)\n and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)\n. \nIt \nalso funds research into the cau\nse and management of ME/CFS through the MEA Ramsay Research Fund.\n2 SummaryThe key points being made in this submission relate to:\n3 ME/CFS \n3\n.\n1\n \nEven though the clinical desc\nriptions are different, ME is\n also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and post-viral fa\ntigue syndrome (PVFS)\n.\n \nThere is a great deal of \nconfusion and \ndebate over\n nomenc\nlature and definition.\n \nF\nor the purpose of this submission\n, we will refer to\n the commonly used composite term of ME/CFS.\n3\n.\n2\n \nME\n/CFS is thought to affect at least\n 250,000 people in the UK.\n \nIt affects all age groups, including children and adolescents\n where it has been identified as\n one of the common\nest causes of long-\nterm sickness absence from school.\n \nThe most common age of onset is\n between 20 and 40 years of age in adults and 11 to 14 in children.\n3\n.\n3\n \nME/CFS\n affects all social classes and ethnic groups.\n3\n.\n4 \nME/CFS is \nrecognised\n to be\n a neurological disorder by the World Health \nOrganisation\n (in section G 93.3 of ICD10) – a classification that is accepted by the Department of Health.\n3\n.\n5 \nIn the majority of cases the illness affects fit and healthy people who predate\n the onset of their illness to \na\nn acute\n viral infection\n, or some other immune system stressor,\n \nbut\n then\n ‘fail to recover’.\n \n3\n.\n6\n \nThe key symptoms include\n:\n3\n.\n7 \nMore serious neurological symptoms occur in a minority of people with ME/CFS, especially those at the severe end of the spectrum.\n \nThese may include blackouts, atypical convulsions, loss of speech, loss of swallowing – which may require assisted feeding.\n3\n.\n8\n \nR\neports into the illness – from the Chief Medical Officer\n \n(R1\n)\n, Medical Research Council\n \n(R2)\n, NICE\n \n(R3)\n, Royal Medical Colleges\n (R4)\n – have all \nrecognised\n the serious and persisting ill health and disability that is caused by ME/CFS\n along with an \nurgent need to provide hospital-\nbase\nd\n referral \nservices and carry out research into both cause and management\n.\n3\n.\n9 \nAround a quarter of all people with ME/CFS fall into the severely a\nffected category – meaning \nthey are housebound, wheelchair-bound\n or bed-bound at significant\n stage\ns\n in the illness.\n3\n.\n10\n \nResearch into prognosis indicates that \nwhile many people with ME/CFS stabilize \nonly a smal\nl minority\n return to normal or near normal levels of health.\n \nMost people experience a significant degre\ne of long-\nterm ill health and disability.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.\n11\n \nThe annual cost to the UK economy \nin relation to medical costs, benefit payments and lost revenue \nhas been estimat\ned to be around £3.5 billion (R5\n).\n&#xa0;\n4 Management&#xa0;4\n.\n1\n \nWe would like to bring to the attention of the Health Committee a number of concerns in relatio\nn to the management of ME/CFS. Some are shared with other long-term conditions whereas others are unique to ME/CFS.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.\n2\n \nThese concerns are repe\natedly raised by people with\n ME/CFS. They have also have been raised on numerous occasions in both the House of Comm\nons and the House of Lords, \nin meetings of the All \nParty Parliamentary Group on ME, which is Chaired by Annette Brooke MP, \nin adjournment debates, \nand in a joint charity forum (Forward ME Group) that is chaire\nd by the Countess of Mar\n.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.\n3 \nUnfortunately, very little progress has been made in addressing \nthese concerns.\n \nA\nnd in relation to some aspects of management\n \nand NHS service provision \nthe position has become worse.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.\n4 \nThe key\n points that we wish to make cover all points in the patient journey from diagnosis\n right\n through to management and support\n.\n&#xa0;\n5 Lack of epidemiological data&#xa0;5\n.\n1 \nHealth service commissioners do not have meaningful epidemiological data on the prevalence and incidence of ME/CFS\n – information that is vital\n for \ncommissioners\n in order to plan appropriate levels of service\n provision\n.\n \nSub\nm\nissions from \nprimary care trusts \n(\nPCTs\n)\n to the \n2010 \nAPPG report on NHS Service Provision\n (R6) \nconfirmed that they do not have accurate patient numbers\n.\n \nThere is\n therefore\n an urgent need for\n \na comprehensive and accurate\n epidemiological study to ascertain the true extent of both diagnosed and undiagnosed ME/CFS.\n&#xa0;\n6 Delay in diagnosis&#xa0;6\n.\n1\n \nMany doctors lack the necessary knowledge and experience to confidently diagnose ME/CFS.\n \nDue to the historical background\n, some doctors sti\nll refuse to accept that ME/CFS exists as a clinical entity or are unwilling to use it as a diagnostic label.\n \nConsequently, a significant proportion of people with ME/CFS remain undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, or have to wait for an unacceptable period of time before the diagnosis is made.\n \n&#xa0;\n6\n.\n2\n \nA report by the ME Alliance (R\n7\n) found that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6\n.\n3\n \nAs a result\n,\n people with ME/CFS\n \noften \nreceive inappropriate or even harmful advice on management \nfor a considerable period of time \n– which has a very negative impact on \nall aspects of management and the \noverall prognosis\n.\n \n7 Lack of medical education&#xa0;\n7\n.\n1\n \nMuch of the\n problem\n relating to diagnostic delay and bad initial management\n relates to the lack o\nf medical education about ME/CFS\n at both an undergraduate and postgraduate level.\n \n&#xa0;\n7\n.\n2\n \nOrganisations\n that are responsible for medical education – Medical Schools, Royal Colleges, General Medical Council – must therefore take a much more proac\ntive role to ensure that all health professionals\n in training \n– doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists - \nsee people with this illness and receive appropriate teaching on clinical assessment and management.\n&#xa0;\n8 Heterogeneity of ME/CFS&#xa0;8\n.\n1\n \nME/CFS is a heterogeneous condition – both from the point of view of clinical presentation and factors that are involved in causation\n and perpetuation\n.\n \nConsequently, any management \nprogramme\n must be linked to individual symptoms, severity of symptoms, and any other issues that may be involved in maintaining the illness – there is no place for a\nn inflexible\n ‘one size fits all’ \nor an overly centralized \napproach.\n \n&#xa0;\n9 Lack of hospital-based referral services&#xa0;9\n.\n1\n \nThere is currently a worrying lack of consistency\n in the way in which hospital-\nbased referral services are organized for patients with ME/CFS, or where there is a possible diagnosis of ME/CFS.\n \nThis was one of the main conclus\nions in the report on NHS Se\nr\nvice Provision that was prepared by the APPG on ME\n.\n \nThe report noted that:\n&#xa0;\nThe APPG finds the degree of variation in the availability of and access to services unacceptable.\n \nPatient evidence also indicates people want services that are physician led, multidisciplinary, and are situated in locations that are accessible to those with significant mobility problems.\n&#xa0;\nThe APPG recommend the \nDoH\n tak\ne\ns steps to remedy the variation and ensure that each PCT offers a range of services promptly – a process that should involve meaningful consultation with local patients or patient support groups.\n&#xa0;\n10 Lack of services for children and adolescents&#xa0;\n10\n.\n1\n \nIn relation to children and adolescents the\n situation is even worse\n.\n \nThis is largely\n due to the fact that\n most of the existing NHS referral services only provide diagnosis and management to people over the age of 16.\n \nThe APPG report \nconcluded\n:\n&#xa0;\nThis is \nunacceptable and can lead to tragic consequences\n&#xa0;\n10\n.\n2\n \nThe APPG report went on to recommend that all involved should:\n&#xa0;\nUndertake a detailed review of current\n servi\nces for children and adolescents to ensure that all receive adequate care and that all decisions are made in conjunction with personal \ncarers\n, education authorities and social services where appropriate.\n&#xa0;\n10\n.\n3\n \nDespite these\n very clear recommendation\ns\n there has been no \nmeaningful \naction from\n the vast majority of\n PCTs since 2010 \n– \nand in some locations \nwhere \nspecialist referral services h\nave been \nset up these have later been \ndowngraded or closed. This is clearly an unacceptable situation\n that\n must now be addressed by the new Clinical Commissioning Groups\n.\n&#xa0;\n11 Lack of services for people with severe ME/CFS&#xa0;11.1\n \nAs already noted, approxi\nmately 25% of people with ME/CFS\n will be classified as being severely affected at some stage in their illness.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, this group\n have great difficulty in accessing hospital \n-\nbased services, \nand \nare not normally offered any form of home \n- \nbased domicil\ni\nary service. Dedicated in-patient beds for the assessment \nand mana\ngement of people with severe ME\n/CFS are almost non-\nexisten\nt.\n \nConsequently, many people at\n the severe end of the spectrum receive no NHS care at all – a situation that is clearly inconsistent with the NICE guideline\n on ME/CFS\n.\n&#xa0;\n11.2\n \nThe APPG report concluded:\n&#xa0;\nSpecialist referral services must ensure that high priority is given to the needs of the severely affected, especially in relation to domiciliary services and in patient facilities for assessment and management\n \n&#xa0;\n12 The NICE guideline on ME/CFS&#xa0;12\n.\n1\n \nThe current \n(2007) \nNICE guideline for the management of ME/CFS has been heavily criticized by people with ME/CFS\n, and the charities,\n \non the grounds that it places far too much emphasis on the use of two \nbehavioural\n interventions – graded exercise therapy\n (GET)\n \nand cognitive \nbehaviour\n therapy (CBT) \n– that are \nconsistently \nfound to be either ineffective or even harmful by a significant proportion of people with ME/CFS. \nIn addition, NICE has failed to recognize the fact that repeated surveys of patient opinion, including the one in the CMO report, have concluded that the most effective and safe form of activity management is a process known as pacing.\n&#xa0;\n12\n.\n2\n \nSurveys carried out by the ME/CFS support charities have repeatedly confirmed a high degree of dissatisfaction with the way in which the NHS is \nalmost indiscriminately\n \nrecommending these two treatments\n to people with mild or moderate ME/CFS\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n12\n.\n3\n \nThe largest and most recently reported survey carried out by the MEA\n (R8\n)\n, which involved over 4,000 respondents, found that in relation to CBT\n \n(\n997 respondents\n)\n:\n&#xa0;\n2.8% were ‘greatly improved’\n23.1% were ‘improved\n54.6% were ‘no change’\n11.6% were ‘slightly worse’\n7.9% were ‘much worse’\n&#xa0;\n12\n.\n4\n \nI\nn relation to GET\n (906 respondents)\n:\n&#xa0;\n3.4% were ‘greatly improved’\n18.7% were ‘improved’\n21.4% were ‘no change’\n23.\n4% were ‘slightly worse’\n33.\n1% were ‘much worse’\n&#xa0;\n12\n.\n5\n \nI\nn relation to pacing (2137 respondents):\n&#xa0;\n11.6% were ‘greatly impro\nved’\n59.6% were ‘improved’\n24.1% were ‘no change’\n3.5% were ‘slightly worse’\n1.2% were ‘much worse’\n&#xa0;\n12.6\n \nThe NICE guideline also downgrades most aspects of \nthe \npragmatic management of key symptoms on the basis that there is an inadequate evidence based guidance of guideline production.\n \nThis is not the position taken by the 2002 CMO Report into ME/CFS.\n&#xa0;\n12\n.\n7\n \nThe MEA does not therefore believe that the NICE guideline is fit for purpose and we are very disappointed to learn that a proper review of this guideline with stakeholder input that was planned for 2013 appears to have been cancelled and \nwill now \nreplaced by some form of brief internal review. \n&#xa0;\n13 Summary&#xa0;\n13\n.\n1\n \nIn summary, there are a number of issues rela\nting to the management of ME/CFS\n that are not being addressed\n by all those who should be taking action\n.\n \nMost of these is\nsues have already been referred to\n in reports to government – including the 2002 Chief Medical Officer’s Report and the 2\n010 report from the APPG on ME o\nn NHS Service Provision.\n \nSadly, there has been a distinct lack of action on behalf of \nall those responsible\n to address these concerns.\n \nThis is clearly unacceptable.\n&#xa0;\n13\n.\n2\n \nAction therefore needs to be taken in the following areas:\n&#xa0;\n13\n.\n3\n \nAn epidemiological study to establish the number of people – adults and children -\n \nwith ME/CFS\n, along with the degree of severity.\n \nThis will enable Clinical Commissioning Groups to plan an appropriate\n local\n level of service provision.\n&#xa0;\n13\n.\n4\n \nAl\nl health professionals should receive\n a proper period of medical education on the diagnosis and management\n of ME/CFS during their \ntraining\n.\n \nME/CFS should also form part of continual professional development/education\n at a postgraduate level\n.\n&#xa0;\n13\n.\n5\n \nEarly and accurate diagnosis\n in primary care\n, along with appropriate early management,\n to reduce the chance of a more severe and prolonged illness occurring\n&#xa0;\n13\n.\n6 \nAn end to the postcode lottery of NHS referral services\n – everyone with ME/CFS, adults and children\n, severely affected, should \nhave access to a local hospital where \nphysician-led \nspecialist\n \ninput on diagnosis and management can be obtained, where appropriate.\n&#xa0;\n13\n.\n7 \nPhysicia\nn\n-\nled multidisciplinary\n management \nprogrammes\n should be introduced which\n recognize that treatment has to be tailored to individual needs based on stage, severity and symptoms \n&#xa0;\nThe ME Association would be very willing to give oral evidence to any of the hearings that the Health Committee intends to arran\nge on this very important topic\n.\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n&#xa0;\nReferences:\n&#xa0;\n1\n \nME/CFS Independent Working Group (2002).\n \nA
