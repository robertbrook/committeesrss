[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Prison Governors Association believe that the whole issue of voting rights for prisoners has been needlessly escalated by political rhetoric.  &#xa0;In reality, the vast majority of prisoners would not even bother voting and the issue has only gained so much prominence due to the publicity given to the political rhetoric regarding the issue.  It is therefore the Association’s view that the current dilemma has really been created by politicians.&#xa0;

[[[The Draft Bill]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Prison Governors Association believe that the three disqualifying options are misconceived and have no real basis in terms of logic.  &#xa0;Option C is unlawful since it is in defiance of European legislation.&#xa0;Option B would present a scenario where offenders who have committed exactly the same type of offence are dealt with differently in terms of voting rights, as some would receive community punishments whereas others may receive sentences of six months.  The rationale for therefore allowing the former group to vote and the latter group not to vote is unclear.  &#xa0;Option A is the least worse of all the options and would at least allow a reasonable number of prisoners to exercise their civic duty in the months leading up to their release.  &#xa0;However, the Prison Governors Association believe that there is a pragmatic way that this contentious issue can be dealt with.  We would suggest that Ministers incorporate prisoners’ voting rights within the headline policy of the rehabilitation revolution and drive on reducing reoffending rates.&#xa0;Ministers could argue that as part of a prisoner’s successful resettlement into the community it is a reasonable expectation that they should vote and take an active interest in local and national politics.  If this were to be argued then it would follow that all prisoners who were being released from prison would be able to vote and the only issue would be to say at what stage prior to release could prisoners vote. &#xa0;As an example, Ministers could argue that once a prisoner is within six months of his or her release date then they would have the right to vote.  Such a proposition would negate the requirement to allow or disqualify certain types of offence lengths or offence type, but clearly whole life tariff prisoners would never have the right to vote.&#xa0;

[[[Other issues]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Prison Governors Association do not believe that there would be any significant administrative impact on the prison system if prisoners were given the right to vote, it has not been an issue with remand prisoners in the past, and since most prisoners approaching their release date have an address to go to it would be possible to know which constituency they would vote in.&#xa0;June 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
