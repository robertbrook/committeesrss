[normal]Submission by The Captive Animals’ Protection Society, UK[bold]Executive Summary[bold]The EFRA Committee has asked for evidence regarding three specific points of interest, as follows:
[normal]This submission seeks to provide 
[normal]comment
[normal] with 
[normal]regard to the second and third points only as our organisation does not hold information on 
[normal]the extent of the trade
[normal] in primates as pets in the UK. It is, however, 
[normal]understood that evidence with regard to the extent of the trade will be submitted by other re
[normal]spondents to this i
[normal]nquiry.
[normal]Our organisation strongly advocates a complete ban on the trade in, and keeping of, non-human primates privately based on the firm belief that the complex welfare needs of non-human primates cannot be met in private hands.
[normal]About [bold]the Captive Animals’ Protection Society:[bold] [bold]Founded in 1957, the Captive Animals’ Protection Society (CAPS) is one of the UK’s longest-running charities working to protect animals. Working alongside campaign partners, CAPS has supported the call for a ban on 
[normal]the keeping of primates as pets for a number of years. Members of the CAPS team have long-term experience working with rescued primates as well as with primate conservation organisations worldwide.
[normal]Evidence to support a ban on the trade in, and keeping of,[bold] non-human primates privately[bold]Our organisation 
[normal]maintains
[normal] that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In light of all of the above, we believe that the 
[normal]trade in, and 
[normal]keeping of
[normal],
[normal] primates privately must be prohibited. It is recognised that this prohibition might be introduced using a number of different mechanisms, which would need to be considered upon their own merits in due course. 
[normal]Whilst 
[normal]it is recognised that some private kee
[normal]pers may differentiate themselves from 
[normal]“
[normal]pet owners
[normal]”
[normal] by virtue of their experi
[normal]ence in keeping these animals, w
[normal]e reject any suggestion that exceptions should be made for those keepers
[normal] in the case that prohibition is brought forward. This assertion is made
[normal] on
[normal] the basis that, if primates are inherently unsuited to being kept privately, the experience of the keepers in question is irrelevant. 
[normal]Given that there are estimated to be between 
[normal]3,006 to 9,017
[normal] 
[normal]primates held in private hands at present
[normal], it is 
[normal]accepted
[normal] that a 
[normal]“
[normal]grandfather clause
[normal]”
[normal] may be necessary
[normal] in the case that any prohibition is brought forward
[normal]. This may be necessary in order to 
[normal]accommodate those who keep primates privately in standards that are currently deemed to be acceptable in law so as to avoid
[normal] criminalising the operation 
[normal]of 
[normal]legitimate sanctuaries, seeing licensed zoos being inundated with primates or seeing individual primates euthanized in large numbers.
[normal] The way in which any grandfather clause might operate, much like the mechanism for introdu
[normal]cing any ban, is something which should be considered on its merits in due course.
[normal]It is recognised that the introduction on a ban on the keeping of primates privately will present some obstacles and complications but 
[normal]we firmly believe 
[normal]that this should not
[normal] be used as a reason to take no action on this matter. 
[normal]The UK prides itself on being a nation of animal love
[normal]rs but
[normal] continuing to allow the keeping 
[normal]of 
[normal]animals with such complex physical, social, emotional and behavioural needs in private hands 
[normal]is to underm
[normal]ine our reputation as a leader in animal welfare protection. 
[normal]Finally, it should be recognised that there are a number of expert organisations in the UK which are willing and able to work with Government in the development and delivery of any ban in the in
[normal]terests of reaching the best possible outcome for the animals involved.
