"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Cllr Paul Rone [TOB30]&#xa0;\nThe very concerning issue regarding illicit tobacco sales in Herefordshire is obviously mirrored throughout the country and therefore affects all of us.\n&#xa0;\nMuch of the under the counter sales of tobacco in Herefordshire is duty  avoided, that is, a legally manufactured produced that has been smuggled into the country and in so being, has avoided all duties and taxes. This situation is very damaging financially on two fronts Firstly the loss of revenue to the country in duty and taxes payable are vast and Secondly, the loss of profit on cigarette and tobacco sales by bona fide retailers is severely damaging to their business' especially the small corner shop retailers - establishments synonymous within these Isles.\n&#xa0;\nOf greater concern though is the selling of counterfeit tobacco products, that is, cigarettes and hand rolling tobacco that is manufactured goodness knows where, by goodness knows who, using goodness knows what.\n&#xa0;\nThe threats to health are frightening- does this counterfeit product contain chemicals that will in 2,5 or 10 years cause  an as yet unseen medical condition that will in turn have a huge cost effect for the health service?\nIn my experience the main age group that would be affected is the under 30's and as the product gets cheaper so the appeal and affordability to young people goes up.\n&#xa0;\nA packet of counterfeit cigarettes now sells in Hereford for £2-50, sold in shops to anyone that has the money. The seller does not ask for i.d. - is not the slightest bit concerned at the age of the purchaser as long as they have the money.\n&#xa0;\nOrganised crime is obviously the backbone of these supply chains, and as long as HMRC have no teeth to punish them with and EHTS nationally can only prosecute for the actual loss of duty on the packets seized on the premises or, ludicrously, for not having a health warning displayed on the packet then this damaging practice will continue.\n&#xa0;\nCllr Paul Rone\nSt Martins &amp; Hinton Ward\n, Hereford\n&#xa0;\nSeptember\n 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
