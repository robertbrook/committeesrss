default 
defaultThis 
defaultsubmission
default consider
defaults
default 
defaultthe issue of Parliament’s role in war powers 
defaultfrom 
defaultthree
default perspective
defaults: democracy, military efficiency and
default international law. 
defaultThe latter is the primary legal focus since
default the constitutional law of the UK provides for very little regulation of decisions to go to war, 
defaultto 
defaultuse force or 
defaultto
default 
defaultdeploy
default 
defaultsignificant UK forces abroad (which are all seen as core prerogative powers in the hands of the 
defaulte
defaultxecutive branch of government)
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultcontention
default is that international law should be the primary framework and that, indeed, public law should be built on this framework either in the form of a War Powers Resolution or a War Powers Act of Parliament. The relative merits of each will be discussed. 
defaultSyria and Parliamentdefault2.
default 
defaultThe debate
default held in the House of Commons at the end of August
default,
default and 
defaultthe 
defaultfailure to 
defaultapprove
default a
default proposal to use force against Syria 
defaultin response to the 
defaultuse of chemical weapons
default,
default ha
defaultve
default been 
defaultdiscussed 
defaulteither as a triumph for democracy or as 
defaulta 
defaultfailure to enforce fundamental norms of international law
default and to 
defaultfulfil
default the UK’s 
defaultinternational 
defaultresponsibilities
default, when it is probably neither
default.
default 
defaultHowever,
default in my view the 
defaultepisode
default leans more towards the former than the latter given that the necessity to use force, certainly at that time, was not 
defaultestablished
default and clearly many MPs
default,
default as well as the public
default,
default were sceptical about the involvement of British forces in Syria.
default 
default 
default3.
default 
defaultThe debat
defaulte turned on the issues of evidence and timing of military action,
default 
defaulta
defaultlthough 
defaultit also raised 
defaultquestions of international law
default. A
defaults with many 
defaultParliamentary 
defaultdebates on 
defaulta proposed 
defaultuse of force, 
defaulta number of 
defaultspe
defaultakers
default addressed the 
defaultinternational l
defaultegal issues, 
defaultal
defaultthough opinion seemed to be split on whether the UK had the right to act without the authority of the Security Council
default.
default There was 
defaulta 
defaultvery brief 
defaultsummary provided by
default the A
defaultttorney 
defaultG
defaulteneral
default 
defaultput
default before the House of Commons 
defaultahead of the vote
default,
default 
defaultclaiming a clear legal basis in the doctrine of 
defaulthumanitarian 
defaultintervention
default,
default which is of doubtful pedigree under international law
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe proposed intervention was 
defaultprimarily 
defaulta 
defaultpunitive r
defaulteprisal, 
defaulttaken as a response 
defaultto a use of chemical weapons
default 
defaultwhich constituted a violation of fundamental norms
default and a crime against humanity
default 
default-
default a different proposition
default to humanitarian intervention
default, but one equally problematic in international law (at least 
defaultif taken 
defaultwithout UN Security Council authority)
default.
default 
default4.
default 
defaultThus
default, international law was central
default to the discussion
default and in a way 
defaultmay have 
defaulthelped to shape the outcome
default, despite the assertions and counter-assertions about the legality of the proposed use of force
default. The proposed use of force was not primarily about protecting the Syrian people but about punishing 
defaultthe 
defaultAssad 
defaultregime 
defaultfor the 
defaultcriminal 
defaultuse of chemical weapons 
defaultbut 
defaultalso preventing him from using them again. The latter could be said to be a humanitarian justification but until the regime’s responsibility 
defaultand the imminent need to use force to prevent another use 
defaulthad clearly been established the 
defaultcase for air and missile strikes was unconvincing. 
default 
default 
default 
default 
defaultA Role for defaultParliament in Conflict Decisionsdefault5.
default 
defaultSyria has been important for democracy because it showed that although executives have the legal power to go to war or to use force, they are increasingly concerned 
defaultwith 
defaultgain
defaulting
default approval from the 
defaultwider polity
default.
default It almost seemed that Parliament and Congress were alternative fora for gaining authorisation in the absence of a functioning Security Council. 
defaultL
defaultegally speaking this does not make sense 
defaultgiven that 
defaultthe Security Council has the power to authorize enforcement action against another state while the 
defaultUK 
defaultor US 
defaultclearly do not have such a power
default.
default I
defaultn terms of legitimacy
default, however,
default it makes more sense 
defaultif
default the proposed use of force is necessary to tackle imminent 
defaulthumanit
defaulta
defaultr
defaultia
defaultn catastrophe and the Security Council is, because of its institutional flaws
default, 
defaultabjectly failing to address the issue. 
defaultThis was arguably the position in Kosovo in 1999.
default 
default6.
default 
defaultThere is little doubt that until force was threa
defaultt
defaultened against Syria
default,
default leading to the current process of chemical weapons inspection and removal,
default the Security Council had achi
defaulte
defaultved very little in terms of diplo
defaultmacy
default or action 
defaultin 
defaultre
defaultla
defaulttion to 
defaultthe violence in 
defaultSyria.
default The Resolution agreed on 27 September 2013 does not authorise any use of force to enforce Syrian compliance with the requirement to hand over its chemical weapons
default, although it 
defaultmay well
default be interpreted in this way
default.
default 
defaultA
defaultrguably the current process
default of disarming the chemical stockpile
default simply frees up the regime to use conventional force against the rebels and their strongholds irrespective of civilian casualties – something that it has been doing since 2011 and something that was deemed a crime against humanity 
defaultin a UN Report
default that year.
default 
defaultA humanitarian catastrophe 
defaultcontinues to unfold in Syria but this should not prevent Parliament from making judgments about when to intervene in such a conflict where there is no guarantee that military intervention will improve the situation for civilians. 
default7.
default 
defaultParliamentary approval for a
defaultny
default use of force has become essential 
defaultprimarily because of t
defaulthe anachronism 
defaultof 
defaultunregulated 
defaultprerogative powers. Powers that on
defaultc
defaulte belonged to monarchs should not be wielded without proper democratic accoun
defaulttability
default; indeed 
defaultthey 
defaultshould be effectively 
defaultre
defaultgulated/r
defaulte
defaultplaced
default by 
defaultclear statutory rules. In medieval times monarchs could decide to go to war without having to seek any approval but they of
defaultten
default struggled to raise both armies and mon
defaulties
default, issues which still remain but seem less pressing.
default Military efficiency
default has improved over the c
defaulte
defaultnturies enabling the 
defaultgovernment 
defaultt
defaulto
default deploy forces overseas more easily, and yet d
defaulte
defaultmocratic accountability has not increased 
defaultsufficiently 
defaultto match this. 
default‘
defaultWar powers
default’
default is a topic 
defaultof
defaultten
default characterised by arguments about milit
defaulta
defaultry efficiency versus democratic accountability
default. The
default former has been allow
defaulte
defaultd to 
defaultoutst
defaultrip
default the latter
default; but in any case one should not be achieved at the expense of the other
default.
default  
default8.
default 
defaultFurther reasons for greater democratic control of the armed forces include: p
defaultublic dis
defaults
defaultatisfaction with 
defaultthe 
defaultnumber of wars and the number of British casu
defaulta
defaultlties
default, without any 
defaultperceived
default improvement in the international security situation
default; and a r
defaulte
defaulta
defaultlis
defaultat
defaultion that such dec
defaulti
defaultsions should not be solely made by a handful of individuals in the war cabinet
default, a perception heightened by the ‘sofa’-form of government of recent years
default.
default 
default9.
default 
defaultOne of the 
defaultmain 
defaultreasons 
defaultoften given 
defaultfor allowing quick executive 
defaultdecision-making to take military measures
default was to enable a government to defend the realm from attack.
default 
defaultThe core of sovereignty, the 
defaultraison 
defaultd’être
default of a state, is to protect the country from attack, invasion and occupation. This is 
defaultembodied in 
defaultthe inherent right of self-defence recognised in international law in both the UN Charter and customary law.
default 
defaultSince 1945 t
defaulthe UK has 
defaultc
defaultlaimed the right of self-defence in relation to its response to the Argentinian invasion of the Falklands in 1982 and in a collective response 
defaultalongside
default the US to the attacks of 9/11 in 2001. 
defaultHowever,
default even in these situations the defensive response was not immediate and allowed significant Parliam
defaultentary
default debate 
defaultal
defaultthough no vote
default was taken
default.
default The 
defaultorthodox 
defaultapproach
default that the ex
defaulte
defaultcutive took the dec
defaulti
defaultsion and then Parliament could comment and evaluate aft
defaulterwards
default prevailed
default.
default 
defaultThis 
defaultprovi
defaultd
defaulte
defaults
default a retrospective form of accountability but in reality 
defaultit
default 
defaultput
defaults
default Parli
defaulta
defaultm
defaulte
defaultnt in an une
defaultn
defaultviable position of being critical of an exis
defaultt
defaulting war which would 
defaultpotentially 
defaultundermine national and milit
defaultary
default morale.
default 
defaultFurthermore, 
defaultmost significant deployments
default and 
defaultuses of force are not taken to defend the country from attack.
default Thus
default,
default what was 
defaultonce 
defaultthe rationale for the prerogative power to go to war should no longer dictate the decision-making process.
default10.
default 
defaultMost uses of force are no
defaultt
default

default Syria in 2013)
default,
default or pr
defaulte
defaultventing h
defaultumanitarian
default catastrophes
default (Kosovo 1999, Libya 2011)
default. 
defaultInternational law does not provide any clear rights or duties here in the absence of an authorization from the Security Council.
default The emergence in the 21
defaultst
default century of the ‘Responsibility 
defaultto Protect’, when a government fails to protect its population from crimes against humanity,
default has not (yet) shaken off the shackles of the Security Council in part due to the perceived lack of alternative and legitimate security communities.
default 
defaultIn these controversial cases
default where military action is proposed in order to prevent crimes against humanity
default there 
defaultare 
defaultvery few instances when the executive has to take action without having time to go to Par
defaultliament
default, 
defaultal
defaultthough it

defaultate
defaultned by the Gaddafi regime against 
defaultBenghazi
default in 2011
default when force was used under clear UN authority before a vote was held in the House of Commons
default.
default 
default11.
default 
defaultThus, in most instances 
default(including of self-defence and humanitarian ne
defaultcessity
default) 
defaultthere is time for Parliament to be involved in a meaningful way in decisions to deploy significant forces or 
defaultto 
defaultuse
default military 
defaultforce. It would be an exceptional situation where the government has to deploy forces in an emergency
default without seeking Parliamentary approval
default. Parliamentary involvement would not hamper the 
defaultoperational 
defaulteffectiveness of any military action, 
defaultbut 
defaultit would mean that Parliament may prevent the deployment or use of force because the majority of MP
defaults
default 
defaultare
default not convinced 
defaultby the Government’s arguments 
defaultthat there 
defaulti
defaults a need t
defaulto
default use force. 
defaultBearing in mind the Government’
defaults strong position in Parliament, giving Parliament a say in conflict decisions should not be seen as a permanent barrier to the effective prosecution of wars, but only a barrier that might come down if Parliament remains unconvinced by the Government’s arguments and justifications. 
defaultThe Insufficiency of Recentdefault defaultPdefaultracticedefault12.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultrecent
default practice
default (starting with Iraq in 2003
default and most recently Syria in 2013
default)
default of seeking approval in Parliament prior to a use of force does not jeopardize the prerogative power
default.
default A
defaultlthough the Prime Minister may cho
defaulto
defaultse
default,
default for political or democratic reasons
default,
default not to exercise prerogative powers in the face of Parliamentary disapproval as in the Syr
defaultian debates
default, there is no 
defaultdoubt that such a power remains and all 
defaultthat 
defaultParliament is doing 
defaultlegally 
defaultis commenting upon its proposed use. Accountability is in effect being brought forward to before the use of force commences, as opposed to waiting to a later point, but it remains an exercise in 
defaultlimited 
defaultpolitical accountability nonetheless.
default13.
default 
defaultRequiring positive approval in the form of a substantive resolution not ‘approving’ or ‘supporting’ the 
defaultG
defaultovernment’s decision, but 
defaultforming part of that 
default‘deci
defaultsion
default’ to authorize the use of force
default,
default 
defaultmight appear to
default 
defaultjeopardize
default 
defaultParliament
default’s
default role
default 
defaultas a mechanism of accountability. 
defaultNevertheless, 
defaultParliament’s
default powers of scrutiny
default 
defaultwould be
default enhanced. The executive prop
defaulto
defaultsal 
defaultwould be
default s
defaultc
defaultrutinised by Parliament and
default,
default if it passes that scrutiny
default,
default then Parliam
defaulte
defaultnt will 
defaultultimately 
defaultdecide on the use of force
default. Parliament
default not only 
defaultperforms
default an accountability function it takes 
defaultco-
defaultresponsibility for the decision that emerges.
default 
defaultIt makes Parliament’s role central in conflict decisions 
defaultand further
defaultmore
default 
defaultit makes it central at the crucial time. 
default14.
default 
defaultIn addition, 
defaultthe current position is that 
defaultthe G
defaultovernment can 
defaultuse its 
defaultprerogative powers 
defaultto 
defaultdeploy troops and forces ready to use force 
defaultand 
defaultthen go to the House for support just before the actual use of force 
defaultis planned 
default(as in Iraq in 2003)
default,
default making it 
defaultextremely 
defaultdifficult for the House to vote against 
defaultit 
defaultin the face of a build up to war knowing in any case that the prerogative power remains. Arguably
default,
default when the UK is threatening
default to use
default force
default and backs that threat by the deployment of forces
default,
default it has already potentially violated international law (which prohibits both the threat and use of force) and
default,
default therefore
default,
default any 
default UK 
default‘decision’ to do so should have been made prior to the deployment
default and accompanying 
defaultthreat
default of force
default.
default15.
default 
defaultIt follows that 
defaultthe current position is unsatisfactory not only because it leaves the prerogative untouched, at least in legal terms, it allows the 
defaultG
defaultovernment to manipulate the agenda, to make threats, to deploy forces and then go to the House for political reasons to seek approval for its decision to use force. The fact that this now normally takes place before the actual use of kinetic force is an improvement on much of the earlier practice
default,
default but it does not increase democratic input 
defaultin
defaultto decision making sufficiently in this era of legally controversial uses of force. The Syrian debate may mislead us into thinking that we have finally tipped the balance in favour of democracy but, although it does nudge us in that direction, the evidence is that better executive management of the build up to the debate would have enabled the 
defaultG
defaultovernment to have gained approval. 
defaultResolution or Statute?default16.
default 
defaultW
defaultould a War Powers Resolution constitute a real legal limitation on prerogative powers? 
defaultThe reform proposal that was due to be laid before Parliament for approval before the general election in May 2010, 
defaulttook 
defaultthe form of a non-binding war powers resolution,
default  giving the Prime Minister maximum flexibility as to the timing of seeking approval from the House of Commons for a Government decision authorising the use of force by British armed forces outside the UK. As with the invasion of Iraq in 2003, this may mean that the timing of the vote will be such as to ensure that it is too late for the House of Commons to realistically say no. In addition, under the draft resolution, there would have been no need for the Government to seek retrospective approval when the operation 
defaultwas
default urgent or secret. Furthermore, the proposed resolution would not have required the Attorney General 
defaultto 
defaultmake his full advice available to Parliament, though legal reasons would normally be given.  
defaultI
defaultn reality 
defaultthis 
defaultrepresented little change from the current constitutional position and had the added advantage, from the Government’s point of view, of being in a non-
defaultstatutory
default form thereby making sure that the Courts are not enticed into the debate about the legality of decisions to go to war.  
defaultEven an improved Resolution would not replace the prerogative although its acceptance and usage would produce a convention
default. This
default would have some value in constitutional law in qualifying the prerogative
default further by recognising the entitlement of Parliament to vote and not simply to be consulted prior to a use of force
default.
default 
default17.
default 
defaultThis leads to the issue of whether a
default War Powers Statute 
defaultwould 
defaultreduce military efficiency too much by introducing the possibility of judicial review
default.
default 
defaultSuch a 
defaultpath might be seen as not only increasing democracy b
defaulty
default making Parliament 
defaultco-responsible for a 
defaultdecision to go to war but 
defaultalso 
defaultmoving 
defaultthe 
defaultaccountability
default function towards the Courts in the form of judicial review. 
defaultHowever, while the
default Courts would be concerned with whether the procedure of the Statute was being complied
default with
default, for instance
default,
default whether a vote in the House of Commons was undertaken in 
defaulta 
defaultprocedurally correct way; or whether the House of Commons had been given sufficient information, including on the legality of the proposed operation, upon which to make an informed decision. 
defaultUnder a War Powers Statute t
defaulthe Courts may declare, in 
defaultobvious 
defaultcases where there is clearly no emerg
defaultency
default situation, that the 
defaultG
defaultovernment had not been enti
defaultt
defaultled to take action first and ask Parliam
defaulte
defaultnt later. Thus
default,
default the Courts would be conce
defaultrned
default with clear abuse of the process, 
defaultbut 
defaultnot with detailed arguments about the legality of going to war under international 
defaultnorms. 
default 
defaultProceedings before the Courts would not delay military action and any declaration by the Courts that the Statute had not been complied 
defaultwith 
defaultshould lead to the Government 
defaultmodifying its behaviour in the future
default.
default In this way jurisprudence would help develop and 
defaultembed
default the Statute
default 
defaultin a way that 
defaultwould
default not hamper effective military action.
default 
default18.
default 
defaultGiven that i
defaultnternational law is a much more open-textured system than domestic law
default,
default and the area is in a state of flux particularly with arguments 
defaultabout the nature and extent of the 
defaultR
defaultesponsibility to 
defaultP
defaultrotect
default, it would not be appropriate for 
defaulta 
defaultBritish 
defaultc
defaultourt to decide or even comment on the legality of the use of force itself, although it would be concerned with 
defaultthe 
defaultquestion of whether Parliament had been given sufficient information on the legal basis so as to make an informed decision.
default 
defaultThere is s
defaultu
defaultffi
defaultcient
default evid
defaultence
default of the Courts
default’
default deference on 
defaultsuch 
defaultmatters to be confident that they would not see this as an opportunity to assert 
defaultpowers of review
default over Government and Parli
defaulta
defaultm
defaultent
default. 
defaultThe Courts 
defaultalready 
defaultrecognise that these are dec
defaulti
defaultsions for the political organs 
defaultma
defaultking difficult judgments in constantly changing 
defaultinternational 
defaultsecurity situations.
default 
default19.
default 
defaultWhile a War Powers Resolution may be a useful interim step and a practical limitation on prerogative powers, only a Statute would clearly ground the 
defaultfinal 
defaultdecision to go to war in Parliament. 
defaultThe
default price is the possibility of greater judicial involvement
default. 
defaultHowever, while the Courts have moved towards the assertion of jurisdiction over prerogative powers
default since the 
defaultGCHQ 
defaultcase of 1985,
default they have seen issues of war powers as not suited to judicial determination and have therefore declared such issues non-justiciable.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe reason behind this
default 
defaultis
default that 
defaultthe Courts
default should 
defaultnot become involved in 
defaultm
defaultatters of foreign policy and in issues of use of force
default in that these are decisions for the elected Government and not for the Courts.
default 
defaultSuch an 
defaultapproach would continue 
defaultu
defaultnder a War Powers Act given the rationale is that it is the type of 
defaultgovernmental 
defaultdecision that is not reviewable whether it is derived from prerogative powers or not. 
defaultGiven this 
defaultabstinence,
default the reality is that the Courts would not present a brake on 
defaultoperational 
defaulteffic
defaultiency
default or the general ability of the executive to prosecute a war
default, but they would keep the Government 
defaultand 
defaultParliament honest in the way they interpret 
defaulta
default War Powers
default Act
default.
default 
default20.
default 
defaultDecisions to deploy significant forces or to use force would normally be made prior to deployment or use; but an 
defaultex post
default decision would have to be catered for in cases of 
defaultnecessity of 
defaultself-defence and humanitarian 
defaultaction
default,
default 
defaultbut only 
defaultwhere 
defaultimmediate 
defaultforce is necessary to combat an imminent attack or 
defaultto prevent an imminent 
defaulthumanitarian catastrophe where there is 
default‘
defaultno choice of means and no moment for deliberation
default’
default.
default Indeed
default, British deployments and uses of force since 1945 show that
default in most instances there is time for debate and decision so that 
defaultprior co-decision making
default should be the norm and the exception
defaults
default should be 
defaultcarefully defined in order to 
defaultprevent exploitation. 
default 
defaultOutline of Content of a War Powers Resolution/Statutedefault21.
default 
defaultGiven the difficulty international law has in providing precise definitions it should only be used as 
defaulta 
defaultframework for
default the conditions that should trigger the application of 
defaulta
default War Powers Resolution/Statute. On this basis non-legal language should be used and the triggers 
defaultfor co-decision making 
defaultshould not be the ‘use of force’ or the presence of ‘armed conflict’, but any proposed 
defaultdecision to deploy significant numbers 
defaultof 
defaultBritish troops/forces to an overseas crisis, conflict or post-conflict situation
default. Given that the desire is to have meaningful decision-making at a stage when force is being contemplated rather than actuated, it should occur at the point when troops/forces are being identified and plans are being drawn up
default. Ther
defaulte
default is the danger that this 
defaultmight
default give too much information to 
defaulta
default potential enemy, but most interventions are not premised on surprise (with the exception of Suez in 1956)
default,
default but are taken in response to invasions (Korea 1950, Falklands 1982, 
defaultIraq 1990) or as part of an incremental response to threats to the peace (for instance in Bosnia in 1992-5).
default22.
default 
defaultA
default Resolution/Statute should apply to any significant deployment of UK forces whether they are bound for peacekeeping, peace support, peace enforcement or war fighting
default. T
defaulto
default ex
defaultc
defaultlude peacekeeping forces on the basis that they trad
defaulti
defaulttionally do not become en
defaultgaged
default as combatants might tempt the 
defaultG
defaultovernment into sending the w
defaultro
defaultng sort of force in order to escape scrutiny, but in any case most modern peacekeeping operations are authorised by the Security Council to use force not only to defend themselves, but to defend civil
defaultians
default an
defaultd
default, more broadly, the
defaulti
defaultr mandates. 
defaultIn addition, mission creep can lead to soldiers being tasked with additional duties leading to long-term and dangerous military commitments. 
defaultThus, sending a UK contingent of 1,000 sold
defaulti
defaulters to a peace operation
default in what appears to be a post-conflict situation
default would be, I argue, a significant deployment and
default,
default therefore, ought to be covered by any 
defaultWar Powers Resolution/S
defaulttatute.   
default   
default  
default23.
default 
defaultThe Government needs to give sufficient information to Parliament in order for it to make an informed decision. 
defaultInformation to be laid before the House 
defaultwould include the 
defaultfull 
defaultlegal opinion of the Attorney General
default,
default which if not s
defaultufficiently
default detailed 
defaultor otherwise
default satisfactory 
defaultsh
defaultould be suppleme
defaultn
defaultted by further advice sought by Parliament or a Committee of the House of Commons. T
defaulthis
default would enable Parli
defaulta
defaultm
defaultent
default 
defaultto
default take a bal
defaultanced
default dec
defaulti
defaultsion
default. I
defaultt might feel
default, for example, 
default that the pro
defaultp
defaultosed action is not fully grounded in international law but is legitimate and necessary; or it might reject the assertions of legal
defaulti
defaultty by the Government. 
default24.
default 
defaultOnly very exceptionally in cases of imminent attack
default or humanitarian catastrophe
default, leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation
default,
default can the decision 
defaultby Parliament

default and then it should normally be given within

defaultwithin seven

defaultOn

defaultthe

default Any substantial change of direction i

default The Government’s proposal stipulated that the Security Council should immediately consider the initial findings of the UN’s investigating team and that every effort should be made to secure a Security Council resolution and, in any case, a further vote would be held in the House of Commons before force would be used. The Opposition’s proposal imposed a number of additional conditions, including that there was a clear basis in international law for taking military action -   Hansard HC, Vol 466, col 1425 and 1440 (29 Aug

default

default [2002] EWHC 2777
default at para 59: ‘
defaultA plain purpose of 
defaultthe 
defaultpresent claim is to discourage or inhibit 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment from using armed force against Iraq without a further Security Council resolution. Thus 
defaultthe 
defaultclaim is an attempt to limit 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment's freedom of movement in relation to 
defaultthe 
defaultactual use of military force as well as in relation to 
defaultthe 
defaultexercise of diplomatic pressure in advance. That takes it squarely into 
defaultthe 
defaultfields of foreign affairs and defence. In my view it is unthinkable that 
defaultthe 
defaultnational courts would entertain a challenge to a Government decision to declare war or to authorise 
defaultthe 
defaultuse of armed force against a third country. That is a classic example of a non-justiciable decision. I reject Mr Singh's submission that it would be permissible in principle to isolate and rule upon legal issues e.g. as to whether 
defaultthe 
defaultdecision was taken in breach of international law. 
defaultThe 
defaultnature and subject matter of such a decision require it to be treated as an indivisible whole rather than breaking it down into legal, political, military and other components and viewing those components in isolation for 
defaultthe 
defaultpurpose of determining whether they are suited to judicial determination. 
defaultThe 
defaultsame objections of principle apply to an attempt to isolate in advance a potential legal component of a possible future decision with a view to limiting 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment's freedom of movement when taking 
defaultthe 
defaultdecision itself’.
