[normal] 
[normal]This 
[normal]submission
[normal] consider
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]the issue of Parliament’s role in war powers 
[normal]from 
[normal]three
[normal] perspective
[normal]s: democracy, military efficiency and
[normal] international law. 
[normal]The latter is the primary legal focus since
[normal] the constitutional law of the UK provides for very little regulation of decisions to go to war, 
[normal]to 
[normal]use force or 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]deploy
[normal] 
[normal]significant UK forces abroad (which are all seen as core prerogative powers in the hands of the 
[normal]e
[normal]xecutive branch of government)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]contention
[normal] is that international law should be the primary framework and that, indeed, public law should be built on this framework either in the form of a War Powers Resolution or a War Powers Act of Parliament. The relative merits of each will be discussed. 
[normal]Syria and Parliament[bold]2.
[normal] 
[normal]The debate
[normal] held in the House of Commons at the end of August
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]the 
[normal]failure to 
[normal]approve
[normal] a
[normal] proposal to use force against Syria 
[normal]in response to the 
[normal]use of chemical weapons
[normal],
[normal] ha
[normal]ve
[normal] been 
[normal]discussed 
[normal]either as a triumph for democracy or as 
[normal]a 
[normal]failure to enforce fundamental norms of international law
[normal] and to 
[normal]fulfil
[normal] the UK’s 
[normal]international 
[normal]responsibilities
[normal], when it is probably neither
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]However,
[normal] in my view the 
[normal]episode
[normal] leans more towards the former than the latter given that the necessity to use force, certainly at that time, was not 
[normal]established
[normal] and clearly many MPs
[normal],
[normal] as well as the public
[normal],
[normal] were sceptical about the involvement of British forces in Syria.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]3.
[normal] 
[normal]The debat
[normal]e turned on the issues of evidence and timing of military action,
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal]lthough 
[normal]it also raised 
[normal]questions of international law
[normal]. A
[normal]s with many 
[normal]Parliamentary 
[normal]debates on 
[normal]a proposed 
[normal]use of force, 
[normal]a number of 
[normal]spe
[normal]akers
[normal] addressed the 
[normal]international l
[normal]egal issues, 
[normal]al
[normal]though opinion seemed to be split on whether the UK had the right to act without the authority of the Security Council
[normal].
[normal] There was 
[normal]a 
[normal]very brief 
[normal]summary provided by
[normal] the A
[normal]ttorney 
[normal]G
[normal]eneral
[normal] 
[normal]put
[normal] before the House of Commons 
[normal]ahead of the vote
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]claiming a clear legal basis in the doctrine of 
[normal]humanitarian 
[normal]intervention
[normal],
[normal] which is of doubtful pedigree under international law
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he proposed intervention was 
[normal]primarily 
[normal]a 
[normal]punitive r
[normal]eprisal, 
[normal]taken as a response 
[normal]to a use of chemical weapons
[normal] 
[normal]which constituted a violation of fundamental norms
[normal] and a crime against humanity
[normal] 
[normal]-
[normal] a different proposition
[normal] to humanitarian intervention
[normal], but one equally problematic in international law (at least 
[normal]if taken 
[normal]without UN Security Council authority)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]4.
[normal] 
[normal]Thus
[normal], international law was central
[normal] to the discussion
[normal] and in a way 
[normal]may have 
[normal]helped to shape the outcome
[normal], despite the assertions and counter-assertions about the legality of the proposed use of force
[normal]. The proposed use of force was not primarily about protecting the Syrian people but about punishing 
[normal]the 
[normal]Assad 
[normal]regime 
[normal]for the 
[normal]criminal 
[normal]use of chemical weapons 
[normal]but 
[normal]also preventing him from using them again. The latter could be said to be a humanitarian justification but until the regime’s responsibility 
[normal]and the imminent need to use force to prevent another use 
[normal]had clearly been established the 
[normal]case for air and missile strikes was unconvincing. 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]A Role for [bold]Parliament in Conflict Decisions[bold]5.
[normal] 
[normal]Syria has been important for democracy because it showed that although executives have the legal power to go to war or to use force, they are increasingly concerned 
[normal]with 
[normal]gain
[normal]ing
[normal] approval from the 
[normal]wider polity
[normal].
[normal] It almost seemed that Parliament and Congress were alternative fora for gaining authorisation in the absence of a functioning Security Council. 
[normal]L
[normal]egally speaking this does not make sense 
[normal]given that 
[normal]the Security Council has the power to authorize enforcement action against another state while the 
[normal]UK 
[normal]or US 
[normal]clearly do not have such a power
[normal].
[normal] I
[normal]n terms of legitimacy
[normal], however,
[normal] it makes more sense 
[normal]if
[normal] the proposed use of force is necessary to tackle imminent 
[normal]humanit
[normal]a
[normal]r
[normal]ia
[normal]n catastrophe and the Security Council is, because of its institutional flaws
[normal], 
[normal]abjectly failing to address the issue. 
[normal]This was arguably the position in Kosovo in 1999.
[normal] 
[normal]6.
[normal] 
[normal]There is little doubt that until force was threa
[normal]t
[normal]ened against Syria
[normal],
[normal] leading to the current process of chemical weapons inspection and removal,
[normal] the Security Council had achi
[normal]e
[normal]ved very little in terms of diplo
[normal]macy
[normal] or action 
[normal]in 
[normal]re
[normal]la
[normal]tion to 
[normal]the violence in 
[normal]Syria.
[normal] The Resolution agreed on 27 September 2013 does not authorise any use of force to enforce Syrian compliance with the requirement to hand over its chemical weapons
[normal], although it 
[normal]may well
[normal] be interpreted in this way
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]rguably the current process
[normal] of disarming the chemical stockpile
[normal] simply frees up the regime to use conventional force against the rebels and their strongholds irrespective of civilian casualties – something that it has been doing since 2011 and something that was deemed a crime against humanity 
[normal]in a UN Report
[normal] that year.
[normal] 
[normal]A humanitarian catastrophe 
[normal]continues to unfold in Syria but this should not prevent Parliament from making judgments about when to intervene in such a conflict where there is no guarantee that military intervention will improve the situation for civilians. 
[normal]7.
[normal] 
[normal]Parliamentary approval for a
[normal]ny
[normal] use of force has become essential 
[normal]primarily because of t
[normal]he anachronism 
[normal]of 
[normal]unregulated 
[normal]prerogative powers. Powers that on
[normal]c
[normal]e belonged to monarchs should not be wielded without proper democratic accoun
[normal]tability
[normal]; indeed 
[normal]they 
[normal]should be effectively 
[normal]re
[normal]gulated/r
[normal]e
[normal]placed
[normal] by 
[normal]clear statutory rules. In medieval times monarchs could decide to go to war without having to seek any approval but they of
[normal]ten
[normal] struggled to raise both armies and mon
[normal]ies
[normal], issues which still remain but seem less pressing.
[normal] Military efficiency
[normal] has improved over the c
[normal]e
[normal]nturies enabling the 
[normal]government 
[normal]t
[normal]o
[normal] deploy forces overseas more easily, and yet d
[normal]e
[normal]mocratic accountability has not increased 
[normal]sufficiently 
[normal]to match this. 
[normal]‘
[normal]War powers
[normal]’
[normal] is a topic 
[normal]of
[normal]ten
[normal] characterised by arguments about milit
[normal]a
[normal]ry efficiency versus democratic accountability
[normal]. The
[normal] former has been allow
[normal]e
[normal]d to 
[normal]outst
[normal]rip
[normal] the latter
[normal]; but in any case one should not be achieved at the expense of the other
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]8.
[normal] 
[normal]Further reasons for greater democratic control of the armed forces include: p
[normal]ublic dis
[normal]s
[normal]atisfaction with 
[normal]the 
[normal]number of wars and the number of British casu
[normal]a
[normal]lties
[normal], without any 
[normal]perceived
[normal] improvement in the international security situation
[normal]; and a r
[normal]e
[normal]a
[normal]lis
[normal]at
[normal]ion that such dec
[normal]i
[normal]sions should not be solely made by a handful of individuals in the war cabinet
[normal], a perception heightened by the ‘sofa’-form of government of recent years
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]9.
[normal] 
[normal]One of the 
[normal]main 
[normal]reasons 
[normal]often given 
[normal]for allowing quick executive 
[normal]decision-making to take military measures
[normal] was to enable a government to defend the realm from attack.
[normal] 
[normal]The core of sovereignty, the 
[normal]raison 
[normal]d’être
[normal] of a state, is to protect the country from attack, invasion and occupation. This is 
[normal]embodied in 
[normal]the inherent right of self-defence recognised in international law in both the UN Charter and customary law.
[normal] 
[normal]Since 1945 t
[normal]he UK has 
[normal]c
[normal]laimed the right of self-defence in relation to its response to the Argentinian invasion of the Falklands in 1982 and in a collective response 
[normal]alongside
[normal] the US to the attacks of 9/11 in 2001. 
[normal]However,
[normal] even in these situations the defensive response was not immediate and allowed significant Parliam
[normal]entary
[normal] debate 
[normal]al
[normal]though no vote
[normal] was taken
[normal].
[normal] The 
[normal]orthodox 
[normal]approach
[normal] that the ex
[normal]e
[normal]cutive took the dec
[normal]i
[normal]sion and then Parliament could comment and evaluate aft
[normal]erwards
[normal] prevailed
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This 
[normal]provi
[normal]d
[normal]e
[normal]s
[normal] a retrospective form of accountability but in reality 
[normal]it
[normal] 
[normal]put
[normal]s
[normal] Parli
[normal]a
[normal]m
[normal]e
[normal]nt in an une
[normal]n
[normal]viable position of being critical of an exis
[normal]t
[normal]ing war which would 
[normal]potentially 
[normal]undermine national and milit
[normal]ary
[normal] morale.
[normal] 
[normal]Furthermore, 
[normal]most significant deployments
[normal] and 
[normal]uses of force are not taken to defend the country from attack.
[normal] Thus
[normal],
[normal] what was 
[normal]once 
[normal]the rationale for the prerogative power to go to war should no longer dictate the decision-making process.
[normal]10.
[normal] 
[normal]Most uses of force are no
[normal]t
[normal] 
[normal]taken to 
[normal]defen
[normal]d
[normal] the territorial integrity o
[normal]r
[normal] poli
[normal]tic

[normal]ndence of the UK 
[normal]from outside attack, 
[normal]but are conce
[normal]rned
[normal] with enforcing international laws
[normal] (Iraq in 2003 and proposed 
[normal]in
[normal] Syria in 2013)
[normal],
[normal] or pr
[normal]e
[normal]venting h
[normal]umanitarian
[normal] catastrophes
[normal] (Kosovo 1999, Libya 2011)
[normal]. 
[normal]International law does not provide any clear rights or duties here in the absence of an authorization from the Security Council.
[normal] The emergence in the 21
[normal]st
[normal] century of the ‘Responsibility 
[normal]to Protect’, when a government fails to protect its population from crimes against humanity,
[normal] has not (yet) shaken off the shackles of the Security Council in part due to the perceived lack of alternative and legitimate security communities.
[normal] 
[normal]In these controversial cases
[normal] where military action is proposed in order to prevent crimes against humanity
[normal] there 
[normal]are 
[normal]very few instances when the executive has to take action without having time to go to Par
[normal]liament
[normal], 
[normal]al
[normal]though it 
[normal]ha
[normal]d
[normal] to 
[normal]in the face of imminent humanit
[normal]a
[normal]r
[normal]ia
[normal]n catastrophe thre
[normal]ate
[normal]ned by the Gaddafi regime against 
[normal]Benghazi
[normal] in 2011
[normal] when force was used under clear UN authority before a vote was held in the House of Commons
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]11.
[normal] 
[normal]Thus, in most instances 
[normal](including of self-defence and humanitarian ne
[normal]cessity
[normal]) 
[normal]there is time for Parliament to be involved in a meaningful way in decisions to deploy significant forces or 
[normal]to 
[normal]use
[normal] military 
[normal]force. It would be an exceptional situation where the government has to deploy forces in an emergency
[normal] without seeking Parliamentary approval
[normal]. Parliamentary involvement would not hamper the 
[normal]operational 
[normal]effectiveness of any military action, 
[normal]but 
[normal]it would mean that Parliament may prevent the deployment or use of force because the majority of MP
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] not convinced 
[normal]by the Government’s arguments 
[normal]that there 
[normal]i
[normal]s a need t
[normal]o
[normal] use force. 
[normal]Bearing in mind the Government’
[normal]s strong position in Parliament, giving Parliament a say in conflict decisions should not be seen as a permanent barrier to the effective prosecution of wars, but only a barrier that might come down if Parliament remains unconvinced by the Government’s arguments and justifications. 
[normal]The Insufficiency of Recent[bold] [bold]P[bold]ractice[bold]12.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]recent
[normal] practice
[normal] (starting with Iraq in 2003
[normal] and most recently Syria in 2013
[normal])
[normal] of seeking approval in Parliament prior to a use of force does not jeopardize the prerogative power
[normal].
[normal] A
[normal]lthough the Prime Minister may cho
[normal]o
[normal]se
[normal],
[normal] for political or democratic reasons
[normal],
[normal] not to exercise prerogative powers in the face of Parliamentary disapproval as in the Syr
[normal]ian debates
[normal], there is no 
[normal]doubt that such a power remains and all 
[normal]that 
[normal]Parliament is doing 
[normal]legally 
[normal]is commenting upon its proposed use. Accountability is in effect being brought forward to before the use of force commences, as opposed to waiting to a later point, but it remains an exercise in 
[normal]limited 
[normal]political accountability nonetheless.
[normal]13.
[normal] 
[normal]Requiring positive approval in the form of a substantive resolution not ‘approving’ or ‘supporting’ the 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment’s decision, but 
[normal]forming part of that 
[normal]‘deci
[normal]sion
[normal]’ to authorize the use of force
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]might appear to
[normal] 
[normal]jeopardize
[normal] 
[normal]Parliament
[normal]’s
[normal] role
[normal] 
[normal]as a mechanism of accountability. 
[normal]Nevertheless, 
[normal]Parliament’s
[normal] powers of scrutiny
[normal] 
[normal]would be
[normal] enhanced. The executive prop
[normal]o
[normal]sal 
[normal]would be
[normal] s
[normal]c
[normal]rutinised by Parliament and
[normal],
[normal] if it passes that scrutiny
[normal],
[normal] then Parliam
[normal]e
[normal]nt will 
[normal]ultimately 
[normal]decide on the use of force
[normal]. Parliament
[normal] not only 
[normal]performs
[normal] an accountability function it takes 
[normal]co-
[normal]responsibility for the decision that emerges.
[normal] 
[normal]It makes Parliament’s role central in conflict decisions 
[normal]and further
[normal]more
[normal] 
[normal]it makes it central at the crucial time. 
[normal]14.
[normal] 
[normal]In addition, 
[normal]the current position is that 
[normal]the G
[normal]overnment can 
[normal]use its 
[normal]prerogative powers 
[normal]to 
[normal]deploy troops and forces ready to use force 
[normal]and 
[normal]then go to the House for support just before the actual use of force 
[normal]is planned 
[normal](as in Iraq in 2003)
[normal],
[normal] making it 
[normal]extremely 
[normal]difficult for the House to vote against 
[normal]it 
[normal]in the face of a build up to war knowing in any case that the prerogative power remains. Arguably
[normal],
[normal] when the UK is threatening
[normal] to use
[normal] force
[normal] and backs that threat by the deployment of forces
[normal],
[normal] it has already potentially violated international law (which prohibits both the threat and use of force) and
[normal],
[normal] therefore
[normal],
[normal] any 
[normal] UK 
[normal]‘decision’ to do so should have been made prior to the deployment
[normal] and accompanying 
[normal]threat
[normal] of force
[normal].
[normal]15.
[normal] 
[normal]It follows that 
[normal]the current position is unsatisfactory not only because it leaves the prerogative untouched, at least in legal terms, it allows the 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment to manipulate the agenda, to make threats, to deploy forces and then go to the House for political reasons to seek approval for its decision to use force. The fact that this now normally takes place before the actual use of kinetic force is an improvement on much of the earlier practice
[normal],
[normal] but it does not increase democratic input 
[normal]in
[normal]to decision making sufficiently in this era of legally controversial uses of force. The Syrian debate may mislead us into thinking that we have finally tipped the balance in favour of democracy but, although it does nudge us in that direction, the evidence is that better executive management of the build up to the debate would have enabled the 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment to have gained approval. 
[normal]Resolution or Statute?[bold]16.
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]ould a War Powers Resolution constitute a real legal limitation on prerogative powers? 
[normal]The reform proposal that was due to be laid before Parliament for approval before the general election in May 2010, 
[normal]took 
[normal]the form of a non-binding war powers resolution,
[normal]  giving the Prime Minister maximum flexibility as to the timing of seeking approval from the House of Commons for a Government decision authorising the use of force by British armed forces outside the UK. As with the invasion of Iraq in 2003, this may mean that the timing of the vote will be such as to ensure that it is too late for the House of Commons to realistically say no. In addition, under the draft resolution, there would have been no need for the Government to seek retrospective approval when the operation 
[normal]was
[normal] urgent or secret. Furthermore, the proposed resolution would not have required the Attorney General 
[normal]to 
[normal]make his full advice available to Parliament, though legal reasons would normally be given.  
[normal]I
[normal]n reality 
[normal]this 
[normal]represented little change from the current constitutional position and had the added advantage, from the Government’s point of view, of being in a non-
[normal]statutory
[normal] form thereby making sure that the Courts are not enticed into the debate about the legality of decisions to go to war.  
[normal]Even an improved Resolution would not replace the prerogative although its acceptance and usage would produce a convention
[normal]. This
[normal] would have some value in constitutional law in qualifying the prerogative
[normal] further by recognising the entitlement of Parliament to vote and not simply to be consulted prior to a use of force
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]17.
[normal] 
[normal]This leads to the issue of whether a
[normal] War Powers Statute 
[normal]would 
[normal]reduce military efficiency too much by introducing the possibility of judicial review
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Such a 
[normal]path might be seen as not only increasing democracy b
[normal]y
[normal] making Parliament 
[normal]co-responsible for a 
[normal]decision to go to war but 
[normal]also 
[normal]moving 
[normal]the 
[normal]accountability
[normal] function towards the Courts in the form of judicial review. 
[normal]However, while the
[normal] Courts would be concerned with whether the procedure of the Statute was being complied
[normal] with
[normal], for instance
[normal],
[normal] whether a vote in the House of Commons was undertaken in 
[normal]a 
[normal]procedurally correct way; or whether the House of Commons had been given sufficient information, including on the legality of the proposed operation, upon which to make an informed decision. 
[normal]Under a War Powers Statute t
[normal]he Courts may declare, in 
[normal]obvious 
[normal]cases where there is clearly no emerg
[normal]ency
[normal] situation, that the 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment had not been enti
[normal]t
[normal]led to take action first and ask Parliam
[normal]e
[normal]nt later. Thus
[normal],
[normal] the Courts would be conce
[normal]rned
[normal] with clear abuse of the process, 
[normal]but 
[normal]not with detailed arguments about the legality of going to war under international 
[normal]norms. 
[normal] 
[normal]Proceedings before the Courts would not delay military action and any declaration by the Courts that the Statute had not been complied 
[normal]with 
[normal]should lead to the Government 
[normal]modifying its behaviour in the future
[normal].
[normal] In this way jurisprudence would help develop and 
[normal]embed
[normal] the Statute
[normal] 
[normal]in a way that 
[normal]would
[normal] not hamper effective military action.
[normal] 
[normal]18.
[normal] 
[normal]Given that i
[normal]nternational law is a much more open-textured system than domestic law
[normal],
[normal] and the area is in a state of flux particularly with arguments 
[normal]about the nature and extent of the 
[normal]R
[normal]esponsibility to 
[normal]P
[normal]rotect
[normal], it would not be appropriate for 
[normal]a 
[normal]British 
[normal]c
[normal]ourt to decide or even comment on the legality of the use of force itself, although it would be concerned with 
[normal]the 
[normal]question of whether Parliament had been given sufficient information on the legal basis so as to make an informed decision.
[normal] 
[normal]There is s
[normal]u
[normal]ffi
[normal]cient
[normal] evid
[normal]ence
[normal] of the Courts
[normal]’
[normal] deference on 
[normal]such 
[normal]matters to be confident that they would not see this as an opportunity to assert 
[normal]powers of review
[normal] over Government and Parli
[normal]a
[normal]m
[normal]ent
[normal]. 
[normal]The Courts 
[normal]already 
[normal]recognise that these are dec
[normal]i
[normal]sions for the political organs 
[normal]ma
[normal]king difficult judgments in constantly changing 
[normal]international 
[normal]security situations.
[normal] 
[normal]19.
[normal] 
[normal]While a War Powers Resolution may be a useful interim step and a practical limitation on prerogative powers, only a Statute would clearly ground the 
[normal]final 
[normal]decision to go to war in Parliament. 
[normal]The
[normal] price is the possibility of greater judicial involvement
[normal]. 
[normal]However, while the Courts have moved towards the assertion of jurisdiction over prerogative powers
[normal] since the 
[normal]GCHQ 
[normal]case of 1985,
[normal] they have seen issues of war powers as not suited to judicial determination and have therefore declared such issues non-justiciable.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he reason behind this
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] that 
[normal]the Courts
[normal] should 
[normal]not become involved in 
[normal]m
[normal]atters of foreign policy and in issues of use of force
[normal] in that these are decisions for the elected Government and not for the Courts.
[normal] 
[normal]Such an 
[normal]approach would continue 
[normal]u
[normal]nder a War Powers Act given the rationale is that it is the type of 
[normal]governmental 
[normal]decision that is not reviewable whether it is derived from prerogative powers or not. 
[normal]Given this 
[normal]abstinence,
[normal] the reality is that the Courts would not present a brake on 
[normal]operational 
[normal]effic
[normal]iency
[normal] or the general ability of the executive to prosecute a war
[normal], but they would keep the Government 
[normal]and 
[normal]Parliament honest in the way they interpret 
[normal]a
[normal] War Powers
[normal] Act
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]20.
[normal] 
[normal]Decisions to deploy significant forces or to use force would normally be made prior to deployment or use; but an 
[normal]ex post
[normal] decision would have to be catered for in cases of 
[normal]necessity of 
[normal]self-defence and humanitarian 
[normal]action
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]but only 
[normal]where 
[normal]immediate 
[normal]force is necessary to combat an imminent attack or 
[normal]to prevent an imminent 
[normal]humanitarian catastrophe where there is 
[normal]‘
[normal]no choice of means and no moment for deliberation
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] Indeed
[normal], British deployments and uses of force since 1945 show that
[normal] in most instances there is time for debate and decision so that 
[normal]prior co-decision making
[normal] should be the norm and the exception
[normal]s
[normal] should be 
[normal]carefully defined in order to 
[normal]prevent exploitation.

[normal] 
[normal]Given the difficulty international law has in providing precise definitions it should only be used as 
[normal]a 
[normal]framework for
[normal] the conditions that should trigger the application of 
[normal]a
[normal] War Powers Resolution/Statute. On this basis non-legal language should be used and the triggers 
[normal]for co-decision making 
[normal]should not be the ‘use of force’ or the presence of ‘armed conflict’, but any proposed 
[normal]decision to deploy significant numbers 
[normal]of 
[normal]British troops/forces to an overseas crisis, conflict or post-conflict situation
[normal]. Given that the desire is to have meaningful decision-making at a stage when force is being contemplated rather than actuated, it should occur at the point when troops/forces are being identified and plans are being drawn up
[normal]. Ther
[normal]e
[normal] is the danger that this 
[normal]might
[normal] give too much information to 
[normal]a
[normal] potential enemy, but most interventions are not premised on surprise (with the exception of Suez in 1956)
[normal],
[normal] but are taken in response to invasions (Korea 1950, Falklands 1982, 
[normal]Iraq 1990) or as part of an incremental response to threats to the peace (for instance in Bosnia in 1992-5).
[normal]22.
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal] Resolution/Statute should apply to any significant deployment of UK forces whether they are bound for peacekeeping, peace support, peace enforcement or war fighting
[normal]. T
[normal]o
[normal] ex
[normal]c
[normal]lude peacekeeping forces on the basis that they trad
[normal]i
[normal]tionally do not become en
[normal]gaged
[normal] as combatants might tempt the 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment into sending the w
[normal]ro
[normal]ng sort of force in order to escape scrutiny, but in any case most modern peacekeeping operations are authorised by the Security Council to use force not only to defend themselves, but to defend civil
[normal]ians
[normal] an
[normal]d
[normal], more broadly, the
[normal]i
[normal]r mandates. 
[normal]In addition, mission creep can lead to soldiers being tasked with additional duties leading to long-term and dangerous military commitments. 
[normal]Thus, sending a UK contingent of 1,000 sold
[normal]i
[normal]ers to a peace operation
[normal] in what appears to be a post-conflict situation
[normal] would be, I argue, a significant deployment and
[normal],
[normal] therefore, ought to be covered by any 
[normal]War Powers Resolution/S
[normal]tatute.

[normal]The Government needs to give sufficient information to Parliament in order for it to make an informed decision. 
[normal]Information to be laid before the House 
[normal]would include the 
[normal]full 
[normal]legal opinion of the Attorney General
[normal],
[normal] which if not s
[normal]ufficiently
[normal] detailed 
[normal]or otherwise
[normal] satisfactory 
[normal]sh
[normal]ould be suppleme
[normal]n
[normal]ted by further advice sought by Parliament or a Committee of the House of Commons. T
[normal]his

[normal]ent
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] take a bal

[normal] dec
[normal]i
[normal]sion
[normal]. I
[normal]t might feel
[normal], for example, 
[normal] that the pro
[normal]p
[normal]osed action is not fully grounded in international law but is legitimate and necessary; or it might reject the assertions of legal
[normal]i
[normal]ty by the Government.

[normal] 
[normal]Only very exceptionally in cases of imminent attack
[normal] or humanitarian catastrophe

[normal],
[normal] can the decision

[normal] made after threat/deployment
[normal]/use of force
[normal] and then it should normally be given within 
[normal]a short period (
[normal]within seven
[normal] days
[normal] would seem reasonable
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]

[normal]n the 
[normal]prosecution of 
[normal]the

[normal], for example
[normal] from protection of civilians to regime change

[normal] The Government’s proposal stipulated that the Security Council should immediately consider the initial findings of the UN’s investigating team and that every effort should be made to secure a Security Council resolution and, in any case, a further vote would be held in the House of Commons before force would be used. The Opposition’s proposal imposed a number of additional conditions, including that there was a clear basis in international law for taking military action -   Hansard HC, Vol 466, col 1425 and 1440 (29 Aug
[normal]ust
[normal] 2013). 
[normal]

[normal]ry action in northern Iraq to protect the 
[normal]K
[normal]urds in 1991
[normal] (and again in Kosovo in 1999)
[normal], there is little 
[normal]legal support for this from other states. Indeed the Foreign Affairs Committee’s inquiry into Kosovo in 2000 found that NATO’s action over Kosovo was unlawful though legitimate
[normal] on the basis that humanitarian intervention was of doubtful pedigree in international law
[normal] 
[normal]– HC Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Fourth Report 1999-2000, 7 June 2000, paras 124-44.
[normal] This was raised in the debate over Syria – see Hansard 
[normal]HC, 
[normal]V
[normal]ol 466, col 1516 (Abbott).
[normal] 
[normal]Reprisals, as with humanitarian intervention, are generally seen as prohibited uses of force under international law
[normal] since the UN Charter prohibited force in 1945
[normal]. In 1970 the UN General Assembly declared in a consensus resolution, commonly seen as part of the fabric of international law
[normal],
[normal] that reprisals were unlawful – UNGA Res 
[normal]2625 (1970), 
[normal]known 
[normal]as the Declaration on Friendly Relations
[normal]. This point was raised in the Syrian debate in Hansard

[normal],

[normal] 
[normal] After being defeated in the vote over proposed military action against Syria the Prime Minister was asked whether he would still use the royal prerogative to order military action. He answered that although he strongly believed in the ‘need for a tough response to the use of chemical weapons, 
[normal]… 
[normal]I believe in respecting the will of the House of Commons. It is very clear tonight that … the British Parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action. I get that, and the Government will act accordingly’ – Hansard

[normal] Many examples could be given to support this. One is Richards J
[normal] 
[normal] in 
[normal]The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament v The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
[normal] [2002] EWHC 2777
[normal] at para 59: ‘
[normal]A plain purpose of 
[normal]the 
[normal]present claim is to discourage or inhibit 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government from using armed force against Iraq without a further Security Council resolution. Thus 
[normal]the 
[normal]claim is an attempt to limit 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government's freedom of movement in relation to 
[normal]the 
[normal]actual use of military force as well as in relation to 
[normal]the 
[normal]exercise of diplomatic pressure in advance. That takes it squarely into 
[normal]the 
[normal]fields of foreign affairs and defence. In my view it is unthinkable that 
[normal]the 
[normal]national courts would entertain a challenge to a Government decision to declare war or to authorise 
[normal]the 
[normal]use of armed force against a third country. That is a classic example of a non-justiciable decision. I reject Mr Singh's submission that it would be permissible in principle to isolate and rule upon legal issues e.g. as to whether 
[normal]the 
[normal]decision was taken in breach of international law. 
[normal]The 
[normal]nature and subject matter of such a decision require it to be treated as an indivisible whole rather than breaking it down into legal, political, military and other components and viewing those components in isolation for 
[normal]the 
[normal]purpose of determining whether they are suited to judicial determination. 
[normal]The 
[normal]same objections of principle apply to an attempt to isolate in advance a potential legal component of a possible future decision with a view to limiting 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government's freedom of movement when taking 
[normal]the 
[normal]decision itself’.
