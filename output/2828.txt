[[[Funding weak claims: is it a problem?]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;“Well let me give you a raw piece of statistic that will explain the nature of the problem. In 2011, the last year we had figures available, there were 11,359 applications for judicial review. In the end 144 were successful and 

[[[all the rest of them]]] tied up government lawyers, local authority lawyers in time, in expense for a huge number of cases of which virtually none were successful. We’re not saying that there shouldn’t be judicial review, we’re not saying that members of the public and organisations should not be able to challenge public bodies, but what we are saying is that we have to raise the bar so that we have fewer cases that have no chance of succeeding.”  [Emphasis added.]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

In some such cases, it may help to consider who would have won if the matter had proceeded to trial …” (para 62)&#xa0;&#xa0;“No order for costs will be the default order when the judge cannot without disproportionate expenditure of judicial time , if at all, fairly and sensibly make an order in favour of either party.” (Para 77)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[save money?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“It may be saving the Legal Services Commission which no longer offers legal aid for this kind of litigation  but saving expenditure in one public department in this instance simply increases it in the courts. The expense of three judges of the Court of Appeal dealing with this kind of appeal is enormous. The consequences by way of delay  of other appeals which need to be heard are unquantifiable. The appeal would certainly never have occurred if the litigants had been represented.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
