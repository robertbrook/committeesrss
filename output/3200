[normal]My view on the future of the BBC is quite simple. The license fee is no longer supportable. Now that the last analogue transmitter has been switched off the days of taxing people to watch broadcast televisi
[normal]on are numbered. The license fee should be used to
[normal] provide every license purchaser with a set top box containing a decryption system similar to that employed by Sky. Sky users already have the ne
[normal]cessary hardware. The BBC 
[normal]tv
[normal] signals could then after a year be encrypted and at future renewals anyone who want
[normal]ed to continue watching the BBC would purchase an updated subscription. This would put and end to the current 
[normal]BBC's money with menaces tactics and the BBC would be compelled to live within its means. The license fee aka televisi
[normal]on tax is a disgraceful anac
[normal]hronism that has outlived its time.
