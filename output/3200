defaultMy view on the future of the BBC is quite simple. The license fee is no longer supportable. Now that the last analogue transmitter has been switched off the days of taxing people to watch broadcast televisi
defaulton are numbered. The license fee should be used to
default provide every license purchaser with a set top box containing a decryption system similar to that employed by Sky. Sky users already have the ne
defaultcessary hardware. The BBC 
defaulttv
default signals could then after a year be encrypted and at future renewals anyone who want
defaulted to continue watching the BBC would purchase an updated subscription. This would put and end to the current 
defaultBBC's money with menaces tactics and the BBC would be compelled to live within its means. The license fee aka televisi
defaulton tax is a disgraceful anac
defaulthronism that has outlived its time.
