defaultAs the local representative, I write on behalf of the WIBF, a long established World promoter and sanctioning authority for women's professional boxing.

defaultThis opportunity is not open to British women because the BBC and SKY television channels will not televise their fights. We consider this to be sexual discrimination.

defaults boxing in the print media.
