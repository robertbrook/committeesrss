"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Tim Bartlett (PH 26)&#xa0;Complaints: do they make a difference?Things can look very different when viewed from different perspectives. Senior civil servants may genuinely believe that their departments/agencies are doing a good job of dealing with complaints simply because those lower down the pecking order are able to tick off boxes as \"resolved\", while members of the public are left frustrated because genuine grievances have been stonewalled so persistently that they have been forced to give up.\n&#xa0;\nI suggest that no complaint can be regarded as \"resolved\" until the person who made the complaint is satisfied with the outcome. Whilst this may mean that some complaints can never be resolved, it would be considerably better than the present system in which genuine grievances are ignored. \nGovernment departments and public service providers do not appear to use \ncomplaints to improve the service provided\n, and seem to have \nlittle or no\n incentive to do so.\nNo comment\nNo comment\nNo comment\nI am submitting a separate document that \nrefers to\n two complaints I have made that in the past five years that were eventually submitted to the Ombudsman. Both were all about money: in both cases, I am sure the officials concerned believe th\nat by stonewalling my complaints they were\n \"saving\"\n \npublic \nmoney. \n&#xa0;\nIn one case, defending myself against an unjustified demand for less than £150 cost me about £2000. I doubt whether it cost the agency concerned any less. The case was eventually settled (in my favour) in court, but I have no doubt that there are thousands of people who are less stub\nborn than I, who simply give up, so in pure financial terms, \nI am sure their strategy does, indeed \"save\" money.\n&#xa0;\nThe true cost of \nthe stonewalling strategy \nis in public trust. There is a limit to the number of times any individual can be expected to put up with arrogance and dishonesty from civil servants before they begin to believe\n that \nall (or most) civil servants are arrogant and dishonest and that \ndishonesty has be\nen elevated to \nofficial policy.\n \n    \n.\nThey do not.\nNo. Even if each individual step is clear, the procedure as a whole is not. Some officials seem to feel obliged to make it as difficult as possible to \nprogress a complaint\n. \nI am\n grammar-school educated, \na former Royal Navy officer, \nand \nnow a journalist, so I regard myself as well-educated and literate. I have found dealing with government agencies to be difficult, time-consuming, and frustrating. How someone who is ill, frail, \nor has learning difficulties or a poor grasp of E\nnglish would cope is unimaginable. \nI do not believe any person or organisation welcomes complaints, but most private sector organisations recognise that the best way to deal with them is quickly and honestly. My experience of government agencies is the opposite: delays seem to be a deliberate strategy; mistakes are commonplace and deliberate misrepresentation is not unusual.\nNo.\n \nNo. In my opinion, judicial investigation/remedy should be unnecessary in most cases: deliberate dishonesty should be extremely rare, and \nit should be possible to rectify \ngenuine mistakes without recourse to the judicial system. \nSadly, I believe the culture of \"defensive behaviour\" has progressed to the stage at which institutional dishonesty has become widespread and deeply ingrained: I refer you to the case histories outlined in the attached document. \nNo comment\nNo comment\nNo comment\nNo comment\nI have only one experience of a tribunal, and that was almost 20 years ago, against the CSA. The tribunal was merely another coat of whitewash over an unjustified decision\n, and another hoop that I had to jump through before the\n matter was \neventually \nresolved \nby\n the Social Security Commissioner.\nIn a perfect world, a \"one-stop\" shop -- analogous to UCAS for \nhandling \napplications to higher education\n or the 999 telephone number for contacting the emergency services\n -- would be ideal. But \nunless and until government departments and agencies learn to deal with complaints properly, it would be a wasted effort.\nNo comment\nParliament’s Ombudsman ServiceFor many people, the Ombudsman is the final safety net to protect them against maladministration or deliberate wrong-doing by government officials. It should exercise that role responsibly, rather than treating complaints as a box-ticking exercise. It should certainly not be attempting to take on more complaints unless it is able and willing to investigate them properly, rather than finding excuses to dismiss them. The ombudsman's own figures show that less than 2% of complaints are investigated, and less than 1% are upheld. \nThe chances of the Ombudsman actually investigating any individual complaint are about the same as the chance of winning a prize in the National lottery with a single ticket.\nA \"safety net\" that allows more than 98% of cases to fall through it is not fit for purpose, and is probably beyond repair. It should be discarded, and an effective replacement introduced as soon as possible.\n&#xa0;\nI am not qualified to comment on the Ombudsman's relationship with Parliament or the PASC, except that as the Ombudsman \nclaims to have been \"...\n set up by Parliament to help both individuals and the public\n.\", it has a duty to Parliament to do what it was set up to do. Its own figures show that it is failing to investigate more than 98% of complaints submitted to it. I am sure a postman who dumped 98% of letters in the bin, or a bus driver who left 98% of his passengers standing at bus stops would soon find themselves looking for new jobs. I see no reason why the Ombudsman should continue to receive taxpayer's money for doing less than 2% of the job.\nUseless. It is an exercise in whitewashing.\nIn my experience, the PHSO does not deal with complaints about itself.\n I received a letter that failed to address the fundamental issue I had raised, but whose concluding sentences were\n \n\"This review is the end of the complaints process, and it is time to draw correspondence on your complaint to a close. We will acknowledge anything more you send us about it, but will only respond if we see a need to.\"I understand that this is standard practice, and that even the wording is virtually standard.\n \nNo. Such a move would probably increase the number of complaints submitted, but it is difficult to imagine that it would increase the number that are investigated and upheld. \n&#xa0;\nSummaryCase History 1: DVLACase History 1: Comments Case History 1: ConclusionsCase History 2: Primary Care TrustCase History 2: Technical background\"\n PCTs should not\n refer a case back\n or\n decide not to accept a recommendation simply because the multidisciplinary team has made a recommendation that differs from the one that those who are involved in making the final decision would have made\n, based on the same evidence.\"\n\"PCT decision-making processes should not have the function of: \nCase History 2: Narrative\"\n...\n Mr \n***\n needs demonstrate a primary healthcare need \nand a nursing home placement should be fully funded under continuing health care.\"\nCase History 2: The Ombudsman's initial assessment\"You told us that the SHA failed to properly consider the discrepancies between the PCT's decision and the original Multi Disciplinary Team (the MDT) decision regarding your father's eligibility for Continuing Healthcare funding (CHC funding).
