[normal]Written [bold]evidence [bold]submitted by [bold]Professor Anthony Bradley QC[bold] [bold](CRJ 11)[bold]The present inquiry 
[normal]seeks
[normal] ‘to 
[normal]explore how the role of the judiciary would change were the 
[normal]UK
[normal] to move towards a codified constitution, and the challenges that this changed role would present
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]This paper contains some
[normal] 
[normal]brief
[normal] answers 
[normal]to the 
[normal]broad 
[normal]questions posed by the Committee
[normal], and it does not attempt 
[normal]to 
[normal]explore all the implications
[normal] of th
[normal]ose
[normal] questions
[normal].  
[normal]              
[normal]The primary role of the judiciary is to uphold 
[normal]the principle of civil and criminal justice and 
[normal]the rule of law
[normal] by
[normal] 
[normal]deciding the
[normal] 
[normal]cases
[normal] 
[normal]that come 
[normal]before
[normal] courts
[normal] and tribunals
[normal],
[normal] resolving disputes 
[normal]over
[normal] 
[normal]issues
[normal] of law and 
[normal](subject to 
[normal]the role of 
[normal]the jury in criminal cases) 
[normal]issues
[normal] of fact, and sentencing those convicted of criminal offences.
[normal]  This role
[normal] 
[normal]is exercised subject to the 
[normal]supreme 
[normal]power of the Westminster Parliament to legislate for the 
[normal]UK
[normal].  As well as interpreting legislation by Parliament,
[normal] the courts 
[normal]apply and 
[normal]as
[normal] necessary develop 
[normal]rules
[normal] that 
[normal]derive from
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]common law
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]T
[normal]he role of the judiciary includes power to review the 
[normal]legality of 
[normal]acts of ministers, civil servants, the armed forces and other public 
[normal]bodies
[normal]:
[normal] the procedure of judicial review is 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]primary means by which the courts ensure that government is conducted according to law.
[normal]  
[normal]The independence of the judiciary has been a vital 
[normal]constitutional 
[normal]element since at least 1700.   
[normal]              
[normal]Because of
[normal] 
[normal]British
[normal] involvement in Europe
[normal], decisions 
[normal]by 
[normal]UK
[normal] courts 
[normal]are now 
[normal]subject to review or oversight by the Court of Justice at 
[normal]Luxemb
[normal]o
[normal]urg
[normal] and the European Court of Human Rights at 
[normal]Strasbourg
[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]continued 
[normal]existence of an independent judiciary is a pre-requisite in these areas of European law.
[normal]              
[normal]The creation of 
[normal]devolved legislatures 
[normal]in 
[normal]Scotland
[normal], 
[normal]Wales
[normal] and 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] has 
[normal]added ‘devolution issues’ to
[normal] the jurisdiction of the courts
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]The Human Rights Act 1998 
[normal](HRA) 
[normal]altered the traditional role of the courts by 
[normal]requiring
[normal] them ‘where possible’ to interpret legislation in a manner that is compatible with rights protected by the E
[normal]uropean Convention on Human Rights
[normal].  W
[normal]here this is not possible, 
[normal]the higher courts may 
[normal]declare that a statutory provision is incompatible with a Convention right. 
[normal] Even if the courts make a ‘declaration of incompatibility’, the statut
[normal]e
[normal] remains in force
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]but 
[normal]the HRA provides 
[normal]special 
[normal]machinery for enabling the incompatibility to be removed
[normal] by the government
[normal],
[normal] acting with the approval of Parliament.
[normal] 
[normal]In what principal respects[bold] might this role be changed if the [bold]UK[bold] were to [bold]move towards[bold] a written constitution?[bold]Th
[normal]e answer must depend on the 
[normal]extent of movement towards a
[normal] written constitution
[normal] and on the nature of the constitution to be adopted
[normal]. 
[normal]A
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal] The
[normal] 
[normal]existing 
[normal]role 
[normal]of the courts 
[normal]need not change merely because
[normal] a written 
[normal]or c
[normal]odified constitution is adopted.  
[normal] The
[normal] most limited form of 
[normal]such 
[normal]a constitution would simply 
[normal]aim
[normal] 
[normal]to reproduce the existing pattern of relationships between government, Parliament and the courts;
[normal] 
[normal]Parliament would 
[normal]retain 
[normal]unlimited power to legislate for the UK, the courts would not 
[normal]have 
[normal]power to review 
[normal]the validity of 
[normal]legislation
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]no special process would be 
[normal]required should Parliament wish to 
[normal]make constitutional changes.
[normal]   
[normal]The codified constitution would thus lack any special 
[normal]status 
[normal]to distinguish it from other Acts of Parliament
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]An obvious comment on 
[normal]this 
[normal]limited 
[normal]goal is to ask whether it 
[normal]would be 
[normal]worth 
[normal]achieving
[normal].   Moreover, if the written text were to include a
[normal]reas
[normal] of government that are 
[normal]now 
[normal]subject to 
[normal]unwritten 
[normal]constitutional conventions, existence of 
[normal]th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]text 
[normal]might 
[normal]well
[normal] 
[normal]give rise to 
[normal]new questions 
[normal]for the 
[normal]courts.  At present, a court may 
[normal]reject 
[normal]a c
[normal]laim
[normal] based on a convention by saying that the convention is not law.  If the constitution 
[normal]were to write down 
[normal]all or some of 
[normal]the conventions
[normal] (e g as to the conduct of ministers)
[normal], 
[normal]it would be 
[normal]more 
[normal]diffi
[normal]cult for the court to refuse to intervene if there were grounds for saying that the rule in the constitution had been breached
[normal].
[normal]    It would be 
[normal]possible, but not wholly 
[normal]satisfactory
[normal],
[normal] for the constitution
[normal]al text
[normal] to guard against this by providing that certain 
[normal]parts 
[normal]of the constitution were not to be interpreted or enforced by the courts.
[normal]B.
[normal]              
[normal]A
[normal]t the other extreme
[normal],
[normal] the 
[normal]written constitution might 
[normal]be 
[normal]granted 
[normal]the legal status that it has in countries
[normal] 
[normal]where the constitution is ‘fundamental
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal](or supreme) 
[normal]law and the powers of all 
[normal]state 
[normal]institutions 
[normal]are said to 
[normal]derive from it
[normal].   
[normal]See the 
[normal]US
[normal] Constitution, Article VI (2): 
[normal]              
[normal]“This Constitution, and the Laws of the 
[normal]United States
[normal] which shall be made in 
[normal]              
[normal]pursuance therefore … shall be the supreme law of the land.” 
[normal]A
[normal] 
[normal]recent example 
[normal]is in
[normal] the South African Constitution
[normal] of 1996, section 2: 
[normal]              
[normal]“This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic; law or conduct 
[normal]              
[normal]inconsistent with it is invalid, and the obligations imposed by it must be 
[normal]              
[normal]fulfilled”.   
[normal]In 
[normal]Marbury v 
[normal]Madison
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]1803)
[normal], 
[normal]the US Supreme Court decided that laws made by Congress must conform with the Constitution
[normal], and could be quashed if they were contrary to it.  The supremacy clause in 
[normal]South Africa
[normal] provides explicitly that laws inconsistent with the Constitution are invalid.  
[normal]              
[normal]Where a constitution contains 
[normal]a supremacy clause
[normal],
[normal] it is now to be expected that the courts
[normal] 
[normal](or possibly a 
[normal]Constitutional Court
[normal]) 
[normal]would acquire the role of enforcing the constitution, since anything contrary to the constitution would be unlawful.   
[normal]So
[normal] the courts
[normal], as ‘guardians of the constitution’,
[normal] would 
[normal]have
[normal] power to review the constitutionality of acts of the legislature
[normal] and the 
[normal]executive
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]To
[normal] what matters would 
[normal]the 
[normal]power to 
[normal]review
[normal] apply
[normal]?  This 
[normal]would 
[normal]depend on wh
[normal]ether the constitution 
[normal]included 
[normal]features
[normal] such as 
[normal]protection for 
[normal]fundamental rights
[normal] and liberties
[normal],
[normal] a formal separation of powers
[normal], 
[normal]a 
[normal]federal
[normal] structure,
[normal] the 
[normal]incorporation
[normal] of international and European law 
[normal]etc.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]All s
[normal]uch provisions would 
[normal]limit 
[normal]the legislative authority of Parliament
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal](The constitution would also be likely to include provisions requiring Parliament to make laws on stated topics – for instance, the conduct of elections.) 
[normal]It would 
[normal]necessarily 
[normal]follow that 
[normal]Parliament 
[normal]w
[normal]ould 
[normal]be unable
[normal] 
[normal]to amend the constitution by ordinary legislation
[normal]: 
[normal]the amendment process would be set out in the 
[normal]constitution
[normal], and might require, for instance, 
[normal]special majorities in Parliament, endorsement by a referendum etc.
[normal]              
[normal]One 
[normal]issue 
[normal]to
[normal] be addressed is 
[normal]whether decisions of the Supreme Court (or Constitutional Court) interpreting the constitution should be final, subject only to constitutional amendment, or whether a way might be found of enabling
[normal] the wishes of Parliament 
[normal]to prevail over the Supreme Court
[normal]’s decision
[normal].  On certain matters, for instance, the Canadian constitution provides for 
[normal]there to be ‘
[normal]express 
[normal]legislative over-ride
[normal]’.
[normal] 
[normal]It
[normal] 
[normal]is arguable 
[normal]that weaker forms of judicial review
[normal],
[normal] especially as regards social and economic rights, are more acceptable on democratic grounds than the strong form of judicial review
[normal],
[normal] in which a constitutional amendment is required to overcome a Supreme Court decision.  (See:
[normal] 
[normal]M Tushnet, 
[normal]Weak Courts, Strong Rights: Judicial Review and Social Welfare Rights in Comparative Constitutional Law 
[normal](2008)
[normal] and 
[normal]S Gardbaum
[normal], 
[normal]The New Commonwealth Model of Constitutionalism: Theory and Practice 
[normal](2013)
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal] For the latter author, the HRA technique of a ‘declaration of incompatibility’ provides a weaker form of judicial review 
[normal]but one 
[normal]that 
[normal]may be defended
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]We may conclude that
[normal] 
[normal](except in the 
[normal]unlikely 
[normal]case of a ‘no change’ constitution) 
[normal]the role of the judicia
[normal]ry w
[normal]ould
[normal] 
[normal]be extended on the
[normal] adoption of a written constitution: 
[normal]the nature and extent of that change 
[normal]would depend on the contents of the constitution.
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]main
[normal] responsibility for 
[normal]all legislati
[normal]on
[normal] is a matter for the government and Parliament.  I do not consider that the judiciary should be consulted on whether the
[normal]re
[normal] should 
[normal]be
[normal] a written constitution, nor on what it should contain
[normal].  
[normal]The political neutrality of the judiciary means that, for instance, judges in 
[normal]Scotland
[normal] should stay out of the current independence debate. 
[normal]My advice would be different 
[normal]when the general structure of a 
[normal]new 
[normal]constitution ha
[normal]d
[normal] been settled 
[normal]through the political process, and a subsidiary 
[normal]question ar
[normal]ose
[normal] of fitting the existing judiciary within that struct
[normal]u
[normal]re
[normal].  Plainly the jud
[normal]ges
[normal] 
[normal]would protest if, for instance,
[normal] a new constitution w
[normal]ere to 
[normal]erode the
[normal]ir
[normal] independence 
[normal]or to diminish their existing role, 
[normal]for instance by taking away the power of courts to interpret legislation or t
[normal]he sentencing of 
[normal]criminals.
[normal]  
[normal]But for purposes of the present discussion, enactment of a codified constitution would add new jurisdiction to the courts, and would not take away existing jurisdiction.  
[normal]              
[normal]Since a codified constitution may take 
[normal]many
[normal] forms, no 
[normal]simple
[normal] answer is possible.  However, if the courts are to have power to hold an Act of
[normal] Parliament unconstitutional, then, on the basis that the constitution is fundamental law, it would follow that they should have power
[normal] to quash the offending provision
[normal] by making a declaration of invalidity
[normal] with immediate effect
[normal].  A 
[normal]much 
[normal]lesser power
[normal], and one
[normal] 
[normal]that would need to be spelled out in the constitution
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]would be
[normal] power to issue a declaration of incompatibility on the lines of th
[normal]at
[normal] under the HRA, s 4.
[normal] [bold]  [bold]              
[normal]Beyond this, 
[normal]it might 
[normal]be 
[normal]desirable 
[normal]for the constitution to 
[normal]include provision on such matters as - which court or courts 
[normal](all, or only some?) 
[normal]would have th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]new 
[normal]power
[normal];
[normal] whether prescribed procedure would need to be followed before 
[normal]the power
[normal] was exercised
[normal] (
[normal]for instance, by requiring the Law Officers to be informed)
[normal];
[normal] whether 
[normal]there would be rules about who 
[normal]would have standing to apply for a
[normal]n Act
[normal] to be reviewed, whether any time limits would apply
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]whether 
[normal]provision 
[normal]should 
[normal]be 
[normal]made 
[normal]for issues of urgency
[normal];
[normal] and whether 
[normal]a
[normal] court should have power to postpone the quashing of an unconstitutional statute to enable Parliament to make acceptable legislation in its place.  
[normal]a)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]What would be the implications of these powers on existing constitutional doctrines, including parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review?[bold]&#xa0;[bold] [bold]              
[normal]T
[normal]o confer these powers on the courts would 
[normal]be to supersede
[normal] the legislative sovereignty of Parliament 
[normal]with
[normal] a different doctrine
[normal]; 
[normal]the 
[normal]extent
[normal] of 
[normal]the new doctrine 
[normal]would depend on the various limits that the constitution impose
[normal]d
[normal] on 
[normal]the legislature.
[normal]  
[normal]Judicial review as it now exists (in administrative law
[normal] and under the HRA
[normal]) would not necessarily be affected.
[normal]  
[normal]Ministerial responsibility to Parliament would not directly be affected, 
[normal]but
[normal] the government would
[normal] have to take constitutional limit
[normal]ation
[normal]s into account in proposing new legislation.
[normal]b)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]In the context of question 3, what can we learn from the interaction between the [bold]UK[bold] courts and the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights?[bold]              
[normal]The conferment of power to hold an Act of Parliament to be unconstitutional might mean that cases that 
[normal]now 
[normal]go to the two European courts could be decided by the 
[normal]UK
[normal] courts.  This would depend 
[normal]to an extent 
[normal]on 
[normal]the 
[normal]provision made 
[normal]in the constitution 
[normal]for
[normal] EU law and the ECHR. At present, 
[normal]UK
[normal] courts are required by EU law to give direct effect to rights under EU law, even in the face of a 
[normal]UK
[normal] statute.  The position is different as regards the ECHR
[normal],
[normal] application of which depends on the Convention itself and the Human Rights Act 
[normal]  
[normal]The courts in the UK are already conversant with EU law and with decisions of the Strasbourg court.
[normal]              
[normal]Apart from the position under the 
[normal]devolution 
[normal]Acts
[normal], 
[normal]UK
[normal] courts and legislators have no experience of prior review of proposed legislation.  One disadvantage is that political opponents of a Bill may turn their opposition into a legal attack on the Bill, 
[normal]by
[normal] seeking political support from the courts.  Prospective review of this kind is necessarily abstract
[normal], and the common law tradition has had little experience of 
[normal]it
[normal].  In some contexts, for example if the constitution were to establish a formal system of federalism, it might be appropriate for a question as to t
[normal]he power of a legislature to deal with a particular subject to be resolved before a 
[normal]B
[normal]ill is enacted.  But a
[normal] key question is whether 
[normal]prior 
[normal]review would bar review taking place in a concrete case when the 
[normal]legislation has 
[normal]been implemented. 
[normal] It would not be 
[normal]acceptable
[normal] for cases involving fundamental rights to be conclusively decided while a 
[normal]B
[normal]ill was before Parliament, 
[normal]as
[normal] this could mean that an individual would be unable to challenge action taken in a way 
[normal]or for purposes 
[normal]that had not been foreseen at the earlier stage of abstract review.
[normal]              
[normal]In many countries, including 
[normal]Germany
[normal] and 
[normal]South Africa
[normal], a separate 
[normal]Constitutional Court
[normal] exists.  This court 
[normal]is 
[normal]likely to be
[normal] the exclusive arbiter of disputes about the constitution, so that other courts 
[normal]may not
[normal] deal with 
[normal]such
[normal] questions, and must refer them to the 
[normal]Constitutional Court
[normal]. The creation of 
[normal]such a  court
[normal] 
[normal]would be justified 
[normal]only if, for whatever reason
[normal]s
[normal], judges sitting in the ordinary courts 
[normal]were
[normal] thought to be unsuitable for, or incapable of, deciding constitutional questions.  One reason 
[normal]in many European countries 
[normal]for creating a 
[normal]Constitutional Court
[normal] is the desire to include in 
[normal]a ‘mixed’ 
[normal]court 
[normal]those 
[normal]with experience of politics and government
[normal], and this is unlikely to suit a 
[normal]legal system based on 
[normal]the common law. If senior politicians, retired civil servants, 
[normal]respected
[normal] professors, 
[normal]high ranking army officers and diplomats 
[normal]etc 
[normal]are to serve on such a court, 
[normal]in addition to professional judges, 
[normal]a separate appointment procedure would be needed, 
[normal]and 
[normal]the
[normal] political parties would have to agree on means for securing 
[normal]a 
[normal]balanced court
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This is indeed a wide question.  I have drawn attention in answering question 1 to various forms of judicial review of legislation.
[normal]  
[normal]There is a 
[normal]huge
[normal] literature about the wisdom within a democracy of subjecting questions that are essentially political in character to a framework in which the decisions are made by judges
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]The model of the US Constitution 
[normal](
[normal]one of 
[normal]‘strong judicial review’) 
[normal]is not the only one on offer
[normal] in comparative terms
[normal].
