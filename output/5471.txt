FBA0019/13-1410.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There has been a significant change in the expected scope of these rules between the consultation document issued on 20 May 2013 and the draft provisions in the Finance Bill. For example, as regards the provision on ‘disguised employment’, both Conditions A (‘disguised salary’) and C (capital contribution requirement) are different from the proposals in the consultation document.  Section 2.13 of the May consultation document states: 10.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ‘These conditions are not intended to apply to members who are in essence partners of a traditional partnership that is now carried on as an LLP. This means they are not intended to affect the status of members who carry on the partnership in common with a view to profit, who take risk in the business and who are to a significant degree rewarded on the basis of a share in the profits. They are also not intended to affect the status of persons who are taken on as members at an appropriate point in their career in recognition of their professional knowledge and personal skills, and who sacrifice an entitlement to salary in exchange for the opportunity to participate in the business in much the same way as a senior partner, even if as junior partners they are substantially rewarded by a fixed profit share.’10.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This approach has not been followed, and has instead been replaced with detailed mechanical tests which give rise to questions in practice in applying them.  As the consultation period for the 2014 Finance Bill closes on 4 February 2014, there is little time for affected LLPs to respond to the consultation process effectively.  10.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The potential impact of making significant changes on how the rules on ‘salaried members’ will apply at a late stage in the legislative process creates uncertainty for affected businesses, means the draft provisions are not properly road tested to check they only counter the perceived areas of mischief; thus seriously undermining the consultation process.  It also results in affected firms taking whatever remedial action to escape the legislation applying in situations where it ought never to have applied; creating unnecessary cost and upheaval for businesses.           10.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Take, for example, Condition A: the purpose of this condition is to identify those individuals who do not in reality have rights to the underlying profits of the business, so should not be taxed as self-employed.  The condition is met if at least 80% of the amounts payable to the individual are in the form of ‘disguised salary’.  Examples of payments which will be caught as disguised salary are fixed sums, payment for piecework, a bonus based on the individual’s own performance or just one part of the business, guaranteed profits and non-refundable drawings.  However, LLPs may have complex arrangements for awarding profits which have nothing whatsoever to do with tax avoidance.  This might include elements of profit share representing meeting personal performance targets (eg on winning new work) and the profitability of their own office/ sector, in addition to a share based on the overall success of the business as a whole.  As things stand, a number of these entirely commercially driven components of partners’ profits will be caught as ‘disguised salary’.  Indeed, the individual’s profit share may be a share of overall profits but that share will also be affected by personal performance – so where there is a combination of both, there is a lack of clarity and certainty in the provisions as drafted.Statutory Residence Test14.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The introduction of the Statutory Residence Test (SRT) has gone some way towards simplifying what was previously a highly unsatisfactory situation that depended too little on legislation and too much on HMRC practice, resulting in uncertainty for many taxpayers. The process was, however unduly protracted and it did not ultimately produce legislation that meets the ideal of being simple to understand and apply. It is fair to say that the SRT now produces greater certainty for a greater number of taxpayers but there remain situations where the complexity has been significantly increased. 14.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In a matter as straightforward as the layout of the legislation, representations were not heeded: the legislation begins by referring to the first test to be applied as being the “First Automatic UK Test” but the first leg of that test is that the individual does not meet the tests of automatic non-residence. 14.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the “ties” taken into account in determining residence, a new tie has been created, that of having one’s “home” or main home in the UK. Both the “old” test and the new take account of an individual having accommodation available but that is different from a “home” which is very widely defined (Finance Act 2013 Sch. 45 Para. 25) but then subject to comment in HMRC’s booklet RDR3 which is extensive but not definitive, referring only to factors that might be taken into account. The result is that nowhere is there a test that a taxpayer can rely on. An example given by HMRC is of a mobile home or canal barge but what if the person does not have one such “home” but regularly rents different ones?14.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The greatest complexity arises in relation to individuals who work both in the UK and overseas and are required to count days and hours of UK and overseas work in different ways for different parts of the tests.  International journeys can be especially problematical: apart from certain trivial actions that may be disregarded the nature of a journey can have a large bearing on status. For example:14.4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; travel from a home outside the UK to work here is not relevant at all if no work is done during the journey but if more than a token amount of work is done on the journey, the entire journey counts as work done in the country where the journey began;14.4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; depending on circumstances travel between engagements may or may not count as work, again in the country where the journey begins; and14.4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; internationally mobile workers need to be able to establish where they were at midnight on any given day since days of presence in the UK at midnight are counted when applying the statutory residence test.14.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition to recording where they are at midnight, the internationally mobile also need to record how many hours’ work they have done and precisely where. For example, if an individual leaves London at 9.00 pm on a seven hour flight that is counted as work, perhaps because they are preparing for a meeting at their destination, they may not be counted as present in the UK on either the day of departure or the following day but will be treated as having done three hours’ work in the UK on each of those days. The time-recording burden threatens to be extremely onerous.14.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The end result is that despite the fact that most of the SRT is good and largely fit for purpose, there are narrow areas of deep uncertainty which are subject to interpretation by HMRC, necessitating the publication of lengthy guides RDR1 and RDR3 which are advisory as to HMRC’s interpretation but do not have any legal force. Furthermore, despite the involvement of HMRC in the process of developing the SRT from when it was first proposed in the Budget of 2011, initially to come into force in April 2012 but deferred until 2013, guidance on HMRC’s interpretation is still only now coming out. That is not a criticism of the legislative process in narrow terms but it is an indictment of the lack of joining-up between legislature and executive.General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR)14.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The basic test in the GAAR is whether the tax arrangements in question can be ‘reasonably regarded as a reasonable course of action in relation to the relevant tax provisions, having regard to all the circumstances…’  14.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A test requiring a view to be taken on ‘reasonableness’ creates uncertainty as different people have different views on what is reasonable (and indeed it is necessary for the view itself to be tested as to whether it is reasonably held). 14.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; HMRC has published extensive guidance on the GAAR with detailed examples, but these only scratch the surface of the issues tax advisers and their clients will have to deal with in practice.  The stated objective of the GAAR was to counter ‘egregious’ schemes, but there is concern that the HMRC could seek to apply it wider in practice.  Furthermore, there is no clearance facility for taxpayers to gain the required certainty.  There is likely to be little certainty for taxpayers for several years, until decisions of the Advisory Panel have been published.14.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We support the Government’s aim to curb abusive tax schemes, but at the very least providing a clearance facility would have gone some way towards providing comfort to the vast majority of taxpayers who do not engage in abusive tax planning, but want the assurance that their proposed actions will not be challenged under the GAAR.&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;6&#xa0;&#xa0;
