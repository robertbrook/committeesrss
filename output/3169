defaultAfter watching the Parliament video of the “ Building Regulations applying to electrical installation and repairs in dwellings “ committee,
default  
defaultI would like to give my opinion on the operation of the Pat “P” regulations and what seems to be a dog eat dog fight by the so called Registered Schemes all trying to make sure that they get my money instead of Joe Bloggs.

defaults to the consumer that this particular electrician is up to date with the current legislation.
