[[[How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?]]]Multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens represent one of the greatest challenges to human health. Antibiotic resistance is now a linked global problem, with the dissemination of successful clones of MDR bacteria often associated with the movement of people1. The excessive and/or inappropriate use of antibiotics is a major causative factor for the local evolution of MDR bacteria that can be further exacerbated by horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants between different bacterial species1. The last decade has seen the emergence of antimicrobial resistance affecting entire classes of antibiotics including quinolones, tetracyclines, glycopeptides, macrolides and β‐lactams including carbapenems2 .In the same time period only three new antibiotics were successfully introduced to market (linezolid, daptomycin a ceftaroline)2. Of great concern is that for some MDR bacteria, no active antibiotic is available, with the fear that this problem will increase over time1, 3. In the USA it is estimated that &gt; 15% of healthcare-associated infections are caused by MDR bacteria, while in Europe in 2007, it was estimated that ca. 25,000 patients died with an infection caused by and infection due to MDR bacteria3.

[[[What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?]]]Hospital based reporting of resistant infections has improved markedly over the last decade. However, such reporting is frequently limited to a small number of pathogens (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, E.coli and glycopeptide-resistant enterococci) and indications (e.g. bacteraemia) as is exemplified by the mandatory surveillance program in England4. Information relating to complex infections associated with a significant risk of antibiotic resistance, (e.g. implant-associated infections) is not generally collected.In the wider community the picture of incidence, prevalence, mortality and cost of resistance remains incomplete. Enhanced surveillance outside the healthcare setting will also be essential if we are to measure and understand the impact of widespread antibiotic use in domestic, agricultural and industrial settings (e.g. sewage treatment).

[[[Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? ]]]

[[[If not, how could this be]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[rectified?]]]For pharmaceutical companies, the development of antibiotics does not represent an attractive commercial proposition when compared to new chemical entities in other areas of medicine (e.g. cardiology, respiratory medicine, rheumatology, cancer, chronic diseases). New approaches and incentives are required to ensure continued industry commitment to the development of new antibiotics. These could include:a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Changes to the regulatory environment - reducing the time interval from discovery to licensing:&#xa0;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Changes to antibiotic pricing, to reflect their value compared with other treatments (e.g. cancer drugs)&#xa0;c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Changes to the practice of automatically restricting new antibiotics for salvage therapy. The use of new antibiotics as first-line therapy (or early in the treatment path) for serious infections such as those caused by MRSA may reduce the risk of resistance and reduce healthcare associated costs5,6,

[[[What measures (including ]]]

[[[behavioral]]]

[[[ change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens?]]]

[[[ ]]]Infection control has played a critical role in managing antibiotic resistance in clinical settings. Government targets have increased accountability and awareness and reduced cases of MRSA and C. difficile across NHS Trusts.  However, while highly successful, the scope of these targets has been limited to a small number of pathogens and indications. Therefore, it is essential that National performance measures should be reassessed to ensure that they are appropriately targeted and take into account the changing environment in terms of causative pathogens and infections where there is a high risk of antibiotic resistance.   While stewardship plays a central role in reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance and superinfections, there are areas where stewardship can be improved to achieve the desired outcomes. While the current slogan “the right drug, the right dose, at the right time and the right duration” provides a helpful illustration of what stewardship programs should look like, it does not include the measurement of outcomes. There is a clear need for all CCGs and hospital to have:The measurement of outcomes needs to be undertaken by the clinical teams and through engagement with national clinical groups in specialties such as acute medicine, emergency medicine, orthopaedics, trauma and GPs.Furthermore, the current stewardship initiatives do not address many fundamental issues associated with antibiotic resistance. To effectively address antibiotic resistance at a patient level requires:Antibiotics are not “wonder drugs” in the management of complex infections but can achieve a remarkably high level of success, if the most effective antibiotics are combined with the correct surgery and/or source control of the infected site7, 8. There have been significant advances in diagnostic techniques that should be employed to identify the causative pathogens and direct antibiotic treatment more effectively9, 10. The multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach is increasingly being seen as best practice in the treatment of complex infections such as endocarditis, prosthetic joint and vascular graft infection7. The education and training of healthcare professionals is critical to success in addressing antibiotic resistance to ensure they have a good understanding of pathogenesis, antibiotic resistance and best practices in the use of antibacterial drugs.    There are potential deleterious consequences of a simplistic view of antibiotic stewardship, namely, restricting the newer and more expensive antibiotics in favour of “cheaper” and generic antibiotics for “salvage” use. These consequences can include increasing the overall treatment course and associated risks for, morbidity and mortality to the patient, selecting resistant mutants and increasing the overall healthcare associated costs.International programs such as the Surviving Sepsis Campaign11 advocate giving the most potent and broad spectrum agent(s) as initial therapy in patients with suspected sepsis and then de-escalating to antimicrobials with a narrower spectrum (if appropriate), once the underlying pathogen, resistance patterns, and the patient’s response to treatment become clear. This approach has been shown to deliver better outcomes in these circumstances.

[[[What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross]]]

[[[-border initiatives?]]]Through the activities of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) and its initiative Antibiotic Action12 the UK is at the vanguard of initiatives to address antibiotic resistance. This forum allows multiple stakeholders to identify, discuss and address key issues in the research, regulatory and market environments, and is regenerating interest in the discovery and development of new antibiotic agents.  Under the leadership and direction of Professor Laura Piddock, Antibiotic Action has been highly proactive in reaching out to important individuals and organisations in the UK and internationally, to address the serious problem of antibiotic resistance. As a global pharmaceutical company, Novartis recognises the international dimension of the challenge of antibiotic resistance and is greatly encourage by the publication of the Government’s AMR Strategy and the impetus provided by the CMO’s interest in the subject. The UK is ideally positioned to assume a leading role in tackling the global threat of antimicrobial resistance. However, any changes implemented in the UK will need to be adopted internationally to maximize their impact and for progress to be made. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?]]]The Government’s five year AMR Strategy provides a useful platform to start addressing some key issues in the area of antimicrobial resistance and is generally balanced in its assessment of the challenge.  If delivered, the three strategic aims would go a significant way to addressing the considerable challenges presented by antibiotic resistance. Novartis were pleased to note that antibiotic stewardship (subject to the caveats presented in the document above), the urgent need for the discovery and developments of new antibiotics, diagnostics and novel therapies and approaches are core themes within the strategy. The Strategy recognises the importance of improving knowledge amongst healthcare professionals and the general public to try and ensure that current treatment are preserved and used appropriately. These statements and objectives need to go further to include the recognition that education and training of healthcare professionals to gain a far greater understanding of pathogenesis. Moreover, the importance of changes in current practice to enhance and develop the role of multidisciplinary teams in managing complex infections needs to be included. The Strategy places significant obligations on industry to produce new treatments but without offering reciprocal commitments to improving the restrictive commercial environment.  The Government must make concrete commitments to how they plan to analyse the challenges associated with AMR further and translate these, in collaboration with stakeholders, into initiatives that will drive real change.  In addressing the commercial environment, the High Level Steering Group must outline how it plans to address some of the key challenges which it started to identify in the Strategy. The Strategy recommends a substantial and extended research program to better understand resistance, discover new therapies and improve surveillance of antibiotic resistance. This will clearly need new and substantial funding. With reference to the concerns about the significant obligation on industry inferred in the Strategy, will new central (Government) funding be made available?&#xa0;
