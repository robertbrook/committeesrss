[normal]Details on number of complaints as provided by DCLG
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"For the six-month period April â€“ Sept 2013, there was a total of 179 complaints to the eight scheme operators that include Part P members.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Note though that some of these scheme operators also cover other work, so this number may not be for electrical work only.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] When looking at complaints as a proportion of notification numbers then all eight received complaints at a rate well below 1%, the highest proportion being 0.31%."
