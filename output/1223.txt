&#xa0;Age Scotland (TIC 0003)&#xa0;We received the notification of the Transport Committee’s inquiry into ‘Passenger Transport in Isolated Communities’.&#xa0; You may be aware that the Scottish Parliament’s Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment Committee recently held an inquiry into community transport.&#xa0;As part of our campaign, Still Waiting, Age Scotland has been lobbying for a review of the existing National Concessionary Travel scheme in order that this is made more widely available on community transport services.&#xa0; We submitted evidence to the Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment Committee and, while we are aware that transport in Scotland is a devolved matter, we hoped that the findings of our research and the key questions which it raises may be of interest in your own investigation.&#xa0;A copy of Age Scotland’s submission to the Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment Committee’s inquiry is available here.&#xa0;If you have any questions in relation to this or would like additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.&#xa0;July 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
