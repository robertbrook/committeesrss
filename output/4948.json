"&#xa0;\nSubmission from the Centre for CitiesExecutive Summary1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBritons work, live and socialise across, and regardless of, administrative boundaries. Nearly 50 per cent of commuters \nto\n cities live and work in different local authorities.\n But neither central government nor local authorities govern or manage budgets at this scale. \n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe challenge for UK cities is this: how can one local authority afford to invest in growth if the financial (as well as social and environmental) benefits accrue to Whitehall or neighbouring authorities? The costs of unlocking growth often fall on one loc\nal authority, while the benefits are widespread. This means the finances for development projects often do not stack up. Cities \nand city regions \nneed greater control over how they spend money, \nfreedom to raise funding of their own and governance structures\n that reflect the economy and enable services to be delivered \nmore efficiently and effectively \nat scale.\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDevolution will not \ninevitably\n lead to increased economic growth but we do know that the current \ncentralised \nsystem \nrestricts growth opportunities\n: str\nuggling areas are maintained but areas that could grow more are held back. By providing freedoms, tools and incentives to local authorities, devolution would enable cities to unlock their full potential. \n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBut devolution in itself\n is not a silver bullet for\n growth everywhere. Not all places have the same opportunities and variation will inevitably increase as places that have more to gain from devolution grow their economies. \nAreas with structural barriers to growth should be helped in different ways to fast\n-growing areas, particularly through minimum standards of redistribution and targeted support. And devolution should\n enable cities to generate additional funds, some of which can be redistributed. \n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe focus for\n \nCentre for Cities \nis to improve the economie\ns of UK cities and the surrounding areas that support urban economies, because evidence shows these are the most effective places to improve the national economy as \na \nwhole. \nO\nur submission focus\nes\n primarily on the existing challenges to growth in cities, o\nr functional economic areas, and why devolution is the answer\n – a\nlthough we also note that there are some freedoms and flexibilities, such as business rates, which should be devolved to all local authorities, urban and rural\n. Ultimately, a process of \ntailo\nred \ndevolution provides the best solution\n, with cities and city regions being a priority for greater freedoms and flexibilities\n. With the freedoms and incentives necessary to invest in the services needed – and to do so at scale, in collaboration – cities \nand city regions \ncan improve their economies but also those of neighbouring areas that depend on them\n, whether urban, suburban or rural\n. \n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCity governments are investors: in the local economy, in society and in their residents and businesses.  But they do not have the powers and resources to effectively manage their assets: the balance of powers and financial control still lies within Whiteha\nll. And while the onus is on local government to deliver local services and support economic growth, it has minimal control over how it manages its finances to invest in growth. Government needs to pass responsibility on to cities – functional economies co\nvering multiple local \nauthorities – enabling them to capitalise on local knowledge, incentivise cross-boundary strategies and leverage capital and services investments off one another. \n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe figure below shows the spectrum of control Government has over loc\nal government income streams, demonstrating that cities and city regions need more financial powers to deliver growth. \n&#xa0;\nSource: Centre for Cities, (2013). \nWays and Means: money management and \npower in local government\n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf UK cities cannot effectively \ninvest in their future growth, how can they compete in a global economy? Our research and analysis shows that\n \nfor devolution to succeed, it must address and overcome three central barriers to economic growth – as it stands, local government:\n \n&#xa0;\n2.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFlexibility to set budgets to reflect local priorities2.4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhitehall limits how local government can spend its budgets and sets statutes on the services local government must provide. Given a set budget, local authorities have little room to provide non-statutory services that support economic growth. This gives t\nhem little influence over local policy design as well as how national policies are implemented. \nFor example, \nthe single most important factor determi\nning a city’s growth trajectory\n \nis \neducation \nand \nyet \nthey have few levers to influence how education \nfunding is used.\n \nThe Dedicated Schools Grant and Pupil Premium Grant sit outside of local government’s control almost entirely, and most of the higher and further education grants sit outside Aggregate External Finance, which means local government cannot \ndetermine how the money is spent to address these challenges.\n \n2.4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCities \nalso \nneed more control over their skills programmes if they are going to provide educated and trained workers in the sectors that build on their local advantages. They should be able \nto\n tailor\n the implementation of the Work Programme, coordinate the skills agenda between relevant stakeholders, and influence the funding provided by the Skills Funding Agency.\n \nUltimately\n local authorities need\n \na range of options to improve different servic\nes: from influencing\n how policy is delivered, \ncontrol over \nthe funding that determines how national policy is implemented, to \nthe \ndesign and deliver\ny of\n local policies.\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFreedoms to raise funds and support growth2.5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo invest in growth, cities need the funds \nto do so. Giving them more freedom over how to use existing funding is one thing, but cities also need the freedom to raise their own. Recent measures have addresse\nd\n the inability of local authorities to raise revenue, such as reform of the business rates system, but are not significant enough. \nBusiness RatesThe new business rates system, introduced in April, gives local government a greater proportion of the procee\nds of local growth than before, but \nchallenges remain, including: \nComplexity:\n \nThe current system is too complicated to effectively influence decisions made by local government and residents.\nResets\n:\n Resets\n to the system should be less frequent. They reduc\ne certainty for local authority budgets and create a “delay effect” that discourages investment closer to the reset or rebase.\nImprovements:\n \nPlaces should benefit from increasing the value of their properties through transport and public realm improvements\n.\nFlexibility:\n \nRather than being constant in real terms, the total tax take should grow with the total value of commercial property in the country.\n&#xa0;\n2.5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUltimately, local government needs more freedom to raise and spend money that can be invested in services \nand support for the economy. Crowd sourcing\n for instance\n,\n which the committee was interested to hear views on,\n is an interesting innovation and might deliver results at community level, but will not drive change at the scale required. Central Government sh\nould reduce restrictions on the fees and charges local authorities can operate locally. And local hypothecated taxes should be more widely permitted to raise funds for specific local projects. \n&#xa0;\n2.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nScale of governance and budgets that reflect the economy2.6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStru\nctures that do not reflect economic areas restrict the ability of local government to plan strategically plan for their economic area. Transport, for example, is key to improving the conditions for business growth but most city regions and economic areas d\no not invest in their transportation network as a system that spans local government \nboundaries. Rather, Government funds councils on the basis of their locally managed roads and local projects and larger projects are managed from Whitehall.\n \n2.6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCross-bounda\nry decision making and budgeting is part of the solution and can have a positive economic impact by helping align policies with the scope of the real economy. Examples in London and Manchester illustrate some of the benefits and successes of local collabor\nation:\n2.6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese examples sh\now what can be achieved when councils come together, but remain the exception not the rule.\n \nSome authorities are coming together out of necessity as a response to austerity measures but the benefits of collaboration go beyond this. Strategic collaboration \nbetween local authorities and integration of devolved budgets increases competitiveness, helps councils adapt to austerity and matches governance, funding and service delivery at the city level.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAre LEPs the answer?3.1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2010, L\nocal Enterprise Partnerships were introduced as platforms for local authorities to engage with business in decision-making, jointly deciding on investment priorities in \ninfrastructure and services to support economic growth.\n \nWhere LEP boundaries have been well set, they define the geography of a functional economic area and as such should be used to coordinate growth. And if LEPs fulfil their mission, they can become a platform for engagement, enabling LEPs, local authorities,\n public bodies that support service delivery and the business community to collaborate and plan strategically for their local area. \n3.1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBut there are limitations: LEPs cannot hold, spend and manage funds as a council does. And complicated regional governance \nin some areas currently makes it difficult and costly for LEPs to coordinate strategies. In Sheffield, for example, the city region and LEP boundaries match-up but proposals for a combined authority include two district councils who will not be legally all\nowed to vote in the new authority. \n3.1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOverlapping and over-complicated structures for local authorities, LEPs, integrated transport authorities, combined authorities and so forth makes coordinating across layers difficult. But as we have seen with Greater \nManchester – where the LEP geography covers the same 10 local authorities as the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and Association of Greater Manchester Authorities – existing structures can be adapted and brought together to provide effective governme\nnt of a functional economic area.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdapting existing structures3.2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith LEPs as a platform for engagement not governance, local authorities must adapt to better meet the needs of functional economic areas in cities.  The question is how to use or improve exis\nting local government structures to maximise the benefits of devolution. \n3.2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCombined authorities provide democratic legitimacy: there is clarity and visibility of decision-making, as the decisions are made in the public sphere through well-defined structures\n. They \nalso \noffer strategic vision for the economic area and they have the ability to deliver this vision. Economic Prosperity Boards provide very similar benefits to combined authorities, but they lack the management of integrated transport budgets. \n3.2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNot \nall areas are ready or suited to fully integrated budgets, however, and\n \ninstitutional, \nlegislative \nand political impediments are barriers in some places. \nLocal authorities should build upon their current relationships and build new ones to move along the s\npectrum of \nintegration. Ultimately, local authorities must come to a shared \nevidence-based \nunderstanding of \nhow their local economy works and which areas of collaboration would deliver most benefits for local residents. \n3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTailored devolution3.3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA tailored approach recognises that both policies and places require different approaches to devolution. \nSome reforms for devolution to cities should be uniform, spread across the country. Business rates reform and further localisation as well as greater f\nreedoms and controls over sales, fees and charges for local government will provide better financial management for all cities.\n \nBut\n other\n reforms should only be devolved where there is appetite and resources in the city. \n3.3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTailored \ndevolution offers the gre\natest promise in the current political context\n, in\n that devolution can and should be different according to local needs and capability, but also\n because it shares responsibility between Whitehall and local government\n.\n \nLocal authorities need i\nncentives to g\net past the political, institutional and financial barriers, but also powers and resources in order to effectively manage the economic area. Government has to put powers, resources and governance on the table that economic areas actually want, while local \nauthorities have to demonstrate how working together and having a common purpose will change their local economy.\n3.3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nB\nuild\ning\n on \nthe important steps the \nexisting City Deals programme\n has made, the Government should \ntake\n a simpler approach\n.\n \nGovernment should d\nevolve\n certain powers to combined authorities, others to economic prosperity boards\n or Joint Committees\n and fewer for areas with no democratic structures \nacross authorities. This \nwould provide certainty, while a tailored approach would enable further detai\nled negotiations on the specifics important to individual cities and city regions.\n Local government must, in turn, build the vision, strategy and commonality of purpose to make economic area working a success\n. \nCommonality of purpose is the essential elemen\nt to the local authorities’ proposal: without a common understanding of what the authorities are working together towards, a realistic and focused set of ‘asks’ cannot be determined. \n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBusinesses, consumers, employers and \nemployees operate in economies\n that do not fall\n within the confines of local authority administrative boundaries. And local authorities, in \ncollaboration, are best placed to \ndesign the strategic\n services that their local economies need\n –\n \ninfluencing the de\nlivery of national programmes in some cases; designing and implemented local schemes in others\n. Cities \nand city regions \ncurrently lack the financial freedoms and \nlocalised reward structures\n to invest and innovate\n in strategic services for transport, housin\ng, economic development and skills.\n \nI\nn addition\n, they\n face barriers to improved collaboration at \nthe \nlocal level. The freedoms to control funding and raise finance for these services should be devolved to cities – reflecting functional economic areas. Crea\nting a more direct link between funding raised and spent would also strengthen local accountability and governance.\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTailored\n devolution offers the best option and rests on a clear proposition: what local government can offer in exchange for devolution and \ngreater collaboration. Central g\novernment must build a united front on the benefits for national growth of increased devolution and provide certainty on measures and structures such as LEPs. But the onus is also on local government to develop a better unde\nrstanding of their local geography, work better across boundaries, overcome political differences and share skills. \n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf Government wants to put cities in the driver’s seat for growth, the following top 5 fiscal and financial reforms \nin line with a tailored\n approach to devolution \nwill make great strides towards empowering them to do so:\nPlease do not hesitate to get in touch with any questio\nns about the content of our submission or if you require further details of our research and analysis on fiscal and financial devolution to UK cities.\n&#xa0;January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Centre for Cities is the proud winner of One to Watch at the Prospect UK Think Tank of the Year Awards 2013&#xa0;Find out all you need to know about your city economy on our data app: www.citiesoutlook.org &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\nCentre for Cities is a registered charity (No 1119841) and a company limited by guarantee registered in England (No 6215397)\n&#xa0;\n2\n Rodri\nguez-Pose A &amp; Ezcurra R (2010),\n \nIs Fiscal Decentralisat\nion Harmful for Economic Growth?\n Evidence from the OECD Countries SETC Discussion Paper 2\n,\n London: SERC\n.\n ONS Commuting Data, 2011.\n \nWilcox Z, Williams M and Nohrovà\n N\n, DRAFT: \nFunctional finance for local government: enabling growth through better financial management\n, London: Centre for Cities.\n \nIbid.\n \nWilcox Z, Williams M and Nohrovà\n N\n, DRAFT: \nFunctional finance for local government: enabling growth through better financial management\n, London: Centre for Cities.\n \nThe London Tri-boroughs (2013), \nImproving lives, Saving money: Practical \nexamples from the first two years since we decided \nto share major s\nervices\n, London.\n \nDCLG, (2013), \nCouncils Combined for Economic Growth\n, Press Release: 12 August 2013.\n"
