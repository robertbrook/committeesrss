[normal]Transport Select Committee session on Cycling Safety
[normal], 2 December 2013
[normal]The ongoing public 
[normal]dialogue
[normal] 
[normal]around cyclist safety has generated more heat than light. Much discussion of the topic seems to reflect a 
[normal]“
[normal]Two Tribes
[normal]”
[normal] mentality: many drivers and cyclists alike perceive themselves as blamed and bullied, and in response have a
[normal]dopted an entrenched approach to the 
[normal]debate. At the heart of this dichotomy lies both sides’ convictions that cyclist injuries are mainly ‘the 
[normal]other guy’s fault’: many cyclists feel that drivers treat them with reckless contempt; many drivers have countles
[normal]s tales of cyclists who ignore the rules of the road; both sides are quick to accuse the other of aggressive and irresponsible behaviour. This febrile atmosphere has only increased with the recent tragic spate of cyclist deaths.
[normal]The present climate of the 
[normal]cycling safety debate present
[normal]s
[normal] government with significant political challenges. 
[normal]M
[normal]any 
[normal]proposed 
[normal]intervention
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]intended 
[normal]to improve cycling safety 
[normal]could 
[normal]be perceived by one or both sides of the debate as 
[normal]an accusation of 
[normal]blame 
[normal]against them
[normal]. The consequent 
[normal]vit
[normal]riolic 
[normal]attack
[normal]s
[normal] will 
[normal]only 
[normal]serve to 
[normal]make 
[normal]consensus and acceptance 
[normal]even 
[normal]hard
[normal]er
[normal] to achieve
[normal]. 
[normal]Given that any 
[normal]government action 
[normal]is likely to include 
[normal]a range of measures which need to win 
[normal]broad 
[normal]acceptance 
[normal]in order 
[normal]to be effective, 
[normal]a stormy reception of this kind 
[normal]i
[normal]s likely to 
[normal]weaken their long term effect on 
[normal]casualty reduction
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]n intelligence led approach based on objective information
[normal] is 
[normal]prerequisite for 
[normal]quenching 
[normal]these flames. 
[normal]This submission provides fact based information 
[normal]which intends to elucidate the extent to which the actions of 
[normal]various 
[normal]road users influence 
[normal]injury crashes. It is indicative of a direction of travel 
[normal]which this 
[normal]debate 
[normal]may take 
[normal]in 
[normal]the 
[normal]future. If all concerned parties are informed by home truths about what i
[normal]s actually occurring on Britain’s roads, it may become easier for government, road safety stakeholders and mainstream public opinion to coalesce around an agenda for effective future action.
[normal]Road Safety Analysis (RSA) is a not-for-profit company which prov
[normal]ides quality analytical and educational products and services, notably the award-winning web-based analysis tool MAST Online, to the British road safety profession.  
[normal]In order to elucidate the impact of both driver and cyclist behaviour on 
[normal]road 
[normal]risk, 
[normal]RSA 
[normal]ha
[normal]s sought to examine the factors which contribute to 
[normal]incidents which resulted in injury and involved
[normal] 
[normal]both 
[normal]motor vehicles and pedal cycles
[normal]. 
[normal]It is hoped that this 
[normal]evidence 
[normal]will shed some light on the heated ‘blame game’ which sometimes breaks out between grou
[normal]ps representing road users, leading to an increased sense of joint responsibility for use of shared space and mutual respect for the dangers and difficulties faced by others.
[normal]This information is derived from 
[normal]STATS19 data supplied by the Departm
[normal]ent for Transport to 
[normal]RSA 
[normal]for dissemination to the road safety community via inclusion in MAST Online. This data includes 
[normal]contributory factors recorded under STATS19
[normal],
[normal] which are not available to the 
[normal]general 
[normal]public for data protection reasons but are 
[normal]included
[normal] in an anonymised summary configuration 
[normal]in MAST
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]with access restricted to 
[normal]public sector road safety professionals
[normal] only
[normal].
[normal]This evidence deliberately includes all qualifying police attended incidents, even where the actual degree of injury inflicted was not 
[normal]particularly severe. About five-sixths of the casualties in these incidents were recorded as ‘Slight’; this classification includes injuries such as whiplash, shallow cuts, sprains, bruising and shock requiring roadside attention. This choice was made for 
[normal]several reasons:
[normal]Up to six contributory factors (CFs) can be recorded by a police officer who attended the scene of an injury crash
[normal], each related to a participant (vehicle, driver, rider, passenger or uninjured pedestrian). 
[normal]It is important to a
[normal]ppreciate that 
[normal]CFs reflect the officer's opinion at time of reporting 
[normal]and 
[normal]may not be the result of extensive investigation
[normal]. Therefore, they 
[normal]should be regarded 
[normal]only 
[normal]as a general guide
[normal] to the factors most likely to feature in incidents, rather than a definit
[normal]ive explanation for them. However, in the last seven years attending officers have recorded CFs for 
[normal]over nine hundred thousand
[normal] injury crashes, making them by far the most extensive and inclusive basis for examining 
[normal]the issues which 
[normal]typically 
[normal]precipitate
[normal] sy
[normal]stem failure 
[normal]and 
[normal]result in injury.
[normal]This preliminary examination included 
[normal]CF
[normal]s
[normal] recorded by 
[normal]all 
[normal]police officers who attended injury crashes on Britain’s roads 
[normal]over 
[normal]the last seven years (2006 to 2012) which involved 
[normal]two vehicles, one of which was 
[normal]a pedal cycle
[normal] and 
[normal]the other 
[normal]either 
[normal]a 
[normal]car or 
[normal]a 
[normal]goods vehicle
[normal]. 
[normal]This sample included 67
[normal],
[normal]88
[normal]2
[normal] police attended crashes, 
[normal]encompassing 
[normal]a total of 135,764 individual
[normal]ly attributed 
[normal]CFs
[normal].
[normal]Th
[normal]e
[normal] analysis divides 
[normal]CFs 
[normal]into two broad categories:
[normal]CFs which were attributed directly to a driver or rider were then grouped by vehicle type:
[normal]61,792 
[normal]two vehicle injury crashes involving a pedal cycle and a car
[normal] were analysed. 
[normal]The overall proportion of cyclist injuries to other road users 
[normal]in these incidents is a stark warning of the vulnerability of cyclists in the event of conflict with a motor vehicle. 
[normal]These crashes resulted in 63,305 casualties
[normal],
[normal] of whom 97% were cyclists. 17% of 
[normal]these 
[normal]casualties were either killed or seriously injured
[normal], o
[normal]f whom 
[normal]98% were cyclists.
[normal] 369 people were killed in these crashes: all 
[normal]bar 
[normal]one 
[normal]were 
[normal]cyclist
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]Figure 1 (see appendix) 
[normal]includes all these 
[normal]crashes
[normal], grouped 
[normal]depending on 
[normal]the category of 
[normal]CFs reported by the attending officer: those attributed to the driver
[normal] (or
[normal]ange circle)
[normal]; those attributed to the cyclist
[normal] (blue circle)
[normal]; and those classified as environmental factors which may fall beyond the control of either
[normal] (green circle)
[normal].
[normal] An incident could fall into more than one category, with over two thousand crashes falling into all three.
[normal]The following conclusions can be drawn:
[normal]Similar analyses were conducted on 4,393 crashes 
[normal]involving a 
[normal]cyclist 
[normal]and a 
[normal]van, and 1,697 crashes involving a cyclist 
[normal]and a 
[normal]lorry. The res
[normal]ulting casualties 
[normal]are indicative of even greater risk
[normal] of severe cyclist injury
[normal]: 
[normal]in crashes with vans killed and seriously injured cyclists accounted for 19% of all casualties, while in crashes with lorries 38% of casualties were killed and seriously injure
[normal]d cyclists. 
[normal]151 cyclists were killed in crashes involving lorries, almost 9% of all casualties from these incidents; while 52 cyclists were k
[normal]illed in collision with vans.
[normal]Figure 2 (see appendix) 
[normal]show
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]crashes involving cyclists and lorries, grouped dependi
[normal]ng on the category of CFs reported by the attending officer: those attributed to the lorry driver (
[normal]yellow 
[normal]circle); those attributed to the cyclist (blue circle); and those classified as environmental factors which may fall beyond the control of either (gre
[normal]en circle).
[normal] Figure 3
[normal] 
[normal]shows crashes involving cyclists and vans, grouped on 
[normal]reported 
[normal]CF categories: those attributed to the van driver (grey circle); those attributed to the cyclist (blue circle); and those classified as environmental factors (green circle)
[normal].
[normal]The following conclusions can be drawn:
[normal]While there is a great deal more to explore, these brief findings make is abundantly clear that 
[normal]any strategy 
[normal]must take [bold]account of the role played by human behaviour[bold] 
[normal]if it seeks to address the principal factors 
[normal]involved in cyclist safety
[normal]. While there is no single simple explanation for why crashes involving pedal cycles occur, the evidence 
[normal]provides clear signposts which poi
[normal]nt the way 
[normal]for 
[normal]both 
[normal]future debate and ultimate action.
[normal]The most important points are:
