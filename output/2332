default  Glencore
default’
defaults customers around the world are active in a wide range of industries, such as a
defaultutomotive, oil, power generation, steel production and food processing. They rely upon the company’s established global network for the supply of metals and minerals, energy products and agricultural products. These commodities either originate from Glenco
defaultre
default’

defaultown production assets or are sourc
defaulted from third parties. Glencore
default also provides financing, logistics and other supply chain services to producers and consumers of commodities.

default Glencore owns and operates mines and other industrial facilities throug
defaulthout the world, including in developing countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America. As a result of these investments Glencore has gained significant knowledge and experience in building sustainable businesses in collaboration with local communities an
defaultd national governments.

default2. Our perspective on the extractive industriesdefault&#xa0;
default2.1
default  The extraction of
default 
defaultminerals is
default the cornerstone of all industrial activities
default 
defaultand 
defaultit 
defaultunderpin
defaults
default the global economy. Without the commodities produced by mining and energy companies the world would not be housed, clothed, fed or transported. 
defaultWithout the extractive industries, t
defaulthere would be no globalisation and sophisticated modern economies, such as 
defaultthe UK, which depend on the supply and trade in commodities
default,
default would be unable to function.
default&#xa0;
default2.2  The extractive sector is not merely a collection of mines and oil fields
default. It is instead a complex global industry that connects resources with customers through
default a network of transport, supply and logistics. At the heart of the extractive sector is the commodity market which efficiently ensures that consumers worldwide have access to the resources they need, when they need them and at competitive prices.
default&#xa0;
default2.3   
defaultMining is becoming more valuable. According to statistics from the International Council
default on Mining and Met
defaultals
default, the value of global production of metals rose from $214 billion in 2000 to $854 billion in 2011. More importantly, the value of the world’s metal
default output ha
defaults been rising at a faster
default rate than the overall increase in global GDP, a consequence of greater demand for metals in the emerging markets. Simply put, mining’s contribution to the global economy is becoming more significant. It is generating mor
defaulte wealth for producing countries and for those countries, such as the UK, which support 
defaultthe global trade in commodities with finance, marketing and technical skills.
default&#xa0;
default2.4  We believe that sustainability
default must be central
default to the operations of extractive companies, not least because the source of many vital minerals is now mainly to be found in the developing world. Due to the nature
default of
default the
default business, extractive companies must acknowledge the significant impact of their oper
defaultations on the environment and local communities. At the 
defaultsame time, extractive companies
default have a distinct opportunity to render assistance to communities and governments in poorer countries.
default 
default 
defaultMining com
defaultpanies, such as Glencore
default,
default have
default exceptional skills in pro
defaultject management as well as access to knowhow and resources. 
defaultThe best operators in
default the extractive sector are aware
default tha
defaultt their licence to operate 
defaultdepend
defaults
default on their good relations with local communities as well as national governments.
default&#xa0;
default2.5  At Glencore
default w
defaulte constantly strive to find new ways to improve how we manage our health, safety and environmental practices, the welfare of all our workers and our support for the development and well-being of the communities in which we 
defaultoperate
default.  We are open and transpa
defaultrent in our engagement with our stakeholders. Respect for human rights is fundamental to all our activities.

default, logistics and marketing.

default 
default&#xa0;
default3. Our response to the Committee’s question areasdefault&#xa0;
default3.1 What is the contribution todefault the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK?default&#xa0;defaultBritain has been a centre for the extractive industries for thousands of years. Tin was mined in Cornwall during the Bronze 
defaultAge and a thriving trade in 
defaultmetal then extended 
defaultas 
defaultfar as the Mediterranean. 
defaultDuring the 18
defaultth
default and 19
defaultth
default centuries 
defaultcoal and iron ore 
defaultmines 
defaultprovided the raw materials for the Industrial Revolution. In the second half of the 20
defaultth
default century, the development of 
defaultoffshore 
defaultoil and ga
defaults
default 
defaultproduction 
defaultin the North Sea
default 
defaultmade Britain 
defaultagain 
defaultthe focus
default of a technological revolution that provided 
defaultnew sources of energy for the world, 
defaultwhich are 
defaultstill being exploited 
defaultand developed 
defaulttoday
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultNorth Sea oil and gas is in decline and l
defaultarge-scale mining is no longer conducted in Britain but the UK still plays a 
defaultpivotal
default role in the extracti
defaultve industries
default as a centre of trading, technology, finance and knowhow. Britain’s role as a trading hub
default 
defaultfor com
defaultmodities is not an accident. It is 
defaulta consequence of centuries of 
defaulti
defaultnvestment by businesses
default in 
defaultthe development of 
defaultnetwor
defaultks of commerce 
defaultlinking Britain to Asia, Africa and the Americas
default.
default Many of these British enterprises remain among the world’s top companies.
default&#xa0;
defaultTrade in commodities has been supported by the parallel development of banking and financial markets that enable the
default expansion
default of trade
default. T
defaulthe
defaultse developments 
defaulthave been made possible through the 
defaultstrategic policies 
defaultof successive British governments which
default encourage
defaultd trade and
default 
defaultallow
defaulted
default it to thrive. 
defaultIt is worth remember
defaulting that one of the world’s largest oil companies was 
defaultfounded in the late 19
defaultth
default century in London as a trader in exotic seashells.
default&#xa0;
defaultGlencore
default, too,
default 
defaultwas founded as a 
defaultmarketing business, initially trading oil 
defaultand then extending its reach into metals and other commodities
default.
default Since then it has expanded
default into
default a global enterprise
default:
default Glencore
default links copper mines in Zambia to 
defaultfactories in Asia
default and it
default brings wheat from the Canadian 
defaultprairies to flour mills in the Middle East
default. 
defaultGlencore has mining and industrial activities on every continent.  Although it has a relative
defaultly small industrial presence in the UK, Glencore has a significant trading activity in Britain and it is our view that the UK can ill afford to ignore the vital role played by a trading and financial hub as important as 
defaultthe City of London. 
defaultWithout networks
default of trade and finance, the extractive industries would be nothing more than
default stranded mines and oil wells
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAccording to ONS figures, the extractive sector accounts for 
default2.3 
defaultper cent of the UK’s gross domestic product. 
defaultAccording to figures from HM Revenue 
defaultand Customs, the annual t
defaultaxation revenue from 
defaultthe UK oil and gas sector over the last five years has 
defaultranged 
defaultbetween £5 billion and £12 billion
default, with the fluctuations being
default due to changes 
defaultthat include 
defaulttax rates, investment levels and production.  
default&#xa0;
defaultLondon-listed extractive companies account for
default 
default21
default per cent
default of the FTSE
default350
default index
default, the largest sector by value
default.  
defaultThese figures 
defaultdo not take account of
default the large indirect contribution to the UK economy made by the activity of companies in the extractive sector in terms of the purchase of financial
default,
default business 
defaultand professional 
defaultservices and technological procurement.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, extractive companies with a
default headquarters or major office presence in the UK provide high 
defaultvalue
default employment
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom our perspective, v
defaultalue
default is 
defaultgenerated by linking mines to mills and, in turn,
default to consumers. Without efficient markets and sound finance, the extractive industries 
defaultwould struggle to satisfy the world’s hunger 
defaultfor raw materials and
default, ultimately, the 
defaultcost
default of consumer goods
default would rise significantly. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.2 defaultHow defaultdo the UK defaultbased extractive industries defaultsupport employment a) in the UK defaultand b) for UK citizens overseas?default&#xa0;defaultWhile the 
defaultphysical mining sector in Britain
default is now relatively sma
defaultll, the employment opportunity
default presented
default overseas
default 
defaultand among ancill
defaultary service providers in the UK
default due to
default the presence of international mining groups 
defaultis 
defaultsignificant. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK is an important s
defaultource of professional staff in the areas of finance, accountancy and law as well as engineering skills
default, project
default management, marketing and trading. In addition to direct employment opportunities in the UK
default and ancillary services
default overseas, 
defaultthe UK is a global 
defaultcentre for the procurement of mining finance and business services which in turn creates indirect employment in Britain.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultBritain also benefits from the contribution made by major extractive companies in the sponsorship of graduates and in grants to 
defaulteducational institutions. BRM, our lead and zinc smelter in the UK, has recently developed several apprenticeship programmes to address the sudden acceleration in the UK’s youth unemployment rate and worsening skill shortages as a result of Britain’s deind
defaultustrialization. In addition to programmes for accountants and electrical engineers, we have tailor-made programmes for process operators and refactoring apprentices. Apprentices will represent almost 10% of the workforce in 2014, up from less than 1% in 20
default11.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, 
defaultGlencore
default is 
defaultcurrently sponsoring

defaultCamborne School of Mines

default&#xa0;
defaultGLENCORE IN THE UNITED KINGDOMdefaultGlencore employs directly default564default defaultpeople in the UK. defaultOur London office, which employs default373 staffdefault defaultis home to our oil and sugar trading activity and our shipping business. London is also the headquarters of our upstream oil exploration business, an area of significant expansion for Glencoredefault.default default defaultSince 2004, Glencodefaultre has drilled 39 wells within the West and Central Africa region with one producing asset and further significant production growth to follow in 2013.defaultBRM, our lead and zinc smelter, employs default155 staff and 16 contractorsdefault defaultat its site in Kent.default A further 36 staff are employed at our grain business in Thame.default&#xa0;
default3.3 defaultDoes UK industry benefit more widely from the UK’s position as a centre for extractive industries i.e. In sales of machinery and services to international businesses in the sector?default&#xa0;defaultGlencore actively seeks to purchase products and services locally as far as possible, according to specific need. Typically we purchase maintenance services, catering supplies, transportation and basic construction materials locally, amongst a range of oth
defaulter items depending on local availability. Local purchasing provides quick access and also reduces the costs and environmental impact associated with transporting materials. In addition, our support of the local economy helps to fund local services includin
defaultg those that meet health and education needs.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2012, Britannia Refined Metals, our lead refinery in north Kent, spent £9 million on procurement, 
defaultof which 
defaultless than 4% was with non-UK suppliers. Of its total 218 suppliers, only 8 were non-UK companies.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.default4default Has the boom in London-listed extractive companies with businesses overseas over the last two decades resulted in a strengthening in the UK’s competitive position in this sector?default&#xa0;
defaultThe relationship of 
defaultGlencore
default 
defaultto the UK is primarily through
default the financial 
defaultand commodity trading 
defaultmarkets and the company’s activity in
default these markets and 
defaultthrough the purchase of 
defaultancillary services
default and equipment
default. 
defaultGlencore
default is listed on the London S
defaulttock E
defaultxchange because it is a global mar
defaultket of superior standing that attracts a very wide community of 
defaultinternational 
defaultinvestors including many with a focus on natural resources
default.
default London-listed extractive companies provide numerous benefits to the UK
default including employment and procurement.
default&#xa0;
default3.5default defaultWhatdefault are the corporate governance concerns raised by the number of extractive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?default&#xa0;defaultGlencore believes that high corpo
defaultrate governance standards are a pre-requisite for properly functioning financial markets. Meeting the listing and corporate governance requirements of the London market may be a challenge for some companies but such hurdles provide comfort and protection f
defaultor investors and, ultimately, benefit
default the reputation of the City of London and the UK, generally.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultExtractive companies are not, in themselves, a reputational risk. G
defaultlencore 
defaultand other companies of similar stature in the mining and energy sectors are 
defaultrequired to comply with extensive regulation in numerous jurisdictions relating to health, safe
defaultty, the environment, the control
default of industrial processes as well 
defaultas 
defaulttax and corporate governance matters. G
defaultlencore
default is scrupulous in its adherence to all relevant
default legislation. Reput
defaultational risk typically arises where businesses 
defaultsuffer from weak management, 
defaultthe failure of
default individual
defaults and where there is poor internal and external oversight of corporate governance standards.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe corporate governance concerns which have been raised do not apply to the main FTSE 100 resources companies such Shell, BP, Glencore, BHP Billiton, Rio and Anglo American. Rather these concerns have been raised in respect of the 
defaultsmall number of companie
defaults
default with a dominant or very significant shareholder or shareholders based 
defaulti
defaultn jurisdiction
defaults
default 
defaultwhich 
defaultlack 
defaulta strong track record in corporate governance. Such companies are not exclusively 
defaultlimited 
defaultto the extract
defaultive
default industries sector but the recent focus on these 
defaultreflect
defaults
default 
defaultthe 
defaultsignificant 
defaultnumber of 
defaultlistings 
defaultby extractive companies 
defaultin the 2000s.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK Stewardship Code provides an additional mechanism by which investors can improve the governance of listed companies by monitoring the performance of directors and the
default fulfilment of their duties to investors and other stakeholders. 
default&#xa0;default3.6default defaultIs there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?default&#xa0;defaultWe 
defaultbelieve that NGOs can play an important role in promoting awareness of best practice in the conduct of extractive companies. At Gl
defaultencore we have
default 
defaultan open door policy towards outside stakeholders who have a legitimate interest in working 
defaultconstructively 
defaultwith 
defaultus either
default centr
defaultally or
default on specific country
default projects
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultGlencore’s investment 
defaultin sustainable development in the local communities in which it operates is significant, spending
default over
default $
default200
default 
defaultmillion in the last financial year, a sum equivalent to
default 
default3
default.6
default per cent of the group’s net income. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile the advocacy role of NGOs in promoting best practice is welcome, the potential also exists for some organisations to see their role in ter
defaultms of both judge and jury in
default condemnation of the 
defaultextractive 
defaultsector genera
defaultlly. 
defaultWe reject this stance since we believe that without the contribution of the 
defaultextractive
default sector, the relevant  countries would
default suffer a
default material reduction in investment and tax revenues
default, in turn causing harm to local communities
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are co
defaultmmitted to 
defaultworking with all non-
defaultstate actors who share 
defaultthe 
defaultdesire to foster sustainable economic growth.
default&#xa0;
default3.7default defaultDoes the UK have the skills base to remain a centre for the extractive industries and to ensure that UK based businesses benefit from potential future defaultopportunities such as shale gas?default&#xa0;defaultThe UK has an enviable 
defaultendowment of academic and technical education that is relevant to the extractive sector. This can be found in world renowned universities and colleges
default across the UK, such as Imperial College in Londo
defaultn and the
default Camborne School of Mining.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is, however, no room for complacency in the UK. The extractive sector, like much of British industry, is in need of skilled and technically competent workers.  
defaultTh
defaulte Government should therefore place particular 
defaultemphasis on investing in skills
default-
defaultbased learning to ensure that young 
defaultBritish 
defaultpeople are able to take advantage of the opportunit
defaulties presented by energy and mining companies, active both in the UK and overseas.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe 
defaultalso 
defaultbelieve that the extractive industries
default can play a major role in the rebalancing of the UK economy and in ensuring that it enjoys 
defaultthe sustainable growth that will result from a diverse and skilled labour force.
default&#xa0;
default3.8default&#xa0; 
defaultWhat is the impact indefault the industry of the UK signing up to the EITI?default&#xa0;defaultG
defaultlencore
default is a signatory to the EITI and welcomes the British government’s decision which provides a 
defaultrenewed 
defaultimpetus to the EITI initiative
default. Glencore is committed to the development of robust g
defaultovernance procedures that promote
default the transparency and accountability of relationships between extractive industries and host Governments.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe consider that the EITI will work to its best effect if Governments take greater responsibility in ensuring that data is collected more efficiently
default and made available
default in a timely fashion
default to all stakeholders.
default&#xa0;
default3.9 defaultWould increased regulation for London lisdefaultted extractives companies resultdefaultin competition from elsewhere or can it be used to make the UK a centre of excellence for best practice and defaultcorporate governance?default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK should resist the temptation to introduce new regulation 
defaultexcept 
defaultwhere:
default&#xa0;
defaultand
default&#xa0;
defaultHigh standards of corporate governance 
defaultdo not 
defaultnecessarily affect the competitiveness of a location
default. However, regulatory regimes which tend to create cost and personnel 
defaultburdens are unlikely 
defaultin themselves
default to improve standards of conduct.
default 
defaultIf the UK wishes to remain an attractive location for extractive c
defaultompanies, it should seek to maintain a regulatory regime that not only imposes high standards but does so with the minimum cost to companies and the public purse.
default&#xa0;
default3.10default defaultWhat is the competitive landscape for the extractivedefault industries in the 21st Century defaultand is it in the UK’s interest to defaultremain a global centre for them?default&#xa0;
defaultDuring the first decade of this century, the mining and
default extractive sector
defaults
default enjoyed a period of high commodity prices and heavy investment. Recent trends in metal
defaults
default and 
defaultin 
defaultmineral
defaults
default suggest that a period of consolidation and adjustment may 
defaultnow 
defaultbe underway. This should lead to a more competitive environment for extractive companie
defaults, one in which th
defaulte more
default efficient players will
default thrive
default while those that are less resilient may fall by the
default wayside
default. In such an environment, successful companie
defaults seeking capital and skills will gravitate towards the most efficient and liquid markets in both financial and human resources.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK has a big endowment of skills in natural r
defaultesources, in part becaus
defaulte of offshore
default oil and gas production
default in the North Sea but also because of Britain’s
default colonial legacy
default and a long and distinguished history of commodity trading, based in the City of London. T
defaulthe continued presence of a number of large extractive 
defaultcompanies, li
defaultsted on the Lo
defaultndon Stock Exchange, is also important. While the value of oil and gas production 
defaultin the UK 
defaultcan be quantified, it is difficul
defaultt to measure the benefit to Britain
default 
defaultof extractive companies established in Britain but whose activities are mainly overseas. However, it would be a mistake to focus only on dividends repatriated or tax paid 
default(although as noted above, these are themselves significant benefits)
default. 
defaultThe UK derives 
defaulthuge benefit 
defaultfrom mining and oil companie
defaults 
defaultin 
defaultterms of training and 
defaultthe 
defaultemployment of Britons in posts overseas and in the services activity generated in Britain by the corporate activities of extractive companies
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultMoreover, the corporate presence and 
defaultstock exchange listing of extractive companies, including many of the world’s largest enterprises, represents an important attraction to foreign capital, thus boosting the UK’s position as a global financial centre.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the future
default,
default the extractive sector wi
defaultll
default continue to see the UK as a natural corporate home if it retains its competitive advantage in terms of finance, skills
default, regulation, tax
default and its open-
defaultdoor policy to foreign investors.  As
default the physical output of 
defaultminerals in the UK dwindles, the UK’s impor
defaulttance as a home to the extractive sector will depend more on its ability to provide high-level skills in finance
default, trading
default and project management and engi
defaultneering.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe opportunity exists for Britain to enhance its position as a global hub for energy, mining
default and resources with further economic benefit to the UK. In seizing that opportunity, the UK must commit to
default remain
defaulting
default an open 
defaultand efficient 
defaultmarketplace for the conduct of 
defaultcommodity trading, corporate finance and 
defaultbusiness
default, generally
default.
