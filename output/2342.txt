[[[Richard Gilbert – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;My wife and I have been active walkers in the Pennines and particularly the Yorkshire Dales for over 60 years!&#xa0;Increasingly we have been disturbed by trail motor bikes and 4 wheel vehicles using footpaths, bridle ways and green tracks.  The noise is appalling and great damage is done to the fragile turf and wider environment.&#xa0;I enclose three photos to illustrate my points, there are captions on the back.&#xa0;We are very keen for the problem to be tackled once and for all by the forthcoming Deregulation Bill.&#xa0;We would propose that all unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be reclassified as Restricted Byways.&#xa0;In addition we would like to propose that when a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to a magistrate or an independent inspector.&#xa0;We have been members of the Yorkshire Green Lanes Alliance since its formation.&#xa0;1 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
