[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I am writing, on behalf of the London Assembly Transport Committee, to provide written information on cycling safety to inform the Transport Select Committee’s oral evidence session on 2 December 2013.  &#xa0;This written submission details our relevant past work on cycling safety in relation to the three specific areas where the Transport Select Committee would like views: 1) whether cycling is safe, particularly in towns and cities; 2) what government can do to improve cycling safety; and 3) whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users. The submission is mainly based on our report Gearing Up? An investigation into safer cycling in London (November 2012) and a full copy of this report is available online at: http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor-assembly/london-assembly/publications/gearing-up &#xa0;

[[[Is cycling safe]]]

[[[, particularly in towns and cities]]]

[[[?]]]&#xa0;In our report Gearing Up?, we argued that, although cycling is increasing in London, safety remains a cause for concern.  Despite improvements in the cyclist casualty rate between 2001 and 2006, we identified that the rate across all types of casualty (slight, serious and fatal) worsened between 2007 and 2010.  After 2006 there was an increase in the number of cyclist casualties per million cycle journeys in London and the risk of injury to cyclists increased between 2007 and 2010. Moreover, Transport for London (TfL) failed to achieve its original target to improve cycle safety and subsequently lowered its target.  Originally TfL aimed to reduce the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured (KSI) by 50 per cent by 2010 compared to the 1994-98 average, but the actual reduction achieved was 18 per cent. TfL now has a target to reduce all KSI casualties by 40 per cent by 2020 compared to the 2005-09 average. &#xa0;We found cyclist casualty rates in London compared poorly to those in other cities where cycling had also increased. For example, between 2001 and 2010, New York recorded a drop of 72 per cent in the rate of cyclist KSIs in central Manhattan whereas in the same period in London the drop was 55 per cent on TfL’s road network. This is based on an increase in cycling of 255 per cent in New York and 160 per cent in London. Elsewhere higher cycling rates have led to fewer casualties. For example, in Copenhagen, as cycling grew by 50 per cent between 1995 and 2010 the risk of cycle casualties reduced four-fold. Although the Mayor believes the ‘safety in numbers’ effect will improve cycling safety in the capital, we found this is not yet evident. We, therefore, concluded that it was imperative for the Mayor and TfL to make improving the safety of cyclists the top priority in all their cycling programmes.  &#xa0;

[[[2. What ]]]

[[[can ]]]

[[[government do to improve cycling safety?]]]&#xa0;In our report Gearing Up?, we made clear the role central, regional and local government bodies have to play in improving cycling safety and encourage more cycling.  We expressed our support for the Mayor’s aspiration to increase cycling but suggested that his target of 5 per cent cycling modal share by 2026 was too low and that the upward cycling casualty trends could prevent more Londoners cycling.  Indeed the Mayor and TfL’s Cycle Safety Action Plan (2010) recognises that concern about safety is both the most significant barrier for non-cyclists taking up cycling and stops 10 per cent of existing cyclists cycling more.  We recommended that the Mayor should establish a new target of 10 per cent cycling modal share by 2026 and appoint a Cycling Commissioner to champion cycling.  We wanted the Cycling Commissioner to publish a biennial London Bicycle Account to inform Londoners of the work taking place to improve cycle safety. We also called for more investment in cycling to shift it away from a transport option for the few, to a safe and attractive choice for all Londoners. We recommended that the Mayor and TfL should: allocate at least £145 million to cycling in 2013/14 (the equivalent of 2 per cent of TfL’s 2012/13 budget); commit a minimum of £100 million to funding the Better Junctions Review (over the period of the review); and provide at least £60 million (or 20 per cent of TfL cycling budget) to fund the Biking Borough Programme so it becomes an Outer London Cycling Fund. &#xa0;

[[[feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]In our report Gearing Up?, we concluded eriod of the review), recommendations in four broad areas: 1) ndon al authorities have encouraged the provision of cythere could, and should, be more segregated cycle space in London. Currently, decisions to give cyclists protected space are often turned down because there is a lack of political will to take space from motorised traffic. We heard from cyclist organisations that cyclists should mix with other traffic where possible, and be separated where necessary. Experts told us that any effort promoted as cycling improvement should give cyclists protected space.  We found the lack of protected space for cyclists on cycle superhighways continued to present risks. This echoed the findings from our earlier report Pedal Power (November 2010) which found that users of the first two cycle superhighways were concerned about their safety. Around 60 per cent of over 1,000 cyclists who responded to our survey said they did not feel safer when using the first two cycle superhighways and two-thirds did not feel these superhighways were respected by other road users. We recommended the Mayor and TfL provide greater consistency in the measures along the cycle superhighways such as a uniform width, improvements to junctions and 20 mph speed limits on busy sections.&#xa0;In our report Gearing Up?, we recommended the Mayor and TfL commit to introducing fundamental cycle safety improvements to the road junctions in their Better Junctions Review. They should prioritise the removal of one-way gyratory systems and examine the case for introducing 20 mph speed limits at junctions.  We also recommended that the Department for Transport introduce legislative changes to traffic regulations to enable TfL to use new cycle safety solutions such as cyclist eye-level traffic signals. In addition to improving infrastructure, we wanted to see action taken to improve the interactions of cyclists with other road users especially HGVs.  We expressed support for the Government and European Union introducing legislation to increase the number of vehicles that are retrofitted with cyclist safety equipment such as side guards, close proximity cameras and visual aids. We also recommended that the Mayor and TfL work with the London Boroughs to make HGV safety training a condition in planning consents and for TfL to do more with the Metropolitan Police Service to tackle dangerous road use. This should include more enforcement activity along busy cycle routes and at collision hotspots and improving drivers’ awareness through education campaigns.  In addition, we called on the Department for Transport to examine evidence from leading cycling countries about the costs and benefits of stricter responsibility and penalties against dangerous driving and the Mayor and TfL to develop a plan to roll out cycle training across London. &#xa0;We will be following up our work on cycling safety in London at our meeting on 10 December 2013 with representatives of the Mayor, TfL and cycling organisations. In advance of the meeting, we have invited Londoners to contribute their views through an online survey which has already attracted many responses.  &#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
