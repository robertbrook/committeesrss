"EIS 37Written evidence submitted by UK Government1.               Introduction 1.1\n              \nBIS are\n responsible for the industrial strategy and \nwe \npublished the Oil &amp; Gas Strategy in March 2013\n.  It ha\ns a clear focus to support oil and gas investment, boost growth and enhance the UK's energy security.  \n1.2\n              \nIn addition, \nBIS \nis\n \nresponsible for\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nUKTI\n \nsector teams and international networks identify overseas opportunities for the \nUK supply chain.  \nThey share information \nwith industry\n, assess\n UK capability\n in oil, gas and mining \nand p\nromot\ne\n UK capability\n overseas.   \nUKTI\n also\n provid\ne\n direct\n support\n for companies and promot\ne\n \nUK \nbusiness overseas – including by minister\nial visit\ns.\n1.4\n              \nDECC seeks to ensure the UK has secure, clean and affordable energy supplies. To that end, DECC works with the oil and gas industry to maximise the UK's oil and gas resource and is working with industry to realise its economic potential.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n              \nDECC respon\nsibilities include the issuing of licences for oil and gas exploration and production, regulating field development and offshore oil and gas pipeline activities as well as regulating the environmental aspects of the offshore oil and gas \nindustry, including\n decommissioning.\n&#xa0;\nDECC\n&#xa0;\nsponsors the Coal Authority whose responsibility includes issuing licences for coal exploration and extraction.\n&#xa0;\n2.              Q1 &amp; 2.  Economic Contribution including employment2.1\n              \nThe extractive industries, and the petroleum sector in \nparticular, generate significant economic rent—the difference between the value and cost of production. Extractive industry revenues tend to be volatile, uncertain and exhaustible.\n2.2\n              \nInformation on the economic contribution of UK\n coal, oil and gas production – including in terms of direct contribution to GDP, direct employment and investment – is included in \nUK Energy in Brief\n.\n That contribution is summarised in the following table:\n2.3\n              \nThe table at \nAnnex 1 gives a feel for the importance of fossil fuels to meeting UK energy demand and of UK production of those fuels.\n2.4\n              \nComprehensive information on the UK\n oil and gas industry including the UK supply chain is provided in the annual \nEconomic Report\n of Oil &amp; Gas \nUK\n.  \nIncluding the 36,000 people it estimates to have been directly employed in hydrocarbon \nexploration and production in 2012, Oil &amp; Gas UK estimat\ne that the UK upstream oil and gas \nindustry supported some 450,000 jobs\n.  There are \nmany highly skilled\n jobs\n, across the whole economy, with 200,000 employed in the supply chain, 112,000 in jobs induced by the economic activity of the above employees and 1\n00,000 in the export of goods and services.\n2.5\n              \nUp-to date coal statistics are published by the Coal Authority\n \na\nnd by UK Coal\n.\n \nUK Coal’s Daw Mill deep mine closed in March 2013\n f\nollowing a devastating fire. That leaves the UK\n with just three large operational deep mines – Hatfield\n, \nKellingley and Thoresby collieries. \n2.6\n              \nT\nhe greatest part of UK coal demand comes from electricity generation. Power stations have represented more than 80% of total UK coal consumption each year s\nince 2001 and 86% in 2012. Over th\nis\n period coal has provided on average around a third of total UK electricity with gas’s share averaging 40% (and approaching a half in 2008–2010) but those shares were roughly reversed in 2012.\n2.7\n              \nUKTI \npublished \nUK – \nDelivering Global Mining Solutions\n \nin \nJune \n2013, \nproviding an overview of the UK’s world class capabilities to the global mining sector, including mining, finance and consulting services.\n2.8\n              \nInformation on UK fossil fuel production is published monthly b\ny the Department of Energy and Climate Change\n (DECC) \na\nnd summarised annually in the \nDigest of UK energy statistics\n (DUKES)\n, \nmost recently in July 2013\n: \n3. Wider benefits to UK industry&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nAs set out in \nUK – Delivering Global Mining Solutions\n \ncapability publication, the\n UK's mining equipment designers and manufacturers deliver world-leading \nproducts across the entire mining lifecycle.  The UK has world\n-\nleading educational providers and cutting edge R&amp;D facilities which deliver training as well \nas research which is utilised across the world. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nA UK firm can provide equipment with many of the components manufactured in the UK including planning, construction, operation and closure.  London is also a centre of excellence in the provision of bus\niness and professional services in support of the sector.   \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nThese UK-based services supporting the extractive industries have often developed in response to mining companies listed in London and/or have located in London to be close to their client’s\n Head Quarters\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nMore specifically, locally sourced extractive\ns \nare important \nto \nother sectors\n in the UK\n.  \nA good example is i\nndigenous limestone \nwhich is \nused in the manufacture of cement, mortar and concrete.  \nL\nimestone \nis\n vital for security of supply and cost competitiveness in construction projects.\n&#xa0;4.              UK Extractive Industries Competitive Position&#xa0;4.1\n              \nThe Oil &amp; Gas Industrial Strategy \nhighlighted \nthat \nthe \noil and gas sector generates £27bn for the economy. \nThe strategy \nalso shows that\n th\ne UK is the largest producer of oil in Europe\n and that f\norecasts show that there will be record investment in 2013 of £14b\nn\n to search for and produce UK oil and gas reserves.  \n4.2\n              \nUK firms are involved across the mining supply chain from\n the provision of components to manufacture of completed items of equipment which are exported across the globe.  With limited domestic opportunities, UK mining equipment companies have had to develop innovative products and technologies to compete interna\ntionally.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nThe UK \nhas \nworld class engineering design companies active in the extractives sector and involved in mine design, construction, \nand \nassociated services \nsuch as power, water and infrastructure.  UK\n consultancies advise on all aspects of the mine design and operation including environmental impact assessments and master planning.   As well as the global financial centre for the industry\n,\n London is also a centre of excellence in the provision of busin\ness and professional services which support the sector.\n&#xa0;\n5.              Corporate Governance and reputation&#xa0;\n5\n.1\n              \n \nLondon is one of the world\n’\ns leading financial centres and attracts a wide range of companies to list on its markets.  \nAs well as having \nsignificant expe\nrtise in mining and extractives, a \nkey strength of the UK and its financial institutions is\n its \nstrong corporate governance framework,\n \nwhich is robust by comparison to many countries in which extractives may operate.  A listing on the London Stock Exchange\n is evidence that a company is held to a high standard which promotes confidence when dealing with that company. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nThe extractive industry has a unique risk profile as a result of the varied projects that the average extractive \ncompany \ncarries out. \nThe\ns\ne projects are \noften in countries carrying greater risks\n which \nrequire permits and licen\nc\nes. \n Th\nere are particular r\nisks \nwhich \nextractive companies \ncould be \nparticularly exposed\n to\n.\n \nT\nhese \nmight \nbe\n reputational, operational\n, environmental\n \nas well as\n bribery and corruption risk\ns\n.\n \nThe UK’s existing regu\nlatory regime helps to mitigate\n these risks.\n \n \nExtractive companies \nhave a responsibility to ensure that their corporate governance is compliant with the regulatory regime. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nIn itself, the number of\n extractives listing in the UK should not pose any concerns if they are compliant with the regulatory regime.   However, \nthere are a num\nber of events that would raise\n concern\ns\n that the regulatory regime is being improperly applied.  This includes, but is n\not limited to:\ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \na \nsignificant \nnumber of companies displaying corporate governance failures;\nii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ninadequate\n \nmonitoring or \nenforcement of failures \nof cor\nporate governance on an industrial\n scale\n;\niii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ncorporate governance failures affecting the market value of extracti\nves across the industry as a whole and\n;\niv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \na significant\n number of companies listing in London\n \nthat pose a significantly higher risk\n profile \nthan the average FTSE listing.  \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nWithout mitigating these risks, \ninvestors \ncould \nquestion the \neffectiveness of the \nUK\n regulatory framework as whole\n, with inherent reputational risks to the UK and its financial institutions. \n&#xa0;\n5.5\n              \nAt present, there are concerns that the interests of minority shareholders are under-represented in companies where ther\ne are powerful majority shareholders and in companies which are traded publicly but have a relatively small proportion of shares in public circulation. In both these situation\ns there is a concern about\n the increased concentrations of shareholder power in t\nhe hands of the few\n. This means\n it is less likely that minority shareholders will be able to make their views known and hold directors to account in the event of corporate governance failures. \n&#xa0;\n5\n.\n6\n              \nThese issues have been considered by the UK Listing Autho\nrity.  The FCA consulted last October\n on proposals to enhance the effectiveness of the Listing Regime overall and in particular to provide greater protection to shareholders in situations where there is a controlling shareholder.\n&#xa0;\n FCA intend\ns \nto provide f\needback on this consultation in October. \n&#xa0;\n6.              Engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGOs &#xa0;\n6\n.1\n              \nThe UK Government \nis\n committed to working with \nstakeholders \nincluding industry and NGOs \nwhen developing\n and delivering\n policy.  \nT\nhe Accounting \nDirective\n \nand \nEITI\n \nprovide\n good examples of \nthe Government\n \nworking with both \nNGOs and Industry on transparency\n.\n \n6\n.2\n              \nAt the international level, the Board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) brings together civil society organisations and companies and investors on a regular basis to agree the EITI rules by consensus.\n&#xa0;\n Several UK-listed extractive\n companies are on the EITI Board. In each of the 39 countries which implement the EITI, there is a multi-stakeholder group of \nG\novernment, companies and civil society which together oversee the EITI process.\n&#xa0;\n \n6\n.3\n              \nAs part of the UK implementation of the EIT\nI, BIS is establishing a multi\n-\nstakeholder group which will also allow UK extractive companies and NGOs to work together to oversee reporting of payments to the UK \nG\novernment for extractives\n.\n6\n.4\n              \nBIS \nbrought NGOs and industry together to work on extractive\ns transparency\n during the \nnegotiations and implementation of the Accounting Direc\ntive\n.  \nThe \nmost recent meeting\n included\n industry representatives from Shell, BP, BG Group, Rio Tinto and Anglo American\n, who \nattended alongside NGO representatives from Publish What You Pay, CAFOD, Tearfund, Christian Aid, Global Witness and ONE. \n \n&#xa0;\n6\n.5\n              \nThese\n meeting\ns\n helped to build understanding between the two groups around the reasons \nwhy \nthey had each adopted their respecti\nve positions\n.  \nThese meetings \nallowed them to begin to identify areas where a compromise could satisfy both parties. \n BIS\n will continue to hold all\n-\ngroup meetings at regular intervals during the implementation phase. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;7.              Extractive Sector and skills 7\n.1\n              \nThe extractive industries cover a wide group of sub-sectors from mining and quarrying to the oil and gas extraction industries all with similar, but different\n,\n skills challenges. \n7\n.\n2\n              \nT\nhe Oil and Gas sector Industrial Strategy identified how the sector \nand the Government can work on the skills challenges \nfaced by the \nsector\n.  L\ninks could be made with opportunities in future sectors including shale gas. \n7\n.\n 3\n              \nThe strategy acknowledges that high levels of activity and global competition have resulted in \nskills shortages in the sector\n.  The \nlack of availability of skilled workers is one of the biggest challenges the sector faces. \n \nThe strategy s\nuggests key actions to be taken forward by Government and Industry such as a \nskills gap analysis\n,\n \ninitiatives to \nrecruit ex-military personnel\n and \nthe redeployment of those from other \nlinked industries to \nthe\n sector.  These will build on the number of existing initiatives being taken forward by\n the Offshore Petroleum Industry Training Organisation\n \n(\nOPITO\n)\n and others\n to ensure the pipeline of skilled individuals into the Oil and Gas sector.\n7\n.\n4\n              \nI\nncreasing use of technology and automation is likely to result in a continuing contraction of the aggregates, mineral\n and\n coal industry workforce.  This in turn is creating a demand for highly skilled individuals with a wide range of talents and there are some reported skills shortages and hard to fill vacancies.   \n7\n.\n5\n              \nR\necently, through a partnership with the Institute of Q\nuarrying and Derby University, the industry has developed an online University Certificate in International Quarry Operations, mainly intended to support companies abroad. This partnership has \nla\nunched a Centre f\nor Mineral Products Professional Development\n, \noffer\ning\n a wide range of industry developed higher level programmes. A higher level apprenticeship in Mineral Products Technology has also been launched, its development supported by the Government\n’\ns \nHigher Apprenticeship Fund. \n7\n.\n6\n              \nWe\n will continue to improve the responsiveness of the skills system to the needs of business\n.  We are\n promoting greater employer leadership and closer collaboration between business and higher education and further education colleges. \n7.7\n              \nIt is important th\nat business leads in developing the skilled workforce required to maintain the competitiveness of the UK\n’\ns extractive industries sector\n and \nto enable its future growth\n.\n  We expect businesses to work closely with bodies such as EU \nS\nkills\n (the Sector Skills\n Council for Energy and Utilities), Cogent\n (Chemicals, Nuclear, Oil and Gas, petroleum and Polymers) and OPITO to help identify the sectors current and future skills challenges.\n7\n.8\n              \nAcross all sectors of the U\nK\n economy\n, we have\n acknowledged the broader challenge to improve \nscience, technology, engineering and mathematics (\nSTEM\n)\n skills\n.  The \nGovernment is funding\n a number of initiatives \naim\ned at increasing the number of young people taking \nSTEM subjects\n and \nimprov\ning\n the image of\n \nmanufacturing \nand engineering\n.  These include \nthe STEM \nA\nmbassadors programme\n,\n See Inside Manufacturing\n,\n the National Careers Service \nand improving the quality of all levels of \napprenticeships\n.\n7\n.9\n              \nThe BIS Chie\nf Scientific Advisor, Professor\n \nPerkins, \nis \nundertaking a review with industry and learned bodies such as the Royal Academy of Engineering \nso\n we understand the scale of the engineering skills challenge in the UK.  \nH\ne \nwill report\n \nin the \nautumn\n.  The UK Commission for Employment and Skills also con\nducts work to understand the skills needs and challenges of key areas of the UK economy, including the energy sector\n.  \n \n&#xa0;\n8.              Impact on industry of UK sign-up to EITI&#xa0;\n8\n.1\n              \nThe \nUK sign\ned \nup to EITI to show leadership \non extractives transparency \nand to \nencourage other countries to follow suit.\n  \nWe are responding \nto concerns \nthat potential EITI countries\n are\n deterred from joining the initiative due to the perception that\n EITI\n is designed for poor and corrupt countries.\n  \nThe Government\n \naim\ns\n \nto \nsend\n a\n \nclear message that EITI is a global standard for both developed as well as developing countries.\n&#xa0;\n8\n.2\n              \n3.5 billion \np\neople live in resource-rich countries but many are not seeing the benefits from the extraction of their natural resources. \nFar\n \ntoo often \npoor governance leaves citizens suffering from conflict and corruption. The EITI was formed to change this.\n&#xa0;\n8\n.3\n              \nWe anticipate th\nere could be domestic and international benefits to \nbusi\nness \nin the UK signing up to EITI\n.  \nD\nomestic\nally\n, there is \npotential for \nan \nimproved relationship between industry and civil \nsociety\n as they work together to implement EITI\n.  \n \n  \n8\n.4\n              \nI\nnternational\nly\n,\n \nUK extractives companies operating in resource-rich countries benefit from lower reputational risk and better relat\nions with \nthe \ncommunities \nwhere\n they operate. EITI is a strong signal that the UK is a responsible operator, further enhancing \nour \nreputation abroad\n.\n8\n.5\n              \nThe UK getting \nour\n \nown house in order will encourage others, including emerging economies, to sign up. As more countries join the EITI, overall global standards of transparency are raised, and together with mandatory reporting, this levels the playing field for UK companies.\n \n8\n.6\n              \nT\nhe \nI\nn\nternational \nB\noard \nrequires the major decisions including scope and materiality \nof each domestic EITI \nto be decided and agreed by \nits Multi-Stakeholder Group\n, consisting of industry, civil society and \nG\novernment\n.  \nThe\n UK\n MSG will meet for the first time on 9 October\n to begin its work to agree a proportionate process and develop a work plan on implementation\n.\n&#xa0;\n8\n.7\n              \nIt is important that reporting requirements are consistent, whether they arise from EITI, EU reporting rules i\nn Chapter 10 of the Accounting Directive or the Transparency Directive.\n&#xa0;\n9.              Role of regulation &#xa0;\n9\n.1\n              \nLondon is one of the world’s leading financial centres and attracts a wide range of companies to list on its markets.  One reason for this is \nour\n legal and regulatory framework.  \nWhile m\nany companies list in their geographic home, other companies will have a choice of location and as a result the UK is in competition with other markets, in particular the US.  \nA\nny decision to change the regulatory s\nystem would need to be taken in this context and maintain the competitiveness of the UK market for issuers whilst providing an appropriate degree of protection for investors. \n&#xa0;\n9\n.2\n              \nNotwithstanding the need to maintain a competitive environment, the UK is r\negarded as a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance\n.  A high value is \nplace\nd\n on the trust and transparency of \nthe UK’s \ncorporate governance framework.  \nT\no enhance this further, \nBIS\n recently published \na\n discussion paper on Transpare\nncy &amp; Trust\n.\n  \nIt\n introduces proposals to improve the transparency of corporate ownership structures in the UK and to increase trust in companies and those who run them by ensuring that we have adequate and robust sanctions in place when the rules are brok\nen.\n&#xa0;\n9\n.3\n              \nThe Financial Conduct Authority, as the independent regulator for the UK’s listing regime, consulted last October on proposals to enhance the effectiveness of the Listing Regime overall and in particular to provide greater protection to \ninvestors\n \nin situations where there is a controlling shareholder.\n&#xa0;\n \nThe \nFCA is\n&#xa0;\nintending to provide feedback on this consultation in early October. \n \n10.              Competitive landscape &#xa0;\n10\n.1\n              \nThe UK\n’s expertise in oil and gas gives us a huge national advantage.  Government and industry \nare \nworking together to keep the UK at the heart of the global race in the worldwide energy industry, creating jobs and growth.\n&#xa0;\n10\n.2\n              \nThe \nOil &amp; Gas Industrial Strategy\n \nwas d\nevelope\nd in partnership with industry.  It\n sets out a clear path to exploit the UK’s remaining resources and overcome an increasingly challenging production environment.\n  \n&#xa0;\n10\n.3\n              \nSince publication, the Oil &amp;\n Gas Industry Council, supported by a BIS-led secretariat, has begun taking forward the actions listed in the strategy. Several have already been completed, and a number of key milestones are due to be finalised by the end of this year. One of the key deli\nverables – a research project mapping the UK supply chain, including exports, by value and destination, to determine areas of constraint and potential opportunities for additional support – is now underway.\n&#xa0;\n10\n.4\n              \nIn addition, \nDECC commissioned an Oil and \nGas Review\n \nin June 2013\n.  This is be\ning led by Sir Ian Wood, who is\n looking in depth at the key issues which need to be addressed to ensure\n the\n longevity of the industry and our resources.  \n&#xa0;\n10\n.5\n              \nWith \nthis \nincreasing focus on environmental and governance \nconsiderations, the UK's comparative advantage in the professional services sector will increasingly be called upon to support these mining developments.  Coupled with the need to raise large capital investment for many mining developments ($20bn not being\n unusual) the City of London will continue to be an important funding source.  \n&#xa0;\n10\n.6\n              \nThe \nCompetition Commission \ncurrently \nhas an inquiry \ninto the Aggregates, Cement and Ready Mix Concrete industries.\n The outcome of the investigation will not be known until the end of 2013.\nAnnex 1&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-oil-and-gas-industrial-strategy-business-and-government-action-plan\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-energy-in-brief-2013\n \nhttp://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/2013-economic-report.cfm\n.\n \nhttp://coal.decc.gov.uk/en/coal/cms/publications/mining/mining.aspx\n \nhttp://www.ukcoal.com/why-co\nal/need-for-coal/world-coal-statistics\n \nhttp://www.extractiveindustry.co.uk/Extractive_industry/Industr\ny_Information_files/UK%20%20Delivering%20Global%20Mining%20Solutions.pdf\n \n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-energy-clim\nate-change/about/statistics\n) \n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-energy-climate-change/series/digest-of-uk-energy-statistics-dukes\n).\n \nhttp://ww\nw.fsa.gov.uk/static/pubs/cp/cp12-25.pdf\n \nhttp://uk.opito.com/\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.euskills.co.uk/\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.cogent-ssc.com/\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.stemnet.org.uk/\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://discuss.bis.gov.uk/seeinsidemanufacturing/\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/Pages/Home.aspx\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/\nsystem/uploads/attachment_data/file/212079/bis-13-959-transparency-and-trust-enhancing-the-transparency-of-uk-company-ownership-and-increaing-trust-in-uk-business.pdf\n&#xa0;\n"
