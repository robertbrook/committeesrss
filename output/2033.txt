[[[The Ridgeway and Sugar Way ]]]

[[[ Aldbourne]]]I write in relation to your deliberations on off road motor vehicles and motor cycles use of BOATS and similar rights of way.Here in the Marlborough downs a.o.n.b we are blessed with many lovely green lanes which used to be havens of peace and tranquillity, where walkers and horse riders could enjoy the lovely springy turf. NO LONGER IS THIS POSSIBLE!This is due to the mindless use of off road vehicles which have made them impassable to walkers and riders alike due to the creation of massively deep ruts and mud. It goes without saying the noise and danger created is considerable. We have seen in excess of 25 4x4’s nose to tail in pouring rain enjoying the destruction of our own land.&#xa0;The natural reaction to this damage from Councils is to pave the track. This has created other, possibly more, disturbing phenomena; these paved tracks have given access to criminals who now use them to break into our farms and houses as well as criminal damage from joy riding, hare coursing and poaching.

[[[The situation is becoming very serious]]]

[[[ I urge the government to restrict the use of these tracks to non motorised traffic]]]
