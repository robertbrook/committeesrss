[[[House of Lords European Union Sub-Committee B (internal Market, Infrastructure and Employment): EU action to tackle youth unemployment]]]&#xa0;Illustrations of good practice&#xa0;Introduction and General Comments&#xa0;In the course of their inquiry the Sub-Committee received oral evidence on Monday 4th November from three academic researchers and commentators: Professor Sue Maguire, Dr Paul Copeland and myself. A note setting out the more important points covered in my oral evidence was submitted the following week.  This supplementary paper, prepared at the Sub-Committee’s request, offers some examples good practice – presented as short case studies.   Three of the four cases (Cogent, Schaeffler UK, and Swarm) have been prepared specifically for this purpose. The fourth, the BBC 2012 London Apprenticeship scheme, was produced for TJ (Training Journal) magazine. It is included because it remains one of the most impressive and interesting that I have encountered. &#xa0;All four case illustrations concern the development or introduction of apprenticeships.  This topic occupies a high public profile in the current political and economic debate.  Indeed in the previous paper presented to the Sub-Committee they were described as the new ‘silver bullet’ of skills training, with a warning that apprenticeship schemes are shamelessly oversold.

[[[A common thread throughout the cases is that they have sought to combine the business case with the social case, or ]]]

[[[needs of the wider community]]]

[[[ – and placed a strong emphasis on the former]]].  An apprenticeship scheme, and indeed any training initiative, will not command support within an organisation unless it can be seen to assist the business in economic terms. The most appropriate processes, or interventions to support, accelerate and direct young people’s learning can be determined only within the context of the organisation. For this reason successful initiatives will not be readily transferrable to another business environment nor will they be scaleable (capable of being ramped up across the economy as a whole).

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Apprenticeships are not an easy option.  However it is possible to make them succeed as the cases demonstrate.]]]  I am grateful to the four organisations for the details that they have supplied.  I am sure that they would be willing to assist the Sub-Committee further if requested. &#xa0;The Cogent Higher Apprenticeship Framework&#xa0;Cogent is the Sector Skills Council (SSC) for the science-based industries.  It represents a sector which employs around 900, 000 people.  The industries involved rely on a constant supply of high-level skills to ensure innovation and growth.  Effective and relevant apprenticeships have become an increasingly important element in meeting that challenge.   As Cogent’s Chief Executive, Joanna Woolf, puts it: “The development of fit-for-purpose Apprenticeships and models through which they are delivered, is central to Cogent’s aim of securing the very best skills for industry”.&#xa0;It is important to recognise that it the companies themselves who are the employers, not the SSC.  In July 2011 Cogent was given financial support from the BIS Growth and Innovation Fund (GIF) to support sector employers to source and employ apprentices.  This led to the creation of a new company, the Technical Apprenticeship Service, which, with Cogent’s support, has developed new frameworks for the sector.   The need for a new approach reflected changing business and individual needs.  Previously the industries looked to graduates.  Now it needs to attract people who choose not to go to University and are seeking career progression through a more practical, in-company route. Christine Sakhardande, Programme Manager for the initiative at Cogent SSC offers the following summary of the added value and changing status: “In the past Apprenticeships have not often been seen as the preferred route to a professional scientific career and with a limited number of vocational degree routes into the science-industries, the programme will give employees and apprentices an opportunity to develop leadership skills, and provide a new route to continuing professional development.”

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[In September 2012 Cogent launched a Developing Science Professionals programme.  This aims to stimulate demand; demonstrate the value of technician job roles; and position apprenticeship pathways that lead to professional technician status as a credible ambition for school leavers and a career choice which has parity with the established science graduate route into industry]]]. The programme is also suitable for adults looking to progress on the career ladder into higher-level roles. Currently (at November 2013) there are 74 individuals undertaking the relatively new programme, with more in the pipeline.&#xa0;The programme builds on and extends Cogent’s Higher Apprenticeship in Life Sciences by offering a broader Higher Apprenticeship for Chemical and Life Science professionals with qualifications at Level&#xa0;4, 5 and 6. The Higher Apprenticeship can be achieved by studying either a Foundation degree or a new HND Diploma.  The Developing Science Professionals programme has also been mapped to the requirements of the new Science Council Technician Register, allowing the apprentice to gain professional recognition, initially as a Registered Technician (RSciTech) and on completion of the programme as a Registered Scientist (RSci). 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[There is a major challenge in meeting the needs of employees with different motivations and ambitions working in a diverse sector.]]]  Apprenticeships could be working in research and development (R&amp;D), quality control quality assurance, production support or in some cases pilot plant development.   The framework could be implemented in life sciences, chemical sciences, process development, packaging development, or health care sciences.&#xa0;The Higher Apprenticeship offers employers a choice between a work-based foundation degree through distance learning or new work-based HNDs and HNCs through a local Further Education provider.  Accordingly a range of qualifications are embedded into the framework.  Examples are: Foundation degree in Chemical Sciences (distance/blended learning, Manchester Metropolitan); Foundation degree in Applied Bioscience Technology  (distance/blended learning, Kent); Foundation degree in Healthcare Science; BTEC HND Diploma in Chemical Science for Industry; BTEC HND Diploma in Biological Sciences for Industry; BTEC HNC Diploma in Chemical Science for Industry; BTEC HNC Diploma in Biological Sciences for Industry. Tuition fees have to be paid for each year of study and either the employer or the apprentice can cover these. At Level 6 the apprentice can top up their qualification through flexible part-time modules leading to a BSc Honours degree.&#xa0;Despite the successful design of the new approach and promotional efforts there is still generally a low awareness and understanding of the benefits that Higher Apprenticeships offer. Current technician recruitment and training is, in many instances, still based on graduate entry&#xa0;Cogent are therefore keen to emphasise that employers need to be involved and take ownership for the design as well as the implementation of frameworks. Much of their efforts are directed towards securing the support and commitment of employers.  The argument offered is that this approach allows companies to grow their own talent and that apprentices gain the skills and knowledge that are of importance to the employer.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[However it is hoped that the legacy of this project will be a broad and flexible framework, a progression route to professional recognition and a step change in the way technicians are trained and recruited. It will appeal to young people who enjoy science, but who do not feel the university route is for them, hope that this pathway will lead to a long and rewarding careers in a strategically important sector of the economy.]]]&#xa0;Schaeffler (UK) Ltd&#xa0;Schaeffler (UK) Ltd is part of the German owned Schaeffler Group of companies, a global multi–national organisation employing over 70,000 employees worldwide. One of the UK sites is Schaeffler (UK) Ltd which manufactures high precision engine components (mostly mechanical tappets) for the automotive industry.  The plant was established in the mid 1950s and is located in Bynea, near Llanelli in West Wales.&#xa0;Schaeffler (UK) Ltd has faced challenging times. The 1990s was a period of rapid growth. Towards the turn of the century, however, the company faced increasing competition from low labour cost countries as group production capacity was placed in Eastern Europe (Slovakia and Romania) where wages are a fraction of those in the UK. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The company responded by developing the capability to deliver higher value added products. There was a planned focus on continuous improvement, cost reduction and, as an integral component of the process, a sustained attempt to up-skill the workforce.]]] As the Human Resource Director for Schaeffler UK, Adrian Roberts says: “Previously the investment had been in machinery, now the investment is in people”. A culture change programme of continuous improvement, training and flexibility was supported by the statement: “the rate of learning must be greater than the rate of change (L&gt;C).” &#xa0;The investment in people has paid off in business terms. The Schaeffler Group named Schaeffler (UK) Ltd as its lead plant for mechanical tappets, a key automotive project.  This involved responsibility for controlling and supporting production and quality on a worldwide basis with plants in the US, South Korea and China.  Roger Evans, the Plant Director, had been named Welsh Business Leader of the Year (large company category) in 2006 and was awarded the MBE in 2009. However, in the spirit of continuous improvement, Roger Evans argued. “Now we have secured a future, we must plan to make the future successful.  The more we do the more we want to do.” In 2012 the parent group invested several million euros in surface coating technology for tappets and as well as a state of the art deep drawing press; this has enabled the Plant to produce superior quality tappets for its customers.&#xa0;Over the last fifteen years the main problem facing Schaeffler (UK) Ltd has been one of survival in a changing global market.  

[[[Now that the future is more secure, forward planning and succession planning across the whole workforce have become important.  Here the company is able to build on a long-standing and well-regarded apprenticeship scheme.]]]   Many of the current team of Management, Supervisors and Team Leaders are former apprentices and the programme has been always been given a high priority.  As Adrian Roberts puts it: “At times we have not been able to undertake any general recruitment.  However despite all the pressures only in one year has the company not taken on new apprentices”.&#xa0;Seventeen apprentices have been recruited over the last five years; three-quarters of those recruited are still with the company.   Schaeffler (UK) Ltd has a strong relationship with the local college, Coleg Sir Gar, in Llanelli, which has been built up over decades. Initially apprentices are recruited and employed through the college.  

[[[Since 2009 a Pathways to Apprenticeships (PtA) programme has been in place in Wales and is funded by the Welsh Government and the European Social Fund.  The young people spend their first year learning the general principles of engineering at the college and some of the more able are sent on placements to Schaeffler (UK) Ltd. From this group the company chooses the three of four candidates to offer an apprenticeship.]]]  This works well for Schaeffler, not least because, as the employer of choice in the area, they would otherwise be overwhelmed with applications.&#xa0;The apprentices can pursue one the following traditional engineering routes and train as a Toolmaker, Mechanical Fitter, or Electrician/Electronics Technician. Their first year of training is spent ‘off the job’ at Coleg Sir Gar where the apprentices obtain a good general understanding of engineering in the college’s workshops, as well as academic study. The next three years spent undertaking a structured training programme, which enables the apprentices to acquire the desired levels of competency in their chosen disciplines. Their practical training is supported by academic study which is delivered through day release once a week at Coleg Sir Gar.  The majority of apprentices achieve HNC level qualifications upon completion of training. Some one in five continue to study a degree at Coleg Sir Gar, with full company sponsorship.   To date the apprentices have spent extended periods in maintenance and in the tool room.  However the company has recently reviewed its programme and future cohorts will spend more time developing their skills and understanding of the new technologies.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Adrian Roberts views Coleg Sir Gar as a strategic partner, the Company has extremely close links, in particular with the Engineering Department which is viewed as one of the best in Wales. The College is focused towards the needs of business, and always has a “can do” attitude. However he says that there is work to be done with school students. He feels that abler school students can be directed away from a career in manufacturing and too many are drawn towards other sectors such as financial services: “In schools an apprenticeship is often seen as something to consider if you are not good enough for an academic pathway”.]]]&#xa0;BBC 2012 London Apprenticeships &#xa0;(This case illustration was first published in Training Journal in August 2011)The BBC 2012 London Apprenticeship scheme forms an important part of the Corporation’s legacy to the Olympic Games.  The scheme, which was introduced in 2010 and will run for three years, gives ten trainees a year the opportunity to undertake an apprenticeship and follow either the Production Management Assistant or Runner career paths.  These are entry level jobs into production and give a good grounding in production processes, research and working in a production team.  According to Caroline Prendergast, the BBC’s Skills and HR Director, London 2012, the choice of these jobs was deliberate.  

[[[They are important to the organisation and as entry level roles are characterised by high turnover.  She is keen to emphasise the business case that underpins the initiative, in particular this new scheme takes a significant step towards making entry into BBC employment more accessible.  It will help create a more socially inclusive workforce and is in line with the BBC’s strategy of engaging with underserved audiences]]]. Six members of the 2010 intake are already working, five for the BBC and one externally. &#xa0;Recruitment is therefore targeted at the six Olympic London Boroughs (Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Newham, Waltham Forest, Barking and Dagenham and Greenwich).  No academic requirements are specified at the selection stage but applicants are expected to be able to demonstrate a real interest in production.  For example they could have had work experience in a recording studio, a community radio station or in film making.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[As would be expected, there is no shortage of applicants.  Over 850 applied for ten places and 48 attended a final centre where their creativity and team working and other key competencies were assessed.]]]   At this stage applicants also undertook an on-line test to ensure that their communication, numerical and IT skills were good enough to gain a Level 2 qualification by the end of the programme. &#xa0;The scheme is mapped to the creative digital media Level 3 advanced apprenticeship competency framework.  The BBC sought advice from Skillset, the sector skills council, and has, on their advice, partnered with Westminster Kingsway College in designing and implementing the training and assessment.  Participants, who are paid £11000 a year, receive a contract for a one-year programme.  &#xa0;The first twelve days are spent undertaking induction and training, first at Westminster Kingsway College and subsequently with the BBC Academy.  They then undertake a series of three months attachments which could be in BBC Departments (for example Drama or Entertainment) or elsewhere in the sector (including ITV and independent production companies).  All participants are assigned an internal BBC mentor and a coach from Westminster Kingsway; they will receive one day a month of classroom training.  As they proceed through the programme they will produce evidence of competence which is examined by an assessor from the College.  They receive a Level three qualification after a final assessment process.&#xa0;The scheme is in its second year and Caroline Prendergast is pleased with progress. Another intake of 10 participants is planned for 2012.  Only one 2010 participant dropped out and this was early on and due to personal circumstances.  A further 2012 apprenticeship scheme has been launched by BBC Scotland and will start in September 2011.  These schemes complement the existing Level 2 creative and digital media apprenticeship which has been in place in Manchester since November 2007.  BBC Wales are also considering apprenticeships to help develop their local talent pool.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[In reviewing the scheme Caroline Prendergast emphasises that its success is a reflection of its business relevance: “We choose the production area very deliberately because this was where we needed more trained and capable staff”. It is evident that a great deal of professional HR effort has gone into the initial design and subsequent management of the scheme.  Caroline Prendergast also stresses the importance of getting the right relationship with the right College and being clear about roles and responsibilities at the outset.]]]  In hindsight she would front-load the training component; the longer the participants are on the scheme the more valuable a resource they are to host departments and it can be difficult for them to find time away from their day-to-day responsibilities.  Finally Caroline Prendergast emphasises the distinction between apprenticeships and work experience – the BBC has a number of the latter schemes in place.  In her view apprenticeships must be about serving the business through generating a cohort of staff who have the knowledge and skills that the organisation needs, whereas work experience, whilst valuable as an entry point to the organisation, does not equip the individual with a formal qualification or necessarily provide the necessary skills to gain employment.  It is simply about giving people exposure to the work environment.  The former is evidently much more difficult to get right.  &#xa0;&#xa0;Swarm Norfolk&#xa0;The development of an effective apprenticeship programme poses particular challenges in rural areas.  There are fewer large employers and those that do exist are mainly located in the centres of population (for example Norwich in Norfolk); smaller businesses predominate and their owners need to be convinced that employing young people will benefit the business, not require extensive resources, nor demand a huge amount of bureaucratic form-filling.  Travel-to-work distances can be long and many young people settle for low-paid, low-prospect work in the retail or hospitality industries – or simply give up altogether. &#xa0;‘Swarm’ is an innovative solution designed to create apprenticeship opportunities for young people against this background.  It was launched in March 2013 by Robert Ashton, a local social entrepreneur and business writer.   Robert Ashton is the author of a series of books including the best selling The Entrepreneur’s Book of Checklists.  He had previously chaired The Exchange, an independent County Council funded body that managed work experience schemes; he was also on the board of the Small Firms’ Enterprise Development Initiative (SFEDI).  His experience in those roles, together with 20 years as a small business adviser and consultant, convinced him that a new approach was required.  He was particularly critical of the way that Colleges appear to put the qualification first, the learner second and the needs of the employer lower down the list.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The concept underpinning Swarm is straightforward.  As originally formulated a ‘swarm’ of ten employers and ten learners/apprentices would be based round a Norfolk market town.  All the apprentices, (aged 16-24, with most over 18) would be employed by one of the ten businesses who would pay them at least the minimum wage for their age (not the lower apprenticeship rate).]]]  These apprentices would study for a Level 3 Diploma in Enterprising Skills in a Business Environment (QCF); Robert Ashton’s view is that positioning the initiative at this level important since “at Level 3 they actually have to learn something; at Level 2 they simply have to show they can do something.  It becomes a tick box exercise”.  Off-the- job training would be delivered by City College Norwich, ideally in the local market town.  The qualification would be achieved within 18 months. Where possible, employers would share experiences with the group as part of their taught sessions. This would keep the course relevant and ensure all apprentices consider other employers as well as their own. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[A critical element in the Swarm concept is that the small business employer should benefit in a clear measurable way.]]]  Accordingly the first stage involves the agreement of a simple business plan.  This sets out the business benefits and provides the framework for assessing and supporting the progress of the learner.  The intention is to put monthly action learner sessions in place for the employers to embrace their own learning. Their track will run in parallel with that of their apprentices.&#xa0;Norfolk County Council have given an initial grant to £50,000 to assist in the establishment of Swarm.  Further support has been provided by three housing associations, each sponsoring a Swarm. For them the incentive is to provision of additional support to NEET youngsters within the communities they serve. &#xa0;Inevitably, to get the initiative started, it has been necessary to compromise on some features of the desired model.  A first group of fourteen apprentices have been identified, found places and are about to start their formal jobs, training and learning.  Eleven of this group are from the mid-Norfolk Breckland area centred round the town of Watton, where the concept was first launched.  Of the remaining three, two are joining Norwich firms, willing to self-fund the Swarm support. The third is an early adopter in North Norfolk, valuable in promoting the opportunity to a group that will be based there.  Another initial group is being recruited in West Norfolk. Within a year it is expected that there will be 30-40 learners on the programme.&#xa0;There are a number of encouraging signs.  The employers in this Breckland Swarm are a diverse group and include a Management Consultancy, a Charity, a Florist, a White Goods Refurbisher and a Golf Course.  All but two of the initial group were NEETs or on Job Seekers Allowance. The two in work, were employed in low wage, temporary posts with no prospect of advancement. &#xa0;It is fair to say that Swarm has attracted a lot of support locally and interest nationally.  Robert Ashton was one of six people invited to make a formal pitch/presentation to Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, when he visited Norfolk in November 2013.  Robert Ashton draws a modest salary from the project, a pay-rate far lower than he earns from more lucrative conference speaking and consultancy. He is not primarily motivated by profit, but by a passion for helping young people create meaningful careers with local small businesses. He plans to grow the scheme both locally and nationally as a social franchise and is exploring this possibility with the School for Social Entrepreneurs.  

[[[He would also like to develop the capacity of the small business community to deliver the training themselves, eventually perhaps offering their own certification.  He finds the inflexibility of the Colleges and their funding motivated focus on ‘high volume/low level qualification’ (for example their insistence on fixed starting-dates) understandable but frustrating.]]]  &#xa0;15 November 2013&#xa0;
