defaultThank you for this enquiry and allowing some of us to make a submission.
default&#xa0;
defaultI write in a personal capacity a
defaults
default one who, with my wife, 
defaulthave
default constant contact with children through the church.
default&#xa0;
defaultSex is a very powerful force in 
defaultmany people`s lives.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen in it`s proper setting of raising children it is a good and right thing.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen out of it`s setting it is like fire out of control and does damage.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have personally been damaged by adult material although this was in an age befo
defaultre the advent of the internet. I have felt the effects of this damage throughout the rest of my life.
default&#xa0;
defaultToday the chances of children being damaged are enormous compared to years ago. I therefore fully agree with David Cameron , Michael Gove and others
default, tha
defaultt every possible effort should be made to get government, parents, internet providers, educators and charities to work together to provide all the protections necessary to safeguard them from the many different types of sexual corruption available online.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is surely a crime to shatter the innocence of children and young
default people.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a solemn piece on the last page of the Bible that speaks of those that love and make a lie.
default&#xa0;
defaultThose that 
defaultmake 
defaulta lie are those that set up and publish these damaging and 
defaultvile things.
default&#xa0;
defaultThose that 
defaultlove 
defaulta lie are those that
default delve into and watch them.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs responsible citizens
default,
default as many as possible need to do everything they can to address this massive problem.
default&#xa0;
defaultMay you all be helped in your 
defaultdeliberations.
