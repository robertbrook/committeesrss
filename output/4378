[normal]1. [bold]How will the £109 million be spent over CP5? What will go on upgrades, closures etc?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I provide further clarification of what we are expecting from Network Rail in the next control period below:  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]All three tables below come from the supporting information provided to ORR by Network Rail during the consultation period, illustrating the case for the additional investment sought by Network Rail. In the context of the determination where Network Rail will be expected to achieve maximum risk reduction, the company will keep the specific deliverables under review and the exact mix might have to flex to meet that.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The table below shows that some 550 of the highest risk level crossings could be closed for the funds available, broken down by average unit cost.

[normal]2.  Moreton-on-Lugg[bold] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal][Q81 onwards from the session] – We understand from the RAIB report that the level crossing order was in draft at the time of the accident. Was it subsequently approved by ORR on behalf of the Secretary of State? Could we have a copy of all orders relating to this crossing please?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We welcome 
[normal]the opportunity to 
[normal]provide 
[normal]the
[normal] Committee with further information i
[normal]n response to the allegations made by TSSA 
[normal]in their letter to the Committee
[normal]. We have not been disingenuous. 
[normal]I also provide further information about the approval of level crossing orders at Moreton-on-Lugg to
[normal] s
[normal]upport the Committee
[normal] 
[normal]in its inquiry into level crossing safety
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A level crossing order sets out in general terms how the crossing should be safely operated. 
[normal]I 
[normal]enclose
[normal] 
[normal]copies of the Level Crossing Order approved in 2013 which replaced and revoked the 1975 Order (as amended in 1976). 
[normal]I also attach the draft Orders at the time of the accident. 
[normal]ORR inspects the industry’s management of level crossings to check that legal safety requirements are being met. Where failings are found, immediate action is taken to ensure the crossing is made safe. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Network Rail requested a new updated 
[normal]draft 
[normal]Order in the light of amendments to the Level Crossings Act 1983 brought about by the Road Safety Act 2006, which allows duties on highways authorities to be specified. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At
[normal] the time of the accident,
[normal] this
[normal] 
[normal]draft
[normal] 
[normal]Order
[normal] 
[normal]contained no fundamental changes to the arrangements then in place under the 1975 Order. At the time of the accident, Network Rail did not comply with the obligations under the 
[normal]1975 
[normal]Order
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Paragraph 3 of the Th
[normal]ird schedule sets out
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“The barriers shall be kept in the raised position except during the time when engines, carriages or other vehicles passing along the railway have occasion to cross the road. The barriers shall be interlocked with the protecting railway signals”. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Crown Prosecution Service 
[normal](CPS) 
[normal]and British Transport Police
[normal] (BTP)
[normal] took the prosecutions of Network Rail and the signaller after the Moreton-on-Lugg accident
[normal] in
[normal] agreement with ORR.
[normal] 
[normal]In accordance with the 
[normal]‘
[normal]Work-related deaths protocol
[normal]’
[normal], t
[normal]he 
[normal]B
[normal]ritish 
[normal]T
[normal]ransport 
[normal]P
[normal]olice
[normal] led the investigation
[normal], with significant technical input from ORR, with a view to 
[normal]bringing manslaughter charges. D
[normal]uring a case conference between BTP, CPS, a leading QC and ORR, BTP were advised that the evidence didn't support manslaughter charges, and that Health and Safety at Work Act
[normal] 1974 (HSW Act)
[normal] charges were the best available
[normal] to bring a successful prosecution
[normal].  
[normal]ORR was willing and able to take on those cases, which in accordance with the Protocol
[normal] 
[normal]would normally revert to ORR for prosecution
[normal].  
[normal]However, w
[normal]e agreed
[normal] at the conference
[normal] that  CPS was better placed to proceed, as it had all the evidence ready and solicitors briefed, 
[normal]and 
[normal] 
[normal]therefore
[normal] to avoid delay and additional cost, CPS took 
[normal]forward the cases
[normal].
[normal] As an enforcing authority, ORR has brought forward a number of successful 
[normal]prosecutions
[normal] against 
[normal]Network Rail 
[normal]for breaches of health and safety law and I enclose a list of 
[normal]ORR enforcement against Network Rail’s controlled infrastructure since April 2006. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Network Rail failed to assess the risks and costs properly when they renewed equipment at Moreton-on-Lugg: we collected evidence of this, and would most certainly have p
[normal]rosecuted Network Rail for it. 
[normal]ORR su
[normal]bsequently pressed Network Rail to make safety improvements to both this crossing and those at a number of similar locations
[normal]. 
[normal]ORR's pressure obliged
[normal] Network Rail to retr
[normal]o-fit a version of approach locking at around 50 high-risk crossings across the country, which they would not 
[normal]necessarily 
[normal]have done without our intervention.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is nothing in the 1975 Order, which was in force at the time
[normal] of the accident
[normal], which prevented Network Rail from including an approach locking system and at no stage did ORR approve Network Rail’s decision not to fit approach locking system at Moreton-on-Lugg.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Level crossing orders do not usually specify details of the functions and interlocking of the equipment, however after the investigations had been completed Network Rail provided a new draft order, which included a 
[normal]more detailed 
[normal]specification for the requirements for approach locking.
[normal] 
[normal]The 2013 Order, which was approved by ORR on behalf of the Secretary of State, includes paragraph 18, which provides the explicit specification for an approach locking device.  
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]3. ORR staffing:[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We devote significant resources to level crossings work. We undertake level crossing work through technical expertise and inspections and investigations across the country.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have 86 warrant holding health and safety inspectors who all have received extensive training in level crossings. We have a team of inspectors who are dedicated to level crossing work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All of our inspectors have level crossing expertise. Skills are developed through both our in house competency management training and external training through Birmingham University’s School of Railway Engineering Integration Programme which includes specific technical based training on level crossings. Our in house training consists of theory and practical experience of level crossings which involves a large practical element. Our inspectors also undertake other technical engineering training provided by industry experts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Across ORR, we have 26 engineers 
[normal](22 of whom are inspectors
[normal]), and of these 7 have signalling engineering qualifications. 
[normal]All of our engineers have either IRSE and/or IET qualifications. (Institute of Engineering Technology, which is a broader qualification than IRSE.) 
[normal]Level crossing engineering expertise is not unique to one engineering discipline. It requires a multi discipline approach therefore we draw on experience from across the office to perform our safety functions. We also have access to other consulting 
[normal]and expert 
[normal]engineers to support our work.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4. Risk assessments[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]ALCRM is a risk ranking tool used by Network Rail that forms part of their risk assessment. It is not on its own a suitable and sufficient risk assessment. When Network Rail is renewing level crossings we require a suitable and sufficient risk assessment which includes both quantitative and qualitative risk assessments. We expect Network Rail will consider local factors in addition to ALCRM in producing risk assessments at level crossings. We are working with Network Rail who are developing a ‘narrative assessment’ to be used by level crossing managers to ensure that it is a suitable and sufficient risk assessment. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]It is for Network Rail to determine the number of crossings in the highest risk classification. Network Rail will provide more details in their draft delivery plan which will be published on 18 December 2013. The final delivery plan will be published on 31 March 2014. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Our Strategy is to strive for 
[normal]excellence
[normal] in risk management and control. We do not set a definition of generally acceptable, tolerable and unacceptable fatality probabilities.  We apply the Health and Safety Executive principles of tolerability of risk.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We hold the industry to account through our Health and Safety legislation to enforce against the legal test of reasonable practicability. We are mindful of changing risks. We have to consider safety against convenience to users through level crossing legislation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]W
[normal]e inspect the industry’s management of level crossings to check that safety standards are being met. Where failings are found, we have enforcement powers that we use to ensure the crossing is made safe and its management improved.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Network Rail uses the ‘level crossing indicator model’ to determine levels of risk reduction in the last control period. This model was verified by our risk assessment specialist who was satisfied with the robustness of the process used. Network Rail is proposing to use the same mode to determine levels of risk reduction for the next control period 2014-19 (CP5).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. Lidar[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We welcome the development in technology which makes railways safer, however it is for Network Rail as the duty holder to both develop this technology and to ensure that it is being used to manage the risk. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]LIDAR is the complementary obstacle detection system at manned controlled barrier with automatic obstacle detection 
[normal]crossings
[normal] (MCB-OD). This type of crossing has automatic full barriers and protecting signals. LIDAR and RADAR (the primary obstacle detection system) prevent trains passing over the crossing until the crossing has been checked and confirmed as being clear from obstacles. LIDAR uses lasers to detect objects and consists of an upper and lower LIDAR. The lower LIDAR scans the crossing at 150mm whilst the upper LIDAR scans at 600mm.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Network Rail has carried out an assessment to lower LIDAR
[normal] 
[normal]in line with their legal duties
[normal]. 
[normal] ORR are currently still evaluating Network Rail’s processes, risk assessments and research documents to evaluate their assumptions that at some level crossings lower LIDAR will not be necessary.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We recognise the concerns that have been raised about crossings with obstacle detection and are keeping them under review.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]Network Rail were fined for breaches of health and safety law which led to a 10 year old boy sustaining serious head injuries when the vehicle he was a passenger in was hit by a train on an unmanned level crossing near Beccles, Suffolk in 2010. The court heard the crossing did not have a phone in place so that people could check if trains were due. The train was travelling at 55mph (90km/h) when the vehicle was struck, throwing the boy from the vehicle where he sustained head injuries after landing on the track. ORR established that the crash was caused by poor visibility when people were crossing from the south side.

[normal]Network Rail had failed to properly consider the impact of the position of a building it had installed alongside New Barn level crossing. The building severely restricted visibility at the crossing, especially for those driving farm vehicles over the private level crossing, resulting in an increased risk of a train colliding with vehicles using the crossing.
