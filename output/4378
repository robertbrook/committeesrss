defaultI provide further clarification of what we are expecting from Network Rail in the next control period below:  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultAll three tables below come from the supporting information provided to ORR by Network Rail during the consultation period, illustrating the case for the additional investment sought by Network Rail. In the context of the determination where Network Rail will be expected to achieve maximum risk reduction, the company will keep the specific deliverables under review and the exact mix might have to flex to meet that.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe table below shows that some 550 of the highest risk level crossings could be closed for the funds available, broken down by average unit cost.

default&#xa0;
default[Q81 onwards from the session] – We understand from the RAIB report that the level crossing order was in draft at the time of the accident. Was it subsequently approved by ORR on behalf of the Secretary of State? Could we have a copy of all orders relating to this crossing please?default&#xa0;
defaultWe welcome 
defaultthe opportunity to 
defaultprovide 
defaultthe
default Committee with further information i
defaultn response to the allegations made by TSSA 
defaultin their letter to the Committee
default. We have not been disingenuous. 
defaultI also provide further information about the approval of level crossing orders at Moreton-on-Lugg to
default s
defaultupport the Committee
default 
defaultin its inquiry into level crossing safety
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultA level crossing order sets out in general terms how the crossing should be safely operated. 
defaultI 
defaultenclose
default 
defaultcopies of the Level Crossing Order approved in 2013 which replaced and revoked the 1975 Order (as amended in 1976). 
defaultI also attach the draft Orders at the time of the accident. 
defaultORR inspects the industry’s management of level crossings to check that legal safety requirements are being met. Where failings are found, immediate action is taken to ensure the crossing is made safe. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultNetwork Rail requested a new updated 
defaultdraft 
defaultOrder in the light of amendments to the Level Crossings Act 1983 brought about by the Road Safety Act 2006, which allows duties on highways authorities to be specified. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAt
default the time of the accident,
default this
default 
defaultdraft
default 
defaultOrder
default 
defaultcontained no fundamental changes to the arrangements then in place under the 1975 Order. At the time of the accident, Network Rail did not comply with the obligations under the 
default1975 
defaultOrder
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultParagraph 3 of the Th
defaultird schedule sets out
default:
default 
default&#xa0;
default“The barriers shall be kept in the raised position except during the time when engines, carriages or other vehicles passing along the railway have occasion to cross the road. The barriers shall be interlocked with the protecting railway signals”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Crown Prosecution Service 
default(CPS) 
defaultand British Transport Police
default (BTP)
default took the prosecutions of Network Rail and the signaller after the Moreton-on-Lugg accident
default in
default agreement with ORR.

default led the investigation
default, with significant technical input from ORR, with a view to

defaulturing a case conference between BTP, CPS, a leading QC and ORR, BTP were advised that the evidence didn't support manslaughter charges, and that Health and Safety at Work Act
default 1974 (HSW Act)
default charges were the best available
default to bring a successful prosecution
default.  
defaultORR was willing and able to take on those cases, which in accordance with the Protocol
default 
defaultwould normally revert to ORR for prosecution
default.  
defaultHowever, w
defaulte agreed
default at the conference
default that  CPS was better placed to proceed, as it had all the evidence ready and solicitors briefed, 
defaultand 
default 
defaulttherefore
default to avoid delay and additional cost, CPS took 
defaultforward the cases
default.
default As an enforcing authority, ORR has brought forward a number of successful 
defaultprosecutions
default against 
defaultNetwork Rail 
defaultfor breaches of health and safety law and I enclose a list of 
defaultORR enforcement against Network Rail’s controlled infrastructure since April 2006. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNetwork Rail failed to assess the risks and costs properly when they renewed equipment at Moreton-on-Lugg: we collected evidence of this, and would most certainly have p
defaultrosecuted Network Rail for it. 
defaultORR su
defaultbsequently pressed Network Rail to make safety improvements to both this crossing and those at a number of similar locations
default. 
defaultORR's pressure obliged
default Network Rail to retr
defaulto-fit a version of approach locking at around 50 high-risk crossings across the country, which they would not 
defaultnecessarily 
defaulthave done without our intervention.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is nothing in the 1975 Order, which was in force at the time
default of the accident
default, which prevented Network Rail from including an approach locking system and at no stage did ORR approve Network Rail’s decision not to fit approach locking system at Moreton-on-Lugg.  
default&#xa0;
defaultLevel crossing orders do not usually specify details of the functions and interlocking of the equipment, however after the investigations had been completed Network Rail provided a new draft order, which included a 
defaultmore detailed 
defaultspecification for the requirements for approach locking.
default 
defaultThe 2013 Order, which was approved by ORR on behalf of the Secretary of State, includes paragraph 18, which provides the explicit specification for an approach locking device.

default&#xa0;
default3. ORR staffing:default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultWe devote significant resources to level crossings work. We undertake level crossing work through technical expertise and inspections and investigations across the country.   
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have 86 warrant holding health and safety inspectors who all have received extensive training in level crossings. We have a team of inspectors who are dedicated to level crossing work. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAll of our inspectors have level crossing expertise. Skills are developed through both our in house competency management training and external training through Birmingham University’s School of Railway Engineering Integration Programme which includes specific technical based training on level crossings. Our in house training consists of theory and practical experience of level crossings which involves a large practical element. Our inspectors also undertake other technical engineering training provided by industry experts. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAcross ORR, we have 26 engineers 
default(22 of whom are inspectors
default), and of these 7 have signalling engineering qualifications. 
defaultAll of our engineers have either IRSE and/or IET qualifications. (Institute of Engineering Technology, which is a broader qualification than IRSE.) 
defaultLevel crossing engineering expertise is not unique to one engineering discipline. It requires a multi discipline approach therefore we draw on experience from across the office to perform our safety functions. We also have access to other consulting 
defaultand expert 
defaultengineers to support our work. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBreakdown of ORR staffdefault&#xa0;

default&#xa0;default4. Risk assessmentsdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultALCRM is a risk ranking tool used by Network Rail that forms part of their risk assessment. It is not on its own a suitable and sufficient risk assessment. When Network Rail is renewing level crossings we require a suitable and sufficient risk assessment which includes both quantitative and qualitative risk assessments. We expect Network Rail will consider local factors in addition to ALCRM in producing risk assessments at level crossings. We are working with Network Rail who are developing a ‘narrative assessment’ to be used by level crossing managers to ensure that it is a suitable and sufficient risk assessment. 
default&#xa0;defaultIt is for Network Rail to determine the number of crossings in the highest risk classification. Network Rail will provide more details in their draft delivery plan which will be published on 18 December 2013. The final delivery plan will be published on 31 March 2014. 
default&#xa0;defaultOur Strategy is to strive for 
defaultexcellence
default in risk management and control. We do not set a definition of generally acceptable, tolerable and unacceptable fatality probabilities.  We apply the Health and Safety Executive principles of tolerability of risk.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe hold the industry to account through our Health and Safety legislation to enforce against the legal test of reasonable practicability. We are mindful of changing risks. We have to consider safety against convenience to users through level crossing legislation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultW
defaulte inspect the industry’s management of level crossings to check that safety standards are being met. Where failings are found, we have enforcement powers that we use to ensure the crossing is made safe and its management improved.  
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultNetwork Rail uses the ‘level crossing indicator model’ to determine levels of risk reduction in the last control period. This model was verified by our risk assessment specialist who was satisfied with the robustness of the process used. Network Rail is proposing to use the same mode to determine levels of risk reduction for the next control period 2014-19 (CP5).  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5. Lidardefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultWe welcome the development in technology which makes railways safer, however it is for Network Rail as the duty holder to both develop this technology and to ensure that it is being used to manage the risk. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLIDAR is the complementary obstacle detection system at manned controlled barrier with automatic obstacle detection 
defaultcrossings
default (MCB-OD). This type of crossing has automatic full barriers and protecting signals. LIDAR and RADAR (the primary obstacle detection system) prevent trains passing over the crossing until the crossing has been checked and confirmed as being clear from obstacles. LIDAR uses lasers to detect objects and consists of an upper and lower LIDAR. The lower LIDAR scans the crossing at 150mm whilst the upper LIDAR scans at 600mm.
default&#xa0;
defaultNetwork Rail has carried out an assessment to lower LIDAR
default 
defaultin line with their legal duties
default. 
default ORR are currently still evaluating Network Rail’s processes, risk assessments and research documents to evaluate their assumptions that at some level crossings lower LIDAR will not be necessary.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe recognise the concerns that have been raised about crossings with obstacle detection and are keeping them under review.
default&#xa0;
defaultYours sincerely

defaultNetwork Rail were fined for breaches of health and safety law which led to a 10 year old boy sustaining serious head injuries when the vehicle he was a passenger in was hit by a train on an unmanned level crossing near Beccles, Suffolk in 2010. The court heard the crossing did not have a phone in place so that people could check if trains were due. The train was travelling at 55mph (90km/h) when the vehicle was struck, throwing the boy from the vehicle where he sustained head injuries after landing on the track. ORR established that the crash was caused by poor visibility when people were crossing from the south side.

defaultNetwork Rail had failed to properly consider the impact of the position of a building it had installed alongside New Barn level crossing. The building severely restricted visibility at the crossing, especially for those driving farm vehicles over the private level crossing, resulting in an increased risk of a train colliding with vehicles using the crossing.
