"&#xa0;\nEvidence submitted by Wild Futures\n&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe extent of the trade and keeping of primates as pets within the UK&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDoes the existing regulatory framework and Code of Practice offer adequate protection for the welfare of primates kept as pets and is it being applied effectively?&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase 1\n&#xa0;\nCase 2\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase 3\n&#xa0;\nCase 4\n“\nAn authorised veterinary practitioner would have originally accompanied the inspecting officer at the first visit to grant the licence, but as the licence was firs\nt issued well over 10 years ago we no longer hold any paperwork relating to the report he would have submitted following his visit.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nSection 1 (5) of the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 states that \n“\na local authority shall not grant a licence under this\n Act unless a veterinary surgeon or veterinary practitioner authorised by the authority to do so under section 3 of this Act has inspected the premises...  and the authority has received and considered a report by the surgeon or practitioner, containing su\nch particulars as in the authority’s opinion enable it to decide whether the premises are such that any animal proposed to be kept under the authority of the licence may suitably be held there, and describing the condition of the premises and of any animal\n or thing found there.”\nLicences are not “renewed” under the DWAA; new licences must be applied for every two years.  A veterinary inspection is required by law upon each application. Canterbury failed to fulfil this obligation for, in their words, “well o\nver ten years”, instead relying on the judgement of their own inspector as to whether further assessment was required. Canterbury stated: “\nWe would also request a veterinary practitioner visit if we identified any concerns during subsequent renewal visits”\n, \nyet even with the apparent passing of one of a pair of monkeys, leaving the remaining monkey without the company of any \nconspecific\n (a contravention of the requirements set out in the Code), no such concerns seem to have been identified.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nShould people be allowed to keep primates as pets and if not, how might a ban be implemented?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014 \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nReferences&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nEARS. \nEuropean Alliance of Rescue Centres and Sanctuaries. at &lt;www.ears-eu.org&gt;\n2.\n              \nGFAS.
