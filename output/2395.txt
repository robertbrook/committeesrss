This experience suggests that the cumulative effects of the recent reforms to housing cost support are significant for many and very significant for some. Particularly we are concerned that the effects on those at risk of homelessness, as well as those trying to rebuild their lives after a spell of homelessness, have not received sufficient consideration. The lack of clarity surrounding the support that will be available to more vulnerable individuals and families under Universal Credit adds to our concern in this area. We would like to see the Government provide much clearer guidance on how it plans to support those affected by these changes and how this support will be funded.

[[[About The Salvation Army]]]&#xa0;1.  The Salvation Army is a Christian church and charity present in 700 communities in the UK.  Its main areas of charitable work are:&#xa0;&#xa0;2.  Within Homelessness Services, The Salvation Army primarily provides short-term hostels for single homeless people. Virtually all the accommodation we own or manage meets the definition of “hostel” as defined under the current housing benefit regulations. In addition, we offer a number of self-contained resettlement flats, which also fall under the definition of supported exempt accommodation.&#xa0;&#xa0;3.  The SA is not a registered provider of social housing, though we manage a number of hostels on behalf of registered providers carrying out housing management functions, and acting as landlord’s agent for rent collection. We provide:&#xa0;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; over 2,800 hostel bedspaces per night;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 42 hostels managed in partnership with a housing association (as social rented supported housing);•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 20 hostels directly managed (as private supported housing).&#xa0;4.  Drawing on its Christian beliefs, The Salvation Army adopts a holistic approach to service provision.  As appropriate it works with people to ensure:&#xa0;&#xa0;Where we cannot deliver these things ourselves we work with others.  Our service users have access to chaplaincy or pastoral care which they can engage with if they wish.&#xa0;

[[[Our overall reaction to ]]]

[[[the inquiry into ]]]

[[[support for housing cost in the reformed welfare system]]]&#xa0;5.  We are a member of Homeless Link and endorse the points they are making in their submission to this inquiry. We are not in a position to comment in detail on every reform highlighted within this inquiry, but will instead focus on the overall impact of these changes on the individuals and families we seek to serve.&#xa0;

[[[Implications of the changes for vulnerable groups in general and people with a history of homelessness in particular]]]&#xa0;6.  While we appreciate the rationale behind some of the changes to housing cost support, we feel that the cumulative effects of the Local Housing Allowance reforms, the household benefit cap, the social sector size criteria and the localisation of council tax support, together with the shortage of social housing in many areas, create real threats to the housing security of vulnerable individuals and families. We have seen an anecdotal rise in people coming to us for help with housing issues in our Community Services. We are also seeing the first signs that welfare reforms are playing a contribution role in causing families and individuals to lose their tenancy. &#xa0;7.  In this context we would like to urge the Government to provide clear guidance on the status of those who lose their home as a direct or indirect result of the social sector size criteria, the household benefit cap or an inability to cope with one monthly payment including housing cost. Particularly will these individuals and household be considered intentionally homeless with the resulting implications in terms of their entitlements?8.  With a specific reference to people with a history of homelessness, we are concerned that the recent reforms will greatly limit the move-on options of our residents. Many of our residents come to us with a range of barriers and behaviours that make it difficult for them to successfully maintain a tenancy. While we work hard to help them overcome these issues during their time with us, we feel than many would greatly benefit from the security offered by social housing when they are ready to take their first step back into the regular housing system. Already we are finding that many of our residents are not offered social housing option within a reasonable timeframe, forcing them to choose less secure private tenancy options instead. We fear that the recent reforms will worsen this situation.&#xa0;9.  Whilst homeless people have previously been a priority group for social housing, the localisation agenda means that eligibility decisions in social housing allocations and service provision are now the remit of local government. At best this will create a postcode lottery. At worse it can lead to a ‘race to the bottom’, particularly in large cities like London where local authorities perhaps rightfully fear that offering a more favourable regime than others may attract people from neighbouring boroughs. As a result, local authorities that do decide to maintain priority need for people with a history of homelessness have an incentive to insist on a strong and verifiable local connection. Many of our residents may either not have that connection or struggle to provide proof of it, particularly if they have been sleeping rough.&#xa0;10.  The same problem of lack of documentation can lead to unintended consequences under the reformed Local Housing Allowance. The change to Local Housing Allowance last year means that most single people under 35 are only eligible for shared accommodation. Whilst those with a history of homelessness are eligible for an exemption, they are required to provide evidence of hostel stays. However, as homeless people are transient they often carry no paperwork and cannot prove this. In addition, we have anecdotal evidence that some Local Authorities are advising hostels not to provide proof of stay if the resident is in arrears at the time when they leave the service.&#xa0;11.  Finally the social sector size criteria in our view do not take into consideration the needs of people with a history of homelessness to a sufficient extent. Of those residents that move on to non-supported accommodation after their stay with us, a large share move in with family and friends. If the social sector size criteria have the intended effect, friends and family living in social housing may no longer be able to accommodate former homeless people. Simultaneously down-sizing in response to the new criteria would increase competition for the one-bedroom flats our residents would be entitled to, based on their history of homelessness, further decreasing the number of secure move on options available to them.&#xa0;12.  In order to overcome these issues, the Salvation Army would like to see continued priority allocation and less stringent rules on local connection for people with a history of homelessness. In addition we would like to urge the Government to seriously consider the unintended effects of the social sector size criteria on people with a history of homelessness and other vulnerable young adults and households.

[[[Treatment of housing cost within ]]]

[[[Universal Credit]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]13.  Both in community settings and our government-contracted work with unemployed and homeless people we find that many lack the budgeting skills and access to financial products needed to manage their money successfully. For some switching from a weekly to a fortnightly payment of benefits is already proving difficult, even if housing costs go directly to the landlord. As a result we worry that, without the proper support, the switch to one monthly payment per household including housing costs will drive many individuals and families on low income (further) into debt and dependency.&#xa0;14.  The Salvation Army welcomes the Government’s intention to make budgeting support and alternative payment arrangements available to those who need it, but would like to see much clearer guidance on how this system will work in practice. Particularly we would like to receive reassurances that those who fear they will not be able to cope will be offered the appropriate support before they fall into debt. Repaying even relatively modest debts can be crippling for those on low income, particularly if they do not have access to the more affordable forms of credit and need to rely on payday loans or loan sharks. As a result we would like to see a system that is focussed on prevention rather than just intervening when a set arrears threshold has been reached. In addition we are concerned about the lack of clarity on how the proposed Local Support Services Frameworks will be organised and funded in practice.&#xa0;15. With particular reference to homelessness services, we welcome the decision to continue to pay the housing costs of those in supported exempt accommodation directly to the landlord. Exempt accommodation status is crucial to residents and homelessness service providers alike, as we already have to absorb significant arrears in service payments under the present system. However, we are concerned about the ability of our residents to manage one monthly payment including housing costs once they move on to other accommodation. Again more clarity about the alternative payment arrangements and support that will be available to those with a history of homelessness would be useful here.&#xa0;16. Overall we support the philosophy behind Universal Credit, but would like to see a clearer acknowledgement that not all will be ready to take on the responsibility of managing a monthly household budget including housing costs from the start. Many will need extensive support in the early days and some may require longer term arrangements to help them cope.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;27 September 20131&#xa0;&#xa0;
