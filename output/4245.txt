[[[Keep Britain Tidy]]]Keep Britain Tidy is an independent environmental charity, which campaigns for people’s right to live and work in a place of which they can be proud. A single truth underpins our success – caring for the environment is the first step to a better society. &#xa0;Sixty years ago, we started with litter. Today we do much more. We run the world’s largest environmental education programme for about five million English students. About 1,300 parks fly our Green Flag. Clean, safe beaches fly the Blue Flag. Our Waste Watch programme helps communities conserve resources. And we work with local authorities and land managers across the country to cut costs and share what works. &#xa0;Keep Britain Tidy is also a founding member of the Break the Bag Habit coalition that includes The Campaign to Protect Rural England, Keep Britain Tidy, Surfers Against Sewage, Thames 21 and Greener upon Thames. The coalition has been campaigning for a charge on all single use carrier bags.
