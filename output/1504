default&#xa0;
default1. Is the UK glodefaultbally competitive and attractive to potential investors?default&#xa0;default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultcurrent 
defaultsuccess of UK industry is largely based on significant 
defaultprevious 
defaultinvestment
defaults
default in 
defaultinnovation
default. 
defaultThroughout
default 
defaultthe past century, ground-breaking research has been exploited by UK industry
default:
default pulled
default through from 
defaultearly development phases to 
defaultmanufacturing
default.
default. This has 
defaultenabled UK industry to compete as one of the leading players in a global technology race.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultO
defaultver the past two decades, 
defaulthowever, ADS believes that 
defaultthe UK’s competitive advantage 
defaultin innovation 
defaulthas been 
defaultgradually 
defaulteroded
default.
default Although the recent industrial strategies are helping to close this competitiveness gap, the UK still lags behind the strategic focus and efficiency of others innovation policies
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultR
defaultesearch by 
defaultNesta
default suggests that th
defaulte UK has been under-investing in innovation by over £38bn each year.
default 
defaultIn addition, business investment remains 25% below pre-recession levels. 
defaultPart of the problem is that
default 
defaultt
defaulthe recent, and indeed needed, focus on industrial strategies
default is
default not being supported 
defaultby 
defaultthe UK’
defaults tax, skills and immigration 
defaultregime
defaults 
defaultthat 
defaultare globally uncompetitive 
defaultfor investment in R&amp;D and technology. 
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn support for innovation, 
defaultthe UK is 
defaultcurrently 
default14
defaultth
default in the OECD and G20 for tax support for R&amp;D, 28
defaultth
default for tax support for innovative machinery and 41
defaultst
default for support for new manufacturing facilities
default,
default which as discussed later, are an inseparable part of the high-value manufacturing innovation process. 
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn terms of engineering skills, the UK ranks 24
defaultth
default in t
defaulthe OECD for engineers as a percentage of all graduates. This leaves the UK facing shortage of almost 60,000 
defaultgraduate 
defaultengineers each year.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNor have successive government
defaults
default’
default policies on immigration recognised the importance of highly-skilled immigra
defaulttion to
default the UK and the negative-
defaultimpact
default of excluding skilled workers from our economy. Currently, almost 30% of all engineering graduates are from outside the UK, and current policies and rhetoric on immigration make it difficult for these much needed skills to re
defaultmain
default in
default the UK after graduation.
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK’s existing funding for R&amp;D, in particular in the science and research base, is also fragmented, reducing the impact of otherwise high-
defaultquality rese
defaulta
defaultr
defaultch. 
defaultFor example, b
defaultoth UK industry and other researchers have limite
defaultd visibility of research taking place at UK universities and certainly no overall picture of research taking place 
defaultwithin industry
default, valuable to their own technological aims. This lack of visibility also prevents industry from accessing and exploiting the w
defaultorld-class research taking place on its doorstep.
default&#xa0;
default1.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMoreover, inaccessible research will cause valuable investment from UK businesses in the development stage to go abroad. Potential UK investment is instead often invested in research taking place at foreig
defaultn research hubs, taking with it jobs (including highly-skilled, high gross value added (GVA) employment). This would weaken the UK’s skills base and, furthermore, reduce investment opportunities for further research in the UK. Lack of access to research ha
defaults a knock-on effect, curtailing investment in UK capability and potentially damaging the next generation of research and skills.
default&#xa0;
default1.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGrowth Partnerships between industry and government, such as the successful Aerospace Growth Partnership (AGP), are working to
default improve this situation. Long-term, focussed government commitments to research infrastructure funding will encourage industry co-investment. Industry business plans work to ten years ahead and it is vital that government funding can transcend electoral cy
defaultcles and match these timescales to give industry the confidence to co-invest. Cross party support for industrial strategies and growth partnerships such as the AGP, Defence Growth Partnership (DGP) and Security and Resilience Growth Partnership (SRGP), is 
defaultessential for industry to ensure its long-term investment decisions are safeguarded from changes in political priorities
default&#xa0;
default1.10
default 
defaultAs Western countries place a greater emphasis on high-tech, advanced manufacturing, the UK will be at a disadvantage to countries 
defaultwhose research infrastructure is more integrated such as the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and the French ONERA. As centres of excellence at critical mass of research infrastructure, the DLR and ONERA are better able to attract global industrial investment
default and leverage additional EU funding.
default&#xa0;
default1.11
default 
defaultThis focus on generating critical mass in existing R&amp;D funding must also be supported by step-change improvements in wider innovation policy landscape, including the corporate tax regime and an innovation friendly skil
defaultls pipeline. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2. Does the UK’s innovation policy place sufficient focus on applied R&amp;D and exploitation?default&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUK innovation policy under successive Governments has not fully recognised the different R&amp;D models under which the UK’s high tech industries 
defaultoperate. This has led to funding streams generally following the R&amp;D model required by the pharmaceutical industry – one that has a proportionally large investment in research – over the model required by the engineering industries – with a proportionally 
defaultlarge investment in development. The imbalance of annual 
defaultfunding between Research Councils – c.£3bn – and the Technology Strategy Board
default (TSB)
default – under £400m – demonstrates this.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs 
defaultdepicted
default in Figure 1 below, the focus on research in the pharmaceutical ind
defaultustry is far great
defaulter than the developmental stage. In contrast, the innovation model in 
defaultindustrie
defaults such as aerospace or defence 
defaultrequire
defaults
default a much 
defaultfar 
defaultgreater investment in 
defaultthe design and 
defaultdevelopment
default phases
default. Unlike the pharmaceutical R&amp;D model, the aerospace 
defaultand defence industries rely on large scale demonstrators for the development of their products, taking
default laboratory research through costly technology development and manufacturing 
defaultdevelopment phases. 
defaultLikewise, as the equipment being produced through the eng
defaultineering R&amp;D model is safety critical, demonstrators are vital in testing components both individually and connected, throu
defaultghout the manufacturing process.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 7-8
default time
default greater Government funding for Research Councils relative to the TSB means that the UK
default government
default limited
default R&amp;D grants and funding are far more likely to support research-intensive innovation and provide insufficient support to industries with development-intensive innovation models.
default&#xa0;
defaultFigure 1 – R&amp;D models differ by sectordefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis bias towards research-intensive R&amp;D processes is reinforced by the UK’s corporate tax regime. As noted above, the UK is not globally competitive in-terms of supporting R&amp;D and capital investment through the tax regime.  Incentives that do exist within
default the regime, in particular the new Patent Box, also have an in-built bias towards certain types of innovation models. By providing a discounted corporate tax rate on income generated from patents, the Patent Box provides benefits to products with low-techn
defaultological complexity and shallow innovation supply-chains (albeit with high scientific and research complexity). 
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor example, once a drug has been proven, it is relatively easy to patent and produce, and so to identify 
defaultincome 
defaultgenerated from a patent for t
defaultax purposes. It is far more complicated to identify the income generated from a patented technology embedded within an engine or aircraft. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3. Is there a sufficient level of funding for R&amp;D in the UK?default&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs highlighted in the NAO report ‘Research and Devel
defaultopment funding for science and technology in the UK’, the UK has had a consistently low percentage of GDP spent on R&amp;D over the last 20 years, considerably lower than most rival nation competitors in the industries ADS represents.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs shown in Figure 2 below, since the recession, the UK has fallen behind key OECD competitors in terms of Government spending on all R&amp;D across the economy and has in fact reduced R&amp;D spending as a proportion of GDP since 2007. 
defaultThis has left the UK at default21defaultsdefaulttdefault defaultin the OECD for Government spending and support on all R&amp;D programmes.default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFigure 2 – Government Budget Appropriations and Outlays on R&amp;D, defaultweighted by size of the economy, 2007=100
defaultSource: 
defaultNesta
default and OECD
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultConsequently, the
default UK still has a long way to go to reach the Europe 2020 target of 
default3%
default of GDP spent on R&amp;D, as also raised in the NAO report.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBy removing capital spend from the ring-fenced science budget, the infrastructure at which research takes place is also threatened.
default Laboratory based teaching is far more expensive than the classroom-based equivalent and with falling capital spending; science infrastructure is an easy target for universities looking to save money.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSMEs often face prohibitive costs to use test faciliti
defaultes for the purpose of trialling, experimenting and developing their innovative technology in real-life environments. The lack of funding spent on development in comparison to research further hinders progress in the engineering sectors 
defaultADS represents where
default the R&amp;D model they are operating under requires far greater funding for development than initial research.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 1.2
default%
default minimum spend on Science and Technology (S&amp;T) in the defence budget set by the Government in the National Security through Technology Whit
defaulte Paper in February 2012 will halt the spiralling decrease in the defence S&amp;T budget over the past two decades. It is important that this figure is not treated as a target but is built upon to increase the spend on S&amp;T and ensure the UK is not left behind 
defaultby other nations investing more in the development of future equipment. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4. Is there an efficient funding process for R&amp;D in the UK?default&#xa0;
default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDespite the advantages afforded to UK manufacturing in the past through the competitive research system under the Haldan
defaulte Principle, the fragmented funding streams through which universities apply do not provide sufficient critical mass and are unaligned to the UK’s new Growth Partnerships. Due to such localised decision making, research is taking place at a sub-critical le
defaultvel across many universities, with many institutions’ research priorities overlapping.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIndividual, localised research proposals from UK universities are often effective at attaining EU funding; however, further external investment into 
defaultstovepiped
default research programmes reinforces the UK’s fragmented research capability. A failure to act with on
defaulte voice through central research hubs leaves the UK unable to leverage and spend EU funding as effectively as possible. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs funding is spread too thinly, the UK risks duplicating funding on research and weakening research outcomes that could have been con
defaultsiderably strengthened through aggregated funding, from a large number of low-funded programmes to a select, well-funded development-focussed few. Duplicated research further serves to hamper exploitation and will miss opportunities to attract global inves
defaulttment.
