[[[Written evidence submitted by the International Labour Organization]]]People with disabilities make up around 15 per cent of the global population – over 1 billion people – and thus form a significant minority group with great potential to contribute to the development of their communities and society. Yet many of those of working age (at least 780 million people) are prevented from making this contribution due to physical, social, economic and cultural barriers that hinder their access to education, skills development, employment, health services and society more broadly on an equal basis with others. While reliable, comparable data on the labour market participation of people with disabilities is not widely available, common patterns are reported in countries at different levels of development. Compared to non-disabled persons, people with disabilities are less likely to be in full-time employment; more likely to be unemployed; and significantly more likely to be economically inactive. In developing countries, they are more likely to work in the informal economy.  When in employment, workers with disabilities are more likely to count among the working poor, as they are frequently in low-paid jobs with poor career prospects and working conditions. Disabled women are less likely to have a decent job than either non-disabled women or men with disabilities, and people with certain types of disability – such as intellectual and mental health disabilities face greater difficulties in finding and retaining employment.  These patterns reflect a serious waste of human resources that could be tapped to contribute to development at local, regional and national levels, if adequate measures were taken. The exclusion of people with disabilities from the world of work and their location at the margins of society in many countries has high macro-economic costs.Accordingly, investments in more effective strategies for the inclusion of persons with disabilities can yield large economic returns to society. For example, in Australia, a cumulative AUD 43 billion (about GBP 24 billion) increase in Gross Domestic Product over the next decade is predicted if the gaps between the unemployment and labour force participation of people with and without disabilities are reduced by one third.A recently published ILO study found that the annual loss of Gross Domestic Product attributed to the exclusion of persons with disabilities from employment opportunities ranged from 3 to 7 per cent in ten selected Asian and African countries. Building on previous research, this study developed a new approach that takes two drivers of economic losses into account: Firstly, the gap between the potential and the actual productivity of people with disabilities; This is essential to indicate that people with disabilities are less productive not because they are “disabled” but because they live and work in environments that are “disabling”. The second driver that is taken into account is the difference between unemployment and inactivity rates of non-disabled people and people with disabilities. Together, these drivers yield the costs that society has to bear for excluding people with disabilities from the world of work.&#xa0;

The key elements of a rights-based approach – equality of opportunity, equal treatment and non-discrimination – are contained in ILO Conventions concerning employment in general and persons with disabilities in particular. Chief among the standards used by the ILO to promote the rights and opportunities of disabled persons are the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958 (No. 111), the Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100), and the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Disabled Persons) Convention, 1983 (No. 159), as well as the ILO Code of Practice on Managing Disability in the Workplace of 2002.In November 2012, the ILO Governing Body welcomed the commitment to include people with disabilities in all areas of work of the ILO through a Disability Inclusion Initiative.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0; Deloitte (2011) The economic benefits of increasing employment for people with disability, Deloitte Access Economics (available online at: http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-Australia/Local%20Assets/Documents/Industries/LSHC/Deloitte_DAE_Report_8May2012.pdf)
