[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]The Royal Society[bold] (RaD0013)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Royal Society has read with interest the recent report commissioned by the Science and Technology Committee from the National Audit Office. The Society was very happy to discuss this report with the NAO as they were preparing it, and are pleased to see it now in publication.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The NAO report provides a useful refresh to data and observations that the Society has itself used in its analysis of the UK research landscape, particularly in our 2010 report, 
[normal]The Scientific Century
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In that report, the Royal Society recommended that the UK should prioritise investment in ‘scientific capital’ – infrastructure, skills and people - with a view to ensuring that the UK ‘remain at the vanguard of international science.’ More recently the Royal Society has worked with the other UK National Academies to reiterate the importance of a long term strategy and investment framework for research and innovation in the UK in our recent joint statement 
[normal]Fuelling Prosperity
[normal].
[normal] This would further strengthen the UK’s globally strong position in research and allow us to reap the benefits of research for the economy and society.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The NAO report offers an overview of the variety of sources of funding for UK research (particularly figures 2, 5 and 6). This diversity of funding provides underpinning strength to UK research, with the streams of public, business, philanthropic and overseas funding complementing each other rather than necessarily overlapping. The Royal Society would be interested to see an in-depth analysis of the interplay between these funding streams, and the levels of funding that is levered between sectors.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Other key issues which are particularly striking in the report, and that the Royal Society is also interested in include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If the UK is to capitalise on its demonstrably excellent research base, it is vital that we understand both the funding and policy landscapes not only in the UK, but also those of our closest competitors. The Royal Society would be keen to discuss any of the points emerging from this report, or other issues relating to the health of the UK research base with you and your Committee. We look forward to working closely with you, and offering any assistance that we can.
