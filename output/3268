defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultRecommendations suggested in Committee’s report and in report by Thomas et al. will not ensure the LGO meets the 5 key criteria laid down by the defaultBritish and Irish Ombudsman Association especiallydefault fairnessdefault&#xa0;
default1.1 I write in my personal capacity as someone who has had personal dealings with the
default Local Government
default Ombudsman 
default(L
defaultG
defaultO) 
defaultintermittently 
defaultsince 1994 and 
defaulthad knowledge 
defaultof campaigns such as Local Government 
defaultOmbudsman 
defaultWatch (LGOWatch) which show that t
defaulthe problems that I experienced obtaining redress via the Ombudsman 
defaulta
defaultre widespread.  
default&#xa0;
default1.2 
defaultThe 
defaultSelect 
defaultCommittee’s 
default(CLG) 
defaultreport of July 2012 considered the handling of evidence and 
defaultat 
defaultparagraph 67 recommended that 
defaultin 
defaultthose cases involving serious service fai
defaultlure
default 
defaultthe LGO's processes should be brought into line with judicial procedures such as full dis
defaultclosure of all submissions
default.  Dr Martin saw her role as making findings and recommendations of remedy based on the evidence and facts.
default&#xa0;
default1.3 
defaultThe external evaluation of the LGO by Thomas et al. 2013 at 
defaultR
defaultecommendation 9 suggests that 
defaultthere should be an independent reviewer of the service given by the LGO.  This would presumably ensure that the investigators follow the service guidelines.
default  
defaultHowever
default, t
defaulthis would do nothing to improve the quality of the evidence supplied by Local Authorities
default (LA)
default to the LGO in response to a complaint
default.  
default&#xa0;
default1.4 T
defaulthe CLG
default believe
defaults
default that the appointment of an external reviewer will ensure that the LGO 
defaultwill 
defaultmeet the 
default5 key 
defaultcrite
defaultria of independence, fairness, effectiveness, openness and transparency and accountability.  Given that the role of the external reviewer would be solely related to service and not to the
default quality of the investigation
default, I do not believe this will improve the
default outcome for a significant number of complainants 
defaultwhose complaints 
defaultfail 
defaultas a result of the LGO relying on unproven misinformation supplied by 
defaultLAs.
default&#xa0;
default1.5 I have 
defaultalways employed 
defaultsolicitors to ass
defaultist me 
defaultand 
defaultsupplied the LGO with background evidence
default,
default usually LA
default documents
default,
default to support my complaints.  I believe that the LGO has always disclosed to me all the submissions from the LA.  However, it has been my experience that the LG
defaultO accepts the evidence from the
default 
defaultLA as being fact 
defaultdespite there being no evidence that the LA had investigated my complaint thoroughly (or possibly even at all) by interviewing or writing to the individual officers involved.  It does not seem fair that 
defaultthe LGO
default 
defaultcan 
defaultdismiss
default a complainant’s evidence 
defaultand acce
defaultpt that of a LA if the LA has not considered the complaint internally.
default  In my case, the LA mislead the LGO over a number of years and when evidence came to light which proved my point beyond any doubt, the LA was told it did not need to investigate that co
defaultmplaint because it had already done so in the earlier complaints.  This missed the crucial point that the previous investigations (if they 
defaulttook place
default)
default must have 
defaultbeen
default 
defaultflawed
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.6 I accessed the 
defaultGuidance on Investigations used by the LGO investigators and 
defaultthe investigators had followed procedures therefore an external reviewer would not have been able to assist me had he/she been in post.
default  
default&#xa0;
default1.7 Dr Martin states in her letter of 1 October 2013 to Mr Betts that 
default“
defaultwe will always share our provisional view on a
default complaint that we investigate, and take comments from both parties, before making a final decision.
default”
default  That procedure took place with my complaint but the LGO accepted the LA
default’
defaults version of events without background evidence or visiting the Council to view f
defaultil
defaultes/interview relevant personnel and so the course of action suggested by Dr Martin is not new in my experience and so will not make a difference when the LGO is intent on accepting the word of the LA.
default&#xa0;
default1.8 It is my belief from 
defaultinformation that 
defaultI have 
defaultreceived from
default the LA
default,
default 
defaultthat 
defaultthe 
defaultofficers concerned were not asked to respond to my complaints and that the LA’s
default response to the LGO was based on what can best be described as ‘wishful thinking’.  The fact that the information provided by the Chief Executive
default is in conflict with the advice given by the 
defaultLegal Services M
defaultanager (and acted upon by other officers
default to my detriment) is not denied by the LA
default’
defaults Monitoring Officer.  There is no committee within the LA that has the power to require any of these senior offi
defaultcers to investigate the conflict and act in the public interest to 
defaultprevent repeat maladministration.
default 
default 
defaultR
defaultecommendations
default on how to prevent a recurrence and how to fill this serious gap in the Council
default’
defaults procedures would have been two obvious results of the com
defaultpla
defaulti
defaultnt having been properly investigated.
default&#xa0;
default1.
default9
default The LGO appears unable to employ the highly specialised personnel required to unpick complex cases of maladministration in speci
defaultalist areas 
defaultwhich include planning and not just social care.
default&#xa0;
default1.
default10
default 
defaultThe inability 
defaultof the LGO to remedy the maladministration has caused me to ask my MP for assistance.  As yet, he has been unable to
default provide me with
default 
defaultadvice as to how the injustice to me can be resolved 
defaultwhere the LGO fails in its investigation 
defaultor to
default ask the LA to resolve t
defaulthe conflict in order to prevent a recurrence of the 
defaultmaladministration
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultPossible Solutions to defaultensure defaultfairnessdefault&#xa0;default2.1
default My
default complaint relate
defaultd
default to 
defaultvery complex 
defaultmatters which initially taxed my own legal advisers even though they were familiar with the issues.  I believe that the LGO should 
defaultuse 
defaultonly experienced specialist investigators 
defaultfor
default such complaints so that complainants 
defaulthave a fair chance of redress
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default 
defaultIt
default should be cost neutral for the
default LGO 
defaultto 
defaultrequire LAs to append transcripts of interviews and written responses from o
defaultfficers
default 
defaultincluded in the LA investigation
default 
defaultto the response sent by
default the 
defaultLA
default’
defaults 
defaultChief Executive to the
default LGO
default.
default  This would show whether 
defaultthe 
defaultChief Exec
defaultutive has 
defaultcarried out a 
defaultproper 
defaultinvestigat
defaultion into the
default complaint or just refuted the complaint in isolation from
default the facts
default.
default  Time spent reading the extra documents 
defaultwould be time well spent 
defaultbecause 
defaultsome LAs
default would admit
default their faults at an earlier stage withou
defaultt need for detailed investigation by the LGO and this in turn would lead to 
defaultfewer dissatisfied complainants as
defaultking for reviews of their cases.  
default&#xa0;
default2.4 Consideration could be given to applying 
defaultfinancial 
defaultpenalties to LAs which fail to investigate complaints p
defaultroperly or 
defaultwhich 
defaultprovide what Dr Martin referred to as misleading information in her report 
defaulton a recent case (12 003 713).
default&#xa0;
default2.
default5
default 
defaultC
defaulturrent
defaultly 
defaultit is all too easy
default for LAs
default to avoid a full investigation by the LGO.  
defaultAll incorrect LGO findings of 
default“
defaultNo 
defaultmaladministration
default”
default 
defaultwhich are then considered by LA committee
defaults
default give false reassurance to elected members that their council is performing adequately.  
defaultIf it is not possible to 
defaultdevise systems that ensure that
default accurate information 
defaultis provided by
default LAs
default on which 
defaultthe LGO can reach correct decisions
default,
default then the 
defaultprocess can only fail
default complainants and 
defaultmaladministration
default is perpetuated.
