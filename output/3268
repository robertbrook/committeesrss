[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Recommendations suggested in Committee’s report and in report by Thomas et al. will not ensure the LGO meets the 5 key criteria laid down by the [bold]British and Irish Ombudsman Association especially[bold] fairness[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1 I write in my personal capacity as someone who has had personal dealings with the
[normal] Local Government
[normal] Ombudsman 
[normal](L
[normal]G
[normal]O) 
[normal]intermittently 
[normal]since 1994 and 
[normal]had knowledge 
[normal]of campaigns such as Local Government 
[normal]Ombudsman 
[normal]Watch (LGOWatch) which show that t
[normal]he problems that I experienced obtaining redress via the Ombudsman 
[normal]a
[normal]re widespread.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 
[normal]The 
[normal]Select 
[normal]Committee’s 
[normal](CLG) 
[normal]report of July 2012 considered the handling of evidence and 
[normal]at 
[normal]paragraph 67 recommended that 
[normal]in 
[normal]those cases involving serious service fai
[normal]lure
[normal] 
[normal]the LGO's processes should be brought into line with judicial procedures such as full dis
[normal]closure of all submissions
[normal].  Dr Martin saw her role as making findings and recommendations of remedy based on the evidence and facts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 
[normal]The external evaluation of the LGO by Thomas et al. 2013 at 
[normal]R
[normal]ecommendation 9 suggests that 
[normal]there should be an independent reviewer of the service given by the LGO.  This would presumably ensure that the investigators follow the service guidelines.
[normal]  
[normal]However
[normal], t
[normal]his would do nothing to improve the quality of the evidence supplied by Local Authorities
[normal] (LA)
[normal] to the LGO in response to a complaint
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4 T
[normal]he CLG
[normal] believe
[normal]s
[normal] that the appointment of an external reviewer will ensure that the LGO 
[normal]will 
[normal]meet the 
[normal]5 key 
[normal]crite
[normal]ria of independence, fairness, effectiveness, openness and transparency and accountability.  Given that the role of the external reviewer would be solely related to service and not to the
[normal] quality of the investigation
[normal], I do not believe this will improve the
[normal] outcome for a significant number of complainants 
[normal]whose complaints 
[normal]fail 
[normal]as a result of the LGO relying on unproven misinformation supplied by 
[normal]LAs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5 I have 
[normal]always employed 
[normal]solicitors to ass
[normal]ist me 
[normal]and 
[normal]supplied the LGO with background evidence
[normal],
[normal] usually LA
[normal] documents
[normal],
[normal] to support my complaints.  I believe that the LGO has always disclosed to me all the submissions from the LA.  However, it has been my experience that the LG
[normal]O accepts the evidence from the
[normal] 
[normal]LA as being fact 
[normal]despite there being no evidence that the LA had investigated my complaint thoroughly (or possibly even at all) by interviewing or writing to the individual officers involved.  It does not seem fair that 
[normal]the LGO
[normal] 
[normal]can 
[normal]dismiss
[normal] a complainant’s evidence 
[normal]and acce
[normal]pt that of a LA if the LA has not considered the complaint internally.
[normal]  In my case, the LA mislead the LGO over a number of years and when evidence came to light which proved my point beyond any doubt, the LA was told it did not need to investigate that co
[normal]mplaint because it had already done so in the earlier complaints.  This missed the crucial point that the previous investigations (if they 
[normal]took place
[normal])
[normal] must have 
[normal]been
[normal] 
[normal]flawed
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6 I accessed the 
[normal]Guidance on Investigations used by the LGO investigators and 
[normal]the investigators had followed procedures therefore an external reviewer would not have been able to assist me had he/she been in post.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7 Dr Martin states in her letter of 1 October 2013 to Mr Betts that 
[normal]“
[normal]we will always share our provisional view on a
[normal] complaint that we investigate, and take comments from both parties, before making a final decision.
[normal]”
[normal]  That procedure took place with my complaint but the LGO accepted the LA
[normal]’
[normal]s version of events without background evidence or visiting the Council to view f
[normal]il
[normal]es/interview relevant personnel and so the course of action suggested by Dr Martin is not new in my experience and so will not make a difference when the LGO is intent on accepting the word of the LA.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.8 It is my belief from 
[normal]information that 
[normal]I have 
[normal]received from
[normal] the LA
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]officers concerned were not asked to respond to my complaints and that the LA’s
[normal] response to the LGO was based on what can best be described as ‘wishful thinking’.  The fact that the information provided by the Chief Executive
[normal] is in conflict with the advice given by the 
[normal]Legal Services M
[normal]anager (and acted upon by other officers
[normal] to my detriment) is not denied by the LA
[normal]’
[normal]s Monitoring Officer.  There is no committee within the LA that has the power to require any of these senior offi
[normal]cers to investigate the conflict and act in the public interest to 
[normal]prevent repeat maladministration.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]R
[normal]ecommendations
[normal] on how to prevent a recurrence and how to fill this serious gap in the Council
[normal]’
[normal]s procedures would have been two obvious results of the com
[normal]pla
[normal]i
[normal]nt having been properly investigated.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]9
[normal] The LGO appears unable to employ the highly specialised personnel required to unpick complex cases of maladministration in speci
[normal]alist areas 
[normal]which include planning and not just social care.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]10
[normal] 
[normal]The inability 
[normal]of the LGO to remedy the maladministration has caused me to ask my MP for assistance.  As yet, he has been unable to
[normal] provide me with
[normal] 
[normal]advice as to how the injustice to me can be resolved 
[normal]where the LGO fails in its investigation 
[normal]or to
[normal] ask the LA to resolve t
[normal]he conflict in order to prevent a recurrence of the 
[normal]maladministration
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Possible Solutions to [bold]ensure [bold]fairness[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal] My
[normal] complaint relate
[normal]d
[normal] to 
[normal]very complex 
[normal]matters which initially taxed my own legal advisers even though they were familiar with the issues.  I believe that the LGO should 
[normal]use 
[normal]only experienced specialist investigators 
[normal]for
[normal] such complaints so that complainants 
[normal]have a fair chance of redress
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal] 
[normal]It
[normal] should be cost neutral for the
[normal] LGO 
[normal]to 
[normal]require LAs to append transcripts of interviews and written responses from o
[normal]fficers
[normal] 
[normal]included in the LA investigation
[normal] 
[normal]to the response sent by
[normal] the 
[normal]LA
[normal]’
[normal]s 
[normal]Chief Executive to the
[normal] LGO
[normal].
[normal]  This would show whether 
[normal]the 
[normal]Chief Exec
[normal]utive has 
[normal]carried out a 
[normal]proper 
[normal]investigat
[normal]ion into the
[normal] complaint or just refuted the complaint in isolation from
[normal] the facts
[normal].
[normal]  Time spent reading the extra documents 
[normal]would be time well spent 
[normal]because 
[normal]some LAs
[normal] would admit
[normal] their faults at an earlier stage withou
[normal]t need for detailed investigation by the LGO and this in turn would lead to 
[normal]fewer dissatisfied complainants as
[normal]king for reviews of their cases.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 Consideration could be given to applying 
[normal]financial 
[normal]penalties to LAs which fail to investigate complaints p
[normal]roperly or 
[normal]which 
[normal]provide what Dr Martin referred to as misleading information in her report 
[normal]on a recent case (12 003 713).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]5
[normal] 
[normal]C
[normal]urrent
[normal]ly 
[normal]it is all too easy
[normal] for LAs
[normal] to avoid a full investigation by the LGO.  
[normal]All incorrect LGO findings of 
[normal]“
[normal]No 
[normal]maladministration
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]which are then considered by LA committee
[normal]s
[normal] give false reassurance to elected members that their council is performing adequately.  
[normal]If it is not possible to 
[normal]devise systems that ensure that
[normal] accurate information 
[normal]is provided by
[normal] LAs
[normal] on which 
[normal]the LGO can reach correct decisions
[normal],
[normal] then the 
[normal]process can only fail
[normal] complainants and 
[normal]maladministration
[normal] is perpetuated.
