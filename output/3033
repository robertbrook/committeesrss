[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]At-Bristol s[bold]cience centr[bold]e (CL0065)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1. [bold]Introduction[bold]At-Bristol is an award winning science and discovery centre based on Bristol’s historic 
[normal]harbourside
[normal], and a landmark Millennium project.
[normal] At-Bristol is a member of the national Association of Science and Discovery Centres UK (ASDC).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are submitting evidence to this select committee as we strongly believe that At-Bristol, and other science and discovery centr
[normal]es in the our national network
[normal], are playing and 
[normal]can
[normal] continue to
[normal] play a significant role in engaging the wider public with climate change. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. [bold]Context[bold]At-Bristol’s vision is to ‘make science accessible to all’. We welcome over 200,000 visitors annually, working with diverse audiences i
[normal]ncluding families, schools, teachers and community groups. The science centre is host to over 200 interactive exhibits, allowing visitors to have hands-on experiences with science, technology, engineering and maths. Changing 
[normal]learning 
[normal]programmes, including 
[normal]science shows, workshops, experiments, competitions, lectures and special events are tailored to specific audience interests and needs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. [bold]Experience[bold]Since opening in 2000, At-Bristol has 
[normal]used core funds, grants and sponsorship to 
[normal]successfully engage
[normal] the 
[normal]public with emerging ‘science and soci
[normal]ety’ topics and issues, such as nanotechnology, synthetic biology and climate science.
[normal] Some e
[normal]xamples include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Schools audience
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Public audience
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Supporting public 
[normal]engagement and
[normal] science research

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal]Science and discovery centres such as At-Bristol are ideal venues for bringing science research and the public together, for investigation 
[normal]and dialogue.
[normal]              
[normal]Over the last 2 years, At-Bristol has undertaken a significant programme of energy reduction and sustainability activity. We have won multiple awards, from food procurement standards, to carbon and energy reduction. 
[normal]Achievements include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We use the technology and systems of the science centre building (e.g. 50 kW peak 
[normal]Photovoltaic
[normal] array, green roof, eutectic tank heat exchange system
[normal], advanced energy monitori
[normal]ng
[normal]) to bring the science of sustainability to life, to act as a ‘living case study’ and provide positive and engaging examples of success. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]By leading the way as an exemplar centre of positive change for energy reduction, we provide an exciting and truste
[normal]d informal learning environment, and a fantastic springboard for climate science discussion and debate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal]At-Bristol and similar centres for informal learning and public engagement with science should be seriously considered as agents in successfully 
[normal]eng
[normal]aging
[normal] the p
[normal]u
[normal]blic with climate science
[normal] and research. 
[normal]This activity is already underway in many centres. 
[normal]We
