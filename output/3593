defaultSummary:default&#xa0;defaultThe Government welcomes the Committee’s examination of this important issue. We recognise the significant challenges that the banking sector in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default faces, and we are determined to work closely with the Northern Ireland Executive to help to boost bank lending to businesses. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe framework the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive set out in our 
defaultBuilding a Prosperous and United Community
default document, announced on 14 June, sets out initiatives in this area and outlines an ongoing mechanism for addressing banking and access to finance issues in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default. The Government’s evidence below covers each of the seven topics highlighted by the Committee.

defaultThe structure and governance of banks in defaultNorthern Irelanddefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are clearly significant differences in the banking structure in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default compared to Great Britain (GB). Of the four main banks – 
defaultUlster
default, First Trust, Bank of Ireland and 
defaultDanske
default – three are not UK-owned. First Trust (as part of Allied Irish Banks) and Bank of Ireland are headquartered in 
defaultDublin
default, whilst 
defaultDanske
default is Danish-owned. Some large GB banks such as HSBC and Barclays only have a comparatively small presence in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default. The strong link between the banking system in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default and the 
defaultRepublic
default of 
defaultIreland
default presents particular challenges, given the difficulties faced by the Irish economy in recent years. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Chancellor has made clear that the link between our financial systems, which is most pronounced in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default, was a strong factor in the Government’s decision to provide a bilateral loan to the 
defaultRepublic
default of 
defaultIreland
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultUK
default signed an agreement for a bilateral loan of £3.2 billion in December 2010, as part of an €67.5 billion international financial assistance package for 
defaultIreland
default. The 
defaultGovernment expects the loan to be repaid in full and with interest.  
defaultSweden
default and 
defaultDenmark
default have also provided bilateral loans to 
defaultIreland
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe loan is disbursed in eight tranches of £4
default03 
defaultmillion, subject to the completion of quarterly programme reviews. The first seven tranches have been disbursed to date.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe conditions of the bilateral loan also made clear that the funding was subject to the Iri
defaultsh Government not amending its r
defaultestr
defaultucturing p
defaultlan in a way that would have a material adverse financial impact on the 
defaultUK
default operations of Anglo Irish bank, Allied Irish Banks or the Bank of Ireland. 
default 
defaultAs the Chancellor 
defaultsaid when the Loans to Ireland Act was debated in the House of Commons
default, providing the bilateral loan has enabled 
defaultthe Government
default to be part of discussions about the restructuring plan and its impact on the UK subsidiaries of banks which have significant presence in Northern Ireland.
defaultThe National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) 
defaultis one of 
defaulta number of initiatives taken by the Irish Government to address the crisis in Irish banking. 
defaultNAMA was formally established on 21 December 2009. Five institutions (and their subsidiaries) applied to join the NAMA scheme and were designated as participating institutions in February 2010: Allied Irish Banks; Bank of Ireland; Anglo Irish Bank; Irish Nationwide Building Society; and EBS Building Society.
defaultThe first phase of NAMA’s operation involved the acquisition and transfer of over €71 billion in loan assets involving 850 debtors and more than 11,000 individual loans collateralised by 16,000 individual properties. Approximately two-thirds of the assets backing those loans are located in 
defaultIreland
default and most of the remainder is located in the 
defaultUK
default with smaller concentrations in the 
defaultUS
default and throughout continental 
defaultEurope
default.
defaultOn the proposal of the Irish Minister for Finance, NAMA set up a Northern Ireland Advisory Committee. Its purpose is to advise the Board in relation to strategy for 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default assets. 
defaultApproximately 3
default per cent 
defaultof NAMAs property profile is 
defaultlocated in Northern Ireland; 36 per cent
default Dublin; 18
default per cent
default Rest of Ireland; 21
default per cent London; 12 per cent
default Rest of GB; and 10
default per cent
default Rest of World.
defaultIts portfolio i
defaultn NI is worth €1.3 billion or 4 per cent 
defaultof its total acquisition value of
default €31.8billion. Approximately 70 per cent
default of its NI portfolio is completed property and income producing. By 
defaultthe end of 
defaultMarch 2013, asset sales approved stood at £86.6 million. By the same time, it had approved £123 million in new advances to NI debtors.
default NAMAs stated approach has been to encourage a phased and orderly realisation of its assets in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default.

defaultThe possible breakdefault-defaultup of RBS/Ulster Bankdefault 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government recognises that RBS, including Ulster Bank, remains weighed down by too many poor assets. The Chancellor announced in his Mansion House speech on 19 June that the Treasury would be examining the case for breaking RBS up and establishing a Bad Bank.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government welcomed the input of the Northern Ireland Executive on the future of RBS, conveyed through its former and current finance ministers, Sammy Wilson and Simon Hamilton. The views of the 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default business community were also considered following on from representations by the Secretary of State for 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 1 November 2013, RBS announced that it was committing to a new direction for the bank, in order for it to restructure and boost the British and Irish economies. RBS 
defaultwill 
defaultcreate an internal 
defaultbad bank 
defaultand £9 billion of Ulster Bank assets will be transferred into this new structure.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Chancellor recently stated that the Government, RBS and the Bank of England are all in agreement on the direction that RBS is heading. 
defaultRBS will focus on its core 
defaultUK
default business
default. 
defaultIt will sell off more of its overseas operations and 
defaultcontinue to reduce 
defaultits investment bank, so it has more capital to support lending to the 
defaultUK
default economy. RBS 
defaulthas also committed
default to becoming the best small business bank in 
defaultthe 
defaultUK
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRBS’s operations in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default 
defaultthrough Ulster Bank, which also operates in 
defaultIreland
default,
default remain an important part of RBS’s core operations and the new direction the 
defaultbank has announced. However, a sustainable operating model needs to be found for it so that it can play its full part in delivering 
defaultsupport to both economies
default. To achieve this, RBS has announced that Ulster Bank will be part of 
defaultits full business review, reporting
default in February 2014, with the aim of identifying a long term viable and sustainable business model
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is in the 
defaultUK
default’s interest that 
defaultIreland
default has a successful economy and a stable banking system. 
defaultIt is therefore important that Ulster Bank is in a position to support the economy in both 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default 
defaultand 
defaultthe 
defaultRepublic
default of 
defaultIreland
default, through new lending and generating new business.
default&#xa0;
defaultRBS's 1st November announcement is a positive step in this direction since it will see Ulster Bank remain as an important part of the RBS group, with its balance sheet strengthened by the transfer of problem assets to the internal bad bank. Developing a sustainable business model for Ulster Bank which is capable of
default&#xa0;
defaultsupporting its cost base may involve some difficult decisions following the forthcoming review, but should ultimately leave Ulster 
defaultBank 
defaultas a stronger bank better able to support lending to business.

defaultThe position of the staff of the former Irish Bank Resolution Corporationdefault 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government has received a number of representations on the question of employees of the former Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, which was liquidated by the Irish Government on 7 February 2013.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe fully acknowledge the concerns of those 
defaultUK
default based employees who face redundancy as a result of this process. As a result of the representations received, 
defaultthe Foreign 
defaultand Commonwealth 
defaultOffice has discussed this issue 
defaultwith the Irish Government.
default 
defaultHowever, whilst the Government is able to pursue requests for clarification, it is important to note that the decision to liquidate the IBRC and the effect this had on employment contracts is a matter for the Irish Government. The Government does not have any jurisdiction in relation to the role currently being played by the Special Liquidators.

defaultAccessdefault to finance, particularly for Small and Medium Enterprisesdefault default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government recognises that access to finance remains a significant challenge for SMEs in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default, as it does across the 
defaultUK
default. The Northern Ireland Department for 
defaultEnterprise
default, Trade and Investment’s Economic Advisory Group (EAG) produced a detailed report on access to finance in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe report included the following conclusions:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe measures set out in our 
defaultBuilding a Prosperous and United Community
default package provide a comprehensive framework within which the Government intends to co-ordinate its efforts to boost lending to businesses in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default.

default       defaultLack of effectiveness of national initiatives to help aid economic recoverydefault&#xa0;
defaultUK
default wide lending schemes set-up by the Government play an important role in providing credit to businesses and individuals in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default. Ulster Bank 
defaulthas 
defaultannounced that it ha
defaults
default approved 
defaultnearly £8
default0 million of loans through the Funding for Lending Scheme
default (FLS)
default, helping 
defaultover 5
default00 businesses in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default. FLS has 
defaultenabled Ulster Bank to establish a new Funding for Lending deal, under which customers will not be charged an arrangement fee for any new loans drawn under the scheme.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Enterprise Finance Guarantee
default Scheme (EFG) has provided 195
default loans
default amounting to £27.66 million
default 
defaultin 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default since May 2010
default. 
defaultIn addition to these national schemes, the Northern Ireland Executive has its own £100 million ‘Access to Finance Strategy’, which incorporates a number of smaller schemes designed to boost lending. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, the Government accepts that 
defaultUK
default wide schemes to boost lending have not always been as effective in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default as they have been elsewhere in the 
defaultUK
default. The take-up of EFG is lower in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default than anywhere else in the 
defaultUK
default. The framework we set out in 
defaultBuilding a Prosperous and United Community
default is intended to provide a mechanism to ensure that there is sufficient monitoring and evaluation of national schemes to ensure that they work more effectively in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default in future.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe package also makes specific proposals on improving existing schemes to increase their impact in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default. We have fulfilled our commitment in the package to extend the Start-up Loans scheme to 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default. Delivery partners for this scheme have been agreed and the first Start-up Loans have already been made to young entrepreneurs with seven loans approved to the value of £30,000 by the end of October 2013. The package includes a commitment to work to ensure that 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default benefits from a pilot extension to the Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme, aimed at addressing loan affordability. We have also committed to continuing to work with the remaining banks to encourage their participation in the Funding for Lending Scheme. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is important to note that improving the effectiveness of these schemes cannot be achieved by the Government alone. We would welcome the Committee’s analysis of how banks in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default are promoting, marketing and championing schemes such as 
defaultEFG,
default and the extent to which the remaining banks are proactively seeking to address any issues holding them back from joining the Funding for Lending Scheme.

defaultLdefaultackdefault of availability of detailed regional lending datadefault&#xa0;
defaultThe lack of availability of lending data in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default presents significant challenges for policy makers. The current position is that the Northern Ireland Executive’s Department for Finance and Personnel (
defaultDfP
default) and the Economic Advisory Group (EAG) receive aggregate lending data privately from the British Bankers Association (BBA). This information is provided on a confidential basis and is not published. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government welcomes the Committee’s examination of this issue and intends to work closely with the BBA, banks, and the Northern Ireland Executive to address it. Our objective as far as possible would be to ensure parity in the availability of lending data across the 
defaultUK
default, including in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default. The Government recently announced that, from next year, businesses in GB will be able to see where banks are lending in the country, down to postcode level. The data will be published by the BBA and Council for Mortgage Lenders on a quarterly basis. The first dataset will cover seven major lenders in GB but we have already made clear that we expect more lenders to sign up to publishing their data in future.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Secretary of State for 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default has been working with the Northern Ireland Executive to seek to persuade banks to provide better data on lending in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default. On 11 September 2013 
defaultshe and Finance Minister, Simon Hamilton, met represent
defaultat
defaultives of the British Bankers' Association to explain their concerns on this issue.

defaultAccess to banking in rural communitiesdefault&#xa0;
defaultIt is essential that local communities have access to suitable and affordable banking services. The Government wants to see greater competition in the banking sector, with more banks challenging the large incumbents. If communities or entrepreneurs want to set up a bank, either to serve their local community or to compete nationally, and can do this responsibly, Government or regulators should not be an obstacle to this.
default&#xa0;
defaultThat is why the Government asked the 
defaultprevious
default financial services regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to review the process for authorising new banks, as well the regulatory requirements placed on new and smaller banks. The FSA published the report on this work in March 2013, and brought forward significant improvements to make it easier for new banks to enter the market and compete. These changes have been put into effect by the new financial services regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), and should have a real impact on competition.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government also believes that Post Offices also have a crucial role to play in ensuring rural communities can access banking services.  In 2010, the Government published its Post Office policy statement ‘Securing the Post Office network in the digital age’, which sets out our commitment to maintain a geographically comprehensive Post Office network with at least 11,500 branches.  Of these, 484 are in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default.  The Government is providing £1.34 billion to maintain and modernise the post office network across the 
defaultUK
default and to ensure that it continues to meet the Government access-criteria that see, for example, 93 per cent of the population within one mile of a post office branch.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome 95 per cent of 
defaultUK
default current account customers can access their cash at post office counters.  This includes the accounts of Bank of Ireland, First Trust, 
defaultUlster
default, and 
defaultDanske
default.  The Post Office network is larger than that of all the high street banks combined, and this service provides vital access to cash for many communities that no longer have a high street bank branch.
