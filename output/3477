[normal]Medical research has found a correlation between atherosclerotic (cardiovascular and 
[normal]cerebrovascular
[normal] disease: notably heart attack and stroke) and periodontal disease (gum disease).  43% of the UK population suffer from periodontal disease, costing £2.73bn last year.  A BMJ study (May 2010) found a 70% increased risk of cardiovascular disease event among those who did not brush their teeth twice a day. 
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Now studies have shown that kidneys, like other major organs, are at a similar risk to be affected by periodontal disease through bacteria in the blood stream.

[normal]Since up to one million patients visit a dentist each week, dentists are well-placed to detect and advise upon tobacco consumption, alcohol usage and diet and where appropriate signpost to relevant services.

[normal]The dental profession can therefore help Public Health England improve the nation’s health and encourage positive behaviours that jointly benefit good oral health and good general health.  This in turn relates to the prevention of, and earlier intervention in long term conditions.   Helping people think about and manage their own health on a daily basis will be an important part of the Public Health England’s success and rising to the long term conditions challenge.
