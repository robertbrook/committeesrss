"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHL Subcommittee call for evidence: EU action to tackle youth unemployment&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1. \n              \nDo you think that the EU should be providing funding to Member States to tackle youth unemployment? \n&#xa0;\nYes, the EU should provide funding to Member States to tackle youth unemployment but this should be in conjunction with and to assist initiatives taken at national, regional or local level. Due to the finite nature of EU resources in this area, funding should be targeted and accompanied by efficient guidance.  The youth unemployment rate varies greatly across the Union and this variation must be taken into account. The €6 billion projected budget for the Youth Employment Initiative would go to those regions with higher than 25% youth unemployment. This is an important condition as it ensures that those regions that need it most would receive adequate funding to implement the necessary programmes.\n&#xa0;\n However, it is important that regions with an unemployment rate of lower than 25% are not ignored. This is where the European Social Fund should be effectively deployed and should be used by Member States to invest in concrete programmes to improve young people’s skills and qualifications by focusing on vocational training and employability. \n&#xa0;\nDoes EU action respect Member States’ powers in the area of social and employment affairs?\n&#xa0;\nIn the area of youth unemployment, action taken at EU level takes account of subsidiarity and the differences in the approaches taken by Member States to tackle this issue. The EU Youth Guarantee demonstrates this as it supplies Member States with a concrete objective of ensuring young people receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education whilst leaving Member States to decide how best to achieve this. It should also be noted that the principle efforts to counter youth unemployment must be at Member State rather than EU level in order to take account of differences in national practices and in order to be most effective. \n&#xa0;\n2. \n              \nHow do you think that the EU can best ‘add value’ to Member States’ efforts to tackle unemployment? \n&#xa0;\nAs in many policy areas, one of the most effective ways in which the EU can add value is to encourage the exchange of best practices between Member States. Across Europe, Member States have taken many different approaches to tackling this issue and it is important that we take this into account and use it to learn from each other. Discourse at EU level and EU-wide Youth Intergroups are good examples of sharing of best practices. \n&#xa0;\nThe EU can also indirectly add value by continuing to urge Member States to implement the structural reforms necessary to strengthen European economies. Improving competitiveness and stability of the economy will stimulate growth which will, in turn, encourage businesses across Europe to create the jobs that young people so desperately need. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. \n              \nIs there sufficient disaggregation in EU measures to tackle youth unemployment between, for example, support for young people classified as being not in education, employment or training (‘NEETs’), support for newly qualified graduates looking for work, and general career guidance? \n&#xa0;\nI think disaggregation in measures for different categories of young people is important. Young people who have recently left school and have not continued into further education require more structured support to develop their employability. They need adequate guidance not only about the career paths which are available to them but also about the skills required and how to obtain them. I also think that young people at this stage in their lives are more likely to leave the labour market completely and to struggle to return at a later stage. This means that efforts should be concentrated in this area. Career guidance is something which should be available to all young people regardless of their status and this is something that students should have access to not only throughout their time in further education but also following their graduation. \n&#xa0;\nMember States should recognise these differences when deciding on projects to be co-financed through ESF to ensure programmes cater effectively for different young people’s needs. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5. \n              \nHow do you think the funds allocated through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and the European Social Fund (ESF) could best be spent? \n&#xa0;\nThe funds allocated through these measures should be spent on implementing concrete training programmes in conjunction with national schemes rather than being squandered on less effective initiatives. Vocational training is one of the most effective ways of making young people employable and emphasis should therefore be placed on this type of scheme. Apprenticeships are also an extremely valuable tool for tackling youth unemployment and funding should be used to provide incentives to businesses to encourage them to take on young apprentices. Access to finance is also something that should be considered by Member States when deciding how to use these funds. Helping small businesses and entrepreneurs grow effectively will create local jobs which young people should fill. Young entrepreneurs should be given priority if funds were used in this way and educating young people to become entrepreneurs and develop entrepreneurial skills is something the youth organisation Junior Chamber International believes is integral. \n&#xa0;\nFeedback from Junior Chamber International, placed emphasis on the catch 22 situation that a young person who is unsuccessful in getting a job gains no experience and without any experience, they will be unsuccessful in getting a job. Funds should therefore focus on getting these young people the experience they need to successfully access, and remain in, the labour market be this through job subsidies or partnerships between businesses, local authorities and schools or further education institutions. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6. \n              \nDo you feel that young people (aged 15-24), youth groups and their representatives are involved and consulted to a satisfactory degree in the decisions being made around EU funding for youth unemployment projects, and how they are administered? \n&#xa0;\nEfforts have been made, at Member State and European level, to consult youth organisations through intergroups, youth parliaments and topical events. I think it is important that this consultation is effective and that young people feel that their view is being listened to and taken into account, although I do understand that this is a difficult objective to achieve it practice. From interactions that I have had with youth organisations, the consensus is that they would welcome further interaction with local and national government and I think this is something that should be encouraged in the development of policy at both EU and Member State level. \n&#xa0;\n7. \n              \nShould the EU and Member States take into account the positive and negative socio-economic impacts of youth migration due to unemployment when designing measures to tackle youth unemployment? How might any negative consequences be mitigated? \n&#xa0;\nMember states should take account of this phenomenon. There is little a Member State can do about emigration other than make its own economy more competitive, particularly through labour market reforms. However, recipient countries need to do more in providing language courses for migrant workers, as well as facilitating integration through community programmes.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n18 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
