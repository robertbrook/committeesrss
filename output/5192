defaultTerumo BCT’s goal is to make even safer, higher-quality transfusions available to more people, unlocking the potential of blood and cell therapies. It also helps to bring even more treatment options to patients through advanced blood therapies and supports researchers in developing cellular therapies that may fundamentally improve health care.

default&#xa0;
defaultOther threats, such as the risk to the safety and security of the UK blood supply from both known and unknown pathogens, are also important to consider in this Parliamentary discussion. 
defaultThe UK provides a good example of how a government can work with policy makers, stakeholders, business and society in combating safety threats to the national blood supply, including those from emerging pathogens, such as 
defaultWest Nile virus (WNV), Malaria, tick-borne Encephalitis, and Dengue fever. Such cooperation can also help assist with other blood supply issues, such as boosting the 
defaultblood donor base amongst the Black Minority Ethnic (BME) community.

default&#xa0;defaultAre UK policies governing who can donate blood and blood products, tissues and organs sufficiently evidence-based? Is NHS Blood and Transplant overly restrictive about who can donate, or should greater precautions be taken to further reduce risk?
