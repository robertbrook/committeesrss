[normal]Written Evidence [bold]submitted by [bold]Terumo BCT[bold] (BTO0015)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]On behalf of Terumo BCT – 
[normal]a global leader in blood component and cellular technologies. It is the only company with the unique combination of 
[normal]apheresis
[normal] collections, manual and automated whole blood processing, and pathogen reduction coupled with leading technologies in therapeutic 
[normal]apheresis
[normal] and cell processing. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Terumo BCT’s goal is to make even safer, higher-quality transfusions available to more people, unlocking the potential of blood and cell therapies. It also helps to bring even more treatment options to patients through advanced blood therapies and supports researchers in developing cellular therapies that may fundamentally improve health care. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We welcome the opportunity to answer the call to provide written evidence to the UK Parliament’s Science and Technology Committee 
[normal]i
[normal]nquiry on Blood, Tissue and Organ screening
[normal] and hope that it will prove useful in the further development of the safety and security of the UK blood supply.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Other threats, such as the risk to the safety and security of the UK blood supply from both known and unknown pathogens, are also important to consider in this Parliamentary discussion. 
[normal]The UK provides a good example of how a government can work with policy makers, stakeholders, business and society in combating safety threats to the national blood supply, including those from emerging pathogens, such as 
[normal]West Nile virus (WNV), Malaria, tick-borne Encephalitis, and Dengue fever. Such cooperation can also help assist with other blood supply issues, such as boosting the 
[normal]blood donor base amongst the Black Minority Ethnic (BME) community.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Are UK policies governing who can donate blood and blood products, tissues and organs sufficiently evidence-based? Is NHS Blood and Transplant overly restrictive about who can donate, or should greater precautions be taken to further reduce risk?
