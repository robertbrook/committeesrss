"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FDC19)1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLondon Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) \nbelieves that the \ncurrent devolutionary settlement can be best described as an improvement on having no city government whatsoever, but still incomplete and unsatisfactory.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe business environment\n in London can b\ne improved\n if local government is given a stake in economic growth through greater fiscal devolution\n.  We recommend\n:\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\ndditional funds raised through the \nretention of existing taxes should be off-set by a commensurate reduction in the overall cent\nral government grant to the GLA, so \nthat \nany fiscal devolution to London will not negatively impact on the grant received by any other UK city or region. \n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLCCI\nis the capital’s largest and most representative business organisation with 2,500 member companies from across Greater London. LCCI membership ranges from small\n-\n and medium\n-sized\n enterprises through to multi-national corporates. LCCI member compa\nnies operate within a mix of sectors, across the \nGreater London area\n, genuinely reflecting the broad London business spectrum. \n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiven the location of our membership base in London\n, this submission will only refer to the prospect of greater fiscal devolution to \nthe capital\n. \nWe will mainly respond on the \n‘\ndetails\n’\n of devolution rather than the \n‘\nconcept\n’\n, since the institutions and geography of London governance are already \nunderstood\n. \n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, there is no reason why \nthe principles\n for additional fiscal powers for the capital could not be replicated \nto\n other UK cities\n; \ni\nndeed, \ngreater fiscal devolution to, and the resulting economic growth of, all core cities would be desirable for our members, just as the growth of London benefits the rest of the UK.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe creation of the\n \nGLA\n as a strategic authority\n, the office of the Mayor of London and a 25 member Assembly with scrutiny powers\n in 1999 has \nbeen overwhelmingly positive for London, Londoners and London businesses.\n \nSuccessive Mayors have champion\ned\n London in Whitehall\n for a better financial settlement\n and around the world in the search for foreign direct investment. The \nGLA\n \nhas been invaluable \nin highlighting where deficiencies exist in London’s services and infrastructure\n,\n and how th\nese\n could be hampering its competitiveness. \n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nW\nhile the ability to identify challenges, forecast increased demand and scope potential remedies has been useful, it is\n \nregrettable \nthat \nthe GLA and London \nLAs\n \nremain\n powerless to act in the strategic interests of the capital. \nThis inability stems from the fact \nthe GLA and London local government have\n \nlittle control over their revenues and are dependent on a grant from cen\ntral government that is unpredictable and often set without consultation. \n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe lack of ownersh\nip over revenue streams \nresults in\n two \ndeficiencies in\n London governance \nthat\n hinder\n economic\n growth:\n10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUntil these two issues are addressed, London’s current devolutionary settlement should be considered incomplete and unsatisfactory.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUntil April 2013, there was no financial incentive for London government to \nencou\nrage\n economic growth as they were \nun\nable to retain any growth in business rate yields. This means that local government policymakers are actively \ndisincentivised from making decisions that will \nimprove \nthe\n business environment if it comes into conflict with other interest groups \nthat\n are able to vote in local elections.\n12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEven after the Local Government Finance \nAct (2012\n)\n introduced the B\nusiness \nRate R\nete\nntion Scheme\n (BRRS)\n, councils only benefit if they perm\nit new forms of physical growth in their area, placing \nLA\ns (where there is little physical space to grow) at a disadvantage. The decision to exclude increases in rateable value from \nthe BRRS\n means that councils have no financial incentive to improve the ec\nonomic viability of their area through improving community safety or investing in infrastructure or \nthe public realm.\n \nEven after reform, council incentives continue to be institutionally separated from the needs of business. \n13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis was demonstrated by the L\nCCI report \nDriving Local Growth: The Business Case\n, \nin which \n businesses were asked what should be the top priority for their local council and the top three responses were “investing in local infrastructure” (62% of respondents), “improving community saf\nety” (40%) and maintaining the built environment (35%).\n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe same report found that just 12% of London businesses felt that their local council was aware of their needs as a business. If London \nLAs\n (and the GLA) were \ngiven\n a stake in the success of their local businesses through ownership and retention of \n100% of \nbusiness rates, it is likely that engagement with the business community w\nould\n improve, confidence in the local council w\nould\n increase and more decisions made by l\nocal government w\nould\n be positive for the local economy rather than \ndirect\ned\n at\n the interests of a\n small\n group of \nresidents\n.\n Retaining and spending the taxes that most pay locally would improve accountability and transparency, remove complication and add n\no significant costs to the collection process.\n15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \ndependence of the GLA and London \nLA\ns on an unpredictable central government grant means that they are unable to raise the finance necessary to deliver the improvements in infrastruc\nture and public services because \nthey are stripped of the ability to plan \nfor\n the future. Moreover, restrictions on borrowing beyond the existing prudential borrowing code prevent the GLA and London \nLA\ns from independently financing major infrastructure pro\njects\n, leaving them reliant on the cooperation of \nHMT\n.\n16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn e\nxample of where this arrangement has \nseverely \nhindered\n essential infrastructure investment \nis\n Crossrail. \nProposals for a new link on the rough\n \naxis of the current \ndesign\n can be found in the Abercrombie plans for London of the 1940s. The earliest mention of the term “Crossrail” in LCCI archives \nis found in a\n policy paper \nfrom\n 1973. The term then appears in the London Rail Study of 1974\n and the Central London Rail Study of\n 1989\n. A parliamentary bill to build the line fell at \nC\nommittee \nS\ntage in the early 1990s\n. \nA\n Hybrid Bill was introduced to \nP\narliament\n in 2005\n, receiving Royal Assent in 2008. Construction work began in mid-2009 but the project was\n still at risk of being c\nancelled during the 2010 Comprehensive Spending Review\n (CSR)\n. It is now anticipated that the first trains will run on the line by 2018. \nDespite the years of prevarication from central government, over 60% of the funding for the project will come from the GLA group, London LAs, London businesses and Londoners.17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are also relevant international comparisons to be made between how the enhanced fiscal powers of London’s competitors have enabled better infrastructure planning and delivery: \n18.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParis is not alone in the degree of its fiscal independence: 37% of Madrid’s income is dependent on \ncentral government grant, falling to 30.9% in New York, 25.5% in Berlin and 7.7% in Tokyo\n. \nLondon, with 73.9% of its income dependent on central government, is an extreme outlier.19.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLondon will have 1.6m extra residents by 2030\n and over half a million new \njobs\n,\n yet its\n ageing infrastructure is already struggling to cope with current population\n demand\ns\n, be it a shortage of affordable homes, overcrowded \ntrains or slow br\noadband connections.\n \nLondon cannot afford delay\n \nin delivering \nthe vital \ninfrastructure projects \nto\n ensure that the projected economic and demographic growth is sustainable\n. \n20.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe efficient and cost-effective delivery of infrastructure can only be achieved if there is a known and credible pipeline of projects where finance has b\neen guaranteed. \nT\nhe delivery of th\nis\n \ninfrastructure \nwill create jobs and distribute prosperity well beyond the GLA area \n–\n 62% of businesses that won contracts for the construction of Crossrail are located outside of London\n.\n \nAs long as London remains so dependent on central government grants for the majority of its income, this will not be possible.21.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe GLA and London local government should be able to retain 100% of the entire suite of property taxes (business rates, council tax, capital gains property development tax, stamp duty land tax and the annual tax of enveloped dwellings) collected within the GLA area. \nProperty taxes \nare the most appropriate for \ndevolution\n. \nThe\n \nsupply of property and land is slow to change, and this immobility creates a steady \nstream \nof revenue from the taxes collected.  \nFurthermore, in\n many cases, \nLA\ns are already responsible for collecting them.\n22.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy devolving all property taxes rather than just o\nne element of them will remove the potential distorted incentives to \nprioritise\n one type of development o\nver\n another. If only Council Tax w\nas\n devolved, for example, it could lead to the prioritisation of housing over other type\ns\n of commercial development.\n23.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf fully devolved, it is estimated that property taxes could fund 50% of all current GLA and local council services and would replace the reliance on the ever fluctuating central government grant. This allows London governme\nnt greater certainty o\nver\n future\n \nincome\n,\n enabling the timely and cost-effective delivery of infra\nstructure projects as well as providing \nthe incentives to create a more competitive business environment in order to grow total \ntax \nyields.\n24.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe full devolution of all property taxes opens up the possibility of the GLA, or even London \nLAs\n, being able to determine the rate, thresholds and exemptions of each. This c\nould\n cause uncertainty for busines\nses\n; \nwithout adequate safeguards, it is entirely possible that some local councils would look to “shake down” local businesses to increase their own revenue streams\n.\n Moreover, businesses with multi\nple premises across in England and Wales \nmight\n face the add\ned complexity of paying different multipliers for different \nsites\n.\n25.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, on balance, and with the right \nsafeguards\n and consultation with the business community, \nthere is no reason for LCCI to oppose the GLA or London LAs being given the power to determine the rate, thresholds and exemptions of the taxes that they retain for the following reasons\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n26.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKey to delivering efficient and cost-effective infrastructure projects is the ability to secure sustainable finance \nin advance\n.\n \nIf the GLA and London \nLA\ns \nwere\n able to retain property taxes\n \nand ha\nd\n a stake in creating \nthe \nconditions to accelerate economic g\nrowth, it \nwould \nmake sense to allow them to borrow against future projected growth in the tax receipts\n from those \ninvestments\n.\n \nTo enable this, the fiscal devolution settlement should allow the GLA and London LAs to proceed with tax increment financing projects as long as they remain within the prudential borrowing code. \nThe size of London’s economy (bigger than Sweden) and the unanimous verdict that it will continue to grow economically and demographically long into the future mean that it is able to suppor\nt such a debt commitment.\n \n27.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBorrowing restrictions on the GLA group should be removed as long as borrowing remains within the prudential borrowing code. Given that London \nLA\ns, unlike central government, cannot borrow money to supplement their revenue \nbudgets,\n no further restrictions on their ability to borrow should be applied.28.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of the greatest infrastructure needs for the capital over the coming years is providing enough \naffordable \nhomes\n for working Londoners\n. By allowing the \nGLA and London \nLA\ns to \nretain property taxes, there will be a certain stream of funding to \nenable\n strategic investment to augment London’s housing stock. \nFurther housing finance can be accessed if the artificial limit on what London LAs can borrow from Housing Revenue Accounts are lifted (\nas long as they continue\n to remain within the prudential borrowing code). \n29.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe additional funding derived from the retention of all property taxes should be met by a commensurate reduction in the grant that the GLA and London LAs receive from the central government. This way, the impact of fiscal devolution \nwould be\n neutral for \nHMT\n at the point of reform\n and\n \nwould\n not impact upon the settlements of other UK regions and cities.\n30.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\no capture the improvements in governance listed above, \nthere will need to be a mechanism in place so that the central government grant is not significantly cut after the initial reduction once fiscal devolution has taken place. If \nHMT\n were to reduce the grant in line with increases in yields from devolved property taxes it would undermine the\n f\ninancial\n incentives\n for\n the GLA and London \nLA\ns \nto create a competitive business environment.\n \n31.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHMT will still be able to capture the proceeds of growth in London through the growth of income tax, value added tax and corporation tax and redistribute them as it sees fit. \nAs these receipts for the whole of the UK add up to two-thirds of all HMT receipts – compared to all UK property taxes which make up less than 10% - central government will continue to be the main beneficiary of the future economic growth of London.32.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere will also need to be a comprehensive review \nof\n how the devolved money is split b\netween the GLA and London \nLA\ns and between the \nLA\ns themselves\n (and to what extent locally set property taxes are retained or redistributed)\n.
