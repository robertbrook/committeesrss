defaultThe effectiveness of academisation in narrowing the gap for disadvantaged children, and what further steps should be taken within the academies system to bring about a transformational impact on student defaultoutcomes;default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government claims that the 2012 GCSE results show that sponsored academies were improving at five times the rate of non-academies.  However,
default&#xa0;
defaultWays in which academies can narrow the gap for disadvantaged c
defaulthildren include:

defaultUse of Technology In Academiesdefault&#xa0;
defaultO
defaultne in ten children between the ages of one and 15 has a mental health disorder
default and 
default61,570 children in state-funded schools who are recorded as having some kind of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD)
default.  These
default two figures alone are terrifying and it is vital that support is given to these young people in education or they will have a higher chance of ending up on the NEETs register.  
defaultIndeed, only 15% of adults with autism in the UK are in full-time paid

default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAs 
defaultattending school is much harder for a vulnerable young person due to wellbeing, health or bullying issues, the use of o
defaultnline and blended learning can be adapted to the mainstream environment to allow these young people 
defaultto focus on learning without being bogged down by external influences, which they may struggle to deal with.  In addition, 
defaultit can help to 
defaultpromote best pract

defaulthe 
defaultNisai Virtual Academy (NVA) – created by the Nisai Group delivers the National Curriculum together with so
defaultme Vocational Qualifications and is completely interactive, allowing students to engage in live lessons with teachers and other students as well as move around the online campus, whilst using the same frameworks as a student would receive in a traditional 
defaultschool.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition 
defaultyoung people using 
defaultthe Nisai Virtual Academy have an entire virtual support team around them including their subject tutors and a specially assigned tutor to deal with their personal wellbeing.  This has proved to be a very 
defaultsuccessful route for vulnerable young people, and can help them get the support they need to deal better with their mainstream lessons
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultReduction of Exclusionsdefault&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthere needs to be a rethink regarding the recommendation made by PricewaterhouseCoopers regarding 
default“a system for monitoring exclusions in Academies … and provide support to Academies, similar to that provided through Local Authority Behaviour Support Teams… 
defaultto reduce the disproportionate number of exclusions in some Academies”.  This will help to make sure that disadvantaged students are not being unfairly excluded and that students are given the help and education they need if they are excluded for example, 
defaultthrough the use of online and blended learning tools.
