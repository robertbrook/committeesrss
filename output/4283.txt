[[[Introduction]]]This paper provides the response from the UK Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association to the “Low carbon innovation” inquiry published by the Energy and Climate Change Committee in October 2013. The UK Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association (UK HFCA) aims to accelerate the commercialization of fuel cell and hydrogen energy technologies. Through the breadth, expertise and diversity of our membership, we work to trigger the policy changes required for the UK to fully realise the opportunities offered by these clean energy solutions and associated elements of the supply chain. Fuel cells and hydrogen are ‘game changing’ technologies providing low-carbon solutions across transport, stationary power and beyond. The growing industry is already bringing benefits that the UK cannot afford to miss: creating new jobs, supporting UK economic growth and improved competitiveness in the energy markets globally. This submission has been produced through consultation with our members and presents the Association’s response to those aspects of the consultation of most relevance to the sector.

[[[erms of Reference: ]]]Whilst the current approach towards low carbon innovation undoubtedly offers some benefits, the Government could provide further incentives to stimulate long-term public and private investment into the low carbon sector to help achieve policy objectives and avoid costly long term challenges around the rising cost of conventional fuels, security of supply and cost of carbon adaptation. Additionally, lowest cost is not the only factor to consider. The LCICG website notes that “In the period up to April 2015, core LCICG members expect to spend over £800 million of public sector funding on low carbon innovation”. We observe that the members of LCICG include a wide range of government departments with a wide range of scope, timescales, varying levels of understanding of low carbon innovation technologies and a wealth of other priorities. In order for funding to be focused on “legally binding targets” and “lowest possible cost”, a consistent approach to assessing, prioritising and monitoring the progress of the projects that are funded is required, and is not evident today. The LCICG may be able to co-ordinate this activity.&#xa0;However, it is also important to highlight that:     From the members of UKHFCA experience, the two criteria being tested are not therefore the only criteria by which innovation funding should be assessed. For instance, from a BIS perspective, ability to contribute to UK growth is included in funds that are administered through the Technology Strategy board, as well as allowing for applied research projects that may or may not deliver innovation that can be deployed within the timescales of the legally binding targets, or within the UK alone.  For instance, the European Fuel Cells and Hydrogen industry has seen annual turnover increase by 10% over the past five years1, the global fuel cell and hydrogen energy market is projected to be worth over $15 billion by 20172, growing to $180 billion in 20503, and revenues in the fuel cell sector are projected to grow at a rate of 26% annually over the next decade3. This substantial opportunity should not be neglected by the UK.&#xa0;It is our view that the government’s approach towards low carbon innovation does not have the right balance as it is not structured to facilitate the introduction of new technologies (such as hydrogen and fuel cells) that do not fit “neatly” into existing policy schemes. Furthermore, there are no planned policy schemes that could support the needs of a small scale and not fully market ready sector (such as hydrogen and fuel cells). For example, the next steps of the EMR (Capacity Market and Contracts for Difference) will address the needs of fully commercialised sectors. On a similar basis, the existing Government structures fail to recognise the convergence of previously diverse parts of the energy space (e.g. electricity for vehicles and heating).&#xa0;In order to maximise the options for the UK in delivering its carbon objectives, the scope of Government thinking, and support for innovation, needs to be extended beyond the ‘usual suspects’. This should include evaluations of technologies with significant potential which is not currently recognised by either Government thinking or support, such as fuel cells and hydrogen, so that new strategies can be developed to help the UK optimise its response to the opportunity. Specifically for hydrogen and fuel cells, outcomes from the LCICG would therefore need to include analyses to support the sector, such as Road mapping of future pathways and options (across all markets), and evaluation of the business case. These will help to define the best pan-application policies and support mechanisms to sit alongside those available for other low carbon technologies. In addition, it would be most useful for the sector if the Energy and Climate Change Committee launched in the short-term a specific inquiry on hydrogen and fuel cells where written and / or oral submissions would provide the evidence required to stimulate Government’s thinking and support for the sector.Such is the challenge of low carbon innovation that investment needs to be targeted across all stages of the innovation process. For innovative disruptive technology for which there is a small but growing industry opportunity, such as hydrogen and fuel cells, there is a need for on-going R&amp;D in all stages of the pipeline. Over the long term, the Government can particularly play a role in defining market needs, risk mitigation, demonstration and scale. &#xa0;Short term funding timelines are not helpful in any aspect of low carbon innovation. Private sector investment needs to be given consistent long term strategies and risk mitigation support to have confidence in match funding investment.  &#xa0;DECC should ensure that its remaining capital allocation is wisely spent by doing work to understand which technologies should be receiving funding. As mentioned above, in question 3, technologies with substantial potential, such as hydrogen and fuel cells, are currently overlooked. A more practical recommendation would be for DECC to identify ways to accelerate the process of getting contracts figured out.It also debatable why the LCICG needed to have their own projects and couldn’t use existing funding providers with established contracts and competition processes already such as Carbon Trust, TSB etc. &#xa0;At the moment, the Government is not maximising opportunities to learn from and partner with international players. Other countries have understood the potential of the fuel cell and hydrogen sector and are investing to reap the benefits. For example, Germany has established a strategic alliance called the National Innovation Programme Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (NIP). NIP is intended to speed up the process of market preparation of products based on this technology. The total budget for the 10 year period to 2016 amounts to € 1.4 billion. Half of this is provided by The Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (BMVBS) and the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi, Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie), while the balance is funded by participating industry. NIP is divided into four programme areas to advance numerous hydrogen and fuel cell technology product and application options in parallel, and to be able to address in a targeted way the market-specific challenges of market preparation. The specific programme areas are: “Transport and Hydrogen Infrastructure”, “Hydrogen Provision”, “Stationary Energy Supply”, and “Special Markets”. With a view to series production of components, the explicit focus of all programme areas is on the strengthening of the supply industry.
