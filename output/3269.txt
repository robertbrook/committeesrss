&#xa0;PUB0005&#xa0;Written evidence from London Borough of LambethLambeth is one of a growing number of councils that are becoming cooperative councils. That means putting people who use our services or live in our communities in control of the decisions that affect their lives. At its core it is about citizens, councillors and council staff working together to determine local outcomes and how best to deliver those. Lambeth has developed its own ambitious public service reform programme to become a cooperative council. Empowering and working with citizens (coproduction) is central to our approach and it is changing the way we think about the role of local government in public service provision.  In the context of reducing public sector spending we are working with citizens to meet their needs. In Lambeth we are seeking to build on the assets in our communities and to give power and control back to them, so that they can find ways of helping themselves and others to lead the lives they want to lead. &#xa0;

[[[Lambeth Council ]]]~What evidence is there that citizen-centred approaches to public service design, delivery and choice of provider can deliver better outcomes—ensuring not only better value for money, but also greater social, economic and environmental value?/ Why pursue citizen-centred approaches to public service design and delivery?

[[[Our cooperative approach]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Utilising user and community expertise]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Aspire WellbeingAspire Wellbeing was a day centre run by the council. Encouraged by our cooperative direction of travel staff established themselves as a social enterprise - owned by the existing staff group and with the active involvement of service users and the local community.  The centre is now a thriving community resource maximising the local benefits it provides. This includes gym membership, studio classes, affordable meeting room hire, the income from which will be re-invested in facilities for the community.&#xa0;Aspire Wellbeing co–produce their services with all stakeholders; customers, volunteers, staff and the local communities.  As part of the government’s mutual pathfinder scheme they also help other social enterprise projects follow in their path; sharing their journey and helping others learn from their mistakes and successes. 

[[[Improving and democratising]]]Cooperative LibrariesFaced with the same challenges to library provision as the rest of the country we engaged with a wide range of people around each of our nine libraries. We provided detailed financial and service information and worked with the community develop what a successful library service would look like. A plan and budget has been set for each library that has been coproduced with the community. This has resulted in Lambeth retaining all of its existing libraries whilst also reducing the necessary costs. Communities have taken on greater responsibility for libraries, and are tailoring the services offered by the libraries to meet the needs of that particular community.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[A wider understanding of the resources available to us]]]&#xa0;c.               We believe that the real value of our cooperative approach lies in bringing greater resources to bear on the challenges we face.  Local government revenues are a small, and diminishing, proportion of the total resources available in our borough. There is also a wealth of resources in our communities, among the people who live and work here, who we can work with, enable, and support to achieve our shared outcomes.  In Lambeth we believe that providing reactive services to people is neither sustainable nor effective.  We focus on the strengths of citizens to achieve good outcomes: coproduction and an asset-based approach enables the council to grow the existing assets and strengths within our communities, enabling communities to meet their own needs.  The WorkshopThe Workshop is an on-going project in West Norwood.  The first phase of the project involved setting up in a vacant shop in the town centre and holding over 540 conversations with residents, generating fresh ideas and seeking new ways to overcome obstacles to collaboration.&#xa0; The second phase of the project is now underway, establishing a number of ‘mini-lab’ projects which aim to establish a more collaborative, better-networked, self-sufficient community more capable of taking on further community-led cooperative activities. To enable this transition from a ‘serviced community’ to a ‘collaborative community’ a whole system redesign is being tested exploring how: 1) citizens interact with each other 2) spaces and venues are used 3) networks operate and connect with each other 4) learning is acquired and shared 5) funding and investment is secured and spent 6) procedures and processes are navigated&#xa0; 

[[[Ownership of decisions ]]]&#xa0;The Young Lambeth Coop (YLC)The YLC is a completely independent, community owned organisation that exemplifies the council’s ambition to transfer control and decision-making to local communities. Over 800 community hours have already been committed to the YLC’s development and 1100 adults and 650 young people expressed interest in being involved in its development.  &#xa0;YLC members will be responsible for a £6m budget deciding what play and youth services are provided across the borough. It is programmed to deliver the council 24% cashable savings and be 23% cheaper than the current commissioning model. Furthermore it aims to commission an additional £3.8 million worth of services for young people over 5-years of age, a significant proportion of which would not otherwise have been brought into the borough. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;To what extent is the government’s public service reform programme succeeding?

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;What are the challenges of citizen centred approaches / and how can we ensure all citizen have influence?

[[[Becoming facilitators and enablers]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Green Community Champions (GCC)             The Council made an open call to citizens to ask them if they would like to be green community champions and asked them to define what they wanted to do, supported by a single officer. There are now 500 champions working with over 60 groups and 5,000 residents on local environmental issues – from food growing to community energy projects. It has led to more innovation and community ownership than if the council had defined the network at the outset. &#xa0;&#xa0;Made in LambethMade in Lambeth is a council facilitated hack-day type event where volunteers work together over single weekends to address particular challenges within the borough.  Volunteers come from a range of backgrounds including graphic designers, artists, project managers and community organisers.  Projects they have worked on include designing a brand new website and branding for the Young Lambeth Coop, accelerating the approach to digital inclusion across the borough, re-launching Vauxhall City Farm and marketing affordable pay-day loan products from the London Mutual Credit Union.  The council facilitates these events through coordinating project briefs and providing a location and wifi.  However, the output is very much down to those who take part in the weekends.  This approach has enabled the council to harness the creativity of communities and helped create a more permissive council culture where creative changes designed by the community are put into practice.Community FreshviewCommunity Freshview is a community-led opportunity for residents to make a difference to their local area whether through brightening up a green space, giving a disused space a facelift or any other activity that improves the local environment.  The council provides nominal support such as plants and paint, expertise where needed, and support in accessing additional volunteers.  In addition to sprucing up an area Community Freshview has the benefit of bringing neighbours together and has been undertaken by more than 20 separate groups already.  This example has emphasised the value of providing a clear and simple offer of council support for resident-led activity and highlighted how barriers to participation can be overcome through well publicised council support.

[[[Evidencing what works]]]

[[[ and learning from early projects. ]]]Brixton EnergyBrixton Energy is a not-for-profit co-operative based in Lambeth creating cooperatively owned renewable energy projects whose financial revenues stay within the local community. It is the first social-housing based renewable energy company in the country with a vision to create a greener future for Brixton.  In doing so it is generating energy, increasing Brixton’s energy resilience and security, raising awareness about energy efficiency, tackling fuel poverty, and providing training and employment for local people.  It was established in cooperation with the council.  Since then five further roofs on the estate have been fitted with panels.

[[[Conclusion ]]]These are challenging times; there is less funding and an increased demand for some public services. There are risks but there are opportunities too. The Lambeth approach is transformational but we have achieved this through a solid evidence base of support (through our Cooperative Council Commission);  citizen engagement; and early prototyping to develop our thinking and draw learning around issues of risk, organisational structure, accountability, behaviour change and capacity building. We have found that in order for the approach to work, the council must help mitigate risk, but more importantly by building new relationships and putting the citizen in control we are saving money. Ultimately we believe that we will see a collaborative community in Lambeth where the council acts as a platform for that collaboration, providing the right spaces and infrastructure to make it happen. By empowering local people in this way we can give them back the power to change their lives and help those around them, fostering stronger more resilient communities. October 20131&#xa0;
