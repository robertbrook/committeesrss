default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI founded the See Me Save Me campaign after my sister Eilidh Cairns, 
defaulta fit and experienced cyclist of 
default30yrs, was run down from behind by a fully laden tipper truck in Notting Hill Gate as she cycled to work on 5
defaultth
default February 2009
default;
default and 
defaultas 
defaultit 
defaultbecame apparent how frequently cyclists and 
defaultpedestrians
default were being killed and seriously injured by HGVs
default;
default and how little preventative action
default,
default or even acknowledgement
default,
default was
default given by industry, government 
defaultor the legal system to such systematic failure and loss.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the majority of cases where a cyclist is killed the driver claims they did not see them. In the majority of cases there is no prosecution. See Me Save Me campaigns for elimination of blind spots in HGVs and for greater visibility for cyclists in the j
defaultustice system.

defaultBackgrounddefault&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe main cause of death and injury to cyclists and the main b
defaultarrier to the uptake of cycling
default is the danger posed by HGVs. 
defaultWhilst 
defaultHGVs are represented disproportionately in 
defaultcyclist deaths they also 
defaulton average
default kill
default more than twice as many pedestrians than cyclists. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the majority of cases the driver says they did not see the cyclist or pedestria
defaultn (SMIDSY – Sorry Mate I Didn’t See You)
default. This can
default be because of a) blind areas, b) not looking, c) looking but not at the right time d) looking but not seeing. Many of the cyclists killed were fit and experienced and aware of the dangers of HGVs. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultfocus for prevention must rest with reducing the danger at source, that is the danger posed by the vehicle, by the driver and by the environment. This will have benefits to all of society on a far wider scale beyond preventing death, injury, and the cost o
defaultf such.
default As such t
defaulthis submission focuses on the measures to address the failings in the construction industry, the legal system and the political system to reduce the risk posed by HGVs to cyclists and other vulnerable road users.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecommendationsdefault&#xa0;defaultA. defaultWhether cycling is safe, particularly in towns and citiesdefault&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are many 
defaultstatistics
default used to arg
defaultue how safe or unsafe it is to cycle, some of them more appropriate than others
default. In reality perception is as important
default as statistics. The fact is
default the vast majority of the active and able adult 
defaultpop
defaultulation, including
default 
defaultSir Bernard Hogan-Howe
default, 
defaultthe Metro
defaultpolitan Police commissioner,
default the man in charge of enfor
defaultcing road safety in the capital, 
defaultdoes not
default consider cycling a
default safe 
defaultmode of transport for themselve
defaults, despite their desire to do so, and cite this as the main barrier to uptake
default. Any person slightly more vulnerable
default be it because they are
default older or younger
default,
default pregnant or
default carrying cargo or a child,
default less able
default or in bad weather,
default is usually deemed at best foolish for attempting to cycle 
defaultand more often than not deserving of any injury that may befall them from a motor vehicle. This is far from the vision of a safe environment for cycling.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultB. What central and local Government coudefaultldefaultd do to improve cycling safetydefault&#xa0;default Ideas could include better training and advice for drivers and cyclists, better enforcement of the law applying to drivers and cyclists, and better vehicle and road infrastructure.default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is much that central government can
default do to improve cycling safety through legislation for better standards for HGVs, the vehicles that pose the greatest risk
default,
default and best practice driver training but also through stipulation and enforcement of such standards through contractual
default documents for
default pu
defaultblicly funded construction projects
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are many technologies designed to prevent scratches on bumpers. Vehicle safety technology to date has focussed solely on protection of the occupant
default resulting in a respective significant fall
default in death and injury
default 
defaultof car drivers
default. 
defaultWhilst there are call
defaults to cut traffic speed to 20mph,
default in the case of 
defaultcollisions with 
defaulta lorry
default death of a VRU
default will 
defaultoccur at 
defaulta speed of only 2mph
default. A report published by the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in April 2012 called for the 
defaultmandatory implementation of ‘collision avoidance technologies’ to eliminate blind spots on all buses and lorries by 2015.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: 
defaultM
defaultandatory requirement to have best available 
defaultdesign and 
defaulttechnology 
defaultin HGVs to eliminate blind areas
default firstly focussing on 
defaultdesign for 
defaultdirect vision (lower cabs and clear doors) and secondly focusing on technology primarily that which automatically controls the vehicle eg ABS, vehicle
default departure warnings and sensors
default when danger of collision occurs.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn-bik
defaulte training for lorries drivers regularly results in an epiphany for them resulting in understanding of 
defaultcyclists’
default positions, motivations and actions and subsequent acceptance of behaviour and consideration when sharing space. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: Mandatory on 
defaultbike
default cycle awareness
default training for all drivers of HGVs
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe construction industry has recognised the specific risk it poses to vulnerable road users and is working on a voluntary construction logistics national standard on Work Related Road Risk due to be 
defaultlaunched in December 2013. However, even with wide adoption by the major companies and strict attempts at enforcement and compliance due to the complexity of the supply chain and the well documented lack of compliance at the lower end of the haulage indust
defaultry (see operation Mermaid) it will be years before every HGV on the road meets the standard without the support of legislation.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: Greater legal 
defaultculpability of employers who allow ill-equipped or incompetent drivers to negotiate crowded stree
defaultts in ill-equipped or inadequate lorries which are effectively mobile places of work.  Employers must be legally required to have and enforce appro
defaultpriate risk management policies that deal with risk from activities off site as well as on site.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDAT
defaultION: All public sector funded projects adopt the new construction industry standard for construction logistics and Work Related Road Safety and 
defaulten
defaultsure its enforcement throughout the supply chain
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: All planning permission for major developme
defaultnts to include requirement to adopt national construction logistics Work Related Road Safety standard
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe recent government announcement to introduce exemptions to driver training
default requirements allowing untrained drivers to take charge of an HGVs for distances up to 50km flies in the face of the spate of recent deaths and the long heard calls for better driver training and the most recent and concerted efforts of industry leaders.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: Immediately withdraw the proposals to any exemptions to driver training requirements
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInsufficient priority is given to keeping dangerous drivers off the road. Driving bans are short and can overlap with custodial sentences. There is a 
defaultmisconception that many drivers are convicted and imprisoned but there are less than 250 drivers a year convicted of causing death by dangerous driving or careless driving whilst under the influence.
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe driver who ran over and killed Eilidh
default Cairns in February 2009 later went on to run over and kill pedestrian Nora Gutman in June 2011. 
defaultBoth bereaved families asked the judge not for retribution but that the driver never be allowed to drive an HGV again. Their requests went unheeded. 
defaultThere are 
defaultmany 
defaultother cases where drivers h
defaultave a string of convictions, show no remorse and continue to driver irresponsibly.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMM
defaultE
defaultN
defaultDATION: Greater consideration of lifetime bans for drivers who kill or seriously 
defaultinjure.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe current culture of conflict and animo
defaultsity is created and inflamed by confusion over road space, lack of driver’s appreciation of a good cycle positioning, inadequate infrastructure causing fear and survival tactics, lack of enforcement of road traffic law designed to protect the vulnerable su
defaultch as use of ASL, mobile phone use, parking in cycle lanes and dangerous overtaking. 
defaultWhilst there are
default calls for 
defaultcyclists to exerc
defaultise greater caution
default, an analysis by Transport for London in 2011 of fatal and serious collisions involving cyclists shows that 
default56 per cent of cases are caused by the motorist driving in an “unlawful or anti-social” manner, compared to only 6 per cent of collisions caused by a cyclist doing the same
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: On-bike cycle awareness training to be a mandatory module of ev
defaultery
default motor vehicle
default driving test.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecent cases of police officers stopping cyclists and clearly being unaware of
default the rights of cyclists and
default traffic law
default 
defaultand they
default 
defaultthemselves driving illegally
default 
defaultdo little to 
defaultinstil
default confidence in the legal system.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: Review and refres
defaulth of police officer training with respect to
default cyclists and road traffic rules and regulations
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultExisting cycle lanes are positioned on the left side of the highway. Over 50% of cyclist deaths 
defaultare 
defaultcaused by left turning 
defaultvehicles. Much danger is presented to those in cycle lanes
default 
defaultby motor vehicles entering cycle lanes and advanced stop boxes whilst driving and parking
default generating fear and conflict
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: A review of road traffic regulations to include a change s
defaulto that turning traffic has to give way to through traffic and an incentive for motorists to respect areas designed to be safe for cyclists.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are no national standards in collision investigation; the ACPO road death investigation manual is advisory 
defaulto
defaultnly and 
defaultnor is there any monitoring of consistency or procedures used by the 43 different police services across the country.  
defaultMany police investigations fall well below the level of acceptable competence (Jake Thompson, Eilidh Cairns, Marie Vescoe) result
defaulting in little chance of prosecution or prevention of further similar deaths through corrective action
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: A national minimum good practice standard agreed by ACPO and others including the national charity for collision investigators (ITAI).  
defaultThis should include prompt dealing with witnesses and the use of the Self Administered Questionnaire that allows witnesses to record information immediately.
default&#xa0;
default3.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA review of the court outcomes for drivers prosecuted for killing or seriously injuring cyclists in London found that between 2007 and 2010 of the 50 fatal cyclist collisions considered only half were taken to court. Of those 25 prosecutions only 12 were c
defaultonvicted of death by dangerous or careless driving. Law breaking committed with vehicles is treated much more leniently than with other dangerous machinery, or other crime committed on the street. Prosecutors do not receive specialized training and they ra
defaultrely visit the crash site or attend any inquest. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: Greater accountability and transparency during the investigation process including reporting of all police forces on the number of cases put forward to the CPS for prosecution 
defaultand the numbe
defaultr of cases not put forward and the reasons why
default not
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: Greater accountability and transparency during the prosecution process including a requirement for prosecutors to consider visiting the scene and 
defaultfor 
defaultthe publication of 
defaultthe 
defaultnumber of cases which are deemed not suitable 
defaultfor prosecution and the reasons why
default not
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a lack of transparency with the charging decision in road crashes, especially by the police in injury collisions, and the number of drivers in crashes that ha
defaultve broken the law is not counted.
default Therefore t
defaulthe victim of a road crash is not counted in crime statistics so the number of people killed or injured by law breaking drivers is not recorded or monitored at all at present. We do not know the number of innocen
defaultt victims injured by Dangerous Driving, Careless Driving, or Drink-Driving, as these charges do not mention when an injury has resulted. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: Vi
defaultctims of law breaking drivers to be included in victim of crime statistics.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCollision investigators are often asked in court what could be done to prevent these deaths. Their answers are unusually ill-informed and without due consideration. Coroners have powers make recommendations to prevent further similar deaths. These are ofte
defaultn not excersized because coroners are unaware of preventative low cost measures. In the case of Judicial Review into the inquest of Eilidh Cairns the coroner argued that ‘there were no practicable, preventative measures’ which could have been implemented
default t
defaulto prevent death
default. This is simply untrue.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: M
defaultandatory and regular training and monitoring of collision investigators, prosecutors and coroners so they can consistently explain the full circumstances of the death and propose preventative 
defaultmeasures to reduce future road deaths.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvent Date Recorders (EDRs) or ‘Black Boxes’ are a simple, cheap and increasingly available technology, which can dramatically reverse the escalating problem of road death and long-term disability.  Black boxes are 
defaultused to improve safety by monitoring the manner in which vehicles are being driven by recording distance driven, start and end time, average speed and time above speed limit, acceleration and deceleration and the highest speed for each trip. Information ca
defaultn be used for driver training and supervision through provision of continuous records, and for crash reconstruction and prevention through detailed vehicle data just before and after a crash. They can also incorporate automatic crash notification (e-call) 
defaultusing GPS to alert the police and emergency services detailing location and potential severity. Drivers driving for work cause the majority of vulnerable road user deaths. 
default&#xa0;
default3.17
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA report by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers
default 
default‘Intelligent Transport Intell
defaultigent Society’ published in March 2012 calls for vehicles to be installed with collision-avoidance technologies, which could help eliminate cyclist and pedestrian deaths caused by driver ‘blind-spots’, and state that they should be made mandatory for al
defaultl U
defaultK buses and lorries by 2015
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION:
default L
defaultegislation to require and regulate 
defaultcollision avoidance technologies
default with all devices meeting minimum technological standards 
defaultfor all high risk groups including 
defaultyoung or novice drivers, all public sector agencie
defaults, all commercial drivers including public transport vehicles, company cars, and all construction vehicles accessing public roads.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultC. Whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.default&#xa0;
default3.18
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultStatistics show that deaths and serious injuries of cyclists peak at rush 
defaulthours.
default 
defaultA report by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) published in 1994 stated that in inner London, in relation to their traffic volume, HGVs cause 30 times as many cyclists deaths as cars and five times as many as buses.  It 
defaultconcluded: 
default"Until the factors
default leading to this excess risk are understood, a ban on HGVs in urban areas should be considered."
default&#xa0;
default3.19
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA study published a decade later in 2004 showed that between 1999 and 2004 nothing had changed. In fact over that period 85% of female cyclist fatalities in L
defaultondon involved heavy goods vehicles.
default&#xa0;
default3.20
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn Nov 2010 a report by Researchers from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) analyzed police road casualty data over a 15-year period from 1992 to 2006 and again called for a ban on heavy goods veh
defaulticles in Britain's cities after a study found that despite making only 4% of road trips they were involved in 43% of London's cycling deaths.
default&#xa0;
default3.21
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe President of the Institution of Highways Engineers at the end of June 2012 called for a ban on HGVs on motorw
defaultays on Sundays.
default 
defaultHGVs are banned in Dublin, Delhi, Paris and Dhaka. A lorry ban occurred in London during the 2 weeks of the Olympics. Not only were no adverse effects obvious but also it was widely reported that London was a much safer, more attractive and
default efficient place to be and through which to travel. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: 
defaultC
defaultonsideration of ba
defaultnning of HGVs during rush hours 
defaultwhen statistics show pea
defaultk collision rates with cyclists, a recommendation which has been made by experts for over two decades.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: Greater consideration and requirement for freight to travel by rail and water rather than by road in order to reduce the number of HGVs on road, and for this to be a requirement of all public sector construction projects
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.22
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe adoption of 
defaultstricter liability would reduce the unfairness of outcomes and encourage the insurance industry to invest in reducing the threat posed to vulnerable road users as they already have with occupant safety
default and vehicle security.
default Stricter liability would also he
defaultlp create a safer road environment, promoting active travel. 
default&#xa0;
default3.23
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn a 
defaultreport for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, on Making walking and cycling normal, changing the civil legal liability system was identified as a key measure (Pooley, 2012).
default&#xa0;
default3.24
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMost countries in the world have a civil liability system whereby pedestrians and passengers are assumed to qualify for compensation. In Europe this includes Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Spain. In Sweden all casualties qualify for co
defaultmpensation. Stricter liability is the norm outside of Europe and can be found in Asia, including India, Bangladesh, Viet Nam. It was introduced in China less than 10 years ago.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: Adoption of strict liability
default&#xa0;
default3.25
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGeneral animosity on the road is
default a result of con
defaultfusion and fights for space, 
defaultbreaking of rules and
default uncertainty of
default unpredictable behaviour. The Dutch Sustainable Safety system shows that
default if
default infrastructure 
defaultis designed to 
defaultbe designed fit for purpose 
defaultthen there is an increase in
default predictabili
defaultty of behaviour, which 
defaultin turn breeds
default consideration between road users.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: review of design guidance and standards to allow 
defaultcreation of cycle 
defaultinfrastructure 
defaultfit for purpose that is 
defaultconvenient, fast, safe and comfortable with segregation where 
defaultpossible to 
defaultfacilitate
default diversity 
defaultin age, culture, disability, 
defaultof people able to ride bikes. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: Any highway or road maintenance works to include a review 
defaultto improve 
defaultcycle facility
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.26
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGeneral animosity on the road is a result of prejudice and stereotyping of those who chose a particular mode of transport and a lack of understanding of facts.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION: Road safety and bike awareness campaigns to dispel some of the negative myths around cycling to show that cyclists are just people on bikes, that most people on bikes are also drivers and so have insurance, that a person on a bike will norm
defaultally suffer more in a collision than another road user, that road tax does not exist any more, that road maintenance is paid for through general taxes and 
defaultthe benefits the cyclist presents to all of society.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.27
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRoad death and injury is not unavoidable, it i
defaults not inevitable. Road death is preventable and the reference to deaths as accidental removes culpability, presumes innocent, excuses law breaking and risk taking, undermines prevention efforts and aggravates suffering of the bereaved
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRECCOMMENDATION: 
defaultP
defaultolicy makers and the media to stop using the word ‘accident’ when referring to road crashes, and to adopt an appropriate, constructive and accurate terminology such as crash or collision.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.28
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCurrently most inquest verdicts in the case of road deaths are 
defaultlogged as ‘accidental deaths’, a term families bereaved find insulting. As a result there is no way to count the number of road deaths and therefore acknowledge the true scale of road death and so attached any meaningful priority.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION:  Introdu
defaultction of a 
defaultspecific short ‘road death’ verdict.
