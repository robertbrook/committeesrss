"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence from Certsure (BRC 75)&#xa0;\nThank you for the opportunity to present t\no the Select Committee\n regarding \nElectrical Safety and \nPart P of t\nhe B\nuilding Regulation\ns\n on 6\nth\n January 2014\n.  During the \ndiscussion\n, you requested more information regarding the Quali\nfied\n Supervisor\n (QS) role and how the number of QS required \nis decided. \n&#xa0;\nTo help with you\nr\n considerations I would \nlike to make the following \nadditional \npoints:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOne specific question we were asked \nby the Select Committee wa\ns\n:  How many operatives can one Qualified Supervisor adequate\nly\n manage?\n \n \nThe level of management and supervision required is determined\n after careful consideration during the \ninitial and subsequent surveillance \nassessment \nprocess\nes\n, \nwhere the assessor will determine \nthe\n number \nrequired \nby sampling, listening, questioning and \nobserving during the assessment and by visiting a \nrepresentative\n sample\n of sites where the \nwork has been \ncompleted.\n \n \nThis assessment include\ns\n the identification, evaluation, estimation of the levels of\n risks involved\n,\n their comparison against benchmarks and \nthe \ntype of work undertaken by \nthe \ncompany\n.\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe answer may be \none \nQS \nor possibly\n \na\n significant \nnumber\n, depending on the type\n, extent\n and location of the\n company\n’s\n \nwork\n and the number of locations from which it operates\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn conclusion w\ne believe there is no objective evidence to suggest the QS system is not working and that to increase the costs and regulatory burden on electrical firms by insisting that all competent \npersons \nwho may be currently undertaking work \nunder the \nsupervis\nion of\n \na QS\n become registered is impractical\n.\n \n \nIt \nwould be costly \nand place additional burden on\n \nthe \nindustry and there is no evidence to suggest that a\nn\n \nadditional \nsafety benefit would be delivered.\n&#xa0;\nThe current framework provides the opportunity for continuous improvement\n and our suggestion to the \nCommittee \nis that the guidance criteria used for deciding the number of QS is enshrined in the\n M\ninimum \nT\nechnical \nCompetency\n requirement\n \nimposed on the scheme operators by DCLG\n, ensuring \na \nconsistent application against agreed standards.\n&#xa0;\nI hope this provides the C\nommittee with \nfurther useful information and I \nam happy to expand on any of the points raised above at the Committee\n’\ns request.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
