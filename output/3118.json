"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the \nAirport Operators Association \n(WRT 036)\n&#xa0;\nThe Airport Operators Association (AOA) is the national voice of UK airports. We are a trade association representing the interests of UK airports, and the principal such body engaging with the UK Government and regulatory authorities on airport matters. \n&#xa0;\nIn recent years, UK airports have taken significant steps – and made major investments in specialist snow clearing equipment – to improve winter resilience. For example, Manchester Airport has invested around £6 million, Aberdeen £1.3 million and Heathrow\n £32.4 million on new snow fleet equipment and staff. An AOA Snow Planning Survey, conducted in \nwinter\n 2012, shows good practice around UK airports, and is co-signed by AOA and the British Air Transport Association, the trade\n body of UK airlines, which is \nenclosed below. \n&#xa0;\nWe would therefore advise that AOA member airports have a high state of preparedness for the forthcoming winter period. While it is almost inevitable that very severe winter weather will cause disruption to all modes of transport, UK airp\norts have:\n&#xa0;\nIn addition to the above, you may also wish to note that CAA led a trial during the last \nwinter period concerned with the reporting of runway condition during winter conditions which involved both airports and airlines. Industry is currently awaiting the publication of the results of this trial but we believe that this further demonstrates our\n desire to continually improve our overall winter resilience.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;AIRPORT OPERATORS ASSOCIATION&#xa0;2012 SNOW PLANNING SURVEY&#xa0;SUMMARY OF FINDINGS&#xa0;\nIntroductionThe UK in recent years has seen increased interest\n by a number of stakeholders\n in the issue of how civil aviation \ncopes \nwith the disruption \nexceptional weather events can cause. Such exceptional events – such as snow – can impact airports, airlines, surface access transport to airports; and ultimately this affects aviation personnel, freight operations and\n, of course,\n passengers.\n&#xa0;\nIn \nearly \n201\n2, the CAA asked the aviation sector to produce a brief report which details the work UK aviation conducts to address exceptional weather events like snow. \nIn response, o\nn behalf of the UK airports sector\n,\n the Airport Operators Association \n(AOA) \nhas liaise\nd with \na number of \nits network of members to produce the following overview of the positive steps taken by airports in readiness for winter operations.\n In producing the report, AOA has worked with the British Air Transport Association (BATA) and several of\n its member airlines to ensure the findings reflect efforts made not only by airport operators but also by UK airlines. Other stakeholders – including national and local government and their agencies – also have key roles to play in ensuring airport and ai\nrline operations can continue to function during challenging winter weather conditions.\n&#xa0;\nPlease see in the pages to follow a\n list of examples of the work airports \nand airlines undertake \nto address snow events which can affect their winter operations. When \nreading this document, it is important to bear in mind that there should be no expectation that these activities are being done by all airports or \nairlines or \nindeed are appropriate for all airports \nand airlines \n– the list merely highlights the work and in\nitiatives undertaken to deal with \nadverse winter weather\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe document details examples of recent changes and good practice conducted by UK airports and airlines in three sections: operational; management; and passenger communications and welfare. Its \npurpose is to provide an indicative précis of some of the work UK airports and airlines perform where appropriate t to address the impact of snow on winter operations.\n&#xa0;\nWe thank the following airports for their assistance: Aberdeen, Belfast City, Birmingha\nm, Blackpool, Bristol, Edinburgh, Exeter, Gatwick, Glasgow, Heathrow, Leeds Bradford, Liverpool, London City, Luton, Manchester, Newcastle, Newquay Cornwall, Norwich, Prestwick, Southampton, and Stansted.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;SECTION 1: OPERATIONALEXAMPLES OF RECENT CHANGES / GOOD PRACTICESnow vehicles\nOther snow clearing equipment\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOther snow clearing equipment\n – cont.d\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWays equipment is deployed during snow disruption\nShort-term/short-notice contractor support\nClearing aircraft stands (likely to be joint with working with ground handlers) \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClearing aircraft stands (likely to be joint with working \nwith \nground handlers)\n – cont.d\nSnow disposal\nDe-icer storage\nAircraft de-icing procedures (likely to be joint with airlines)\nMonitoring of consumable stocks (eg\n.\n grit/de-icer)\nObtaining/  discussing/using weather forecasts \nSECTION 2: MANAGEMENT EXAMPLES OF RECENT CHANGES / GOOD PRACTICEManagement structures\nPermanent and temporary staffing levels \nStaff standby and mobilisation procedures\nStaff training\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nStaff training\n – cont.d\nExercises, drills and simulations\nManagement processes (for example, triggers that activate parts of snow plan)\nInternal communications and assessment of situation on ground (for example, new internal commun\n-\nication processes, increased \nuse of CCTV, or telemetry)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nInternal comm\ns and assessment of situation on ground \n(for example, new internal communi\n-\ncation processes, increased use of CCTV, or telemetry)\n – cont.d\nProcesses for flight re-scheduling or cancellation \n(joint with airlines)\nWinter Runway Assessment Trial\nSECTION 3: PASSENGER COMMUNICATIONS AND WELFAREEXAMPLES OF RECENT CHANGES / GOOD PRACTICEInforming passengers about disruption (likely to be joint with airlines)\nIn addition to traditional methods such as tannoy, information desks, and deployment of ext\nra staff giving verbal information, members reported:\nRetailer\n \np\nrovi\nsion of\n services in event o\nf disruption\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRetailer\n \np\nrovi\nsion of\n services in event of \ndisruption\n – cont.d \n&#xa0;\nWork to clarify respective airport/airline \nresponsibilities\n on the Denied Boarding Regulation -\n EC261\n (which requires airlines to\n offer meals, drinks and accommodation to stranded passengers)\n \nAirport p\nrovisions to passengers in the\n event of major disruption (eg. \nfood, drinks, wi-fi, internet  access\n, other provisions\n)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAirport p\nrovisions to \npassengers in the\n event of major disruption (eg. \nfood, \ndrinks, wi-fi, internet  access\n, other provisions\n)\n – cont.d\nWidespread provision of:\nOther examples reported are provision of:\nAirport help with hotels in the event of disruption\nAirport help with flight rebooking\n in the event of disruption – cont.d\nArrangements for onward travel\n in the event of disruption\n (\neg.\n provision of buses,\n \ncar parking arrangements)\nGenerally handled by airlines, but with airports assisting in:\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n \n14 / \n14&#xa0;\n"
