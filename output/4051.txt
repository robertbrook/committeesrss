[[[Written submission from the British Gas Service Ltd (BRC 47)]]]&#xa0;The following paper has been prepared by British Gas Services Ltd. in response to the questions raised by the Communities and local Government (CLG) Select Committee regarding electrical safety in the home and the operation of Competent Persons Schemes.

[[[&#xa0;]]]Prior to the introduction of Part P there was no formal requirement for electrical work to be assessed or registered in any way.  The safety of the public in relation to electrical installation work was reliant upon the employment of competent contractors.  The only validation of the technical competence of those contractors was via voluntary registration with one of a number of trade organisations such as the Electrical Contractors Association (ECA) or the National Inspection Council for Electrical Installing Contractors (NICEIC).&#xa0;The introduction of Part P in 2005 improved electrical safety standards by forcing contractors operating in the domestic sector to follow the industry standards and regulations. &#xa0;However following the review of Part P in 2013 and subsequent concerns raised about the scheme, The CLG Select Committee has requested responses to a number of issues.  The following document details the view of British Gas Services ltd. with regards to these issues.&#xa0;British Gas carry out electrical contracting work throughout England (Scotland and Wales) across a number of specific markets.  We operate within the industrial, commercial, domestic and residential sectors via our Electrical Services contracting business, carrying out electrical installation and maintenance work for domestic customers, Central Heating Installation business undertaking gas heating installations and upgrades and through our British Gas Business contracting teams undertaking installation work, renewable technology installation work, maintenance, repair, test and inspection services.&#xa0;We support the introduction of electrical installations as a controlled service as defined within the Building Regulations for England and any scheme aimed at improving electrical safety in domestic properties and raising awareness of the requirements for electrical safety in this sector.  As such we believe:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Select Committee]]]Prior to the introduction of Part P there was no formal requirement for electrical work to be assessed or registered in any way.  The safety of the public in relation to electrical installation work was reliant upon the employment of competent contractors.  The only validation of the technical competence of those contractors was via voluntary registration with one of a number of trade organisations such as the Electrical Contractors Association (ECA) or the National Inspection Council for Electrical Installing Contractors (NICEIC).&#xa0;The introduction of Part P in 2005 improved electrical safety standards by forcing contractors operating in the domestic sector to follow the industry standards and regulations. &#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Committee is keen to establish: the extent to which members of the public are aware of the competent persons scheme and that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations;The general awareness of the requirements for electrical work to be notified in England (Wales and Scotland operate a differing scheme) is poor.&#xa0; The proliferation of electrical accessories availability via DIY sheds like B&amp;Q, Screwfix, and Wickes adds to the belief that electrical work is predominantly a DIY activity.&#xa0;Those members of the public that are aware of the requirements to use competent electrical installers and report certain electrical work employ contractors registered with an organisation such as the NICEIC or ECA as their brands are well established and respected.&#xa0;The publicity on Part P and the requirements has tended to be aimed at the trade not the general public.  This has educated the electrical contractors who want to operate legitimately and want to promote electrical safety but appears to have little impact on the general public’s awareness.Part P work is only a fraction of the electrical installation work carried out in homes across England, the main issue is that many home owners believe electrical installation work is a low risk activity.  Educating the general public on electrical safety and the risks associated with poor installation work and encouraging them to use competent registered electrical installers on all electrical work not just that deemed to be reportable under Part P should be a priority.&#xa0;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations and the extent to which all those working for a company are brought up to the same level of skills;&#xa0;The introduction of Part P into the building regulations in 2005 created a split in the electrical trades.&#xa0; For the first time it was recognised that the full skill sets delivered via a recognised trade apprenticeship of 4 -5 years were not necessary if the person was only training to operate in a small sector of the industry known as domestic installations.&#xa0; For many years electricians had been operating in this sector that migrated from similar trades, were self taught or never completed their formal training.&#xa0; As electrical work was previously an uncontrolled service (not notifiable to building control) there was no requirement for any formal qualifications.&#xa0; &#xa0;Part P introduced a necessity for any installer carrying out work that is “reportable” under the building regulation scheme to register with a Competent Person Scheme.  This had the effect that existing installers and previously “unqualified” installers had to take recognised qualifications, improving their awareness of the wiring regulations and as a result improving the electrical installation standards and safety.  &#xa0;However, in some cases new “limited competency” qualifications were developed to allow those operating in this sector without formal qualifications to attain a recognised qualification quickly.&#xa0; These training courses ran from as little as 3 days, however their scope expanded from the provision of a recognised qualification for people already experienced to a new skill training scheme.&#xa0; The schemes became popular amongst people who never worked in the sector, they could attend a short duration course and then hold the necessary qualifications to become registered on a competent persons scheme and rewire domestic houses!  The quality of these training schemes needs to be carefully considered.&#xa0; &#xa0;The competent person scheme providers rules demand that the “Qualifying Supervisor” (QS) holds the technical qualifications and are assessed carrying out work such as testing.&#xa0; The QS is then responsible for the work undertaken by the installers he is responsible for. A QS can supervise a number of unqualified installers, the individuals may never need to be assessed.&#xa0;The two main issues with this scheme are:1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Poor levels of initial training to qualify as a Part P QS.2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Not everyone who carryout installation works on behalf of the company need hold the qualifications.&#xa0;A more robust mechanism for protection is the demand for minimum levels of competence in the form of a robust qualification along with individual registration with the CPS providers for 

[[[all]]] operatives similar to that adopted by the gas industry would improve safety and quality of domestic installations.&#xa0;There have been great strides to improve electrical competencies in the sector over the period that Part P has been in force with the Electrotechnical Assessment Scheme (EAS) and the requirements of the MTC document published on the DCLG website, (in particular Appendix 4 of the MTC) which has been developed and strengthened over the last few years.&#xa0;c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the extent to which those carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply, review or have their work reviewed to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Regulations;&#xa0;The Part P competent persons scheme requires that:&#xa0;The annual assessment of contractors is designed to ensure standards are maintained and also helps build relationships between the contractors and CPS provider.  However, there is a case for risk based assessments to be considered.  That is where a contractor has demonstrated that they work to the standards expected consistently and no issues have been identified during their annual assessments, the frequency of the assessments could be reduced.  Thus reducing the assessment burden for organisations operating in sectors with numerous annual assessment requirements.&#xa0;The Part P assessments carried out by ELECSA and the NICEIC (the CPS provider of our organisation) are conducted by assessors who are knowledgeable and highly competent.  This builds the confidence of the contractor in the CPS provider and should provide customers with assurances that the assessment process is robust.&#xa0;d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the adequacy of the review of electrical works carried out by Competent Persons;The current annual assessment of contractors is in line with similar competence schemes and electrical safety schemes in other parts of the UK.  E.g. Scotland &#xa0;However, as previously stated contractors such as ourselves would welcome a regime of assessments that are based on risk and past performance under the assessment regimes.  Thus reducing the assessment burden for organisations operating in sectors with numerous annual assessment requirements.&#xa0;e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the effect of competition between accreditation bodies, and the two separate registers of electricians, on the standards of review of domestic electrical work; and&#xa0;Competition is healthy in any sector.  It provides a mechanism for self regulation and keeps operational costs down.&#xa0;There have always been a number of CPS providers that any contractor could choose from.  The development of the two electrical contractor registers should in effect provide the same competition.  &#xa0;It should be noted that the Electrical Safety Register recently launched by the ESC &amp; ECA, for the contractors, consumers, clients and specifier’s has provided a valuable platform for anyone requiring a competent installer to utilise, safe in the knowledge that the organisations registered with those bodies are competent and offer the safe guards the schemes provide.&#xa0;We believe that the initial publicity to the general public was poor with most householders unaware of the schemes.  The two registration schemes need to work together closely to avoid the dilution of the safety messages and potentially confusion to the public.&#xa0; &#xa0;f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the adequacy of the supervision by DCLG of the accreditation schemes.We have little visibility of any supervision of the CPS providers via the DCLG.&#xa0;We are aware that each scheme operator now has to be UKAS accredited.  Our understanding of UKAS and their assessment processes provides assurance that this requirement ensures consistency and robust support processes to be in place by the CPS providers.&#xa0;This further enhances the case for scheme providers like the Certsure Ltd. (NICEIC and ECA/ ELECSA) who have achieved UKAS approval for their schemes.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
