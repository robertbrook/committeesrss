"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Combined Heat and Power Association (HOT50)The Combined Heat and Power Association (CHPA) welcomes\n the opportunity to provide written evidence to the Energy and Climate Change Committee’s inquiry on heat. \nThe \nCHPA\n is the leading advocate \nof \nan integrated approach to delivering energy services using combined heat and power and district heating and cooli\nng.\n \nThe CHPA’s response sets out key elements of \nthe \nheat \nsector \nand highlights immediate issues where policy focus would be of value. \nWe \nwould also welcome the opportunity to provide oral evidence to the Committee. \nAccounting for half of \nUK\n energy demand, h\neat is central to the energy debate\n. \nIf we are t\no achieve our decarbonisation \ncommitments\n,\n \nreducing emissions from heat \nmust \nbe at the heart of energy policy.\n \nDECC’s creatio\nn of a heat directorate in 2011, and the publication of \nH\neat \nS\ntrateg\nies\n \nin \n201\n2 and 201\n3 \ndemonstrates \nGovernment\n’s growing\n \nrecogni\ntion\n \nof \nthe importance of heat\n. \nHeat policy must focus on the needs of the consumerWhile p\nower is a standardised commodity\n,\n heat is highly \nspecific \nto the consumer\n’s requirements\n. \nFor example, h\nomes\n and offices \nneed low-temperature heat for heating and hot water\n, while\n \ni\nndustries need high temperature heat for industrial processes. \nThe difficulty \nof transporting \nheat \nover long\n distances ensures heat generation is always \ngenerated \nlocal\nly\n and\n, therefore,\n \ninvolves a close relationship with the final \nuser\n.\n \nH\neat \npolicy\n, therefore,\n requires\n a more\n decentralised\n and\n \nuser\n-orientated \napproach\n. \nWith \nsuch an \napproach, it becomes clear that there \nis no \none \nsolution for decarbonising \nUK\n \nheat\n. Rather \na\n \nsuite of technologies \nis needed\n,\n \neach\n tailored to \nspecific users’ \nneeds.\n \nAn integrated systems approach controls costs for consumersWith an increased use of elec\ntricity for energy needs, including heat and transport, there is a pressing need to consider how different energy needs interact. \nThe 2013 Heat Strategy recognises the \nenergy system’s \ncomplex nature and recognises that a more cost-effective system will ari\nse when all energy uses are better integrated.\n \nBy using tools such as thermal\n \nstores, a more integrated energy system \ncan \nhelp reduce overall costs by better managing electricity demand and supply\n.\n \nWithout considering heat and power \ntogether\n, the UK risks\n creating a very expensive, inefficient energy system.\nEnergy efficiency links key options for decarbonising heatT\nhere are many technologies\n \nwhich\n can offer low carbon heat \nincluding generation technologies like \nheat pumps, solar\n thermal\n, \ncombined heat \nand power (\nCHP\n)\n.\n \nHowever, w\nhatever generation solution is deployed, energy efficiency \nacross generation, delivery \ninfrastructure, \nand final demand\n is key\n. \nCurrently,\n \nt\nhe high temperatures required by \nindustrial \nprocesses \nare\n \nmostly \nprovid\ned by individual gas-fired boilers\n or CHP\n, but with an increasing role for bio\nenergy\n.\n \nT\nhe relatively high cost of electricity makes it \nprohibitively \nexpensive\n \nfor widespread \nindustrial \nheat generation\n.\n \nElectrically\n-generated heat \nis \nneeded for some \nprocesses such as iron and \naluminium\n smelting\n where the high temperatures required cannot be \nreadily \nachieved by other means\n.\n \nEnergy efficiency sits at the heart of industrial heat decarbonisation F\nor medium temperature industrial heat needs, fossil and \nbioenergy\n will remain the key sources for cost-effective heat\n in the medium term\n. \nBut these\n energy options pose challenges as well. \nT\nhe \nbiomass sup\nply chain is immature\n,\n \ncreat\ning\n \nsecurity of supply concerns for industry. \nUsers\n of f\nossil fuel\ns \nare exposed \nto price volatility\n.\n \nCarbon \nc\napture and \ns\ntorage remains a future option, but is \ncurrently \ntoo expensive for industry in the medium term.\n \nA focus on energy efficiency is therefore vital to reduce emissions from industrial heat. The key \nefficiency \ntechnolog\ny that is underexploited in UK industry remains combined heat and power\n,\n which delivers a reductio\nn in fuel use of up to 30%\n. \nC\nombined heat and\n power (CHP)\n is sourced from gas, biomass, biogas and energy from waste.\n As an energy \nefficiency technology, CHP rec\nonciles major issues including\n:\n \nPlease see the \nCHPA’s response to the \nEnergy and Climate Change \nCommittee’s Gas Generation Strategy inquiry\n for \nmore detail on CHP benefits.\nDECC Heat Strategy makes the case for targeted support for new gas CHP DECC estimates an economic potential for more than 18 GW of CHP in the UK, almost triple current capacity. \nHowever, t\nhe Heat Strategy recognised that gas CHP\n requires \na \npolicy mechanism \nfor it to achieve its potential \nin decarbonising the \nUK energy system. \nT\nhe \nStrategy \ntherefore made \nthe welcome \ncommit\nment\n to \ndevelo\np\n \na bespoke \ngas fired \nCHP policy to support \nCHP’s \ndeployment\n.\nCHP\nA\n members are\n \nwork\ning\n \nclosely \nwith DECC on \nits\n \nanalysis \nof \npolicy options\n for its ‘bespoke policy’. \nIndustry \ncurrently \nregards \noptions to either incentivise\n CHP \nfor \nthe energ\ny savings it delivers, or a feed-\nin tariff for efficiently generated \nCHP-produced electricity heat\n,\n \nas \nhaving \nthe \ngreatest potential.\n \nHowever, the Government has not yet committed a dedicated budget for its bespoke CHP policy. This lack of financial commitment must be addressed to ensure investor confidence is created.Existing gas CHP capacity faces challengesThe \nproposed\n \nCHP \npolicy is \nspecifically \nlimited \nto supporting new CHP capacity, and does not recognise \nthe Government’s £\n11\n0m\n to £165m annual\n tax rise\n on CHP operators \ncreated \nby the \nearly\n removal of \nCHP’s LEC\ns\n.\n \nAt the time of the \nLECs \ndecision, t\nhe Government \nindicated \na solution would be found, but n\no action \nwas taken \nto return this value to existing CHP operators\n. \nThe impact of this decision, which was implemented in April 2013, is now starting to hit British industry and undermine the competitiveness of \nCHP\n sites\n. \nSome CHP \noperators \nare reducing \nth\neir \nCHP \ngeneration\n \nbecause, with the \nremoval\n of LECs and the addition of Carbon Price Support, it is no longer economical to \noperate\n.\n \nDamaged investor confidence limits new CHP investmentM\nuch of the expected investment for new CHP installations will likely come from those companies which operate existing CHP. \nThe CHPA is\n aware of a number of companies who \nare hesitant \nto invest in CHP again because of the Government’s \ndecision \nto remove \nLEC\ns. For example, \nE.ON\n has stated that\n the removal of LECs has not given “much encouragement to take further investment”\n. \nIf investors attach higher risks to CHP projects, it will raise \nthe cost to industry, business and taxpayers. \nSupport investment and competitiveness with Carbon Price Support relief T\no address the twin concerns of investor confidence and existing CHP operation, t\nhere is a need for DECC to urgently consider\n returning the value lost to CHP operators from the removal of LECs\n.\n \nA simple, direct way to restore investor confidence is to give CHP plant relief from Carbon Price Support, equal in value to the LECs, helping the Government to meet its original 2011 commitment.Current support levels for renewable CHP-generated heat appears to be sufficient to bring forward new investment, but the Government \nhas \nnot introduce\nd\n a mechanism to allow investors to ‘lock in’ the value of the RHI payments when \ninvestments \nreach financi\nal close.\n \nWithout \nsuch a \nmechanism, \ncalled \nEnhanced\n \nPreliminary Accreditation\n,\n \nmore than £1.5 billion in renewable CHP investments\n are ‘very unlikely’ to come forward\n, according to a survey of CHPA members. \nThe RHI needs an enhanced preliminary accreditation scheme as a matter of urgency if large-scale renewable investments are not to be put at risk. High-temperature heat, as used by industry\n or power stations\n, can often be re-used for low-temperature demands, such as housing. \nEither on t\nhe same site or via a network, proce\nsses requiring high temperature heat\n can pass lower temperature ‘waste’ heat to a secondary user.\nMore than half of energy wasted in power generationPower generation wastes most of its heat through cooling towers, losing valuable efficiency and savings, and even the most efficient gas power plants \nwaste \nhalf\n of the energy they consume\n.\n \nCHPA analysis found p\nower stations waste more energy from their coo\nling towers than the total\n UK\n \ngas \ndemand for heating\n.\nAcross Europe, \nthe amount of waste heat \nfrom thermal power generation \nis\n substantial. \nOne academic study estimates \nwaste heat from thermal generation \nadd\ns\n \nup to \nnearly 2\n,000\n \nT\nWh \nannually\n (enough to \nmee\nt\n \ntotal \nUK \nheat demand two and a half \ntimes over)\n, with o\nnly \n17% \nof \nthat energy captured and \nrecycled.\n \nChallenge of linking industrial heat to demandDespite improving the efficiency of industrial processes, reducing and reusing waste products, there is \noften low temperature heat (below 100°C) which has no further industrial application.\n Total \npotential recoverable industrial \nheat \nin Europe \nis estimated at over \n580 \nT\nWh \nannually\n, or about 80% of total UK heat demand\n.\nIn \nan\n \nintegrated \nenergy system\n, this w\naste heat\n from power production and industry\n can be supplied to a community heat network for local homes, public and commercial buildings\n at low cost and zero carbon, as occurs in Dunkirk\n, France\n.\n \nCrucially, Dunkirk’s \nscheme design was \nchampioned by\n \ncit\ny \nleaders\n and\n \nw\nithout \nsimilar \ncoordination, \nwaste heat \nopportunities are lost\n. \nFor example, w\ne are aware of UK \ncases where\n \nhousing developers install individual gas boilers rather t\nhan access\n available waste heat from local industry.\nRecoverable heat assessment welcome, but coordination is keyWe welcome \nDECC\n’s commitment to \nassess the technical and economic potential for re-use of recovered hea\nt and to \nexplore incentives for use \nof recoverable\n heat. \nHowever, there are a number of institutional challen\nges to linking this heat to demand. Recovering waste heat requires partnerships which do not naturally or currently exist between industry, local authorities, and housing developers. \nThe development of a waste heat incentive, alongside increased coordination, is necessary to exploit this potentially valuable resource. More ambition needed for industrial steam networks policyAggregating industrial energy users into \nclusters \ncan allow steam \nnetworks to serve multiple sites\n,\n increas\ning\n efficiency and \ncompet\nitiveness\n. \nVitally, i\nndustrial clusters would allow future carbon capture and storage \n(CCS) \ninfrastructure to be concentrated at \nkey\n sites with costs shared among several users. These industrial clusters may also serve to attract new industry through reduc\ned energy costs\n.\nThe Heat Strategy notes the industrial clustering opportunity, but unfortunately does not propose how to develop this policy further. H\nouseholders, businesses and public sector organisations \nneed affordable heating, hot water and, increasingly, cooling\n in commercial buildings\n.\n \nCurrently, individual gas-fired boilers predominate but this will need to evolve as \nvillages, \ntowns and cities decarbonise.\nFor lower density areas\n \nindividual heating so\nlutions are more appropriate. The starting point should be considering \nbuilding efficiency\n and then\n generation\n technologies\n including \nindividual \nheat pumps\n,\n \nmicroCHP\n (gas, LPG and eventually biogas) and wood boilers. \nLarge public sector and commercial bui\nldings are increasingly turning to small-scale CHP, which allow them to save carbon and reduce waste. The number of CHP schemes below 10MW increased nearly 50% in the last four years, from 1,257 in 2008 to 1,860 in 2012.\n An example is the\n 1.1MW CHP plant \ninstalled in Birmingham Heartlands Hospital in June 2008 \nwhich \nsaves £650,000 \nannually \nand reduces CO\n2\n emissions by 8,000 tonnes per year. \nHigh density urban areas are characterised by space restrictions and high land values\n. Air quality and noise \nregulations limit the suitability of individual solutions such as heat pumps or biomass boilers.\n \nH\nigher densities, however, make community solutions servicing households, commercial and public sector buildings potentially more cost-effective than individua\nl ones.\nWhilst it is vital to seek to reduce heat demand, it is also critical to look at the efficiency of heat supply. \nHeat networks \nare pipe infrastructure that \ndeliver heating or cooling\n,\n generated communally\n,\n to homes and b\nusinesses, rather than generating heat \nat\n \nindividual properties\n.\n \nThis \nnetwork\n infrastructure facilitates gains in\n economies of scale \nin heat generation\n \nand \nis \nefficient, flexible and easily upgradeable.\nH\neat networks\n can \nincorporate\n \na range of different \nhe\nat sources\n,\n \nincluding \nheat pumps, solar thermal, boilers (both renewable and fossil fuelled), CHP (both renewable and fossil fuelled), geothermal, waste heat or energy from waste – some \noptions \nof which cannot be harnessed at an individual building level. \nBenefits of district heating to consumersT\nhe UK Committee on Climate Change \nrecognises\n that\n district heating, using \nlow carbon generation\n or waste heat\n in high density area\ns\n,\n \nis \none of the most cost effective \nforms of \ncarbon abatement\n, and\n \nacademic \nstudies have\n found \nthat\n \nin urban areas, \ndistrict hea\nting is a cheaper solution \nthan\n \nother options\n.\n \nThis cost effectiveness means a lower cost for consumers and taxpayers. \nWhether serving public or private rented sector or \nowner\n-\noccupiers district heating\n is steadily growing, in cities like London, Sheffield and Nottingham, saving carbon \nand\n combat\ning\n fuel poverty.\n \nHeat networks \nalso \nremove\n the need for the property owner to maintain, and ultimately replace, \na \nboiler.\nIndustry protecting consumers with proposals for independent regulation Recognising that heat customers should be afforded protection of comparable levels to those in the regulated gas and electricity sectors\n,\n the CHPA, on behalf of the district heating i\nndustry, \nis\n facilitating the development of an Independent Heat Customer Protection scheme for domestic and micro-business customers. \nA\nn independent steering committee, with representatives from consumer groups, government and the district heating industry\n, \nare developing \nproposals\n and after \npublic consultation, \naim to \nestablish \na\n scheme in 2014.\nThe Government’s Heat Strategy ruled out regulation for heat networks and announced that Government “will seek to endorse an industry-led consumer protection schem\ne”. \nDECC’s support will be a critical component of the Independent Heat Customer Protection scheme’s success.\nParticipation in the customer protection scheme should be a condition for local authorities to receive support from HNDU and other programmes.Government recognises key role of local authoritiesLocal authorities are central to the development of new district heating networks\n, acting\n as brokers between key agencies, owning critical heat demand\n, and\n through Planning and street works permissions. Deve\nlopers are unlikely to risk initiating city-wid\ne schemes, so local authorities’ \nlong\n-\nterm strategic view of heat, developing heat masterplans to facilitate interconnected networks\n, are important\n. \nWe \ntherefore \nwelcome the commitment to \nlaunch the Heat Netwo\nrk Delivery Unit\n (HNDU)\n, a \n‘\nhand-\nholding\n’\n service for local authorities.\nHowever, we have outlined four other key measures which would help \nsti\nmulate heat network development, both in the short term and long term, below.\nOnce the development stages of a project have been undertaken and a project is deemed viable, \nit may still be difficult \nto secure adequate funding at appropriate interest rates. Whilst the low but steady returns a heat network \ncan deliver are well suited to \nlow-risk \ninvestors such as pension fund\ns\n, \ndistrict heating schemes can be too small to meet \nthese funds\n’\n \nminimum investment \nthresholds.\n \nA national fund, as proposed under Allowable Solutions, would provide a professionally-managed concentration of capital at a suitable scale for cost-effective, community-scale schemes such as heat networks. While district heating is eligible under two targeted householder carbon reduction schemes, it does not currently receive any bespoke support from Government. \nGovernment should consider ways to encourage renewable district heating, potentially including supporting renewable district heating under the renewable heat incentive after its 2014 review.3. Use planning requirements to drive district heating investmentsPlanning requirements are currently driving deployment of net\nworks in new build developments, \nlocal authorit\ny-\ninitiated schemes in social housing blocks\n,\n or \ncity-centre developments \nencompassing a diverse mix of buildings.\n \nUnfortunately these planning-led carbon emission investments are being undermined \nby \nunambitious\n targets under Part L of the 2014 \nBuilding Regulations\n and the proposed removal of the Planning and Energy Act 2008.\nIt is important that these important planning levers are retained. 4. Develop wider, longer-term vision for future heat networksThe Gover\nnment’s Heat Strategy recognised the role of district heating as a route to decarbonise heat where suitable heat density exists. \nDECC \nmodelling estimates \nan economic \npotential \nof \n20% of domestic heating and hot water demand met by heat networks in 2030\n.\n \nDistrict heat scheme investments are made on \n6\n0-year timetables,\n and\n if the Government’s aim to significantly expand the amount of heat delivered through networks is\n to be\n \nrealised\n, it will require a step change in deployment levels and more long-term thin\nking.\nGovernment needs to lay out its long-term vision and policy for district heating.September 2013\n&#xa0;\n DECC,\n 2013. \nFuture of Heating: Meeting the challenge\n. \n DECC, 2013. \nFuture of Heating: Meeting the challenge\n.\n \nHMRC Notice CCL1/2\n,\n J\nuly 2010\n.\n \nhttp://www.chpa.co.uk/medialibrary/2013/01/31/6c93a612/CHPA%20Expression%20of%20Interest%20to%20Committee%20Inquiry\n%20on%20Gas%20Generation%20Strategy.pdf\n \nhttp://www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget2012/ootlar-main.pdf\n \nEnvironmental Audit Committee, 2013, HM Treasury: Planning for econom\nic infrastructure, Q60.\n \n Based on data available from \nDigest of UK Energy Statistics\n (DUKES)\n, 2012.\n Euroheat and Power, 2013. \nHeat Roadmap Europe: Pre-Study II.  \n Euroheat and Power, 2013. \nHeat Roadmap Europe: Pre-Study II.  \n See case study in 2013 Heat Strategy\n. \n \nDigest of United Kingdom Energy Statistics (DUKES), 2013.\n \nUK Committee on Climate Change (2010) \nFourth Carbon Budget\n \nEuroheat and Power, 2013. \nHeat Roadmap Europe: Pre-Study II.\n  \n \n \nwww.gov.uk/government/publications/the-f\nuture-of-heating-meeting-the-challenge\n p45\n"
