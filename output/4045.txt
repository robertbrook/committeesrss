[[[Supplementary evidence submitted by Natural Resources Wales (ESG 36)]]]&#xa0;At the Welsh Affairs Select Committee session on 22 October, I agreed to write to you clarifying the approach of Natural Resources Wales to the separation offunctions in relation to energy development on our estate and the Welsh GovernmentWoodland estate.&#xa0;The Board of Natural Resources Wales has agreed a set of principles in relation to the separation of functions and is committed to working in an open and transparent way.  We have put in place measures to ensure that there is clear separation of functions in relation to our duties on SEA and HRA (see attached summary note).&#xa0;In relation to energy developments on our and the Welsh Government woodlands estate, the team that liaises with developers to establish lease agreements operate separately from those teams who provide statutory advice to Local Authorities and advice to our permitting service.  Attached to this letter is our latest high level organogram, annotated to make show where the various teams involved with onshore oil and gas are located.&#xa0;We are clear that any onshore oil and gas developments on our own or the Welsh Government woodland estate will be developed by a third party who will have to meet the same regulatory standards as any other developer.  The applications will be dealt with in an open and transparent way in line with our regulatory process. If anyonshore oil and gas developer holding a PEDL licence doesn’t meet our regulatorystandards, then a permit application will be rejected.  This risk is borne by the developer.&#xa0;We are putting in place a process to screen all energy developments on our estate and the Welsh Government Woodland estate, to identify at an early stage the range of environmental issues that will have to be considered.  This will minimise the risk of schemes being rejected at a late stage in the process because of failure to address a critical environmental issue.&#xa0;I trust this clarifies the position for you, but if you need any further information please do not hesitate to contact me.  In the meantime, if you have any questions about our approach to onshore oil and gas, please contact Dr Sarah Williams, who is leading on this area for us.&#xa0;

[[[s)]]]&#xa0;Natural Resources Wales has multiple roles in respect of SEA and plan-level HRA. We can be:&#xa0;&#xa0;In our roles as relevant nature conservation body (HRA- plans) and consultation body (SEA) for the plans and programmes of other authorities, as well as for our own plans and programmes that require either SEA or HRA (plans) we have a number of statutory roles and non-statutory including;&#xa0;&#xa0;As well as these specific roles in respect of SEA and HRA, we have many other roles and duties arising from our role as land  and natural resource managers/project developers/operators and as the Regulators for some 30+ regulatory regimes. For SEA, there is European caselaw ( the ‘Seaport’ case) that requires the ‘functional separation’, where Natural Resources Wales or any other authority is both the‘responsible authority (plan maker) and statutory consultant body.&#xa0;Mindful of this complexity, but with a clear line of sight on the strategic case for NRW to function as a single organisation, with integrated teams adopting an ecosystem approach to support fully integrated decision making in pursuit of our purpose, the NRW Board adopted a number of high level principles to help manage thesepotential tensions. These principles include:&#xa0;&#xa0;In response to our responsibilities and these principles, a ‘functionally separate’ Strategic Assessment team has been established within the Governance Directorate of NRW. This team’s primary role is to fulfil the statutory consultee role for the SEA of NRW’s own plans and programmes (legally required by Seaport ruling).  However, based on the strong interdependencies between the SEA and HRA (plans)processes, Welsh Government and the Board maintain that this team should also fulfil the relevant nature conservation body role on HRA(plans) for NRW’s internal plans.&#xa0;For those plans, programmes and projects produced by Responsible authorities external to NRW, the consultant body role for SEA (programmes and plans) and HRA (plans and projects) is provided by either the Knowledge and Evidence Directorate or the relevant Operations Directorate, according to the type of plan, programme or project (national/sectoral or regional respectively).&#xa0;Where NRW’s input to a plan or programme is substantial, through technical advice interfacing directly with plan making, and/or when the relationship to the Responsible authority for the plan is close (e.g. the Welsh Government), it has been viewed as helpful for the Governance Strategic Assessment team to fulfil the statutory consultee role in these instances. We have chosen (rather than be required by legal precedent or Board direction) to adopt this mode of operation for two cases only since 1 April2013. Firstly, for the M4 Relief road where Welsh Government is the Responsible authority; and secondly for the Welsh Government’s Water Strategy. In the first case, this has enabled the Operations team to maximise their participation and input to the plan development and its relevant assessments, while establishing transparency during the formal consultation processes. Both teams are operating to the same guidance and using the same evidence base, including technical expertise.&#xa0;In light of experience, NRW will review the effectiveness of this particular mode of operation in fulfilling our roles and responsibilities.&#xa0;26 November 2013&#xa0;
