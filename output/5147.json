"Written evidence  from Japan Tobacco International [TOB15]\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Organisation name&#xa0;\nJapan Tobacco International (\nJTI). \n&#xa0;\nJTI is part of the Japan Tobacco group of companies, a leading international tobacco product manufacturer. \n&#xa0;\nJTI’s UK headquarters is in Weybridge, Surrey, and its manufacturing facility is in Lisnafillan, Northern Ireland, where it has a long-standing and significant presence. JTI’s cigarette brand portfolio includes Benson &amp; Hedges, Silk Cut, Winston, Camel, Mayfair, \nSterling\n, Sovereign and more, as well as a number of other tobacco products including cigars (such as Hamlet), roll-your-own tobacco (such as Amber Leaf) and pipe tobacco (such as Condor).\n&#xa0;\nGallaher Limited is the registered trading company of JTI in the UK.\n&#xa0;              Confidentiality &#xa0;JTI is happy for this response to be made public\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\nWhy the number of arrests, prosecutions and convictions for tobacco smuggling have f\nallen over the past three years\nWhy Border Force failed to meet its operational targets for tobacco seizure in 2012–13\n(a) \n              \nMethods of smuggling tobacco into the UK are varied and variable, making detection and seizure a challenging process\n.\n(b) \n              \nSeizures outside of the UK have gone up and Sir Charles suggests that this should mean less illicit tobacco is making its way into the UK.  In this regard, we note that work undertaken by HMRC outside the UK through its network of Fiscal Crime Liaison Officers has prevented illicit tobacco products from reaching UK borders. Overall cigarette seizures, regardless \nof \nwhere they take place (e.g. inland, border and overseas), have remained consistently high at between 1.7 and 1.9 billion cigarettes per annum over the past five years.  \nThere has also been an upward trend in the amount of HRT seized over the same period.\n(c) \n              \nTwo UK Border Force initiatives failed to deliver as anticipated. \nWhether the current sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are appropriate\nThe similarities and differences in patterns of tobacco smuggling in the UK and Ireland, how they affect each other, and the implications of the restrictions on National Crime Agency\n operations in Northern Ireland\nThe possible impact of the introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK\n(a) \n              \nIllicit trade is inherently difficult to measure (both in terms of existing levels, changes over time and the causes of those changes).\n(b)\n              \nAustralia is the only country in the world which has plain packaging in place and it is too early to assess in a meaningful sense the impacts of plain packaging there.\n \n \n              \n \n(c) \n              \nThere is, as far as JTI is aware, no established/recognised research base on the actual impacts (in terms of illicit trade or otherwise) on a neighbouring state of another having such a measure in place.\n \nIt is right therefore that this Committee has called for evidence in respect of \"the possible impact\" of the introduction of plain packaging in Ireland on the illicit trade in tobacco in the UK and JTI has provided below its best assessment of such impacts. \nReduced costs burdens for illicit traders\n“\n[P]\nlain packaging is highly likely to aggravate the existing negative impacts of the already serious and socially damaging trade in illicit tobacco. Since illicit products are often more accessible to those underage and those from low income groups, plain pack laws risk undermining a key objective of plain packaging: to reduce smoking by these groups\n.\n”\nThe pre-existing impact of Irish illicit trade on the UK\n“[Crime groups]\n have already recognised a porous land border, and that is a weakness that we in law enforcement have to eradicate. We have a huge challenge on the island of Ireland as a whole, particularly around organised crime and serious harm, be it drugs or human trafficking in all its guises\n.”\n“\n… once you have established a route that you are confident you can use, in essence it does not much matter what the commodity is. Whether it is people, firearms, cigarettes or fuel, if the route is secure, then anything can be smuggled\n.”\n \nAnticipated impact on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK\nNew smuggling opportunities for criminals“\nIn December 2009, the Irish Minister of Finance announced that the government: “decided not to make any changes to excise on tobacco in this Budget because [the Minister of Finance] believe[s] the high price is now giving rise to massive cigarette smuggling”.\n”\nIncreased consumer complicity The impacts of increased criminality in the UK \n“\nChildren who buy cheap tobacco can come into contact with criminals. Some children are talked into selling cheap cigarettes on to school mates. People selling cheap tobacco are more likely to be selling other things illegally (DVDs, alcohol), exposing our children to more dangers\n.”\n   \nThe relationship between tobacco smuggling, organised \ncrime and paramilitary activity\nConclusion\n \n&#xa0;JTI29 August 2013&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Given the limitation on the length of submissions to the Inquiry, JTI have sought only to address the specific questions raised by the Committee.  JTI notes, however, that there are diverging views about the current illicit trade in tobacco products and how plain packaging risks exacerbating it, as reflected by criticism of JTI's related 2012 media campaign by certain tobacco control groups which were, in part, upheld by the ASA.  JTI disagrees with the ASA's conclusions and remains of the view that these adverts provide an important contribution to the political debate.\n Based on Empty Pack Surveys (\nEPS).  The EPS involves the physical collection of discarded empty cigarette packs. Upon collection, samples are either sent to independent or manufacturer laboratories for analysis as to their authenticity. In 2012, around 25,000 packs were collected from 105 sample points across the UK.\n \n£34.66 billion for the years 2001/2 to 2010/11 based on HMRC’s upper estimates.\n The Taylor Report on Tobacco Smuggling was prepared by Martin Taylor for the then Chancellor, Gordon Brown.\n Separately, JTI have produced a number of documents that address the issue of illicit trade in more detail and we would be happy to provide the Committee with copies of these.  Such documents include our “Response to the Department of Health’s Consultation on the Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products”, July 2012 (available at \nhttp://www.jti.com/files/4013/4149/4323/Packaging_Response.pdf\n), and “The Billion Pound Drop”, October 2012 (available at \nhttp://www.jti.com/files/2413/5220/4070/The_Billion_Pound_Drop_website_version.pdf\n).  JTI has also commissioned expert evidence to assess the impacts of plain packaging on tobacco products: “The Impact of Plain Packaging on the Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, June 2012” (available at \nhttp://www.jti.com/files/5113/4150/5828/Impact_on_illicit_trade.pdf\n) by Professors Peggy Chaudhry and Zimmerman (the \nZimmerman Report).

As at the date of this report, the exchange rates and the increase in duty mean that the UK is the most expensive market in the EU\n”.\n “\nNorthern Ireland has witnessed an unprecedented wave of international migration...
