[normal]Summary of the main points
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We welcome this inquiry
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]capacity and 
[normal]efficiency of the strategic road network 
[normal]are
[normal] central to the success of ports.  The British Ports Association (BPA) represents 48 ports in England, all of which will depend on the adequacy of their links to the UK road network.  All the indications are that road usage for both freight and passengers 
[normal]will increase, and this is a 
[normal]conclusion
[normal] of the DfT’s 
[normal]Road T
[normal]ranspo
[normal]rt F
[normal]orecast 2013.  
[normal]Currently, two-thirds of all goods are transported to and from ports by road.  I
[normal]n spite of 
[normal]this
[normal] reliance 
[normal]on road not just for ports but for the economy generally
[normal], in compar
[normal]ison with other member states our road network compares poorly and, in the words of the DfT’s “Action for Road
[normal]s
[normal]: A Network 
[normal]for
[normal] the 21
[normal]st
[normal] Century”, while the strategic road network compared well with competitors 20 years ago, “it now falls a long 
[normal]way 
[normal]short” 
[normal](para 1
[normal].
[normal]10).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The UK’s road infrastructure is vital as an enabler of economic activity of which the port sector  represents a very significant part.  An Oxford Economics report published in December 2012 showed that in 2011 UK ports contributed £7.9bn to U
[normal]K GDP and supported 391,800 jobs. They handle 95% 
[normal]of
[normal] import and export trade by volume and so their connectivity will have an influence far beyond the port gates.  Economic conditions since 2007 and the weakening of demand subsequently ha
[normal]ve
[normal] had an impact o
[normal]n port volumes  
[normal]which
[normal] rose to a peak of 600m tonnes in 2005
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]They 
[normal]are now at a level of just over 500m tonnes.  Nevertheless, tonnage forecasts which 
[normal]are set out as part of the 2012 National Policy Statement for ports indicate a doubling of ro-ro traffic 
[normal]and an increase o
[normal]f
[normal] 182% in container traffic between 
[normal]now
[normal] and 2030.  As the “Action for Roads” 
[normal]paper
[normal] points out, demand will return and port volumes 
[normal]will 
[normal]increase accordingly.  
[normal]A fit for purpose road network will be required to accommodate that demand.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We very much welcome the principles and 
[normal]objectives in the “Action for Roads” paper.  It shows a clear commitment to investment in the network, to improve the way in which it is managed and to environmental gains.  W
[normal]e
[normal] also support the recognition of the need for long term strategies and for great
[normal]er certainty about spending commitments.  Taken at face value, we do not doubt that if these policies were implemented they would produce improvements
[normal],
[normal] but the track record of all governments in 
[normal]securing
[normal] consistency for transport spending and planning has 
[normal]been weak.  We note that the recent CBI study of UK infrastructure finds that successive governments have been “dithering over delivery”.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Any d
[normal]iscussion about transport inevitably come
[normal]s
[normal] back to budgets and it is here that we find the outlook for the net
[normal]work extremely concerning.  For example, a National Audit Office report for 2012 noted that although the DfT’s funding, which provides around 60% of capital funding for transport has remained stable, there has been a 28% fall in grants from the DCLG.  The 
[normal]Audit Commission reported in 2011 that there is “a significant but unquantifiable backlog of maintenance work needed to get local highways to a sustainable level”.  Since then we have had extreme weather events which can only have made the problem worse.  
[normal]Another important unknown is the effectiveness of the new regional 
[normal]arrangements
[normal] following the demise of RDAs and the setting 
[normal]up 
[normal]of Local Transport Boards (LTBs).  It is too early to judge the effectiveness of LTBs.  When they were launched a year ago, 
[normal]it
[normal] w
[normal]as 
[normal]alongside
[normal] 
[normal]a very ambitious timetable with, for example, a deadline of December 2012 for LTBs to 
[normal]confirm
[normal] their governance and financial 
[normal]arrangements
[normal], effectively allowing three months to do so
[normal].  There are no guarantees that funding 
[normal]is
[normal] available to LTBs w
[normal]hich might have failed to
[normal] meet this strict timetable.  We have had mixed reports
[normal] 
[normal]about the extent to which LTBs have managed to comply, but a consistent message, in spite of the upbeat summary provided in “Action for Roads” is that there is strong competit
[normal]ion for a very limited pot of money.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On the basis that
[normal],
[normal] as “Action for Roads” points out,
[normal] locally managed roads make 
[normal]up 
[normal]98% of 
[normal]the
[normal] road network and that almost every journey starts or ends on a local road, the 
[normal]respective 
[normal]role
[normal]s
[normal] of LTBs
[normal], LEPs and
[normal] local auth
[normal]orities 
[normal]are
[normal] absolutely crucial.  
[normal]W
[normal]e can only support (para 
[normal]5.3
[normal]) the commitment to tackling maintenance and other local road network issue
[normal]s,
[normal] but doubts have to remain as to whether 
[normal]sufficient funds
[normal] will be available and whether local arrangements are 
[normal]fully 
[normal]in place
[normal].  We
[normal] also support the principles underlining the creation of the Road Investment Strategy (RIS) setting out plans for construction and maintenance for 2021 and
[normal] beyond.  However, we also note
[normal] that the government is relying on achieving savings of u
[normal]p to 20% on maintenance and improvement work by allowing suppliers to commit to “innovative working methods”.  20% represents a sizeable figure and there must be uncertainty as to whether such savings can be delivered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Although ports in themselves are not a mode, they are of course servicing the maritime logistics chain and there needs to be recognition of the impacts that concentrations of trade will have on the r
[normal]oad network.  To a 
[normal]reasonable
[normal] degree, we believe that this recognition is there and BPA members, for example, are encouraged to produce port masterplans which identify where road improvements are required and the effects that port traffic are likely to hav
[normal]e
[normal] on the network
[normal] in the future.  
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]drawing up
[normal] of marine plans which will identify the main areas of coastal activity
[normal],
[normal] should be helpful to planners in establishing where the main traffic flows are or are likely to be.
[normal]  Rather than the main network, it is
[normal] often the final legs of journeys which create delay and congestion. We support higher investment in a range of 
[normal]local repair, maintenance and improvement schemes to improve road connectivity and allow the UK’s collective port assets to be used optimally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are not in a position to comment in detail on the Government’s forecast but we do agree with the general premise that with increases in population and growth of the economy, inevitably there will be growth in road traffic.  But even if there were to be 
[normal]no substantial growth this 
[normal]would
[normal] not remove the need for substantial investment in the current network
[normal],
[normal] simply to ensure that current bottlenecks 
[normal]are
[normal] removed and the network 
[normal]i
[normal]s properly maintained.  We note in para 1.22 
[normal]of the traffic forecast paper 
[normal]the co
[normal]mment that fuel efficiency improvements should have the effect of “significant
[normal]ly
[normal] decreasing the fuel 
[normal]cost 
[normal]of driving”.  This also contains an assumption about future taxation; if fuel costs were to decline as the forecast
[normal]s
[normal] predict, 
[normal]there may be temptation
[normal] 
[normal]to raise fuel 
[normal]duty in response
[normal].  All forecasts have to acknowledge the vast number of unknown factors, but in broad terms we do accept the conclusions of the Government’s forecast in their July 2013 paper.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have already referred to the
[normal] overriding need for the right investment, but we also believe that better signage, real time information on traffic flows and other traffic 
[normal]management initiatives can make significant differences.
[normal]  Paras 1.16 to 1.20 provide a good summary of the technical advances that will become available in the near future.  All these are extremely welcome in terms of environmental protection and safety, b
[normal]ut the advantages will be minimized if, as a result of congestion and under-investment by 2040 (as “Action for Roads” points out) almost a quarter of all travel time could be spent 
[normal]“
[normal]stuck in traffic
[normal]” (fig 1.5)
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have two issues to raise here.  Firstly, the obvious mechanism and which is now being actively looked at
[normal] is road tolling.  In the absence of other forms of private investment, this may become the only option if new infrastructure is to be created.  Specific schemes with clear objectives and with the most significant advantages could be considered, but a whol
[normal]esale change to tolling of the motorway network along the lines operated in France, would not only increase costs significantly, but 
[normal]will
[normal] have 
[normal]consequences for
[normal] the rest of the network.  For ports, assessment
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]are already
[normal] made of what contribution a port ca
[normal]n make to a road or rail development linked to a port development.  So the ports industry itself is 
[normal]potentially 
[normal]subject to extra cost.  On
[normal]e of the results of the recent Port Sector S
[normal]trategy 
[normal]document 
[normal]is an undertaking to review this arrangement.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Secondly
[normal], we believe that the Government should make much stronger efforts to ensure that the Trans European Network for transport (TEN-T) could also be used to fund road improvements.  Our understanding of the changes in the new TEN-T legislation is that apart fr
[normal]om very specific road schemes strongly linked to environmental improvement, there 
[normal]will
[normal] be no funding from TEN-T for roads 
[normal]which
[normal] instead will be allocated to inland waterways and rail projects.  Bearing in mind the 
[normal]sums allocated 
[normal]to
[normal] HS2 and this recent deci
[normal]sion in relation 
[normal]to TEN-T, our perception is that there is a general prejudice amongst policy makers against road as a mode
[normal];
[normal] priority spending goes elsewhere.  We believe this 
[normal]is
[normal] short sighted and that road as the most used mode for freight and passengers 
[normal]must not be excluded.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We support in princip
[normal]le the proposed changes to the Highways Agency and the switch to a
[normal]n
[normal] independent structure.  We have argued previously for more long term
[normal] 
[normal]planning 
[normal]certainty and again we would support the concept of a “fixed and stable budget” 
[normal]in parallel with
[normal] a more commercial approach to the Agency’s functions with a strong emphasis on savings.  We do not share the Government’s conviction that this is the 
[normal]entire 
[normal]answer.  Although long term budget certainty is helpful, the actual level of that budget is the mo
[normal]st important factor and, as with the funding statement for the RIS, much is based on prospective savings which may not be as achievable as 
[normal]“Action for Roads” suggests
[normal].  However, we support the changes as far as they go and look forward to working with the 
[normal]Agency in its new format.  As to the Government and the private sector ensuring better 
[normal]management
[normal] of the strategic road network, we would support the production of a formal policy statement on the network along the lines of 
[normal]the
[normal] National Ports Policy Statem
[normal]ent which appeared at the beginning of last year.  This 
[normal]network s
[normal]tatement 
[normal]appears 
[normal]to have been sidelined. 
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]lthough we would not expect it to produce solutions overnight, we would expect it to set out how the interests of significant generators of traffic 
[normal]such as ports 
[normal]can
[normal] be taken into account when decisions are made.  As private sector entities
[normal],
[normal] ports themselves are not recipients of public spending and can be marginalized when 
[normal]major 
[normal]decisions are made about road and rail networks.  We also very much look
[normal] to LEPs and the LTBs to provide an effective for
[normal]um
[normal] for private and public sector interests to meet and agree strategies.
