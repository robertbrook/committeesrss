defaultCurrently, two-thirds of all goods are transported to and from ports by road.  I

defaulton road not just for ports but for the economy generally
default, in compar
defaultison with other member states our road network compares poorly and, in the words of the DfT’s “Action for Road

defaultst
default Century”, while the strategic road network compared well with competitors 20 years ago, “it now falls a long

default(para 1
default.
default10).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK’s road infrastructure is vital as an enabler of economic activity of which the port sector  represents a very significant part.  An Oxford Economics report published in December 2012 showed that in 2011 UK ports contributed £7.9bn to U
defaultK GDP and supported 391,800 jobs. They handle 95% 
defaultof
default import and export trade by volume and so their connectivity will have an influence far beyond the port gates.  Economic conditions since 2007 and the weakening of demand subsequently ha
defaultve
default had an impact o
defaultn port volumes  
defaultwhich
default rose to a peak of 600m tonnes in 2005
default.
default  
defaultThey 
defaultare now at a level of just over 500m tonnes.  Nevertheless, tonnage forecasts which 
defaultare set out as part of the 2012 National Policy Statement for ports indicate a doubling of ro-ro traffic 
defaultand an increase o
defaultf
default 182% in container traffic between 
defaultnow
default and 2030.  As the “Action for Roads” 
defaultpaper
default points out, demand will return and port volumes 
defaultwill 
defaultincrease accordingly.  
defaultA fit for purpose road network will be required to accommodate that demand.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe very much welcome the principles and 
defaultobjectives in the “Action for Roads” paper.  It shows a clear commitment to investment in the network, to improve the way in which it is managed and to environmental gains.  W
defaulte
default also support the recognition of the need for long term strategies and for great
defaulter certainty about spending commitments.  Taken at face value, we do not doubt that if these policies were implemented they would produce improvements
default,
default but the track record of all governments in 
defaultsecuring
default consistency for transport spending and planning has 
defaultbeen weak.  We note that the recent CBI study of UK infrastructure finds that successive governments have been “dithering over delivery”.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAny d
defaultiscussion about transport inevitably come
defaults
default back to budgets and it is here that we find the outlook for the net
defaultwork extremely concerning.  For example, a National Audit Office report for 2012 noted that although the DfT’s funding, which provides around 60% of capital funding for transport has remained stable, there has been a 28% fall in grants from the DCLG.  The 
defaultAudit Commission reported in 2011 that there is “a significant but unquantifiable backlog of maintenance work needed to get local highways to a sustainable level”.  Since then we have had extreme weather events which can only have made the problem worse.  
defaultAnother important unknown is the effectiveness of the new regional 
defaultarrangements
default following the demise of RDAs and the setting 
defaultup 
defaultof Local Transport Boards (LTBs).  It is too early to judge the effectiveness of LTBs.  When they were launched a year ago, 
defaultit
default w
defaultas 
defaultalongside
default 
defaulta very ambitious timetable with, for example, a deadline of December 2012 for LTBs to 
defaultconfirm
default their governance and financial 
defaultarrangements
default, effectively allowing three months to do so
default.  There are no guarantees that funding 
defaultis
default available to LTBs w
defaulthich might have failed to
default meet this strict timetable.  We have had mixed reports
default 
defaultabout the extent to which LTBs have managed to comply, but a consistent message, in spite of the upbeat summary provided in “Action for Roads” is that there is strong competit
defaultion for a very limited pot of money.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn the basis that
default,
default as “Action for Roads” points out,
default locally managed roads make 
defaultup 
default98% of 
defaultthe
default road network and that almost every journey starts or ends on a local road, the 
defaultrespective 
defaultrole

default of LTBs
default, LEPs and

defaultorities 
defaultare
default absolutely crucial.  
defaultW
defaulte can only support (para 
default5.3
default) the commitment to tackling maintenance and other local road network issue
defaults,
default but doubts have to remain as to whether 
defaultsufficient funds
default will be available and whether local arrangements are 
defaultfully 
defaultin place
default.  We
default also support the principles underlining the creation of the Road Investment Strategy (RIS) setting out plans for construction and maintenance for 2021 and
default beyond.  However, we also note
default that the government is relying on achieving savings of u
defaultp to 20% on maintenance and improvement work by allowing suppliers to commit to “innovative working methods”.  20% represents a sizeable figure and there must be uncertainty as to whether such savings can be delivered.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough ports in themselves are not a mode, they are of course servicing the maritime logistics chain and there needs to be recognition of the impacts that concentrations of trade will have on the r
defaultoad network.  To a 
defaultreasonable
default degree, we believe that this recognition is there and BPA members, for example, are encouraged to produce port masterplans which identify where road improvements are required and the effects that port traffic are likely to hav
defaulte
default on the network
default in the future.  
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultdrawing up
default of marine plans which will identify the main areas of coastal activity
default,
default should be helpful to planners in establishing where the main traffic flows are or are likely to be.
default  Rather than the main network, it is
default often the final legs of journeys which create delay and congestion. We support higher investment in a range of 
defaultlocal repair, maintenance and improvement schemes to improve road connectivity and allow the UK’s collective port assets to be used optimally.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are not in a position to comment in detail on the Government’s forecast but we do agree with the general premise that with increases in population and growth of the economy, inevitably there will be growth in road traffic.  But even if there were to be 
defaultno substantial growth this 
defaultwould
default not remove the need for substantial investment in the current network
default,
default simply to ensure that current bottlenecks 
defaultare
default removed and the network 
defaulti
defaults properly maintained.  We note in para 1.22 
defaultof the traffic forecast paper 
defaultthe co
defaultmment that fuel efficiency improvements should have the effect of “significant
defaultly
default decreasing the fuel 
defaultcost 
defaultof driving”.  This also contains an assumption about future taxation; if fuel costs were to decline as the forecast
defaults
default predict, 
defaultthere may be temptation
default 
defaultto raise fuel 
defaultduty in response
default.  All forecasts have to acknowledge the vast number of unknown factors, but in broad terms we do accept the conclusions of the Government’s forecast in their July 2013 paper.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have already referred to the
default overriding need for the right investment, but we also believe that better signage, real time information on traffic flows and other traffic 
defaultmanagement initiatives can make significant differences.
default  Paras 1.16 to 1.20 provide a good summary of the technical advances that will become available in the near future.  All these are extremely welcome in terms of environmental protection and safety, b
defaultut the advantages will be minimized if, as a result of congestion and under-investment by 2040 (as “Action for Roads” points out) almost a quarter of all travel time could be spent 
default“
defaultstuck in traffic
default” (fig 1.5)
default.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have two issues to raise here.  Firstly, the obvious mechanism and which is now being actively looked at
default is road tolling.  In the absence of other forms of private investment, this may become the only option if new infrastructure is to be created.  Specific schemes with clear objectives and with the most significant advantages could be considered, but a whol
defaultesale change to tolling of the motorway network along the lines operated in France, would not only increase costs significantly, but 
defaultwill
default have 
defaultconsequences for
default the rest of the network.  For ports, assessment
defaults
default 
defaultare already
default made of what contribution a port ca
defaultn make to a road or rail development linked to a port development.  So the ports industry itself is 
defaultpotentially 
defaultsubject to extra cost.  On
defaulte of the results of the recent Port Sector S
defaulttrategy 
defaultdocument 
defaultis an undertaking to review this arrangement.  
default&#xa0;
defaultSecondly
default, we believe that the Government should make much stronger efforts to ensure that the Trans European Network for transport (TEN-T) could also be used to fund road improvements.  Our understanding of the changes in the new TEN-T legislation is that apart fr
defaultom very specific road schemes strongly linked to environmental improvement, there 
defaultwill
default be no funding from TEN-T for roads 
defaultwhich
default instead will be allocated to inland waterways and rail projects.  Bearing in mind the 
defaultsums allocated 
defaultto
default HS2 and this recent deci
defaultsion in relation 
defaultto TEN-T, our perception is that there is a general prejudice amongst policy makers against road as a mode
default;
default priority spending goes elsewhere.  We believe this 
defaultis
default short sighted and that road as the most used mode for freight and passengers 
defaultmust not be excluded.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe support in princip
defaultle the proposed changes to the Highways Agency and the switch to a
defaultn
default independent structure.  We have argued previously for more long term
default 
defaultplanning 
defaultcertainty and again we would support the concept of a “fixed and stable budget” 
defaultin parallel with
default a more commercial approach to the Agency’s functions with a strong emphasis on savings.  We do not share the Government’s conviction that this is the 
defaultentire 
defaultanswer.  Although long term budget certainty is helpful, the actual level of that budget is the mo
defaultst important factor and, as with the funding statement for the RIS, much is based on prospective savings which may not be as achievable as 
default“Action for Roads” suggests
default.  However, we support the changes as far as they go and look forward to working with the 
defaultAgency in its new format.  As to the Government and the private sector ensuring better 
defaultmanagement
default of the strategic road network, we would support the production of a formal policy statement on the network along the lines of 
defaultthe
default National Ports Policy Statem
defaultent which appeared at the beginning of last year.  This 
defaultnetwork s
defaulttatement 
defaultappears 
defaultto have been sidelined. 
default 
defaultA
defaultlthough we would not expect it to produce solutions overnight, we would expect it to set out how the interests of significant generators of traffic 
defaultsuch as ports 
defaultcan
default be taken into account when decisions are made.  As private sector entities
default,
default ports themselves are not recipients of public spending and can be marginalized when 
defaultmajor 
defaultdecisions are made about road and rail networks.  We also very much look
default to LEPs and the LTBs to provide an effective for
defaultum
default for private and public sector interests to meet and agree strategies.
