[normal],
[normal] for example, a GPE grant of US 
[normal]$
[normal]57.4 million for th

[normal]to improve the 
[normal]management of moderate disabilities of school-age children through school based health interventions to ensure children, especially girls, complete primary education.
[normal] 
[normal]In addition, 
[normal]the 
[normal]Global Partnership
[normal] has 
[normal]put in place a
[normal] [bold]Data Strategy for Improved Educati
[normal]on Sector Planning and Implementation
[normal] 
[normal]to address data gaps, including data on children with disabilities, in GPE countries.

[normal]The Global Partnership for Education
[normal] 
[normal](GPE) 
[normal]is 
[normal]the 
[normal]only multilateral [bold]partnership devoted to getting [bold]all [bold]children into school for a [bold]good [bold]quality education[bold]. The Global Partnership 
[normal]– made up of governments, civil society organizations, international 
[normal]institutions, teachers, private foundations, and the private sector – provides funding to support the development and implementation of high-quality education sector plans
[normal] 
[normal]in the w
[normal]orld’s poorest countries and  helps
[normal] 
[normal]coordinate support arou
[normal]nd those plans.
[normal] F
[normal]undamental to the
[normal] Global Partnership’s work is ensuring
[normal] education 
[normal]sector 
[normal]plans
[normal] 
[normal]are 
[normal]inclusive and 
[normal]meet the educational 
[normal]needs 
[normal]of all children
[normal]. 
[normal]In its report to the UN Secretary General in May 2013, the 
[normal]United Nations High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on [bold]the Post-2015 Development Agenda[bold] highlighted:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘The Global Partnership for Education is getting quality education to marginalized children, coordinating education’s many players, offering aid without wasteful replication, and following local leadership’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]With the support of the UK and a number of other donor partners, the 
[normal]Global Partnership has[bold] 
[normal]transformed international cooperation[bold] in education in developing countries.
[normal] Since 2002, it has helped to pioneer the coordination of development partners in support of nationally owned 
[normal]and implemented education sector plans. In doing so, the GPE has 
[normal]improved the alignment of external 
[normal]technical and financial resources with sustain
[normal]able
[normal], nationally relevant
[normal] education strategies
[normal]. Due to the value of GPE processes in improving education development and the catalytic impact of GPE financing on system strengthening in the education sector, GPE has become one of the most significant sourc
[normal]es of education financing for the poorest countries in the world. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Since 2009, 
[normal]the Global Partnership has [bold]implemented[bold] widespread[bold] 
[normal]reforms to further strengthen the partnership[bold] and help it to [bold]deliver [bold]better [bold]results.[bold] 
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]UK MAR
[normal] 
[normal]2013 Update
[normal] ranks GPE progress 
[normal]against 
[normal]the MAR reform priorities as the fourth highest 
[normal]of all multilateral organizations 
[normal]assessed in
[normal] the original review
[normal]. 
[normal]Further revisions
[normal] are planned including of the GPE Fund 
[normal]to ensure it 
[normal]respond
[normal]s
[normal] to the increase in
[normal] demand for
[normal] 
[normal]fun
[normal]ding in the most effective and efficient way
[normal]. 
[normal]New commitments
[normal] from the UK and other donor partners for the repleni
[normal]shment of the Global Partnership
[normal] for the pe
[normal]riod 2015 – 2018 
[normal]will help 
[normal]further 
[normal]accelerate 
[normal]developing country 
[normal]progress towards ensuring 
[normal]all
[normal] chil
[normal]dren receive a
[normal] quality education, in
[normal]cluding children with disabilities
[normal] and other marginalized
[normal] groups
[normal].

[normal]The GPE [bold]Strategic Plan [bold]2012 – 2015 commits t[bold]he partnership to support [bold]children who are [bold]the [bold]most marginalized[bold] and 
[normal]to 
[normal]building national systems that have the capacity and integrity to deliver, support and assess quality education for all
[normal], including
[normal] children with disability
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he GPE strategic
[normal] goals are
[normal] access for all, learning for all, reachi
[normal]ng every child, and building for the
[normal] future. The 
[normal]Implementation Plan for GPE’s Strategic Plan includes a specific outcome on the access of children with disabilities to inclusive and quality learning. It further com
[normal]mits GPE and its partners to support the creation of inclusive educa
[normal]tion systems, in particular: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]environments f
[normal]or children with disabilities
[normal]effective
[normal]ne
[normal]ss to improve learning outcomes for marginalized children, in particular children with disabilities.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Global Partnership’s approach is comprehensive, supporting inclusive educa
[normal]tion and the education of children with special needs 
[normal]at the country
[normal], regional
[normal] and global level.
[normal] 
[normal]Specifically, GPE support
[normal]s inclusive education and children with special needs 
[normal]as follows

[normal]Inclusive education sector [bold]analysis and planning[bold] [bold]–[bold] [bold]explicit 
[normal]s
[normal]upport for 
[normal]inclusive education is articulated
[normal] in 
[normal]the 
[normal]GPE 
[normal]Guid
[normal]e
[normal]lines
[normal] 
[normal]for education sector plan development and appraisal
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]These guidelines make specific reference to 
[normal]the need for consideration of 
[normal]disability
[normal] in the process of education sector plan preparation, education sector plan appraisal, implementation strategies and targeted monitoring
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]F
[normal]or example, 
[normal]in preparation for th
[normal]e development of an education sector plan, 
[normal]sector analysis should include analysis of the needs and situation of marginalized groups, in
[normal]cluding children with disabilities
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal] appraisal section o
[normal]f the Guidelines, which guides development p
[normal]artners’ assessme
[normal]nt and endorsement of the sector plan (on which eligibility for GPE funding is based)
[normal], also refers 
[normal]to disability. It promotes
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]arg
[normal]et setting 
[normal]for each of the m
[normal]arginalized and at-risk groups 
[normal]such
[normal] as children with disabilities as well as 
[normal]underserved communiti
[normal]es, girls, the poor, orphans, children in hard to reach communities, ethnic minorities, refugee and internally displaced populations, and chil
[normal]dren affected by HIV and AIDS
[normal]. The guidelines
[normal] also promote
[normal] the identification of 
[normal]specific strategies and activitie
[normal]s
[normal] to ensure equity in the provision of basic inputs across these 
[normal]groups 
[normal]as well as 
[normal]an inclusive 
[normal]approach to
[normal] mainstreaming support to marginalized group
[normal]s.

[normal]Evaluation[bold] of [bold]the ‘inclusiveness’ [bold]of existing[bold] [bold]education [bold]sector plans[bold] –
[normal] 
[normal]the Monitoring and Evaluation 
[normal](M&amp;E) team of the G
[normal]PE Secretariat is conducting a comprehensive 
[normal]evaluation of member countries’ edu
[normal]cation sector plans.  The evaluation
[normal] includes an equity dimension that assesses, for example, whether sector plans address education for children with special needs.
[normal] It will inform improvements to sector monitoring and help to identify data gaps
[normal]. 
[normal]The evaluation is expected 
[normal]to be concluded by
[normal] mid-2014. 
[normal]Previous analyses 
[normal]indicate s
[normal]ector plans in a number of 
[normal]G
[normal]PE – endorsed countries
[normal] i
[normal]nclude specific strategies
[normal] to target childre
[normal]n
[normal] with special needs, and
[normal] 
[normal]deta
[normal]iled 
[normal]a
[normal]ctivities and timelines
[normal].  
[normal]Guyana[bold]’s[bold] education sector plan, for exampl
[normal]e, includes 
[normal]specific activities such as conducting a national study to determine the number of 
[normal]students with special needs as well as 
[normal]creating special resource centers
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Similarly, 
[normal]Ethiopia[bold] has adopted a strategy for special needs education within its education sector 
[normal]program.

[normal]everal GPE
[normal] grants 
[normal]directly 
[normal]finance 
[normal]education activities 
[normal]for children with special needs
[normal]. 
[normal]In
[normal] 
[normal]Cambodia[bold], 
[normal]for example, 
[normal]a GPE grant of US
[normal] 
[normal]$
[normal]57.4 million for the period 2008-2012 
[normal]is supporting
[normal] the Ministry of Edu
[normal]cation and 
[normal]Youth 
[normal]to conduct a survey on the needs of marginalized and disabled children excluded from education. 
[normal]A total of 
[normal]13,175 children aged 11-15 were screened  in 56 elementary schools under t
[normal]he Out-of-School and Disability Survey
[normal], which used a state-of-the-art methodology for data collection and referring to services of children with disabilities and impairments, and provided them with ey
[normal]e 
[normal]glasses at the low cost of US
[normal] 
[normal]$
[normal]2 a pair. For the first time, the survey also provided high-q
[normal]uality data on disability and education, which enabled the Ministry to plan and budget for more targeted intervent
[normal]ions, and ultimately better addr
[normal]ess the issue of access to primary education for the most marginalized. As a result, the out-of-school populat
[normal]ion in Cambodia was halved between 2007 and 2011, a large part of which was due to a significant increase in the am
[normal]ount of disabled children 
[normal]able to attend school. Unde
[normal]r this initiative,
[normal] t
[normal]eachers from 56 schools were trained on 
[normal]vision testing so teachers 
[normal]can
[normal] assess 
[normal]whether children need
[normal] to be referred for refraction or for an eye exam. 
[normal]The results of the GPE-funded surv
[normal]ey were also shared with other
[normal] Ministries and development partners in Cambodia, prompting a number of education programs to support childre
[normal]n with disabilities and impairments. These initiatives range from inclusive teacher training, to disability awareness campaigns, and vision and hearing screenings for children in primary schools.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Similarly, 
[normal]Moldova[bold] is currently implementing a GPE grant 
[normal]of
[normal] US
[normal] 
[normal]$
[normal]4.4 million 
[normal]for the period 2012 to 2014, with the aim of
[normal] improving access, quality and inclusiveness of preschool education. 
[normal]The grant
[normal] is a continuation of two successfully comp
[normal]leted grants
[normal] implemented from 2006 to 2010
[normal]. 
[normal]Since 2006, 
[normal]GPE has provided 
[normal]Moldova with
[normal] 
[normal]technical assistance to revise
[normal] sanitary reforms and legislation encouraging inclusive approaches, as well as the promotion of integrated services across the education, health
[normal] and social protection sectors. 
[normal]Moldova 
[normal]has 
[normal]also developed key docume
[normal]nts promoting inclusiveness such as standards for learning and development of children (from birth to 7 years old), standards for pre-school teachers, and a guide on socio-educational inclusiveness of children with disabilities, and continues
[normal] to promote in
[normal]clusive approaches
[normal] through a broader teac
[normal]her training/mentoring program. 
[normal]With the support of GPE
[normal], 
[normal]two 
[normal]‘pilot’ 
[normal]centers 
[normal]have been established 
[normal]for 
[normal]the 
[normal]rehabilitation of children with special needs within mainstream kindergartens in Straseni and in Criuleni (respectively 15 and 24 children benefitted). 
[normal]More recently, GPE funding supported
[normal] the establishment of one additional rehabilitation center for child
[normal]ren with disabilities in Ceadir Lunga UTAG Gagauzia (61 beneficiaries), and 
[normal]there are 
[normal]plans are to create a similar center in Nisporeni (17 exp
[normal]ected beneficiaries). 
[normal]GPE support 
[normal]has also 
[normal]helped 
[normal]to 
[normal]leverage support from other partners, such as UNICEF and loc
[normal]al NGOs, for the inclusion of children with special needs in mainstream institutions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Support at the global and regional level[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Support for children with special needs through the [bold]Global and Regional Activities [bold](GRA) Program[bold] 
[normal]- 
[normal]the GRA Program supports 
[normal]capacity development, knowledge sharing and knowledge development at the regional and global levels and is complementary to the country level process. It fosters innovation through the systematic provision of services and products that enlighten, engage, a
[normal]nd energize partners to apply new knowledge and evidence based good practices to resolve education challenges
[normal]. A proposal 
[normal]submitted by the World Bank 
[normal]was
[normal] approved 
[normal]in July 2013 
[normal]for 
[normal]US 
[normal]$3 million to im
[normal]prove the management of moderate disabilities of school-a
[normal]ge children through school based health interventions to ensure children, especially gi
[normal]rls,
[normal] complete primary education. T
[normal]he 
[normal]program aims to 
[normal]improve learning outcomes and access to education in 15 GPE developing partner countries
[normal], including 10 countries in 
[normal]Africa and 5 in Southeast Asia
[normal]. The program will address knowledge gaps in operational and technical understanding of disability and provide the support needed to include children with disabilities, impairments and untreated health conditions to prevent th
[normal]em from dropping out, and to improve access to education. 
[normal]The activity will be managed by the World Bank in cooperation with WHO, Sight Savers, Save the Children, Partnership for Child Development, Imperial College, Children Without Worms and national NGOs
[normal] will be involved at country level.

[normal]Data S[bold]trategy for I[bold]mproved Education Sector Planning and Implementation[bold] – in 
[normal]many 
[normal]GPE 
[normal]countries
[normal] the 
[normal]lack of reliable data, including data on children with disab
[normal]ilities, remains
[normal] a major constraint
[normal]. This is especially 
[normal]the case in fragile and conflict-affected states, which account for almost half of GPE’s overall country portfol
[normal]io. As noted in the
[normal] MAR Update 2013, the Global Partnership has already made considerable progress in the area of results by 
[normal]introducing a syste
[normal]matic framework for aggregated resu
[normal]lts reporting, and by 
[normal]publishing an increasing volume of data o
[normal]n its work. 
[normal]These reforms have enhanced GPE’s
[normal] capa
[normal]city to assess the 
[normal]extent 
[normal]to which 
[normal]GPE-endorsed education sector plans address 
[normal]disability, and whether the 
[normal]educati
[normal]onal needs of all children are addressed in GPE countries
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition, 
[normal]the Partnership has recently pu
[normal]t in place a
[normal] [bold]Data Strategy for I
[normal]mproved Education Sector Planning and Implementation
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he strategy outlines a 
[normal]comprehensive approach to address
[normal]in
[normal]g
[normal] a number of data-related challen
[normal]ges in 
[normal]GPE countries
[normal], particularly in relation
[normal] to the need for timely reliable data as a basis for effective monitoring of the implementation of education sector plans.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]new
[normal] strategy 
[normal]sets out a number of concrete steps 
[normal]the GP
[normal]E intends to take in this regard, including
[normal]:

[normal]The

[normal]to 
[normal]better measure the impact of its work at country-level, 
[normal]and in addressing the education needs of all children
[normal].

[normal]underway to maximize
[normal] the efficient and effe

[normal]esources 
[normal]in order to 
[normal]help 
[normal]achieve its mission
[normal]. Taking into 
[normal]consideration the results of 
[normal]the MAR, lessons learned and 
[normal]feedback 
[normal]from its partners, the revised
[normal] funding model will
[normal] incentivize and reward the delivery of results against strategic plan objectives, development effectiveness and increasing value for money; and leverage additional domestic and e

[normal]repl
[normal]enishment of the Global Partnership
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]2015 to 2018
[normal])
[normal]. The replenishment campaign was announced in Ne
[normal]w York in September, 
[normal]and will culminate
[normal] in a pledging conference on the 26
[normal]th
[normal] of June in Brusssels,
[normal] hosted by 
[normal]the EU. The replenishment of the Global Partnersh
[normal]ip
[normal] 
[normal]is an opportunity for the international community to turn around 
[normal]the current decline in
[normal] donor aid for basic education and leverage
[normal] additional domestic resources to create lasting change.

[normal]With its country-led and inclusive approach, 
[normal]the Global Partnership [bold]is [bold]an investment in transformative development[bold] and a model for the post-2015 framework[bold]. 
[normal]A s

[normal]will
[normal] cement 
[normal]GPE’s value-added 
[normal]in providing a
[normal] global picture of the extent to which education sector plans address the

[normal], and based on this, promote
[normal] inclusive education and best policy and practice for children with special needs
[normal] in GPE

[normal]Renewed

[normal]allocated near
[normal]ly USD 
[normal]3.8 billion 
[normal](by the end of 2013) 
[normal]to 59 countries in support of education. More than 
[normal]40% of GPE’s total disbursement
[normal]s supported children’s education in fragile and conflict-affected countries. Specifically, GPE 
[normal]helped put an additional 58
[normal] million chi
[normal]ldren in
[normal] 
[normal]primary 
[normal]school; increased primary school completion rates and literacy rates,
[normal] 
[normal]especially among young girls; and spurred
