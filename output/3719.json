"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from  by James Derounian (CYS0013)Thank you for this opportunity to make a submission; it is appreciated.\nI want to make a \nsingle,\n and forceful point: I would like to see that the wearing of cycle helmets becomes \ncompulsory.\nHaving experienced a near-death experience, when a motorist crashed in to me from behind – causing me to be thrown in to a ditch – my cyc\nle helmet split in 3 places (but fortunately I walked away with just a broken nose &amp; shock). I am certain that I would be dead, were it not for the fact that my helmet absorbed most of the impact.\nThank you for considering this.\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
