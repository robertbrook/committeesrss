"&#xa0;\nAFS0085South East Strategic Leaders Response&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSouth East Strategic Leaders (SESL) \ndoes\n not have a shared view on the Government’s programme of academisation; individual South East authorities have their own \npolicies \non\n academies and free school\ns. This submission is, therefore, intended to \nbe considered alongside\n more detailed local authorit\ny \nevidence\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRegardless of stance towards academies, it is a fact that under the current Government, the number of academies in the South East has \nincreased\n. Between 2011/12 and 2012/13 no SESL authority saw a drop in the percentage of pupils educated in \nsecondary academies, although growth has varied across the region. \nThe introduction of academies and free schools has changed the education landscape and raised questions about the role and responsibilities of local authorities in education and, in particu\nlar, in respect to academies and free schools.\n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSESL has determined to submit a collective response as whilst South East Councils hold different positions on the concept of academies, we hold firmly that local authorities retain a role in promoting learnin\ng across all schools\n. We\n recognise the need for the local authority as a strong ‘Middle Tier’ between all schools and the Secretary of State. \nWe agree that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLocal authorities have an on-going role in promoting learning &#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe duties placed on English local authorities under Section 13 of the Education Act 1996, relating to promoting high standards of education, ensuring fair access to opportunity and promoting the fulfilment of learning potential, apply\n to \nall\n children and young people across \nall\n schools and alternative education providers, which includes academies. \nWhilst there is some debate as to the exten\nt\n to which a local authority is ‘capable\n’\n of exercising \nthese functions with respect to \nnon-maintained schools, academies are not independent fro\nm these local authority duties.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs long as these duties remain, local authorities have a role to engage constructively with, and seek to influence, all schools to ensure their responsibilities towar\nds children are being met. \nSouth East Councils continue to relate to all schools in carrying out responsibilities for admissions, SEN exclusions and commissioning new school places. I\nn respect to championing vulnerable pupils and ensuring equality of oppor\ntunity, for example, there are \ncases\n of South East Councils taking a very active role. In Kent, the County Council and local schools are focusing intensively on narrowing the attainment gap for vulnerable groups. In the same way as local authority maintain\ned schools, Kent County Council expects academies to focus on ensuring that vulnerable groups are identified, strategies personalised and pupil premium monies effectively targeted. \n&#xa0;\nTo fulfil their role successfully, councils need to build strong relationships with all schools&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEstablishing strong relationships\n is a prerequisite to constructive engagement\n with any school.\n \nWhere \na local authority\n do\nes\n have direct powers of intervention, these are often only effective where \nthat local authority\n has\n the capacity to invest in building constructive relationships with \nits \nschools and the history of doing so. Nurturing strong, positive, trusting relationships with academies \nis important as t\nhe quality of relationship\ns\n is likely to determine the level of \ninformation shared by \nacademies\n with their local \ncounci\nl\ns\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAcross \nSESL \nthere are many examples of where local authorities have invested in build\ning positive relationships with\n schools\n \nin a variety of ways. To give one example, \nthrough collaboration with \nRobert Bloomfield Academy, Central Bedfordshire Council has established The Central Bedfordshire Teaching School Partnership and Council \nCommissioning Officers\n sit on the Partnership’s Strategic Board. \n&#xa0;\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe partnership has published an on\nline workforce \ndevelopment tool\n and is helping to broker school-to-school support using National and Local Leaders of Education and Governance, Advanced Skills Teachers and Specialist Leaders. Central Bedfordshire already has four National Leaders in Governance. The Coun\ncil would like to approach other Chairs but \nhas\n been prevented from doing so due to tight, nationally imposed \nqualifying criteria\n regarding length of service prior to applying\n. The Committee may wish to see if this is an issue for other areas and subsequen\ntly to explore loosening the criteria on qualifying Governors. \n&#xa0;\nWhere relationships are not good, Government should support councils to exercise their democratic mandate.&#xa0;\n2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere exist a number of means by which local authorities can seek to influence academies; for example, through meeting with the Chairs of overarching Trusts and regular meetings with regional HMI. There are many examples of positive endeavour on this front\n. In Kent, for example, the local authority has been inviting academies to work in partnership with other schools to create a sustainable, self-improvement school system, which is working well. Despite many examples of positive engagement, difficulties can\n and do arise where, \nfor whatever reason, an academy refuses to engage constructively with the local authority.\n&#xa0;\n2.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n Persistent un-cooperation and disengagement \ncan\n lead to a situation where it becomes difficult for a local authority to be\n a)\n assured of the health of a school and thus to fulfil its statutory duties towards pupils\n and b) to drive improvement within that school\n. \nIn the current system, where relationships break down and attempts to influence through exerting soft powers fail, it \nis the \nDfE’s\n responsibility to intervene and drive necessary improvements at pace. It would therefore be prudent for the Committee to explore further whether the \nDfE\n has the \nlocal knowledge \nof underperforming academies and the capacity \nand capability \nto in\ntervene quickly and support sustained improvement.\n The decision to recruit Schools Commissioners in eight regions across the country and to charge them with responsibility for monitoring performance and \ndriving improvement\n \nin \nunderperforming academies impl\nies that there is a \ngap not currently being met by the Department. \n&#xa0;\n2.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn keeping with localism, it is essential that local politicians, alongside their schools, are able to be held to account by their communities for the education that their children and yo\nung people receive\n.\n Local politicians are far better placed than Whitehall or any regional representative to keep abreast of and address local issues.\n Indeed, when difficulties arise, residents rarely turn first to the Secretary of State bu\nt\n rather to thei\nr locally elected politicians. Local Councillors need to be supported to influence schools and to hold providers to account for the delivery of the local system through their democratic mandate.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo this end, Regional Schools Commissioner\ns\n should be required to cooperate with local authorities, sharing information about underperforming academies \nwith which they are working and \ninvolving \nlocal authorities\n in \nboth \ndiscussions about the most appropriate remedial action and securing school impr\novement services. Local authorities, have a wealth of local knowledge, practical expertise and experience in this area that Regional Commissioners ought to draw upon. In light of Councils’ broad systems oversight\n and democratic mandate\n, Commissioners ought\n also to involve them in decisions to approve an academy conversion application. \n&#xa0;\n2.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal Councillors could be further supported to exercise their democratic mandate by \nstructuring the Funding Agreement between the \nDfE\n and \na\ncademies in a way that reinforces\n to academies that whilst they are funded centrally, they have a responsi\nbility towards locally elected M\nembers. \n \n&#xa0;\nConvertor academies – a potential line for future enquiry&#xa0;2.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe principle that no school is beyond falling into difficulties is an impor\ntant one and raises \nquestions around convertor academies. \nWhi\nlst we celebrate in the successes\n of such schools, we have concerns regarding the longevity of that success and the potential vulnerability of convertor academies in particular. We suggest there \nis value in the Committee exploring the basis of convertor academy success, whether their success is likely to be sustained\n and what securities are needed/exist\n that will help\n convertor academies\n to guard against potential deterioration or failure in the f\nuture. \nBeing proactive, not reactive relies on access to real time information and data sharing2.12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal authorities have a role, alongside an array of other partners, to support schools throughout their improvement journey. This involves identifying and \nacting upon early warning signs that might, for example, suggest that educational standards are slipping.\n Councils’ ability to track individual pupil data \nin real time, over a period of time, is important to spotting warning signs. Local authorities ought \nnot to be in a position where they must wait for the Department to publish Key Stage data, for example, several months after it is received by local schools; rather, they need access to robust, real time information before it is placed in the public domain\n.\n Access to more sensitive information also plays an important part in supporting councils to fulfil their safeguarding responsibilities.\n&#xa0;\n2.13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs referenced above, building strong relationships with schools overtime will underpin \ntheir \nwillingness to share\n \ninformation. \n              \nA\ncross the South East there are \nexamples of locally negotiated information sharing protocols between \nC\nouncils and academies which are proving effective. For locally-led initiatives, such as the Troubled F\namilies Programme, there may be\n need f\nor further \ndata sharing\n within locally agreed timescales. \n&#xa0;\nAcademy sponsors should be strongly encouraged to cooperate with councils and encourage their schools to do likewise.&#xa0;\n2.14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is sometimes the case that academies, which enjoy a good relationship with\n their local authority and are open to sharing information in principle, come under pressure from their Sponsor not\n to\n share data with their local authority. This causes unnecessary obstacles locally which could be\n easily overcome if nationally \nacademy spo\nnsors were encouraged\n by the \nDfE\n,\n and\n in the future\n Regional Schools Commissioners\n,\n to willingly and \nconstructively \nengage with local authorities\n directly. Moreover, Sponsors should actively encourage academies within their sphere to communicate with their local authority. \n&#xa0;\nThe capacity of local authorities to exercise due diligence towards all schools, regardless of status, is diminishing&#xa0;\n2.15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is \nincreasingly difficult for local authorities to know all of their schools well due to limited capacity and SESL questions whether existing \nfunding \nis\n sufficient to sustain the capacity of local authorities to exercise due diligence with their schools, rega\nrdless of status. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
