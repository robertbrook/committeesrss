"&#xa0;\nAFS0047&#xa0;Submission to the Education Select Committee fromWritten evidence submitted by ‘Hands Off Our Schools’&#xa0;\nINTRODUCTION\n&#xa0;\n1. \n‘\nHands Off Our Schools\n’\n is a campaign group comprising local parents, teachers\n, governors and councilors, which\n monitor\ns\n local schools and campaign\ns\n against \nacademisation and free schools in the Nottingham and Nottinghamshire area.\n It is not affiliated to any political party.\n  The group is clear in its aims\n:\n we oppose \na\ncademy\n conversions\n and \nf\nree \ns\nchools because we see this \ndevelopment \nas a loss of \ncommunity\n \nc\nontrol of our local schools, combined with a\nn\n incoherent and chaotic approach to \nthe provision of \nschool place\ns\n. Our view is that within such a system\n, \ndemocratic control will diminish whilst \neducational inequalities are likely to increase.\n&#xa0;\nSUMMARY\n&#xa0;\n2. \nIn our experience, detailed in this submission, we are already seeing our concerns being \nrealis\ned.  However, of equal concern,\n is \nthat the process\nes\n by which \na\ncadem\nies\n and \nf\nree \ns\nchools are emerging are far from clear.  The\nr\ne are key questions about the \ncommunity use of public money and yet we have consistently experienced attempt\ns\n to \nstifle \nor avoid \npublic \ndebate \non these key issues\n by those pursuing particular agendas. This is sometimes achieved by refusing to engage in meaningful consultation, but in o\nther instances it is achieved through acts of bullying and intimidation\n, of employees and ourselves\n.\n&#xa0;\n3. \nOur concerns therefore\n centre on several issues\n and can be summarized as follows\n: \n&#xa0;\ni.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nloss of democratic oversight of schools\n (including school place pla\nnning)\n; \nii.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nlack of democratic procedures in the process of academisation and the setting up of free schools; \niii.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ngrowing\n 'conflicts of interest' emerging in the academy/free school 'world'\n (and associated opacity in relation to these)\n; \niv.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe \nincreasingly ineffic\nient use\n of resources for \nitems\n that are not \ndirectly related \nto education\n. \n&#xa0;\nSUBMISSION\n&#xa0;\n4. \nThis submission\n \ngive\ns\n case study examples from our area of \nall \nthese issues\n [within the submission we have anonymised all schools \n–\n the \nfull list of schools \nmentioned, with brief descriptors, is provided at the end of this submission]\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5. \nWe have been struck by the way those who are 'for' academy status are unprepared to engage in debate with those of us who oppose. In our experience, those 'pushing' for aca\ndemy status are often the head and chair of governors of a school. Typically, they will arrange for the governing body to be addressed by another proponent of academies who gives all the arguments 'for' whilst no-one is invited to put the case 'against'\n \n(\nw\nhere we have been invited we have been \nwell-received.) \nSometimes the academy proponent is portrayed as a ‘neutral’ who is giving \n‘the facts’ in an unbiased way. \n'Consultation' with parents usually follows the same pattern and staff are \noften\n simply informed. The impression is given that the change is going to happen, \nit is non-controversial and \nthat \neveryone agrees it's self evidently a 'good thing'. \nWe are aware of many instances where staff feel afraid to express opinions that might oppose \na potential academisation\n.\n&#xa0;\n6. \nIn our area,\n F\n Primary was going through the process\n of academisation, to become par\nt\n of the G Trust\n. The staff of another local primary\n, B\n, who were also facing academisation \nas part of the G Trust \nand who were anxious about\n it, arranged \na meeting for all \nstaff \nfrom local schools \nto d\niscuss it. No-one from F\n \nattended and\n we have \nbeen informed by a reliable source\n that letters \nabout the meeting that were \nind\nividually addressed to \nSchool \nF\n teachers were, on the orders of the he\nad teacher, \nintercepted and \ndestroyed.\n&#xa0;\n7. \nAt A\n P\nrimary school, the upcoming academisation was \npublicly \nannounced on the website of the\n 'parent' school (G\n, of which, more later) whilst the so-called 'consultation' period was still ongoing.\n&#xa0;\n8. \nThe G\n Trust is a developing organisation in our area\n, centred on the G \nsecondary \nschool. It is gathering to it a number of local primary schools, those that might be considered in its local 'family'\n, though not all\n. In those schools, the arguments 'for' include\n the benefit of c\nlose working with G\n. This is an arg\nument being put at B\n Junior School but whilst that debate has \ncontinued\n (the staff are active in opposition) it is clear the school has continued to \nwork closely with G\n,\n so academisation would appear to b\ne un\nnecessary. C Primary Academy\n was an early \n‘\nconverter \nacademy’ \nas part of the G\n Trust and the head has been active in promoting academy status to others. He acted as a kind of '\nsuper head'/adviser to E Primary. \n&#xa0;\n9. \nTh\ne Chair of Governors at A\n Primary i\ns a former V\nice Principal at G\n, \nwho now runs a consultancy which \nhas done work for G\n. The senior\n office manager at \nC\n is Chai\nr of Governors at \nG\n. \nThe wife of the B \nChair of Governors \nis a former deputy at the \nsame \nschool, later a local headteacher herself a\nnd then independent adviser to Nottinghamshire CC. She now runs her own ed\nucation consultancy and has done\n some training at G. Recently she was \nco-opted o\nnto the governors at H and became Chair of the Finance Committee\n straight away\n, at the instigation of the headteacher. No suggestion is made that\n anyone has broken any laws but it concerns us that \nan ‘inner circle’ of networked individuals is emerging in which a relatively \nsmall number of people who clearly know each other well are \nmaking significant and critical decisions \nabout\n the future of schools \nin our area.  There is no meaningful community involvement in these decisions and there is no democratic process whereby the local community has a meaningful voice in \nthe \ndecisions\n being\n made\n.  \n&#xa0;\n10. \nA final \ndecision has \nnot \ny\net been made over academisation at B \nin part, we think, because of the active opposition of many staff there, supported and encouraged by us. However, another \nexplanation is that the governors are \nwaiting for the loc\nal authority to foot the bill for a much needed new roof, before then taking the school out of local authority control.  If this is the case, it illustrates how key decisions about local management of our community schools are being driven by concerns that\n have nothing to do with educational arguments, or debates about community control \n–\n but \neverything to do with principles of accountancy. We do not \nbelieve\n \nthis is in the interests of the effective stewardship of public finances, let alone the best interes\nts of our children.  \n Something similar a\nppears to be happening at H\n, a large primary school, where expansion is likely to \nhappen\n with funding from the LA. However, meetings of governors have taken place with the head autocratically driving the a\ngenda. \nThis is illustrated by t\nhe head\nteacher\n of C\n \nbeing \ninvited\n to a governors’ meeting\n to present the ‘academy’ case\n (no-one was invited to put the case ‘against’) \n: governors were told they could only ask questions if these had been submitted in advance. \nWe be\nlieve this is extraordinary.  How can governors have an intelligent and open debate about a critical issue if they are not able to respond to points raised in the presentation\n at the meeting\n?\n It exemplifies very clearly how important debates are \noften \none-\nsided\n, stage managed and closed down.  In \nthis same school (H)\n \nw\ne\n have been\n reliably informed that the staff governors are not elected but appointed by the head\nteacher\n, in rotation, fo\nr 'staff development' purposes! \n&#xa0;\n11. \nIn recent months, much of our effo\nrts have been put into opposing two proposed free schools \n(L and M) \nin our area. The DfE approved one of these, the \nM Free School\n: b\noth of the schools were mooted\n by J K \nTrust \nwhich is, effectively, J Comprehensive and the K\n School, a failing school w\nhich \nthe 'outstanding' J\n has been supporting\n (NB an OFSTED judg\nment made in December 2011)\n. \nT\nhere is no shortage of secondary places in the Sherwood area of Nottingham where the M Free School will, apparently, be located. \n We believe that the introduction of a \nf\nree \ns\nchoo\nl\n into the area will badly de\ns\ntabilise existing provision and will be both inefficient and a threat to quality.\n&#xa0;\n12. \nWe have \ntherefore \ncontinued to oppose the \nM Free School\n, aiming to influence \nthe parents of \npotential recruits, through letters a\nnd statements to the local press and by handing out leaflets at primary schools and at open meetings publici\nsing the \nF\nree \nS\nchool. The J K \nTrust has not engaged \nwith us \nvia the media but reacted very strongly to our leaflets, issuing a threatening letter, t\naking issue with our statements - and \nthe \nquestions raised - in the leaflet. We are satisfied that none of their complaints are justified: for example, we made much of the fact that currently there \nwas (and still \nis\n)\n \nno publicly announced site for the new school and that as it is a new school parents couldn't talk to existing parents and pupils or view an OFSTED report or check examination outcomes. These are self-evident facts, \nyet J K Trust\n seemed to think that becau\nse they could raise counter arguments, what we had said was a 'malicious falsehood'. Although we were conf\nident in what we had said, J K \n's letter threatened legal action and as a small voluntary group with little in the way of funds, we couldn't afford le\ngal advice or representation and therefore we have had to stop issuing the\n leaflet. None of the\n \nconsequential \nactions \nthreatened by J K \nhave been pursued but we do feel as if we have been bullied into silence. We think this might in part be because we were\n instrumental in an article in the local press \nthat\n revealed the sums earned\n \nby the Chief Executive of J K  (the former headteacher of J\n) and other local 'executive principals' including at \nG\n. As the Nottingham Post said, these are well in excess of \nthe pu\nblished pay scales for headteachers in maintained schools and we believe they offer another example of how resources are being misdirected in the new school system\n.\n&#xa0;\n13. \nThe development of academies has involved expenditure that we think would have been be\ntter spent directly on education. Several schools or ‘trusts’ have executive principals or CEOs in addition to headteachers, several of whom are paid ex\ntremely well (\nas reported in the Nottingham Post\n - \nhttp://www.nottinghampost.com/Heads-Notts-academies-e\narn-PM/story-19840343-detail/story.html\n); \na wide range of \nposts are proliferating at academies as evidenced by the Jobs Section of the Not\ntingham Post\n.  These posts may perform important roles\n, however we question\n, for example,\n the educational value of a ‘\nPublicity Officer’ (\nrecently advertised by \nJ K Trust) that\n appears to have more to do with marketing than teaching children in classrooms\n. Moreover\n we question whether the move away from local authority provision has resulted in the reduction of bureaucracy that was always claimed by advocates of academisation\n.\n Indeed, as multi-academy trusts\n in our area grow, many have established business premises \nlocated away from schools.  This again suggests that the argument that academisation would direct resources away from town halls and into schools is proving \nmisguided.\n \n \nRather we are seeing new bureaucracies being created, in one case located in \na \npremium \nlocation in the \nbusiness district\n of \nNottingham. \n&#xa0;\n14. \nWe wonder also how much money the New Schools Network \n(a publicly funded quango run by people close to Michael Gove) \nh\nas put into supporting the J K\n free schools\n (L\n, \nM\n and N\n)\n. \nThe original two\n had website\ns\n from early on, which featured children apparently wea\nring the L \nFree School uniform; the same child models and people pretending to be teachers\n appeared\n on the ‘sister’ M Free School web site (the L \nFS site has been taken down after the DfE f\nailed to support it\n and, in its place, at the same address, a website for the N Free School has appeared. \nH\now much public money \nhas been\n wasted there?). In passing, we also question whether the adults and young people who appeared \n– and still appear - \nin t\nhe website pictures were paid models or member\ns of staff/students at J\n or \nK\n? If the latter, were proper permissions and procedures followed? Whatever the case, public money has been – and is being – spent to promote these schools, one of which at least wil\nl not come to pass.\n&#xa0;\nCONCLUSION\n14. \nIn short, therefore, those who promote academies and free schools in our area do not engage in debate or proper consultation with those who might be considered legitimate stake-holders, preferring to further their cause \nby more underhand means including, where they feel it necessary, threat and intimidation. They also appear to be engaged in an undemocratic behind-the-scenes 'network' of dubious conflicted interests, with clear financial benefits for some at the top.\n Fina\nlly, posing as both more effective and efficient than local authority schools, academies and free schools \nactually \nappear to waste public money\n - on\n additional management/admin posts or promotion - \nthat could be \nbetter spent on the education of children.\n A\ns yet, we have seen little evidence locally that academies are more effective than their local authority predecessors and counterparts. \n&#xa0;\n15. \nIn conclusion, \nwe very much welcome the Select Committee review, and the opportunity to present our arguments.  As we indicate, we are a relatively small group, and we are all volunteers.  We have no resources of an appreciable nature.  We are clear that we are opposed t\no \na\ncademies and \nf\nree \ns\nchools, for the reasons indicated.  However, our concerns are not just that our criticisms of \na\ncademies and \nf\nree \ns\nchools \nappear\n \nto be \nwell\n-\nfounded, \nbut that genuine community debate on these issues is often being stifled.  As a group \nof local people, we are well connected to parents, governors and those who work in schools.  We therefore hear what is happening in schools, and how decisions are being made. We know what is going on.  However, as a small group of local campaigners, with v\nery few resources, we are left with anecdot\nal\n rather than systematic evidence.  \nWe also understand that those who seek to stifle debate in the ways we have described have no interest in opening themselves up to serious research\n into\n their processes of gove\nrnance.\n&#xa0;\n16. \nOur view is \nthat \nthere is an urgent need to commission serious, detailed and independent research into many of the issues identified in this submission.  There is much that is rotten in the governance of schools currently if our stories are re\nplicated on a much wider scale\n across the country\n.  Much more difficult and penetrating questions need to be posed, and \nappropriate\n \nresearch undertaken, if we are to develop a\n \nmore authentic understanding of what is really happening in our schools.  We \nhope that the Select Committee Review is the start of this process, and that much more work will be undertaken as a result.\n&#xa0;\nKey to Case Study schools:\nA Primary Academy\n, recently ‘converted’; \nB Junior School, a school which has been considering and debat\ning becoming an academy for about a year\n;\nC Primary Academy\n, an ‘early converter’;\nE Primary\n, run by the local authority;\nF Primary School\n, a recent ‘converter’;\nG Academy, a large secondary,  the\n ‘parent’ of a growing cluster of schools, run by the associated G Trust\n;\nH Primary, a large primary which has so far remained\n with the local authority;\nJ Comprehensive, an ‘outstanding’ academy\n;\nK School, less successful secondary school, being supported \nby J\n;\nJK Trust: schools J and K have become an ‘academy trust’, led by the former headteacher of J\n and has recently added another school which was already an academy;\nL Free School, a free school proposed by the JK Trust (turned down by DfE)\n;\nM Free School\n, a free school, proposed by the JK Trust and approved by the DfE, due to open in September 2014\n;\nN F\nree School\n, a free school proposed by the J K Trust to open on September 2014, close to the area in which the L Free School was proposed, whic\nh was \nrejected by the DfE; the N\n Free School has been submitted for approval by the DfE but a decision has not yet been made. \n&#xa0;\nColin Tucker, Chair, ‘Hands Off Our Schools’\n [colintucker18@gmail.com]\nhttp://nottsantiacademies.org\n18 \nDecember, 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
