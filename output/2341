defaultUntil recently I rode my Dales pony on the green lanes of Wensleydale, in the beautiful countryside of the Yorkshire Dales National Park.  Most of these had areas where motor cycles and four by fours had damaged the land, widening the existing tracks onto the surrounding land, to avoid the huge ruts they had already made on previous forays.  As well as the damage these vehicles do, the noise they make can be heard for miles, spoiling any chance of walkers, cyclists or horse riders enjoying the sounds of the countryside.

defaultIt would be much appreciated by the majority, if when assembling the Deregulation Bill, all unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads, could be re-classified as Restricted Byways.  Also when a traffic regulation order has not been imposed, and there is much support for one, there should be a right of appeal.

defaultI fully support the formal submissions made by The Green Lanes Environmental Action Group, the Green Lanes Protection Group, The Peak District Green Lanes Alliance and The Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance.
