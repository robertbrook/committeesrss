defaultWritten Submission by the Law Society of Scotland VEP 0023default&#xa0;defaultThe Society’s Constitutional Law Sub-Committee has considered the call for evidence on the Draft Bill and has the following comments to make.
default&#xa0;
defaultGeneral Principlesdefault&#xa0;
defaultAs a matter of general principle the United Kingdom should seek to comply with its international obligations including those under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).   Fundamentally, this is an issue of support for the rule of law – a value which the United Kingdom seeks to uphold.
default&#xa0;
defaultConsideration of the optionsdefault&#xa0;
defaultIn the Committee’s view, Option 3 (restatement of the existing law) would not satisfy the terms of the ECHR and would be subject to the criticism of the European Court of Human Rights that a general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction on a vitally important convention right had to be seen as falling outside any acceptable margin of appreciation, however wide that margin might be, and as being incompatible with Article 3 of Protocol No.1.   Accordingly the proper choice is between Option 1(Disqualifying Prisoners sentenced to 4 years or more in prison from voting) and Option 2 (Disqualifying prisoners sentenced to 6 months or more in prison from voting).   
default&#xa0;
defaultIn a written ministerial statement made by Mark Harper MP (the then Minister for Constitutional and Political Reform) on 20 December 2010, Mr Harper announced that the Government “will act to implement the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. In deciding how to proceed, we have been guided by three principles. First, that we should implement the Hirst judgment in a way that meets our legal obligations, but does not go further than that. Secondly, that the most serious offenders will not be given the right to vote. Thirdly, that we should seek to prevent the taxpayer having to face future claims for compensation.   The Government will therefore bring forward legislation providing that the blanket ban in the existing law will be replaced. Offenders sentenced to a custodial sentence of four years or more will lose the right to vote in all circumstances, which reflects the Government's clear view that more serious offenders should not retain the right to vote.” 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the Committee’s view, the proposed 6 month rule would not satisfy the Court and is not objectively justifiable and accordingly Option 2 should not be followed.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn terms of the distinction between short and long term prisoners, based upon whether a prisoner has been sentenced to more or less than 4 years, sentencing generally has some relevance to the severity of the offence and the individual circumstances of the case and is therefore one of the criteria mentioned by the European Court of Human Rights which may allow disenfranchisement to be imposed.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough there may be concern about whether Option 1 (4 year rule) would satisfy the court and that it may be vulnerable to challenge in future, nevertheless, it seems an appropriate mid-point.   There are currently 2,400 prisoner vote cases pending at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.   This may give the Committee some assistance when considering the potential impact of a failure to legislate properly on this topic.   As Lord Mackay stated in the Committee’s 5th Report (February 2011) Paragraph 13, persistence in 
defaultignoring the court’s judgement creates a situation where “the right to damages becomes a realistic expectation”.
default&#xa0;
defaultI hope that these comments are helpful.
