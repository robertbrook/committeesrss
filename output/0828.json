"Written evidence from the Health Foundation (LTC 78)&#xa0;1.0              Executive summary&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nThe Health Foundation is an independent charity working to improve the quality of healthcare in the UK. Informed by our research and improvement programmes, this submission of evidence \nconsiders \nthe ability of the NHS to ‘\ntreat the patient\n as a person’\n and recommends changes\n needed to deliver high quality, person-ce\nntred care for people with long-\nterm conditions.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nThe NHS has only a very limited ability to deliver person-centred care for people with \nlong-term\n conditions.\n \nThis is because p\natients are largely viewed by clinicians as passive recipients of care and few are supported to develop the skills, confidence and behaviour to effectively manage their conditions. Furthermore, the \nway that the health system is structured and its processes are organised poses a barrier to more person-centred care.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nThe \nvast \nmajority of care for a person with \nlong-term\n conditions is delivered by the individual patient themselves\n because they are living with their condition every day\n. \nIt is therefore essential that \nimprovement of health services \nis \nfocused upon supporting people \nto effectively manage\n their own conditions.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nThere must be\n \nchanges to the roles, mindsets and behaviours of patients and clinicians, supported by processes and infrastructure that enable a new relationship of partnership between people and health professionals.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n              \nTo make the rhetoric of person-centred care a reality, action is required by clinical com\nmissioning groups, NHS England \nand those bodies with influ\nence on\n the education and training of health professionals.\n&#xa0;\n2.0              What is person-centred care and why is it important?&#xa0;\n2\n.1\n              \nCoordinated, community-based services are important, but not \non their own \nsufficient, to deliver sustainable and effective care for people with \nlong-term\n conditions\n. \nThere needs to be a fundamental change in how government a\nnd the NHS think\n about care for people with \nlong-term\n conditions. \n&#xa0;\n2\n.\n2\n              \nIt is vital that the improvement of \nlong-term\n conditions management is focused on the role patients themselves can play in effectively managing their conditions. On average, a person with a \nlong-term\n condition spends just three hours each year in contact with a health professional, and that contact does not always coincide with the periods of time when an individual most needs support. \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nPerson-centred care \nshould\n \nsupport people to self-manage, offer personalised care planning and enable people to share in decision making\n.\n It should\n \nuse the \nlimited time patients\n \nspend wi\nth a health professional \nto\n:\n enable patients to become knowledgeable, confident managers of their health\n; \nsupport\n people\n with \nlong-term\n conditions\n to make informed decisions about and \nto \nsuccessfully manage their own\n,\n health and \ncare\n; \ndeliver\n care that is responsive to people’s individual abilities, preferences, lifestyles and goals.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nDespite the promotion of these approaches by government and health policy leaders\n,\n truly person-centred care has not spread beyond core innovators. The ability of the NHS to “treat the patient as a person” is far too limited.\n \n&#xa0;\n2\n.\n5\n              \nCreating this person-centred health system\n requires different roles, behaviours and mindsets from clinicians and \npatients, supported by processes and infrastructure that\n enable new relationship\ns\n.\n \nHealth professionals need to view people as partners in their care, rather than passive recipients. They need to understand the motivations and challenges that each \nindividual faces in adopting healthy behaviours – not just the biomedical challenges, but psychological and social challenges as well. \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nThis requires \na \nfundamental shift\n in how health services are delivered, with the emphasis moving \nfrom\n focusing on improving clinical outcomes \nto\n quality of life, \nfrom\n providing specialist treatment \nto\n generic support, and \nfrom\n a system that reacts to people’s ill health to one that focuses proactively on enabling people to live as healthily as possible.\n&#xa0;3.0              Our evidence base&#xa0;\n3\n.1\n              \nThis submission of evidence is informed by the \nHealth Foundation\n’s improvement programmes and research, and focuses primarily upon our learning about how to effectively implement self management support and shared decision making.\n \n&#xa0;\n3\n.2\n              \nStarting in 2007, t\nhe Health Foundation’s \nCo-creating Health\n (CCH) \nimprovement programme \nworked \nfor five years \nwith several NHS sites\n \nto demonstrate the best ways to redesign routine care so that patients are well support\ned\n to manage their \nlong-term\n conditions.\n It featured\n training programmes for patients and health professionals \nand \na \nservice \nimprovement programme. \nFour sites have now been given additional funding which they will be using over the next two years to continue to embed self management in their services.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.3\n              \nThe Health Foundation’s \nMaking \nGood Decisions in Collaboration (MAGIC)\n \nimprovement programme \nhas been exploring how clinical services can support patients to share in decision making.\n \nMAGIC \nhas not been tested\n specifically\n \nin the context of \nlong-term\n conditions,\n but\n is relevant because people with \nlong-term\n conditions are faced with care and treatment options.\n \n&#xa0;\n3\n.4\n              \nOur \nClosing the Gap through Cha\nn\nging Relationships\n \nand Shine\n \nimprovement programme\ns\n \nhave supported NHS teams to \nexplore innovative ways to improving care.\n \nProjects \nhave \ninclude\nd\n the provision of \nhome-based web consultations \nfor patients with diabetes and support for people with \nkidney disease to use self-dialysis in hospital.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nThe research we draw on in this submission includes our syntheses\n of the evidence bases for self-\nmanagement support and shared decision making\n \nand\n an exploration of the interaction between patients and clinicians during the consultation\n.\n \n&#xa0;4.0              Barriers to person-centred care&#xa0;4\n.1 \n              \nThe b\narriers to person-centred care are lar\ngely cultural and arise\n \nfrom\n the\n \nthree key participants\n in healthcare:\n health professionals, patients\n and \norganisational processes\n.\n \n&#xa0;4\n.\n2\n              \nHealth professionals.\n \nThe a\nttitudes, beliefs and behaviours ingrained in \nhealth professionals\n limit their ability to provide effective, person-centred\n care\n. \nBarriers include\n the following\n: \n&#xa0;\n4\n.2.1\n              \n‘\nWe already do that.\n’\n \nThere is a lack of a clear, shared understanding about what effective person-centred care looks like. When urged to participate in our programmes, many health professionals said they already are supporting their patients to self-manage or ar\ne using shared decision making.\n \nBut after training sessions, many realised that they had not be\nen using a truly person-centred \napproach.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.2.2\n              \n‘\nThere isn’t enough time.\n’\n A common response to our programmes was that health professionals felt they had too much to do and no time to participate in training or \nto \nengage in self-management support and shared decision making. Clinicians also feared that \nthe approaches would\n lengthen the time of consultations.\n \n&#xa0;\n4\n.2.3\n              \nHealth professionals lack understanding about the value of involving patients in design and delivery.\n In Co-creating Health, for example, lay tutors sometimes found that \nhealth professionals\n questioned the role \npatients \ncould play in clinician training. \n&#xa0;\n4\n.2.4\n              \nHealth professionals are not taught \nskills necessary for person-centred support.\n Our programmes found that few health professionals are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand what motivates their patients and support them to change behaviours\n.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.\n3\n              PatientsIndividuals with \nlong-term\n conditions may have a poorer quality of life, lower levels of support from social networks, and less confidence in their ability to manage their health than people without \nlong-term\n conditions.\n Barriers include\n the following\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n4\n.3.1\n              \nPatients l\nack of \nknowledge, skills, and \nconfidence\n to effectively manage their\n own\n health\n. \nBeing diagnosed with a \nlong-term\n condition is a life-changing event which may involve changes in lifestyle and \nrequire new \ncompetenc\nies\n in\n, for example,\n medicines management\n. \n&#xa0;\n4\n.3.2\n              \nPatients feel \n‘\ndoctor knows best\n’\n.\n \nFeelings of deference\n or anxiety\n toward\ns\n health professionals \nmade\n some \npatients \nreluctant to engage in \ntraining \nprogrammes \nor in \na new kind of consultation\n in which they act as partners with clinicians in planning and making decisions about their care.\n \n&#xa0;\n4\n.\n4\n              Organisational processesH\nealthcare delivery \nsystems – including the services that are commissioned, \noperational systems and financial incentives \n– can \nbe \nbarriers \nto \nperson-centred care\n.\n These barriers include the following\n:\n&#xa0;\n4\n.4.1\n              \nPatients lack access to a range of services that fit their individual needs and abilities.\n \nP\nroviding information \nalone is not enough\n to support people with \nlong-term\n conditions\n. \nPeople need p\nroactive support \nto \nhelp \nthem\n develop \nthe \nconfidence\n,\n \nskills and knowledge to manage their health and care\n.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.4.2\n              \nCommissioners lack an understand\ning of person-centred care and ‘\nhow to get \nit\n’\n.\n \nCommissioners who gave insights for Co-creating Health recognised the role of self-management support in reducing pressure on services. However, their understanding of effective self-management support was mixed and some were unsure about how to commission it.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.4.3\n              \nIT systems can prevent easy access and flow of information\n. \nFor example, one Co-creating Health team faced the problem of GPs using different IT systems, which prevented them from flagging patients participating in the \ntraining \nprogramme. \n&#xa0;\n4\n.4.4\n              \nL\nack of access to test results or \nother \ninformation \nin advance of \na consultation\n.\n Our systems are designed to give test results or information about treatment options during the consultation\n, which hinders agenda setting, care planning and shared decision making within allotted consultation times.\n \n&#xa0;\n4\n.4.5\n              \nTariffs are not always aligned to provide self-management support.\n In our shared haemodialysis project\n,\n \nfor example, \np\neople with kidney disease\n learnt\n to self-administer dialysis in hospital, gaining ind\nependence and freeing up staff.\n Patients use button hol\ning – a means \nto self-administer dialysis\n –\n but the tariff acts as a disincentive because the needles \nnecessary \nare more expensive than\n the\n sharp\ner\n needles used in staff-administered dialysis. \n&#xa0;5.0              What we have learned about how to overcome these barriers&#xa0;5\n.1\n              \nCreating a culture that supports person-centred care is a significant challenge\n. \nOur programme teams \nhave \nhad to be creative and\n flexible to overcome barriers.\n Support from senior leadership – up to trust board levels –\n has been vital in \ngaining traction.\n \n&#xa0;\n5\n.2\n              \nChanging culture and behaviours among health professionalsHealth professionals need education, training, and development that gives them \nthe \nknowledge and \nskills \nrequired \nfor person-centred care.\n \nThe Health Foundation has learnt the importance of\n the following\n:\n&#xa0;\n5\n.2.1\n              \nEncouraging participation in training\n.\n Getting health professionals to participate in training required clearly setting out the benefits of self-management suppo\nrt and shared decision making. \nTo address time concerns, t\neams had to adapt training, in some cases shortening the programme or offering mi\nni-training\n sessions\n to support staff. \nThose\n who participated found that using shared decision making and agenda setting helped to structure con\nsultations\n.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.2.2\n              \nTraining whole teams\n. \nCo-creating Health found it important to train whole teams of health professionals from the same service, so that everyone involved had a common understanding of self-management support and its tools and techniques.\n \n&#xa0;\n5\n.2.3\n              \nEnsuring health professionals have the right skills.\n \nTraining involved role playing as well as education in support techniques such as motivational interviewing and coaching skills, which are key to helping patients build confidence.\n \n&#xa0;\n5\n.3\n              \nChanging culture and behaviours among patientsPatients who attended Co-creating Health group sessions had, on average, become more motivated and confident to self-manage.\n \nAs one person who took the course said: \n‘\n[I]t galvanised me, it got me going.\n \nI think I pulled myself out of a hole and decided that I was going to do it.\n \nLike the lay person [tutor], she’d obviously taken charge of her illness, and I thought well I can do that, I’m not a wimp\n’.\n \nOur programme\ns\n helped overcome \npatient \nbarriers in the following ways\n:\n&#xa0;\n5\n.3.1\n              \nEncouraging participation in patient training.\n Co-creating Health found that patients sometimes needed encouragement from a trusted source – especially their GP – \nto prompt them to participate in a training programme.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.3.2\n              \nOffering activities\n that build confidence\n.\n \nCo-creating Health \noffered biomedical, psychological and in some cases socia\nl support through peer support.\n Group sessions included goal setting, problem solving, and relaxation, as well as condition-specific training such as self-monitoring or managing pain. Lay and clinical tutors used techniques such as positive psycho\nlogy, motivational interviewing\n and helping people identify unhelpful beliefs. \n5\n.3.3\n              \nAdapting to patients’ needs and preferences\n. Teams \nsometimes\n \nchanged \nthe length \nor content of sessions to suit patients\n. \nThey developed creative ways to promote and carry out self-management support, such as through practice-b\nased resource libraries or text \nmessages to follow up on goals.\n5\n.3.4\n              \nInvolving patients in design and delivery of training sessions\n. Several project managers found that involving pati\nents in the design, development\n and implementation of the programmes was vital to meet patients’ needs b\necause the patient perspective ‘could not be imagined’\n by professionals.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.3.5\n              \nPromoting peer support\n.\n Peer support at some sites also helped motivate people to engage. Peer support activities ranged from regular phone calls with a \n‘\nbuddy\n’\n, reunions for those who had participated in training together, and a peer-led walking group.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.4 \n              \nChanging systemsWhole system change is needed to integrate person-centred care into care pathways. More work is needed at all levels to investigate and consider what systems or tariffs \nare\n supporting or\n hampering person-centred care.\n \nO\nur programme teams made some progress\n in this\n with help \nfrom \ntheir wider organisations.\n Progress included the following\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n5\n.4.1\n              \nDeveloping tools and support for clinicians\n. \nSome teams developed agenda-\nsetting sheets to help patients identify what they want from a consultation, confidence rulers to help assess the likelihood of a behaviour change and health plans to capture patients’ commitments to their actions. Other\n teams developed electronic templates\n \nto prompt clinicians and\n help structure consultations. \nA\ndministrative staff \nmembers were trained\n to \nh\nelp get information out before consultations. \n&#xa0;\n5\n.4.2\n              \nCreating access to h\nome-based solutions that promote independence\n. \nA\n \nHealth Foundation \nprojec\nt has \noffered diabetes foll\now-up consultations by web-cam.\n Patients reported that, compared to face-to-face appointments, web consultations s\naved time, were more convenient\n and \nthat they \nwould be more likely to attend them.\n&#xa0;6.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecommendations &#xa0;\nWe want to see as many people as possible supported to develop the skills, knowledge and confidence to successfully manage their health. To make this possible:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.0              Oral evidenceThe Health Foundation would be pleased to give oral evidence to the committee if it would be helpful to the inquiry.\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n&#xa0;\n Further information about self management support and shared decision making is available on the Health Foundation’s resource centres at http://selfmanagementsupport.health.org.uk/ and http://shareddecisionmaking.health.org.uk/. \n Further information about CCH is available at http://www.health.org.uk/areas-of-work/programmes/co-creating-health/. \n Further information about MAGIC is available at http://www.health.org.uk/areas-of-work/programmes/shared-decision-making/. \n Further information about Closing the Gap through Changing Relationships is available at http://www.health.org.uk/areas-of-work/programmes/closing-the-gap-through-changing-relationships/.\n Further information about Shine is available at http://www.health.org.uk/areas-of-work/programmes/shine-eleven/ \n The Health Foundation (2011). \nHelping people help themselves\n.
