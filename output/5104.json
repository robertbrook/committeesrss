"&#xa0;\nEvidence submitted by Neotropical Primate Conservation, January 2014.&#xa0;\nSummary: Trade in primates as pets, wherever this trade occurs, is damaging to primate welfare and to conservation efforts.  The UK should take immediate steps to stop the trade and keeping of all primates.  \n&#xa0;\nNeotropical\n Primate Conservation (NPC), establ\nished in 2007, is an NGO that works to protect primates and their habitats in some of the most biologically diverse (and threatened) regions on the planet.  We are regularly involved in the confiscation, rescue and care of primates and other wildlife from \nillegal trade in South America, and are intimately familiar with the issues relevant to the keeping of primates as pets - especially the damage wreaked by the trade on the endangered primates of the region.\n&#xa0;\nIn our submission  we comment only on the questi\non of “whether people should be allowed to keep primates as pets”.  Other organisations are better placed to answer the other questions.    \n&#xa0;\nIn short, the UK should act swiftly to ban the trade and keeping of pet primates in order to prevent the inevitabl\ne suffering that the pet trade causes for all primates and the negative impact that the trade has on wild populations. Support for a ban has been expressed by numerous professional veterinary, research, conservation, animal rights and welfare groups\n.\n(1–6)\n&#xa0;\nFew primate owners \ndeliberately or \nknowingly harm their pets\n.\n  But by its very nature, the keeping of primates as pets is damaging and should not be allowed to continue.  \nIn a review of the pertinent literature utilizing \nSchuppli\n and Frasier's “framework \nfor assessing the suitability of different species as pets”,(7)  \nSoulsbury\n et.al. concluded: \n“strong evidence supports the argument that primates are not suitable pets; it is unlikely that the welfare of pet primates can be adequately addressed in normal h\nouseholds”.(8)  \n&#xa0;\nResearch specifically perta\nining to \npet\n primates is scarce, but primates constitute the most extensively studied of all animal orders.(3)  Maternal deprivation and isolation from \nconspecifics\n, both of which are common practice in the prim\nate pet trade, have been intensively studied since the 1950s and it is clear that these practices are detrimental to the welfare of primates as measured by parameters such as: \nneophobia\n; plasma \ncortisol\n levels; abnormal behaviours; \nanaclitic\n depression/wit\nhdrawal; cell-mediated immunity; and survivorship\n.\n(9–15)\n  Studies of captive primates in non-domestic environments, such as zoos and laboratories, demonstrate that even with specialist care, abnormal behaviours and captivity-related complications are hard to avoid.\n(16–19)\n   \n&#xa0;\nIn a study of ex-laboratory chimpan\nzees at a North A\nmerican sanctuary, \nchimps showed clear signs of what would be termed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD] in humans, according to the criteria set out in the DSM-IV (\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n).(20,21)  A simila\nr study found that ex-pet capuchin monkeys resident at Wild Futures' Monkey Sanctuary in the UK showed symptoms of disorders homologous to PTSD, Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, at significantly higher rates than zoo capuchins.(22)  \nPet m\nonkeys are highly susceptible to metabolic bone disease, diabetes, obesity, emaciation, poor fur/skin condition, and other physical ailments.  \n&#xa0;\nWith the great popularity of internet-based social networks and cable television channels in rural South Americ\na, people are increasingly exposed to European and North American cultural practices  and are strongly influenced by them.  When South Americans see that the keeping of pet primates is legally accepted in places like the UK, it encourages them to buy these\n species even in the face of their own country's prohibitions on trade.  Pet primates in South America are almost always wild \ncaught, causing an estimated ten deaths for each monkey that survives to become a pet. The work of conservation NGOs and the autho\nrities to tackle wildlife traffic is undermined and many endangered species are exposed to even greater risk of extinction.  \n&#xa0;\nTo keep any animal as a pet should not be considered as an automatic right – it is a privilege that must hinge on whether a perso\nn is able to provide, \nand\n whether the animal itself is capable of experiencing, a good life as a pet.  Life as pets clearly and demonstrably damages primates.  There is no reason that the trade should be allowed to continue.    \n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\nLiterature Cited&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1. \n              \nAVMA G.
