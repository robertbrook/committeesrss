"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Eating Better: for a fair, green, healthy future&#xa0;\nIntroduction:&#xa0;\nEating Better: for a fair, green, healthy future\n is a\n \nUK alliance \nthat is \nraising awareness of the need\n for food policies that put sustainable \nfood \nconsumption at the heart of \nsolutions to national and global food security challenges.\n&#xa0;\nWe are calling for action by governments, the food industry and all those who can make a difference to help people move towards eating less meat and more food that’s better for us and the planet, a\ns part of the vital task of creating sustainable food and farming systems.\n&#xa0;\nLaunched in July 2013 with the endorsement of\n \nHugh \nFearnley-Whittingstall\n, Eating \nBetter’s\n growing support includes \n36\n national \norganisations\n and partner networks\n spanning the brea\ndth of health, environment, social justice, animal welfare, international development, resource use, sustainable business and faith perspectives.\n (see Appendix 1)\n&#xa0;\nEating Better encourages a culture where we place greater value on the food we eat, the anim\nals that provide it and the people who produce it.\n&#xa0;\n Eating Better supports farmers who produce meat in a sustainable way.\n \nEating Better has called for a global conversation about meat consumption\n,\n which has as its goal a world in which everyone values and\n has access to healthy, humane and sustainable diets.\n&#xa0;\n High meat consuming countries and individuals have reduced their consumption in line with health recommendations and greenhouse gas reduction targets.\n&#xa0;\n Meat is produced humanely and sustainably, its pr\noduction provides sustainable livelihoods, environmental benefits and it is consumed in quantities consistent with good health and global resource use capacity.\n&#xa0;\nWe welcome the \nEnvironment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs \nCommittee\n’s Inquiry into food security\n.\n \n \nOur submission has \nbeen prepared in consultation with our supporting \norg\nanisations\n and partner networks.  \n&#xa0;\nOur response\n addresses\n Q1: How best to improve UK (and EU) food security, including u\nsing resources more efficiently and Q7: \nWays of increasing self\n sufficiency in products for which the UK has a comparative advantage\n.\n&#xa0;\nSummary:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Food security policy needs to focus on consumption as well as production&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“\nThe solution is not just to produce more food, or change diets, or eliminate waste.  The potential threats are so great th\nat they cannot be met by making changes piecemeal to parts of the food system.  It is essential that policy-makers address all areas at the same time.”\n \n(p12)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“Demand for the most resource-\nintensive types of food must be contained\n..\n”\n \n(pa\nge 12)\n&#xa0;\n“It has been argued that a reduction in the amount of meat consumed in high- and middle-income countries would have multiple benefits: a reduced demand for grain, leading to lower greenhouse gas emiss\nions, and a positive effect on health….. Policy-makers should \nrecognise\n that more proactive measures affecting the demand and production of meat may be required should current trends in global consumption continue to rise\n.”\n \n(page 22)\n&#xa0;\nThe evidence for addressing consumption is compelling&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n ‘M\nost of the world’s \npeople consume more milk and meat than necessary, and many consume more t\nhan is healthy. Obtaining calo\nries and protein through animal products is also highly inefficient from a resource use standpoint. \n… \nWe project an 82 percent increase in meat consumpti\non b\netween 2006 and 2050, and hold\ning down growth in consumption by the world’s upper and growing middle class would reduce land demands and greenhouse gas emissions\n…..\nYet this menu item may be necessary not to close the food gap but just\n to keep it from g\nrowing larger.\n \n…\n High-consuming regions will probably need to eat less meat just to provide room within the FAO projections for billions of people in low-consuming regions to eat a little more.\n’\n&#xa0;Policy progress towards sustainable diets lacks Ministerial commitment&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWays of increasing self-sufficiency in products for which the UK has a comparative advantage (Q7)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n‘\nUK consumers buying meat and dairy products should be encouraged to consider the environmental, as well as the health, impacts of their choices. To enable consumers to make informed decisions\n, Defra needs to do more work on what are the most sustainable methods of livestock production, and the balance to be struck between animal welfare, biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions, and the need to conserve inputs such as water.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis submission has been coordinated by: \nSue Dibb\nCoordinator\nEating Better: for a fair, green, healthy future\nEmail: \nsue@eating-better.org\nWebsite: \nwww.eating-better.org\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\nAppendix 1:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1\n&#xa0;\n \nForesight.The\n Future of Food and Farming (2011) Final Project Report.
