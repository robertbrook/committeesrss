Letter from [bold]Rt Hon Theresa May MP, Home Secretary[bold], [bold]to the Chair of the Committee, [bold]9 December 2013[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Detention of Filimone Lacanivalu[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for your letter dated 15 November expressing your concerns about
[normal] the treatment of Mr Lacanivalu
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I recognise and value the immense sacrifice and contribution made by
[normal] 
[normal]members of our Armed Forces, including foreign and Commonwealth
[normal] 
[normal]personnel. Their contribution is reflected in the Immigration Rules and
[normal] 
[normal]nationality legislation, which enable foreign and Commonwealth personnel to
[normal] 
[normal]apply to naturalise as a British citizen after five years' service, or alternatively
[normal] 
[normal]to apply for settlement after four years' service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Foreign and Commonwealth military personnel are exempt from immigration
[normal] 
[normal]control while serving. On discharge, they are given a period of grace of 28
[normal] 
[normal]days to regularise their immigration status and can subsequently apply to
[normal] 
[normal]settle here up to two years after leaving the military, although they are
[normal] 
[normal]expected not to have remained here in breach of immigration laws in that
[normal] 
[normal]time. Mr Lacanivalu did not apply to regularise his stay in the UK for over two
[normal] 
[normal]years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst immigration officials correctly applied the rules in this case, it is not
[normal] 
[normal]clear that Mr Lacanivalu's Army unit correctly explained to him the immigration
[normal] 
[normal]procedures on his discharge. In the light of the particular circumstances of this
[normal] 
[normal]case, I have personally intervened. Mr Lacanivalu was released from
[normal] 
[normal]detention on Friday 15 November and will shortly be granted Indefinite Leave
[normal] 
[normal]to Remain in the UK exceptionally outside the Immigration Rules.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I instructed UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) to complete an urgent review of
[normal] 
[normal]all of the cases of those individuals identified as ex-HM Armed Forces who
[normal] 
[normal]are currently detained. The review identified a total of eight former British
[normal] 
[normal]Armed Forces personnel in detention. The majority of these (six) are pending
[normal] 
[normal]deportation following serious criminal offences and after obtaining a significant
[normal] 
[normal]custodial sentence. One further individual has been detained following
[normal] 
[normal]curtailment of exemption from immigration control due to drug abuse. The
[normal] 
[normal]individual in the remaining case was discharged from the Armed Forces in
[normal] 
[normal]2010 following a failed drugs test. All individuals have been assessed and in
[normal] 
[normal]each case continued detention is considered to be both justified and
[normal] 
[normal]proportionate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]You also asked for details of British Army veterans who have been granted
[normal] 
[normal]British citizenship as well as the number deported in the years since 2008; this
[normal] 
[normal]information is not available.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Rt Hon Theresa May MP
[normal]Home Secretary
