Letter from defaultRt Hon Theresa May MP, Home Secretarydefault, defaultto the Chair of the Committee, default9 December 2013default&#xa0;defaultDetention of Filimone Lacanivaludefault&#xa0;
defaultThank you for your letter dated 15 November expressing your concerns about
default the treatment of Mr Lacanivalu
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultI recognise and value the immense sacrifice and contribution made by
default 
defaultmembers of our Armed Forces, including foreign and Commonwealth
default 
defaultpersonnel. Their contribution is reflected in the Immigration Rules and
default 
defaultnationality legislation, which enable foreign and Commonwealth personnel to
default 
defaultapply to naturalise as a British citizen after five years' service, or alternatively
default 
defaultto apply for settlement after four years' service.
default&#xa0;
defaultForeign and Commonwealth military personnel are exempt from immigration
default 
defaultcontrol while serving. On discharge, they are given a period of grace of 28
default 
defaultdays to regularise their immigration status and can subsequently apply to
default 
defaultsettle here up to two years after leaving the military, although they are
default 
defaultexpected not to have remained here in breach of immigration laws in that
default 
defaulttime. Mr Lacanivalu did not apply to regularise his stay in the UK for over two
default 
defaultyears.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst immigration officials correctly applied the rules in this case, it is not
default 
defaultclear that Mr Lacanivalu's Army unit correctly explained to him the immigration
default 
defaultprocedures on his discharge. In the light of the particular circumstances of this
default 
defaultcase, I have personally intervened. Mr Lacanivalu was released from
default 
defaultdetention on Friday 15 November and will shortly be granted Indefinite Leave
default 
defaultto Remain in the UK exceptionally outside the Immigration Rules.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultI instructed UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) to complete an urgent review of
default 
defaultall of the cases of those individuals identified as ex-HM Armed Forces who
default 
defaultare currently detained. The review identified a total of eight former British
default 
defaultArmed Forces personnel in detention. The majority of these (six) are pending
default 
defaultdeportation following serious criminal offences and after obtaining a significant
default 
defaultcustodial sentence. One further individual has been detained following
default 
defaultcurtailment of exemption from immigration control due to drug abuse. The
default 
defaultindividual in the remaining case was discharged from the Armed Forces in
default 
default2010 following a failed drugs test. All individuals have been assessed and in
default 
defaulteach case continued detention is considered to be both justified and
default 
defaultproportionate.
default&#xa0;
defaultYou also asked for details of British Army veterans who have been granted
default 
defaultBritish citizenship as well as the number deported in the years since 2008; this
default 
defaultinformation is not available.
default&#xa0;
