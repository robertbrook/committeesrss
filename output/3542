defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
default1. 
defaultThe Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE) is 
defaultthe 
defaulthealth and safety regulator in 
defaultGreat Britain
default for work related activities, including those associated with shale gas.
default&#xa0;
default2. 
defaultHSE’s role is to ensure that operators of shale gas activities are adequately managing and controlling risks to the health and safety of people, whether workers, contractors, or members of the public. 
default&#xa0;
default3. 
defaultHSE has no role in setting energy policy and deciding what is the right mix of energy sources.  HSE is also not involved in 
defaultenvironmental protection, 
defaultlicensing or planning decisions related to shale gas.
default However, HSE does work collaboratively with the bodies responsible for overseeing such areas.
default&#xa0;
default4. 
defaultFor shale gas operations, HSE focuses on ensuring gas wells are designed, constructed, operated, maintained, and ultimately decommissioned to ensure that the flow of gases and
default 
defaultfluids in the well, whether fracking fluids or extracted gas or water is controlled and stays within the well. This is called ‘well integrity’ and is equally important for safety as well as environmental protection.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhatdefault are the main process safety hazardsdefault?default&#xa0;
default5. 
defaultThe e
defaultffective management and control of well integrity is key to safe shale gas operations and mitigating the risk of environmental pollution.
default&#xa0;
default6.  
defaultThe main
default hazard
default from shale gas operations
default is 
defaultthe 
defaultuncontrolled release of hydrocarbon gas due to a failure of the well structure, which may then reach a source of ignition leading to a fire or explosion. A well
default-
defaultdesigned and constructed well will reduce the risks of a release of 
defaultgas or 
defaultfluids
default 
defaultas low as is reasonably practicable. The actual level of risk varies, depending on how quickly and easily any release can be controlled, and on geological conditions. 
default&#xa0;
default7
default. 
defaultWhere there is a loss of well integrity, there is also the possibility of fracking fluids or water being released to the surrounding rock strata or at surface, which may have environmental consequences depending on the location of water aquifers.
default&#xa0;
default8
default. 
defaultThe occupational health and sa
defaultfety risks to workers from shale gas
default pilot activities are considerably lower than for other mineral extraction industries (e.g. coal mining and offshore oil and gas). People are generally working at ground level on sites with traditional health and safety risks comparable to a simple construction site, including 
defaultfalls or being hit by something.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe health and safety regulatory regimedefault&#xa0;
default9
default. 
defaultHSE’s regulatory regime is long established
default and is 
defaultgoal 
defaultsetting. 
defaultThe 
defaultgeneral duties under the 
defaultHealth and Safety at Work Act 
defaultetc 
default1974 (HSWA) 
defaultrequire 
defaultrisks to workers and the public to be reduced so far
default as is reasonable practicable. 
defaultThis is 
defaultsupplement
defaulted
default with more specific regulations particular to 
defaultthe 
defaultextraction of gas and oil through wells, which includes shale gas operations.   
default&#xa0;
default10
default. 
defaultThe specific regulations are:
default&#xa0;
defaultThese regulations require notifications to be made to HSE about the design, construction and operation of wells
default,
default and a health and safety plan which sets out how risks are managed on site;
default and
default 
defaultThese regulations include specific requirements for all wells, whether onshore or offshore, and include well integrity provisions which apply throughout the life of shale gas wells. They also require a well operator to provide HSE with regular reports of any activities on the well and to appoint an independent well examiner to undertake regular assessments of well integrity.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1
default1
default. 
defaultThis combination of duties ensures that HSE is provided with information at key stages in the lifecycle of a well and allows 
defaultHSE
default to assess whether risks are being adequately controlled and, if not, to intervene.  
default&#xa0;
defaultHow does HSE conduct its interventions?default&#xa0;
default12
default. 
defaultHSE’s intervention approach has two elements. 
default&#xa0;
default13
default. 
defaultThe first has been to contribute to the development of best practice standards for the industry as a whole with the 
defaultUnited Kingdom Onshore Operators Group
default.
default These standards 
defaultwere published in February 2013.  Such guidance, and existing industry codes dealing with well design and operations, sets clear expectation between HSE and operators as to how the general goal of reducing risks so far is reasonably practicable can be met. 
default&#xa0;
default14
default. 
defaultThe second element is to focus HSE interventions with particular sites and operators on the key risk control measure of ensuring well integrity. For this, HSE uses its team of expert wells engineers who cover all types of hydrocarbon wells both on and offshore. As an oil or gas well is a complex engineered construction, most of which is not accessible to visual inspection, HSE takes a lifecycle approach to well integrity. 
default&#xa0;
default15
default. 
defaultThis lifecycle 
defaultapproach 
defaultconsists of: 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis allows HSE to assess the well design before construction starts. This is a key phase of work where the vast majority of issues likely to have an
default impact on well integrity
default will be identified and addressed by the well operator. It includes ensuring that safety features are incorporated into the design.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThis provides HSE with the assurance that the operator is constructing and operating the well as described in the notification
default.  W
defaulthen they are not, HSE can take the appropriate action.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis includes site inspections to assess well integrity during the operational phase
default. 
defaultF
defaultor new and first time shale gas operators
default,
default HSE and 
defaultthe Environment Agency 
defaultwill meet and advise them of their duties and conduct a joint inspection of their key operations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe independent well examinerdefault&#xa0;
default16
default. 
defaultHSE’s regulatory
default approach is supplemented by the requirement 
defaultin DCR 
defaultfor an independent well examiner to assess 
defaultwell 
defaultdesign, construction and maintenance. The well examiner is an independent competent person separate from the immediate line management of the well operations 
defaultbeing
default examin
defaulted
default. The well examiner can be an employee of the operating company or
default, as is normally 
defaultthe case for 
defaultUK
default onshore wells
default, 
defaulta contractor. 
default&#xa0;
default17
default. 
defaultThe examiner’s task is to review the proposed and actual well operations to confirm they meet the operator’s policies and procedures, comply with DCR and follow good industry practice. This may include periodic site visits.
default&#xa0;
default18
default. 
defaultHSE checks that the operator has these arrangements in place. The well examination scheme and involvement of the well examiner is for the complete lifecycle of the well from design through to final plugging and decommissioning.

defaultHSE has sufficient wells expertise to cope with the current exploratory phase of shale gas

defaultIt will 
defaultreassess the situation if

defaultHSE works closely with these bodies to share relevant information and to ensure that there are no material gaps between the safety, environmental protection and planning authorisation considerations, and that all material concerns are addressed.
