[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1. 
[normal]The Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE) is 
[normal]the 
[normal]health and safety regulator in 
[normal]Great Britain
[normal] for work related activities, including those associated with shale gas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]HSE’s role is to ensure that operators of shale gas activities are adequately managing and controlling risks to the health and safety of people, whether workers, contractors, or members of the public. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. 
[normal]HSE has no role in setting energy policy and deciding what is the right mix of energy sources.  HSE is also not involved in 
[normal]environmental protection, 
[normal]licensing or planning decisions related to shale gas.
[normal] However, HSE does work collaboratively with the bodies responsible for overseeing such areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal]For shale gas operations, HSE focuses on ensuring gas wells are designed, constructed, operated, maintained, and ultimately decommissioned to ensure that the flow of gases and
[normal] 
[normal]fluids in the well, whether fracking fluids or extracted gas or water is controlled and stays within the well. This is called ‘well integrity’ and is equally important for safety as well as environmental protection.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What[bold] are the main process safety hazards[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal]The e
[normal]ffective management and control of well integrity is key to safe shale gas operations and mitigating the risk of environmental pollution.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.  
[normal]The main
[normal] hazard
[normal] from shale gas operations
[normal] is 
[normal]the 
[normal]uncontrolled release of hydrocarbon gas due to a failure of the well structure, which may then reach a source of ignition leading to a fire or explosion. A well
[normal]-
[normal]designed and constructed well will reduce the risks of a release of 
[normal]gas or 
[normal]fluids
[normal] 
[normal]as low as is reasonably practicable. The actual level of risk varies, depending on how quickly and easily any release can be controlled, and on geological conditions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]. 
[normal]Where there is a loss of well integrity, there is also the possibility of fracking fluids or water being released to the surrounding rock strata or at surface, which may have environmental consequences depending on the location of water aquifers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal]. 
[normal]The occupational health and sa
[normal]fety risks to workers from shale gas
[normal] pilot activities are considerably lower than for other mineral extraction industries (e.g. coal mining and offshore oil and gas). People are generally working at ground level on sites with traditional health and safety risks comparable to a simple construction site, including 
[normal]falls or being hit by something.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The health and safety regulatory regime[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal]. 
[normal]HSE’s regulatory regime is long established
[normal] and is 
[normal]goal 
[normal]setting. 
[normal]The 
[normal]general duties under the 
[normal]Health and Safety at Work Act 
[normal]etc 
[normal]1974 (HSWA) 
[normal]require 
[normal]risks to workers and the public to be reduced so far
[normal] as is reasonable practicable. 
[normal]This is 
[normal]supplement
[normal]ed
[normal] with more specific regulations particular to 
[normal]the 
[normal]extraction of gas and oil through wells, which includes shale gas operations.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal]. 
[normal]The specific regulations are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These regulations require notifications to be made to HSE about the design, construction and operation of wells
[normal],
[normal] and a health and safety plan which sets out how risks are managed on site;
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]These regulations include specific requirements for all wells, whether onshore or offshore, and include well integrity provisions which apply throughout the life of shale gas wells. They also require a well operator to provide HSE with regular reports of any activities on the well and to appoint an independent well examiner to undertake regular assessments of well integrity.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]1
[normal]. 
[normal]This combination of duties ensures that HSE is provided with information at key stages in the lifecycle of a well and allows 
[normal]HSE
[normal] to assess whether risks are being adequately controlled and, if not, to intervene.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How does HSE conduct its interventions?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal]. 
[normal]HSE’s intervention approach has two elements. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal]. 
[normal]The first has been to contribute to the development of best practice standards for the industry as a whole with the 
[normal]United Kingdom Onshore Operators Group
[normal].
[normal] These standards 
[normal]were published in February 2013.  Such guidance, and existing industry codes dealing with well design and operations, sets clear expectation between HSE and operators as to how the general goal of reducing risks so far is reasonably practicable can be met. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14
[normal]. 
[normal]The second element is to focus HSE interventions with particular sites and operators on the key risk control measure of ensuring well integrity. For this, HSE uses its team of expert wells engineers who cover all types of hydrocarbon wells both on and offshore. As an oil or gas well is a complex engineered construction, most of which is not accessible to visual inspection, HSE takes a lifecycle approach to well integrity. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15
[normal]. 
[normal]This lifecycle 
[normal]approach 
[normal]consists of: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This allows HSE to assess the well design before construction starts. This is a key phase of work where the vast majority of issues likely to have an
[normal] impact on well integrity
[normal] will be identified and addressed by the well operator. It includes ensuring that safety features are incorporated into the design.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This provides HSE with the assurance that the operator is constructing and operating the well as described in the notification
[normal].  W
[normal]hen they are not, HSE can take the appropriate action.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This includes site inspections to assess well integrity during the operational phase
[normal]. 
[normal]F
[normal]or new and first time shale gas operators
[normal],
[normal] HSE and 
[normal]the Environment Agency 
[normal]will meet and advise them of their duties and conduct a joint inspection of their key operations. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The independent well examiner[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]16
[normal]. 
[normal]HSE’s regulatory
[normal] approach is supplemented by the requirement 
[normal]in DCR 
[normal]for an independent well examiner to assess 
[normal]well 
[normal]design, construction and maintenance. The well examiner is an independent competent person separate from the immediate line management of the well operations 
[normal]being
[normal] examin
[normal]ed
[normal]. The well examiner can be an employee of the operating company or
[normal], as is normally 
[normal]the case for 
[normal]UK
[normal] onshore wells
[normal], 
[normal]a contractor. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17
[normal]. 
[normal]The examiner’s task is to review the proposed and actual well operations to confirm they meet the operator’s policies and procedures, comply with DCR and follow good industry practice. This may include periodic site visits.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18
[normal]. 
[normal]HSE checks that the operator has these arrangements in place. The well examination scheme and involvement of the well examiner is for the complete lifecycle of the well from design through to final plugging and decommissioning.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]HSE resources[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]19
[normal]. 
[normal]HSE has sufficient wells expertise to cope with the current exploratory phase of shale gas
[normal]. 
[normal]It will 
[normal]reassess the situation if 
[normal]shale gas
[normal] moved into large-scale production.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Coordinated approaches[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]20
[normal]. 
[normal]HSE has long
[normal]-
[normal]established arrangements to ensure joint working wi
[normal]th DECC, 
[normal]the Office for Unconventional Gas and Oil 
[normal](
[normal]OUGO
[normal]),
[normal] the environment agencies (E

[normal] and N
[normal]atural Resources Wales
[normal]) and 
[normal]th
[normal]e relevant planning authorities. 
[normal]HSE works closely with these bodies to share relevant information and to ensure that there are no material gaps between the safety, environmental protection and planning authorisation considerations, and that all material concerns are addressed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21
[normal]. 
[normal]In 
[normal]England
[normal], t
[normal]he E
[normal]nvironment Agency
[normal] and HSE have a Memorandum of Understanding in place that sets out the day-to-day arrangements for managing the broad range of operations that fall under their regulatory control. 
[normal]This includes how they will work together to r
[normal]egulate shale gas developments.
[normal]22
[normal]. 
[normal]HSE and 
[normal]the 
[normal]E
[normal]nvironment 
[normal]A
[normal]gency
[normal] have agreed jointly to inspect the next series of hydraulic f
[normal]racturing operations in 
[normal]England
[normal]. 
[normal]For new and f
[normal]irst time shale gas operators HSE and 
[normal]the 
[normal]E
[normal]nvironment 
[normal]A
[normal]gency
[normal] will
[normal] 
[normal]meet and advise them of their duties under
[normal] the relevant legislation; and 
[normal]conduct a joint inspection of the key operations
[normal], such as cementing.
[normal] 
[normal]23
[normal]. 
[normal]If shale gas drilling was to be undertaken in 
[normal]Wales
[normal], HSE would look to enter into similar arrangements with 
[normal]N
[normal]atural Resources Wales.
[normal]HSE’s inv[bold]olvement with onshore oil and [bold]gas [bold]wells in Wales[bold]24
[normal]. 
[normal]There have been no shale gas wells drilled in 
[normal]Wales
[normal].  
[normal]25
[normal]. 
[normal]HSE 
[normal]records currently show a total of 22 
[normal]other 
[normal]wells in 
[normal]Wales
[normal]; th
[normal]e earliest dates back to 
[normal]1941.
[normal] 
[normal]In the last 10 
[normal]years,
[normal] HSE
[normal] ha
[normal]s
[normal] processed 9 well notifications. Many of these have been for coal bed methane
[normal].
