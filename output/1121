[normal]1[bold]              [bold]Background[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]A rehearsal 
[normal]here 
[normal]of the background to t
[normal]his matter would be superfluous
[normal] other 
[normal]than, 
[normal]perhaps
[normal],
[normal] to re
[normal]iterate
[normal] that a further rejection of 
[normal]a change in the law 
[normal]by the legislature will condemn the UK to a
[normal]n extended
[normal] period of humiliation by unknown numbers of prisoners 
[normal]- undoubtedly including the most serious offenders - 
[normal]at vast expense to the taxpayer in legal costs and fines
[normal];
[normal] and that 
[normal]in any event 
[normal]some compromise would have to be reached at some future date with further wasted Parliamentary time
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]On the evidence of the Commons debate t
[normal]here is no 
[normal]basis
[normal] whatever 
[normal]for believing 
[normal]that any proposal 
[normal]currently
[normal] being considered by the Committee would have the very slightest chance of passing a vote in Parliament.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2[bold]              [bold]Current proposals[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]              
[normal]The current proposal of a fixed cut-off 
[normal]based on 
[normal]the length of sentence may be straightforward from an administrative viewpoint but is deeply flawed in its ideology.  It depends critically on the erroneous presumption that an offender with any given sentence length 
[normal](whether six months or four years or anything in between) 
[normal]is as deserving (or undeserving) as any other offender serving the same sentence.  Th
[normal]u
[normal]s such a 
[normal]determinant 
[normal]falls 
[normal]firmly 
[normal]in
[normal]to
[normal] the category of blanket decision making, the very conduct to which the Court of Human Rights is so clearly increasingly opposed
[normal] in this area of human rights as in any other
[normal].
[normal]  It must be assumed that there will be an endless trail of appeals against such a provision
[normal], and that it is only a matter of time before the facts of a particular case will result in defeat of it
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]The Committee should be very slow indeed to promote such a blanket proposal
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]whatever the sentence length proposed, 
[normal]and should be looking for alternatives that might 
[normal]truly be
[normal] regarded as proportionate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]              [bold]A presumption of rehabilitation[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]              
[normal]The proposal put forward here is that prisoners:
[normal](a)
[normal]              
[normal]who
[normal]se
[normal] 
[normal]date 
[normal]for release 
[normal](
[normal]this is 
[normal]determined within days of the commencement of a sentence) 
[normal]is 
[normal]within twelve months of the date of a general or local election; and
[normal](b)
[normal]              
[normal]who retain a “presumption of rehabilitation”; and
[normal](c)
[normal]              
[normal]who are 
[normal]already 
[normal]“eligible” to vote under the rules;
[normal]will be entitled to vote at that election.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]For the purposes of (
[normal]3.
[normal]1.b) there 
[normal]would be
[normal] a presumption of rehabilitation for prisoners upon release 
[normal]except
[normal] for those on a prescribed list, as below
[normal] (indicative criteria)
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]For the purposes of (
[normal]3.
[normal]1.c) prisoners 
[normal]would be 
[normal]deemed eligible to vote if:
[normal](a)
[normal]              
[normal]they were 
[normal]on the voting register
[normal] prior to commen
[normal]cing their current sentence; or
[normal](b)
[normal]              
[normal]they 
[normal]were below the age of eligibility to vote at the start of their sentence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]The underlying principle is of a scheme of eligibility based on a forward look
[normal] 
[normal]at the 
[normal]right of (and need for) representation after release, not a backward look at the crime and an 
[normal]arbitrary 
[normal]extension of the punishment beyond release
[normal].  This is a proportionate 
[normal]and individual 
[normal]assessment of whether there should be a right to vote
[normal] while in prison
[normal].  It
[normal] 
[normal]excludes the serial sex offender whose current sentence just happens to be a short one.  It
[normal] 
[normal]excludes the career armed robber whose current sentence happens to be short because the police were ly
[normal]ing in wait and thwarted the last attempt
[normal].
[normal]  It makes a proper distinction between the repeat violent offender and the 
[normal]senior executive or 
[normal]public figure who has committed serious offences but who is 
[normal]highly 
[normal]unlikely to repeat them.
[normal]  A fixed sentence-length cut-off is not capable of any such distinctions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]The prescribed list would doubtless be subject to much debate and change.  Should serious fraud or perjury or perverting the course of justice be in the list, 
[normal]or would 
[normal]these offences 
[normal]be covered by the criterion as to length of current sentence, 
[normal]and so on.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4[bold]              [bold]Other matters[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]              
[normal]The prospect of large numbers of prisoners voting in a particular 
[normal]constituency
[normal] by virtue of the location of a prison that takes their category of offenders 
[normal](an affront to democracy
[normal], albeit perhaps unlikely on the numbers 
[normal]actually 
[normal]eligible
[normal]) 
[normal]is readily solved.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]Prisoners would v
[normal]ote in 
[normal]the 
[normal]constituency in which they were already registered to vote
[normal] at the 
[normal]start of 
[normal]a 
[normal]prison sentence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]              
[normal]If 
[normal]the prisoner was 
[normal]not registered 
[normal]to vote 
[normal]at the start of a prison sentence 
[normal]then there would be no right to 
[normal]vote
[normal] while in prison.  It is not 
[normal]a duty of the Criminal Justice system 
[normal]to 
[normal]assist 
[normal]people to vote who have shown no previous inclination to do so
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]              
[normal]P
[normal]risoner
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]not eligible 
[normal]to vote 
[normal]only 
[normal]at the start of a prison sentence 
[normal]by virtue of age would be eligible to 
[normal]vote in 
[normal]the 
[normal]constituency of last residence
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold]              [bold]Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]              
[normal]That the scheme should be considered by the Committee and consulted on.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]That the Committee call
[normal] evidence 
[normal](
[normal]refused to me 
[normal]in a FOI request 
[normal]to the Ministry of Justice 
[normal]of May 2012
[normal], 
[normal]on the flimsiest of grounds) 
[normal]as to 
[normal]the 
[normal]likely numbers 
[normal]of prisoners 
[normal]who would be eligible to vote under this scheme
[normal], with the prospects of success in a Commons vote in mind
[normal].
