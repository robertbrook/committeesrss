Written evidence submitted by [bold]J R Welch, B.Sc. [bold](FSS032)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]              
[normal]I welcome the opportunity to submit evidence to th
[normal]is inquiry. 
[normal] I was one of those made redundant from the London Laboratory of FSS Ltd in July 2010.  I now work as a self-employed consultant in forensic document examination. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Does the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the UK and is it sufficient to support forensic science R&amp;D and criminal justice? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]It is not apparent that the government has 
[normal]any[bold] strategy
[normal] for forensic science.  There is perhaps a vague hope that “market forces will provide”
[normal] but that ignores the fact that
[normal] market forces always choose the shortest-term option whi
[normal]l
[normal]st human lifetimes and activities operate in the medium term.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Did the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget ? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]              
[normal]The costs of transition and closure should be available from government figures.  The process was certainly not smooth.  The 
[normal]initial 
[normal]closure of three laboratories was intended to reduce costs and allow those remaining to continue operating
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Just one difficulty
[normal] was that t
[normal]oxicology expertise had previously been 
[normal]concentrated in the Chorley laboratory
[normal].  When the decision to close that laboratory was taken senior management seemed surprised that none of the toxicologists were willing to 
[normal]transfer to London (which would have entailed 
[normal]sell
[normal]ing
[normal] their houses in Chorley and enter
[normal]ing
[normal] the London housing market at three times the price
[normal])
[normal].  The few remaining toxicologists elsewhere in the FSS were under considerable stress from then on. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]              
[normal]The relatively small department in which I worked in the London Laboratory was scheduled for closure at the end of July 2010.  At short notice the closure was brought forward by three weeks precipitating a scramble to finish work-in-hand and preventing an orderly run-down to closure.  Then, one of us was required to remain at work, effectively at “stand-by”, for some further months.  This lack of consistency seemed to typify the gross incom
[normal]petence displayed by some in the
[normal] management
[normal] of FSS Ltd.
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What impacts have the FSS’s closure had on (i) the criminal justice system and (ii) forensic science R&amp;D and training? In particular, have the appropriate quality standards and accreditation been rigorously maintained ? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]              
[normal]In the criminal justice system the forensic sciences are being used in investigations much less than they were before the closure of FSS Ltd.  Submissions of case items to the major suppliers used by constabularies (LGC Forensics, Key Forensics, and Cellmark) have declined year on year.  None of those companies is 
[normal]getting as much work or 
[normal]making as much profit as its owners would like; arguably, none of those companies is making enough money to ensure its continued operation.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]              
[normal]Two recent cases in which I was engaged by defending solicitors provide concrete examples.  
[normal]              [bold](a).[bold] 
[normal]The first concerned the allegation, made long after the event, of sexual abuse of a very young school-girl.  The prosecution introduced a handwritten note supposedly written by the victim close to the time of the alleged events.  The prosecution had not sought evidence from forensic document examination to confirm (i) that the note was written by the alleged victim nor (ii) that it was contemporaneous with the alleged events.  
[normal]              [bold](b).[bold] 
[normal]The se
[normal]cond case involved alleged drug-
[normal]dealing by
[normal] someone who used a residence occupied by several individuals.  Documents found at the property were alleged to be the accused person’s “dealing lists”.  No forensic science evidence was sought by the prosecution to show that they were written by the accused.  Informal conversation with the investigating officer revealed that he had wanted to seek such evidence but had been prevented from doing so by the “forensic budget holder”.  
[normal]Also, the documents were not searched for indented impressions which would have had the potential to widen the investigation. 
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]In each of these cases the police investigation was limited by insufficient use of forensic document examination. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]              
[normal]The constabularies cannot afford to use external suppliers greatly and will look to use cheaper in-house resources wherever they exist.  It is likely that the police use of in-house resources is costed in a way different from that used for external forensic science.  Constabularies have always had direct responsibility for scene-of-crime examination and for developing and comparing fingerprints.  
[normal]The temptation for departments to stretch the boundaries of their work beyond their expertise is considerable.  Fingerprint staff searching documents for indentations and scenes-of-crime staff investigating suspicious fires are examples of work likely to be undertaken in a manner less than expert. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal].
[normal]              [bold]Forensic science research in England is much reduced.  The view is that research may lead to knowledge but not profit, at least not in the short term, so why should private industry fund it ?  The most recent volume of the UK forensic science journal (“Science and Justice”,
[normal] 
[normal]Vol
[normal] 52,
[normal] Issue
[normal] 4, December 2012) contains eight peer-reviewed papers.  Only two originate in England; two are from the United States, one comes from each of Sweden, Belgium and New Zealand, 
[normal]and one is an international collaboration i
[normal]nvolving one English participant.  While this shows that the UK journal is held in high
[normal] regard internationally it suggests
[normal] that UK forensic science is now insufficient to support the UK forensic science journal.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal].
[normal]              [bold]The quality of forensic science in the UK is generally high because 
[normal]academic 
[normal]science is about discovery
[normal] 
[normal]of the truth 
[normal]and operates within a moral code
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Q
[normal]ualified scientists
[normal], in the main,
[normal] are dedicated people willing to work altruistically.  A difficulty now is that forensic scientists are no longer isolated from the commercial pressures which encourage hurried work and cutting corners.  Indeed,
[normal] “product charging”
[normal],
[normal] “performance pay”
[normal],
[normal] and “bonus payments” 
[normal]positively 
[normal]encourage such activities
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal]              
[normal]Accreditation is largely irrelevant apart from it increasing overhead costs by enormous amounts.  For at least half of my career formal accreditation did not exist; in my direct experience standards were just as high then as they were after formal accreditation systems were introduced.  Prior to formal accreditation there occurred the occasional calamity – the “Birmingham Bombs Case” and the “Preece Case”.  After accreditation there occurred the occasional calamity – t
[normal]h
[normal]e “Damilola Taylor Case” and the case which gave rise to the appeal court judgement in “R v T”.  I do not minimise the concerns raised by such cases
[normal]; I point out that accreditation has not eliminated them. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What should be role of the Forensic Science Regulator ?  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]In the forensic sciences and in a number of other industries the appointment of a regulator is proof positive that a truly competitive market does not exist.  The 
[normal]forensic science 
[normal]regulator has attached himself to the accreditation bandwagon – a juggernaut which has no need of extra resource.  
[normal]Satisfying the requirements of the forensic regulator, of the “National Forensic Framework”
[normal],
[normal] and of “ISO17025”
[normal] requires many tens of thousands of pounds and is beyond the financial resources of any but the largest forensic organisations.  T
[normal]he 
[normal]regulator 
[normal]seems to have restricted his attentions to the major providers – those who tender for the police forensic science contracts.  He seems to have ignored completely the smaller-scale forensic science
[normal] laboratories
[normal]; those
[normal] with perhaps just one or two 
[normal]self-em
[normal]p
[normal]loyed 
[normal]practitioners who generally provide expertise to defending solicitors in criminal matters and to those engaged in civil disputes.  Some of 
[normal]those
[normal] self-employed forensic scientists have technical and ethical standards every bit as high as 
[normal]those of the larger operations
[normal]; so
[normal]me
[normal] are 
[normal]unqualified 
[normal]charlatans.  T
[normal]he regulator
[normal] should
[normal] be concerned with 
[normal]identifying which is which.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]The regulator should be more involved with the commercial and financial aspects of the forensic science industry.  How does he view the “Association of Forensic 
[normal]Service 
[normal]Providers” ?  It sounds like a price cartel, how can he ensure that it doesn’t operate as a price cartel ?  How wou
[normal]ld he prevent other anti-competi
[normal]ti
[normal]ve actions such as
[normal] informal
[normal] “no poaching-of-staff agreements” ?
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]2
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal] 
[normal]The single practitioner and small partnership forensic laboratories are largely dependent on fees paid by the Legal Services Commission
[normal] but channelled through the instructing solicitors
[normal].  
[normal]Solicitors generally regard such payments as a means of augmenting their cash-flow and hold them for as long as possible.  Is there any reason why Legal Service Commission payments for forensic consultants cannot be paid directly to the consultants ?  The regulator should be concerned with such matters.  An active group of forensic consultants avai
[normal]lable to review and challenge
[normal] work 
[normal]undertaken by larger laboratories is a force for quality assurance at least as effective as, and possibly much more effective than, cumbersome systems of accreditation.  
[normal]However, if the consultants do not receive payment for work undertaken they will not be active for
[normal] very
[normal] long.  
[normal]A defending solicitor seeking to use forensic science must obtain quotes for the work
[normal] from a number of consultants and, in general, use the consultant offering the lowest quote.  There is no “quality threshold”; the lowest quo
[normal]te may well be from the least
[normal] qualified.
[normal]  
[normal]The regulator should be concerned with such matters.  
[normal]The regulator should ensure that he and the Legal Services Commission can distinguish forensic document examiners from graphologists. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What is the size of the forensics market and how stable is it ? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]Overall the size of the “forensics market” is unknown and unknowable.  It depends on so many variables it cannot be regarded as stable.  In forensic document examination the decline in the use of clearing-bank cheques reduced the amount of a particular type of work; at roughly the same time the increasing use of various printing systems attached to home computers introduced a whole new area of work.  
[normal]The introduction of DNA profiling increased work in some areas and reduced work in others.  
[normal]The field of “Computer F
[normal]orensics” has grown from nothing 
[normal]to become a major specialism
[normal] 
[normal]during the second half of my working life.  
[normal]Changes in the law relating to drinking and driving have eliminated whole laboratory departments; changes in the law relating to drugs and driving may require new ones.  
[normal]Again, forty years ago forensic science was much used to investigate domestic burglary via the analysis and comparison of paint-flakes, glass fragments and shoe-marks.  Now, such inve
[normal]stigations have almost disappeared
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]4
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]In practice, the size of the “forensic market” is determined by the amount of money that is devoted to it.  The changes referr
[normal]ed to in paragraph thirteen
[normal] reflect changes in police priorities
[normal] and changes in police budgets
[normal] as much as changes in society.
[normal]  The more money that is available for forensic s
[normal]cience the more forensic science
[normal] will be used and that is
[normal] 
[normal]irrespective of the money originating in a direct civil-service budget or as a sub-set of the police budget.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]5
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]It is essential to 
[normal]focus on the fact that forensic science is science applied to the law.  It is best undertaken by qualified scientists
[normal] who are able
[normal] to apply
[normal] expertise appropriate to whatever p
[normal]roblems
[normal] arise
[normal].  The current fashion for production-line proce
[normal]s
[normal]ses operated by staff with a specific
[normal] vocational training is drive
[normal]n
[normal] by accountants seeking financial efficiency.  In some ways that is a laudable aim but it 
[normal]lacks flexibility and cannot serve all the
[normal] varied needs of criminal and civil justice.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How are forensic science services procured by police forces and could procurement processes be improved ? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]15.
[normal]              
[normal]Procurement 
[normal]of forensic science 
[normal]by police is a complicated and expensive tendering process providing employment for procurement teams, sales teams, account managers, customer relations teams and accounts clerks all of whom are unproductive of forensic science.  This maintains a fiction of being a competitive process but with three 
[normal]main 
[normal]suppliers and, maybe, five groups of purchasers there can be no real competition.  Indeed, one object of real competition is to drive out of business the less efficient competitors so that the resulting lack of competition enables higher prices to be charged by the surviving monopoly supplier.  Can Parliament or the police contemplate with equanimity such a truly competitive environment 
[normal]for the forensic sciences 
[normal]? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Has the closure of the FSS resulted in a loss of intellectual wealth through its scientists leaving the forensic science profession, or the UK? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]16.
[normal]              
[normal]Yes.[bold]  
[normal]The department in which I worked in London employed six scientists; one now works in Australia and two have left forensic science.  Three are employed or self-employed in forensic science in a less than full-time capacity.  
[normal]Professional colleagues in the Huntingdon and Wetherby laboratories were approximately twelve in number and I am aware of only two 
[normal]who are now 
[normal]working in forensic science. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Are current arrangements for the FSS’s archives satisfactory? How could arrangements for the retention of case files and forensic materials in the UK be improved ? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]17.
[normal]              
[normal]I have had only a little contact with this.  The arrangements seem adequate.
