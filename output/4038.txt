[[[About us]]]Action on Hearing Loss is the new name for RNID. We're the charity working for a world where hearing loss doesn't limit or label people, where tinnitus is silenced â€“ and where people value and look after their hearing. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]Our response will focus on key issues that relate to people with hearing loss. Throughout this response we use the term 'people with hearing loss' to refer to people with all levels of hearing loss, including people who are profoundly deaf.&#xa0;We are happy for the details of this response to be made public.

[[[Comments]]]Action on Hearing Loss welcomes the opportunity to provide written evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee concerning the future of the BBC. We believe the BBC should be the pioneering broadcaster in terms of accessibility. The BBC to date has played an extremely important role within the broadcasting industry in promoting accessibility. The BBC is the most accessible broadcaster for people with hearing loss (although there are still improvements they can make) and we believe the BBC has been fundamental in encouraging other broadcasters to also improve their accessibility through demonstrating the possibilities. The BBC has also helped to raise expectations amongst deaf people about what level of service they can and should expect from all broadcasters. We therefore believe that ensuring everyone has access to BBC services has and should continue to be a key role for the BBC. &#xa0;This is particularly important with the development of catch up television and video on demand services, which are not currently regulated in terms of access services. Accessibility is not currently explicit within the Public Purposes. However, the Agreement between the BBC and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport does include the requirement to have regard to the need to make services accessible to people with a visual or hearing impairment. We welcome the BBCs commitment to provide 100% subtitles on the majority of its programmes. We would like to see the accessibility solutions extending further, for example, with the provision of subtitles on online video clips. We would welcome an explicit statement within the public purposes regarding accessibility. This would help to highlight the importance of ensuring BBC services are accessible to disabled people. Please see answers to questions two and three above. The BBC should absolutely retain and build on its commitment to provide accessible services to ensure that people with hearing loss are able to enjoy TV programmes to the same extent as everyone else. We urge the BBC to ensure that all programmes, whether produced in house or commissioned externally, are accessible to people with hearing loss. This includes ensuring that production staff are aware of the issues around background noise and know how to reduce this. Background noise, such as music, sound effects and ambient noise, can make it difficult for people with hearing loss to follow dialogue during a programme. In our 2008 annual survey 87% of respondents agreed that background noise affects their ability to hear speech on television.It is also important that all programmes are delivered to the BBC on schedule, with enough time to produce subtitles in advance of broadcast. Live subtitles have much higher error rates and therefore pre-recorded subtitles are always preferable except for truly live programmes. No comment. We believe the BBC should play a key role in developing technology. The BBC is the only broadcaster who has ensured that subtitles are available on the BBC iplayer when watched through the majority of platforms. Currently no other broadcaster provides this functionality, meaning that deaf people do not have the same access to catch up and video on demand services as other people. We believe this pioneering role is important, demonstrating to other broadcasters that accessibility is technologically feasible. &#xa0;

[[[Conclusion]]]The BBC has played a pioneering role within the broadcast industry in terms of accessibility for deaf people. We would like to see this role continued and built upon, ensuring that all BBC services are accessible to people with hearing loss, thereby encouraging other broadcasters to do the same. &#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
