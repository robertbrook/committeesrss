[normal]Written evidence from [bold]Dr Ben [bold]Goldacre[bold], Sir Iain Chalmers, Dr Trish Groves[bold], Dr Fiona [bold]Godlee[bold], Dr Virginia Barbour (GMC0019)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ben 
[normal]Goldacre
[normal] is a medic 
[normal]and 
[normal]academic who writes 
[normal]for the 
[normal]public on misuses of scientific evidence
[normal], including a recent book 
[normal]about 
[normal]problems in medicine [1]
[normal]. 
[normal]Iain Chalmers is co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration, and director of the James Lind Library. Trish Groves is 
[normal]a medic and 
[normal]Deputy Editor of the British Me
[normal]dical Journal. 
[normal]Fiona 
[normal]Godlee
[normal] is 
[normal]a medic and 
[normal]Editor in Chief of the British Medical Journal. Virgin
[normal]i
[normal]a Barbour is 
[normal]a medic and 
[normal]Editor in Chief of 
[normal]PLoS
[normal] 
[normal]Medicine
[normal]. 
[normal]All are 
[normal]also
[normal] co-founder
[normal]s
[normal] of 
[normal]AllTrials
[normal], a campaign 
[normal]with widespread public and professional support 
[normal]c
[normal]alling for all trial results on currently used treatments to be made publicly available
[normal] [
[normal]2
[normal]]
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are 
[normal]writing to raise three areas where the assistance of the GMC would be very valuable to patients and the public
[normal], and where such intervention is timely
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.[bold] P[bold]romoting p[bold]articipat[bold]ion [bold]in research.[bold] 
[normal]The GMC guidance previously stated that doctors “
[normal]must work with colleagues and patients . . . to help resolve uncertainties about the effects of treatments” (
[normal]para
[normal] 14f)
[normal]. 
[normal]However, in 
[normal]2013 
[normal]the GMC 
[normal]removed 
[normal]this clause
[normal] [3]
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]his decision should be reversed, and the clause reinstated
[normal]. Research is the only way we can identify and reduce uncertainty about which treatments work best. At present there is considerable red tape obstructing doctors who seek to conduct research
[normal]. M
[normal]uc
[normal]h of 
[normal]this red tape 
[normal]is unnecessary; the incentives to participate in research do not reflect the urgency of the 
[normal]need for better evidence to guide clinical practice
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]here are many documented cases where patients have suffered and died unnecessarily
[normal],
[normal] because
[normal] doctors 
[normal]have 
[normal]failed to 
[normal]recognise
[normal] uncertainty
[normal] and conduct research to address it
[normal] [3]
[normal]. The GMC requires doctors to practice medicine based on research evidence. 
[normal]We cannot 
[normal]do so 
[normal]without 
[normal]producing 
[normal]this 
[normal]evidence, and doctors have a responsibility to 
[normal]all 
[normal]patien
[normal]ts to help identify and reduce uncertainty in everyday clinical practice.
[normal] This should be 
[normal]unambiguously 
[normal]reflected in GMC guidance
[normal], as it was until 2013
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. A register for doctors’ conflicts of interest[bold]There is a need for a register of doctors' 
[normal]c
[normal]onflicts o
[normal]f 
[normal]i
[normal]nterest, similar that for MP's. At present, doctors may receive 
[normal]consultancy 
[normal]income, 
[normal]research 
[normal]funding, sponsorship, travel, hospitality and free educational activity sponsored by the pharmaceutical and device industries
[normal]; m
[normal]any doctors serving on Clinical 
[normal]Commissioning Groups now run companies whose services are commissioned by their own CCG
[normal]; m
[normal]any media doctors receive income from PR or medical companies
[normal]; and so on
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]C
[normal]onflicts of interest cannot be prevented, nor would it be desirable to do so: there is mu
[normal]ch good work done by doctors collaborating with industry. 
[normal]These payments 
[normal]also 
[normal]do not mean that doctors are corrupt. However, t
[normal]here is extensive research evidence showing that 
[normal]doctors with financial 
[normal]conflicts of interest 
[normal]often 
[normal]express 
[normal]more 
[normal]favourable
[normal] 
[normal]views on 
[normal]the 
[normal]treatments
[normal] in question
[normal],
[normal] when compared to 
[normal]doctors who have not received such payments
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]important that information about these conflicts of interest is transparent
[normal]. It
[normal] is currently extremely hard - and in many cases impossible - 
[normal]for patients, colleagues, 
[normal]patients 
[normal]and the public to establish who 
[normal]has paid
[normal] a doctor.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Industry and self-
[normal]regulatory approaches to this have failed, and will most likely to continue to do so. The Ethical Standards in Health and Life Sciences Group (co-chai
[normal]red by the ABPI and the Royal College of Physicians) is a particularly concerning example: they produced "guidelines" documents for doctors which contained a number of false claims, and gave false reassurance on important matters of patient safety, before 
[normal]disbanding
[normal] in October 2013
[normal], 
[normal]without ever giving 
[normal]a clear account of their activities
[normal] [4] [5] [6]
[normal]. Furthermore, declarations of payments to doctors from the pharmaceutical industry 
[normal](which has often been proposed, but never delivered) 
[normal]would be
[normal] 
[normal]insufficient, a
[normal]s 
[normal]this sector 
[normal]cover
[normal]s
[normal] only a small proportion of the many sources of 
[normal]payments to 
[normal]doctors
[normal], as
[normal] described above
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The GMC requires doctors to re-register each year, 
[normal]and 
[normal]maintains a public register
[normal]. It is therefore 
[normal]in 
[normal]a clear position to 
[normal]request 
[normal]a simple decla
[normal]ration 
[normal]of financial conflicts of interest 
[normal]from each doctor in the UK
[normal], 
[normal]annually, 
[normal]and make 
[normal]this information 
[normal]publicly available
[normal] on the register
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Action on withheld trial results[bold]The problem of clinical trial results being 
[normal]witheld
[normal], on treatments in curren
[normal]t use, continues to undermine the evidence base for medicine. The best currently available evidence suggests that around half of all trials have their results withheld
[normal] [7]
[normal]. Doctors, patients, researchers and payers cannot make informed decisions about whic
[normal]h treatments are best
[normal],
[normal] when half 
[normal]of all 
[normal]trial results are 
[normal]unavailable
[normal]. This problem has not been adequately addressed by medical 
[normal]and
[normal] academic professional bodies, regulators, or industry. 
[normal]There has also been a worrying trend for some in both industry and 
[normal]medicine to give false reassurance, claiming that the problem has been fixed. This poses a significant threat to patient care.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Science and Technology Select Committee called on the government to take action 
[normal]over 
[normal]this issue
[normal] in September 2013
[normal] [8]
[normal]. 
[normal]The H
[normal]ealth Committee called on the GMC 
[normal]to take action on this issue in January 
[normal]2013 
[normal][
[normal]9
[normal]]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]British Medical Association
[normal] passed a motion 
[normal]in June 2013 
[normal][10] [11] 
[normal][12] 
[normal]stating that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“(
[normal]i
[normal]) Selective non-publication of unflattering trial data is research misconduct
[normal]; 
[normal]“
[normal](ii) Registered medical practitioners who give grounds to believe they have been involved in such conduct should have their fitness to practice assessed by the GMC
[normal].” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It would therefore be useful if the 
[normal]GMC could 
[normal]prominently 
[normal]clarify their position
[normal], 
[normal]and strengthen the wording of their guidance
[normal], requiring that 
[normal]any 
[normal]doctor
[normal] 
[normal]working on 
[normal]a 
[normal]trial
[normal] 
[normal]both past and present - on all treatments currently in use – 
[normal]is 
[normal]responsible for ensuring that the trial is 
[normal]registered
[normal],
[normal] with 
[normal]its 
[normal]results made publicly available
[normal] withi
[normal]n a year of completion
[normal]; and forbidden from entering into contracts with trial sponsors that 
[normal]relinquish access to data 
[normal]and prevent dissemination of results
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While only a small proportion of doctors actively participate in conducting 
[normal]randomised
[normal] trials, a m
[normal]uch larger number 
[normal]make a valuable
[normal] positive
[normal] contribution by 
[normal]recruit
[normal]ing and encouraging 
[normal]patients to participate 
[normal]in others’ 
[normal]trials research.
[normal] They too have a responsibility around missing trial results.
[normal] 
[normal]Para 49d of Good Medical Practice says that doctors must work in partnership with patients, providing 
[normal]“
[normal]any other information patients need if they are asked to agree to be involved in teaching or 
[normal]research
[normal]”
[normal]. This would be greatly
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]strengthened by adding a ne
[normal]w clause
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]49e 
[normal]“
[normal]Doctors should advise patients to
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]participate in a clinical trial only if: (1) the study protocol has been registered and made publicly available; (2) the protocol refers to systematic reviews of existing evidence showing that the trial is ju
[normal]stified; and (3) each patient
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]receives a written assurance that the full study results will be published and sent to all participants who indicate th
[normal]at they wish to receive them.

[normal]The GMC 
[normal]do good work on misdeeds 
[normal]by individuals 
[normal]in individual stu
[normal]dies
[normal]. However
[normal], 
[normal]it is 
[normal]inadequate and inconsistent to 
[normal]only 
[normal]hold individual studies to hig
[normal]h
[normal] standards, 
[normal]when 
[normal]the biases we are seeking to exclude 
[normal]can re-emerge
[normal] 
[normal]further down the chain
[normal]. 
[normal]Even when all trials are conducted perfectly, i
[normal]f 
[normal]those 
[normal]whole studies 
[normal]with un
[normal]flattering results 
[normal]are withheld from the public record
[normal] – as we know they commonly are -
[normal] then we are 
[normal]overall 
[normal]misled on the risks and benefits of treatments
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]as surely as if the data 
[normal]from 
[normal]the individual studies themselves were fraudulent
[normal].
[normal] The GMC are in a po
[normal]sition to police the withholding of trial results
[normal],
[normal] as they 
[normal]police 
[normal]other forms of research misconduct.
[normal] It is in patients’ interests that they should do so.
