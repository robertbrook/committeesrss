[normal]              
[normal]The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh has 50% of its UK Fellows and Members working in the NHS in England and welcomes the opportunity to respond to this consultation, which is felt to be an area associated with significant difficulties and some emotion.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]Much is expected of new pathway design across the health economy and measures to reduce acute admissions.  However, there is evidence in England of the new competition rules hindering co-operative working between NHS organisations. There are however also examples of good practice, for example the new regional trauma centres, that may allow efficiency savings and provide enhanced quality of care.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]It is perceived that there is significant variation in resource geographically within the NHS. This may be perceived with differences in medical trainee numbers and vacancies across disparate regions, but may be further amplified with much greater apparent resource in the large teaching hospital compared to smaller District General Hospitals.  The effectiveness of the mechanisms by which resources are distributed geographically in the NHS has to be clear - it is a fundamental precept that the NHS should be equitable.  A national system of allocation is needed to adjudicate on equity (as has been seen in the allocation of money for Emergency departments this winter).

[normal]              
[normal]The plans made by NHS organisations to enable them to meet the Nicholson Challenge seem to have succeeded partially in making efficiency gains over the past three years.  It is perceived, however, that this will get increasingly difficult.  Trusts have been used to efficiency savings (CRES) for years, but adding in the lack of growth money has started to cause problems, particularly when joint funded projects 
[normal]eg
[normal] with Local Authorities are threatened by their financial limitations.  Attempts to rationalise services have been shown to founder on poor planning and examples of this have been quoted by Fellows from across the country.  It is felt that many Trusts struggle with making efficiency savings and these often do end up as cuts particularly in “easier targets”. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]Significant structural reorganisation of Trusts with centralisation of services particularly in acute areas may be hampered by a lack of political will, although from a clinical viewpoint such changes may be of value in terms of service, training and resource.  The only reason for continuing to operate a service is because of rational local need and adequate quality delivery 
[normal]ie
[normal] nothing to do with local/regional political wishes, or inability of clinicians to accept the need for change.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]The benefit in the diversion of funding into general practice is of questionable benefit with little evidence base to support this, but many of the hard-pressed medical specialities such as acute medicine and geriatric medicine do not get the same attention or financial backing as has been seen for emergency medicine.  It is felt that General Practice should have much stronger links to local hospitals – and vice versa, hospital staff should be working in community settings.  The distinctions between primary and secondary care are not improving patient outcomes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]Adult social care funding and organisation is perceived to be problematic, and there has been a decline in social work input into medical wards over the past 12 months in many areas.  This type of change makes the management of the frail and elderly patients through their journey from the community, through hospital and back to the community increasingly difficult.  This group, of course, constitutes a significant percentage of patients admitted to medical wards.  There are areas of good practice between social and health care, but these could be threatened by local authority funding pressures and external factors such as the need to bolster children’s services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal]              
[normal]We are aware that a large proportion of health spending goes on patients in the last six months of life – at a time when quality of life is uncertain.  The national end of life strategy encourages us to recognise and acknowledge impending death and intensive treatment futility, to provide better, more realistic care and save resource.  This needs to be further developed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal]              
[normal]There is a real concern that efficiency savings equate to driving down healthcare staff earnings in a time of intense media pressure, increasing workload and visibly decreasing morale.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal]              
[normal]What is now needed is stable budget provision so that Trusts can decide which services to provide and to be able to plan effectively 
[normal]eg
[normal] for winter pressures in medicine where increased patient numbers are admitted.
