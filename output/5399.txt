[[[Memorandum by the BBC]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The BBC’s view is that the broadcast election debates in 2010 were a resounding success and we want them to be repeated at future elections. Among other reasons, they engage difficult-to-reach parts of the electorate, are an effective way of holding those in power to account, invigorate interest in general election campaigning and fulfil a prime focus of the BBC, citizenship. &#xa0;

[[[Institutional Arrangements]]]The 2010 general election debate programmes were subject to the same regulatory and legal framework in which each of the broadcasters operates during election periods with impartiality, independence and public interest central to the way they were organised. If there were to be different arrangements made e.g. setting up a separate body, the broadcasters would still need to comply with this framework. The BBC could not delegate to other bodies responsibility for the judgements it takes about election coverage. A key lesson from the 2010 broadcasts was to keep the arrangements as simple as possible to reduce potential for disagreement and failure. Separating the organisation of the debates from those who have responsibility to broadcast them with due diligence would be – in the BBC’s view – an unnecessary complication. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Public Interest as a Primary Concern]]]Making judgements in the public interest and serving licence-fee payers is central to the BBC’s mission. Research conducted jointly with ITV and Sky found half of viewers said the debates had improved their understanding of key issues (on average, across all three). The coverage had a greater impact on younger audiences (18-34s) with 25% saying it helped them decide whether to vote (v 21% adults) and 45% said it helped them decide who to vote for (v 37% adults). &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[‘Debates Commission’]]]Whilst acknowledging the work carried out by the US Commission on Presidential Debates in encouraging public interest, the BBC does not regard it as a useful or necessary model for the UK.  It notes that it is co-chaired by representatives of the two biggest political parties and is widely regarded as ‘bi-partisan’, rather than “independent”. The parties’ objective is to seek a low risk environment and maximum electoral advantage, not the public interest. &#xa0;Among the considerations regarding the establishment of such a body are: whether other political parties would accept such parameters for who takes part in the debates; its impact on the editorial independence of the broadcasters; how it would be funded; what the role of a commission would be in organising complementary debates in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.&#xa0;A commission can provide a forum for discussion about the debates, as the broadcasters did in 2010, but it cannot force participation. If debates were conducted in a way that primarily suits the main political parties, excluding other forms of scrutiny, this may be too high a price.

[[[Submission]]]

[[[Introduction]]]The BBC’s view is that the Prime Ministerial TV election debates in 2010 were a resounding success and would want them to be repeated at future elections:

[[[“Institutional arrangements”]]]In the run-up to the 2010 general election the three main broadcasters came together and put up a joint proposal to the three largest political parties in the UK for three television programmes during the election campaign. The parties agreed in principle and there were then discussions on how the programmes would work in practice. Each of the broadcasters then made the arrangements – some together, some separately – and paid for the programmes and broadcast them. Although it was not, of course, quite so simple; in principle the debates were no different to the many other TV election programmes which broadcasters produce. They were subject to the normal regulatory and legal framework in the context of which each of the broadcasters operates during election periods. Impartiality, independence and public interest were central to the way the debates were organised.  In the BBC’s case, this was tested both through our own complaints system, up to and including the BBC Trust, as well as in the High Court in Edinburgh. The arrangements proved robust.  The only really unusual aspect was that the three broadcasters chose to voluntarily “pool” some of their editorial judgement – but only in a limited and controlled way which did not compromise their editorial independence.The debates were a success – and, above all, they finally took place.  Fifty years after the first US presidential TV debate, institutional arrangements were devised by the three main broadcasters which finally secured TV election debates in the UK.The BBC’s view is that the arrangements for 2010 worked and that they remain the most appropriate way of making them happen again.If there were to be different “institutional arrangements” – for example debates which were set up by a body separate to the broadcasters – they would still need to comply with the legal and regulatory framework of an election period.   In those circumstances, each broadcaster – separately – would still have to make its own judgements on issues such as impartiality, of how and when the debates were presented, of scheduling – even deciding if the proposals of such a body were sufficiently compliant for them to be able  to broadcast the events.The relevant regulatory structure for each broadcaster is different and each of them transmit to different geographical areas, meaning that the impartiality questions for each are also different.  The BBC could not delegate to other bodies responsibility for the judgements it takes about election coverage.  For instance, part of the BBC’s overall strategy for ensuring impartiality in 2010 was not only to organise complementary debates in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but also to make specific arrangements for other smaller parties to receive appropriate coverage in relation to the debates.A key lesson for the broadcasters from 2010 was to keep the arrangements as simple as possible:  the more complications, the more potential for disagreement and failure.  Separating the organisation of the debates from those who have responsibility to broadcast them with due diligence would be – in the BBC’s view – an unnecessary complication.

[[[The BBC’s response to the questions the committee asks about the management and operation of the debates is as follows:]]]For television debates, there is an existing, established framework within which to make decisions about:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; who takes part and on what basis-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; how many debates there should be-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; where and when they should be held-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; their format and styleIn the 2010 TV debates, these difficult issues (many of which had contributed to debates not happening before) were part and parcel of the way they were set up by the broadcasters, within the established regulatory system.  In short, the 2010 arrangements work.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[More broadly, how can we ensure that the public interest is the primary concern in]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[determining any administrative matters…]]]

[[[..]]]The broadcasters already have precisely that responsibility.  As well as a duty to ensure impartiality and independence, the BBC has a direct obligation for public service and to take account of the public interest in the production of its output.  The BBC has a specific public purpose in citizenship.  Making judgements in the public interest and serving licence-fee payers is central to the BBC’s mission.  This is distinct from simply attracting high audience figures – in relation to election periods, we regard the public interest as being to engage different audiences in the campaign, to provide information and understanding which equips voters as citizens and to make a particular effort to reach those sections of the public which may otherwise be less engaged in the electoral process.  The priority we give to public interest is evident from the research carried out jointly with ITV and Sky and analysed in 2010 by BBC Audiences as follows

[[[•]]]

[[[              ]]]Crucially, the debates helped further viewers understanding (which was a key objective of the BBC’s election coverage). An average of 43% claimed to have learned a lot from the debates across all 3, with the same amount saying the programmes had encouraged them to find out more information about the parties/issues. Overall, half of viewers said that the debates had improved their understanding of the key issues (on average, across all three).•              The debates had a bigger impact on young audiences.  Amongst the 18-34s who watched any of the debates, on average across all three, 25% said it helped the debate decide whether to vote (vs. 21% of all adults), and 45% said it helped them decide who to vote for (37% of all adults).(See Appendix 1)A relatively new phenomenon in 2010, noticed in relation to the debates, was the practice among younger viewers of engaging with two screens – that is, they watched the debates on television but communicated simultaneously with friends through social media, sharing comments, information and humour.  What was noticeable was that the engagement was more active than passive, as evidenced by the very high proportion (nearly 90%) of those people seeing the debates who also had conversations about them with others afterwards.   Given the relatively short notice for the arrangements last time, the BBC sees potential for much more use of social media around the debates next time, to build on their success as a vehicle for engaging harder-to-reach audiences in the electoral process.

[[[Which broadcasters should take part? ]]]The BBC, ITV and Sky chose to pool their combined resources and weight in order to make the debates happen in 2010.  Given the success of that enterprise, the BBC would be in favour of a similar approach in future elections, but is pragmatic about which other broadcasters should be involved – the key criteria are whatever makes debates most likely to happen and to reach and engage with the widest possible audience in the UK.  •&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[In what ways does the interaction between existing broadcast regulation, case law, and]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[the potential for judicial review set the parameters for decisions relating to each of]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[these topics?]]]The parameters are set in exactly the same way as they would be for any other broadcasting during election periods.   These are decisions which the broadcasters have to make at all elections in many different circumstances.  If Prime Ministerial Debates are to be broadcast at all, they will have to sit within these parameters.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[What is the appropriate level of openness and transparency in which these questions]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[should be addressed?]]]At a level appropriate to giving debates the best chance of taking place.  For the BBC, there is no difficulty in conducting arrangements for debates in an open and transparent way.  But given the complexity of reaching agreement on debates, having a public blow-by-blow commentary is not necessarily conducive to success.  In particular, a party political negotiator whose position is public inevitably finds compromise more difficult.The broadcasters who produced the 2010 debates have been open and transparent about the process which led to them being set up and have published the relevant material, which is attached to this document.  (See Appendices 2 &amp; 3)•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Are such matters best left to the broadcasters and political parties to determine?]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[If so, how can it be guaranteed that the public interest plays a decisive role in]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[their negotiations?]]]It is important to emphasise the nature of the negotiations in 2010.  They were framed by an initial invitation from the broadcasters, accepted by the politicians.  The framework was drawn up by the broadcasters in a way that was consistent with their obligations to be impartial, independent and in the tradition of public service broadcasting.  The details of how that would happen were then negotiated with the contributors – the political parties – as would be the case with any programme contributor.   It is in setting out the principles that the broadcasters deploy their general and existing duty – and their central culture - to do so in the public interest.  A greater engagement of the electorate – not just high audience figures – was achieved in 2010 and is a fundamental objective for the BBC. &#xa0;

[[[ ]]]

[[[in such matters?]]]&#xa0;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[What would be the arguments for the establishment of such a body?]]]

[[[o]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[What would be the arguments against the establishment of such a body?]]]In the United States, over a number of years, the Commission on Presidential Debates has become an established institution, which has undoubtedly done much good work in promoting debates and other activity around public engagement in the electoral process. In its central task, however, of organising presidential TV debates, it is construed in a way which the BBC believes would be inappropriate in the UK.Many who argue for a Commission on such lines in the UK   refer to the CPD as “independent”.  Others, however, suggest the term “bi-partisan” is more apt.  It is co-chaired by representatives of the two big political parties and arrangements for debates are agreed between the two parties, through the Commission.  The broadcasters – and other political parties – are, in effect, presented with a fait accompli.  The participation of other candidates in debates (which has only happened on one occasion) remains, in our view, more in the hands of the two large parties than would be acceptable in the UK. The primary concern – not surprisingly - for each of the two main US parties, is to provide as low risk an environment as possible for their candidate and maximum electoral advantage. Quite reasonably from their perspective, those are the main objectives of the negotiators – not the public interest. The relative strength of the broadcasters in the UK provides a more robust and independent voice for the public interest.In considering the setting up of a UK version of the CPD, the committee may want to address a number of consequent questions:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; whether a structure which is designed, essentially, for a two-party system could cater effectively for the UK’s less symmetrical political make-up – and whether such a structure would be acceptable to other political parties around the UK.- -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; whether UK television viewers would now accept the US-style “debates”  - often characterised as “joint press-conferences,” so limited is the interaction between the candidates - compared to the high level of engagement between the party leaders in the successful 2010 UK debates.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; who would pay for the new body and its permanent administration: in the USA large corporate  bodies and foundations offer sponsorship.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; that any system giving the political parties the ability to dictate format and editorial parameters  (such as the right to veto which journalists ask the questions) would be unlikely to win the support either of UK broadcasters  or the UK public.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; what the role of the Commission would be in organising complementary debates in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (and  how all the above questions would apply in each of those cases).&#xa0;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[How should a new independent body be established]]]The BBC does not believe such a body is now necessary in the UK - it is not immediately obvious which problems it would be seeking to solve. The system of broadcasting regulation in the UK means that independence is already sufficiently core to the production of the debates as evidenced by the experience of 2010. The risk of a non-broadcasting body (or a body in which the broadcasters are invited to take part, but without having a decisive say) being responsible for setting the parameters is that the existing independence from political influence would be lost, not enhanced. Such an arrangement makes it less likely that the public interest would be paramount and more likely that the larger political parties hold sway.The conundrum facing those who believe a Debates Commission is the way forward is that  it will only have the power to establish debates if Parliament – the politicians – give it that authority;  it will then only have sufficient independence to set the terms of those debates if it can stand up to the influence of the political parties.   Contradictory and challenging as that may sound, there is already such an organisation:  the BBC.  The difference is that, along with the other broadcasters, it draws its authority not from the politicians, but from a strong relationship with its audience.&#xa0;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[How could it ensure that the relevant broadcasters and political parties would]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[participate and to do so according to its rules and guidance?]]]Unless established by statute, it could not ensure participation.  As senior BBC executives put it in 1997, following the failure to secure debates: “in this game, the politicians hold all the aces”….in other words, if a political party believes it is not in its own electoral interests to take part in a debate, no system, including the one in the US, can force it to participate.  No political party will sign up to rules which it believes might harm its chances of winning the election.   A Commission may provide a forum for discussions about debates, just as the broadcasters did in 2010, but it cannot – any more than the broadcasters - guarantee they will happen.  If debates do only happen because they are conducted in a way that primarily suits the main political parties – and they also crowd out other forms of scrutiny at election time – then that may be too high a price.&#xa0;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[What principles should guide the body responsible for this system in determining its view on some of the thorny questions it would face e.g. which political parties should]]]

[[[participate?]]]Precisely the same legal and regulatory framework in which the broadcasters currently operate. 

[[[What relationship should the new body have, if any, with the Electoral Commission?]]]This is not a matter for the BBC.&#xa0;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
