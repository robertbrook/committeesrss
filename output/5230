default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Electoral Commission is an independent body which reports directly to the UK Parliament. We regulate political party and 
defaultelection finance and set standards for well-run elections. We put voters first by working to support a healthy democracy, where elections and referendums are based on our principles of trust, participation, and no undue influence. We are responsible for pu
defaultblishing reports on the administration of elections
default and referendums
default.

defaultreferendums held under the framework of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA). The proposed 
defaultreferendum included within the D

defaultconducted under that framework.

defaultThe Chair of the Commission, or someone she appoints, is Chief Counting
default Officer,
default responsible for the conduct of the referendum and ensur
defaulting the accuracy of the overall result. 
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA well-run referendum which has the confidence of voters and campaigners is underpinned by a clear and certain legal framework. Good legislation provides absolute clarity on the roles and responsibilities of those a
defaultdministering the referendum and sets out fair rules governing cam
defaultpaign spending and fundraising.

defaultThe Commission’s comments 
defaulton the draft Bill
default 
defaultdraw
default on lessons learnt from the 
defaultWales and
default the UK-wide referendum
defaults
default held in 
default2011
default.
default 
defaultWe published reports on the two 
defaultreferendums in 2011
default. 
default1.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe legislation for the
default forthcoming
default Scottish independence referendum addresses a number of our recommendations from 2011 and also contains provisions specific to that referendum. After the independence referendum, we will reflect on 
defaulthow those provisions have worked in practice and consider whether and how such provisions should apply to all referendums held under PPERA. 
defaultRules for the conduct of the referendumdefault1.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe draft Bill provides f
defaultor the referendum rules
default to be contained in
default an
default Orde
defaultr in Council
default. The provision in the draft Bill is the same as that in the Government of Wales Act 2006
default (GOWA
default). 
default1.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFollowing the referendums in 2011, 
defaultwe recommended
default that the UK Government should use the powers pro
defaultvided 
defaultin the Political Parties, Elections and
default Referendums Act 2000
default (PPERA) to make a generic order providing for the conduct of any future referendum
default.
default We said that i
defaultntroducing generic rules would:
default&#xa0;
default1.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK Government responded to our recommendation in December 2012
default, recog
defaultnising
default the benefits that a generic conduct order for refe
defaultrendums would bring, and undertaking to consider this
default further, including through discussion with the Law Commission in the context of their revi
defaultew of electoral law as a whole.
default1.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe continue to urge the
default Government to make such an Order, which
default in relation to
default the draft Wales Bill would obvia
defaultte the need for rules to be made in the
default Order in Council
default after the referendum h
defaultas been triggered. 
default1.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHaving a generic conduct Order in place would also ensure that the 
defaultrules for the referendum are in place at least six months before t
defaulthe referendum takes place, as
default should be t
defaulthe case for all polls
default.
default We have already seen the benefit of this for the Scottish independence referendum, where the relevant legislation is in place 
defaultnine months in advance of the poll.
default1.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe recommend that defaultthe defaultrules that apply to the conduct of a referendum defaultunder the provisions of the draft Bill defaultare in pldefaultace at least six months before thedefault referendum defaultis helddefault.defaultScope of the Order-making powerdefault1.15
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNotwithstanding
default our recommendation for a generic conduct order, we are concerned that t
defaulthe Order-making power in the draft Bill 
defaultmay not be sufficient in scope to allow for lessons learnt fr
defaultom other referendums
default to be applied
default.
default 
defaultOur concern is based on experience in the previ
defaultous referendum in Wales in 2011.
default1.16
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe detailed rules 
defaultfor the referendum 
defaultheld under
default the Parliamentary Voting Systems 
defaultand Constituencies 
defaultAct
default 2011
default (PVS
defaultC
default) 
defaultwere very similar to the rules used for the Wales referendum in March 2011, but with some notable differe
defaultnces. The two sets of referendum rules could not be fully aligned at the time
default, 
defaultbecause of limitations to the scope of
default the Order-making power in in GOWA
default.
default 
default1.17
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have 
defaultrecommended that 
defaultchanges should be made to the ge
defaultneric
default controls 
defaulton campaigning at
default any referendum held under the provisions of PPERA
default, to provide a robust and proportionate regulatory regime
default. 
defaultWe recommenddefault, therefore, that these should
default apply to any referendum held under the
default provisions of the draft Bill. 
default 
defaultAgain b
defaultased on experience from 
defaultthe
default Wales referendum in 2011
default, 
defaultit may not be possible for these
default changes
default to be introduced under the O
defaultrder-making power in its current form.
default1.18
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo illustrate the scope of the Order-making power
default that will be needed, 
defaultspecific examples that the rules for the referendu
defaultm should include
default and the changes that need to be made to the regulatory controls of the referendum are set out in 
defaultAnnex 1default.
default1.19
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWdefaulte recommend thadefaultt the Order-making power for adefault referendum in the draft Wales Bill should be sufficiently broad in scope to enable anydefault recommendations about the conduct and regulation of referendums held under PPERA to apply to a referendum held under the provisions of the Bill. default1.20
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf there is any 
defaultdoubt about whether the changes that are needed can be achieved through an 
defaultO
defaultrder
default in Council, t
defaulthen we suggest that amendments are incorporated in the 
defaultprimary legislation.
defaultDesignation and puttidefaultng campaign arguments to votersdefault1.21
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe issue of 
defaultwhether the referendum is likely to stimulate a level of debate which would generate willing and a
defaultble applicants for designation
default 
defaultas lead campaigner
defaults
default on both sides 
defaultof the argument 
defaultis one that needs early consideration. 
default1.22
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe generic 
defaultstatutory designation process 
defaultin PPERA 
defaultrelies on the assumption that there will be campaign groups on either side of the re
defaultferendum question which are willing and able to use the benefits of designation to mount a lead campaign. If that is not the case – either because most prospective campaigners are on one side of the debate, or because a campaigner sees tactical advantage i
defaultn not seeking designation – then the referendum campaign, and the process of putting the campaign arguments to voters, 
defaultis likely to
default suffer.
default1.23
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA
defaultt the 2011 referendum in
default Wales, we were unable to designate lead campaigners because there was no willing and able 
defaultapplicant for the 
default‘no’ outcome.  
default1.24
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe recommendeddefault in 2011 that when considering the case for future referendums, legislators should take into account whether the referendum is likely to stimulate a level of debate which would generate willing and able appli
defaultcants for designation. We would of 
defaultcourse be happy to work with the Government to consider how to take th
defaultis recommendation into account.
default1.25
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe also recommended
default in 2011 
defaultthat t
defaulthe Government should take steps to reduce the potential advantages to a prospective l
defaultead campaigner of deciding not to apply for designation. In 2012, the Government responded to this recommendation by saying
default:
default‘
defaultDesignated organisations are important to the referendum process as they are a source of public awareness about the issues at hand
default. It is important that support be provided for them through the legislative framework. Clearly, it runs counter to the interests of voters if there is any incentive for campaigners to refrain from applying to become designated organisations, as this may im
defaultpede the proper development of public understanding during a referendum campaign…… The Government is therefore considering carefully how the designation process might be improved
default’
default1.26
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Scottish Government has addressed this recommendation 
defaultin the 
defaultScottish 
defaultIndependence Referendum Act 2013 by providing for the Commission to designate for only one outcome if there are not willing and abl
defaulte applicants for both outcomes.

default 
default1.28
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs described earlier, generic referendum rules would obviate the need for referendum rules to be made by Order in Council. Without generic rules, however, advance drafting of the rules will be essential to enable
default 
defaultstatutory consultation
default 
defaultwith the 
defaultCommission
default and others, as well as
default scrutiny,
default within the 180-day timetable.

defaultWe recommendeddefault after the referendums held
default in 2011
default that there 
defaultshould be
default at least 12 weeks between the campaign rules being finalised and the start of the 
defaultregulated referendum peri

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe Draft Wales Bill
default provides for the Commission to have

default mirror

defaultNational Assembly defaultfor Wales electoral arrangementsdefaultFdefaultive defaultyear fixed termsdefault1.34
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe draft Bill
default would lengthen
default Assembly terms from four to five years. 
defaultWhilst the C
defaultommission does not have a 
defaultspecific 
defaultview on the question of whether an Assembly term should be a four or five year fixed term, we 
defaultdo
default 
defaultgive
default 
defaultour 
defaultviews on particular combinations of elections.
default 
defaultThe Commission’
defaults position is that each individual proposal should b
defaulte considered on its merits and w
defaulte advise on the particular risks and how they could be managed.
default 
defaultOur priority is that a poll
default is well-run and delivered in a way that is easy for voters to 
defaultunderstand and par
defaultticipate in.
default1.35
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe election schedule is
default:
default&#xa0;
default1.36
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe combination of a UK Parliamentary general election, Welsh general election and Police and Crime Commissioner elections in 2020 would present significan
defaultt challenges for voters. I
defaultt would mea
defaultn each voter
default 
defaultcasting ballots
default in up to three differently-drawn constituencies
default and
default 
defaultan electoral region;
default on four separate ballot papers and using
default 
defaultthree different electoral systems
default.
default It would also prove challenging for political parties and candidates, not least because of the risk of one campaign overshadowing another and the communication issues that campaigning across multiple elections presents. 
defaultThere would also be 
defaulta
defaultdministrative 
defaultchallenges
default for
default Ret
defaulturning Off
defaulticers
default. Overall, these
default issues would bring significant risks to ensuring well-run elections.
default 
default1.37
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMoving 
defaultthe Assembly term to five years avoids 
defaultthe risks inherent in 
defaultcombining three sets of elections i
defaultn 2020
default, although 
defaultit 
defaultdoes then bri
defaultng
default 
defaultcombination with local government elections
default in Wales
default 
defaultin 2021
default.
default 
defaultIn th
defaultat combination, each voter would cast ballots
default in 
defaulta constituency
default, 
defaultan electoral region
default and 
defaulta local ward
default, on three ballot papers and using two electoral systems. There would be 
defaultrisks
default to add
defaultress
default, but less so
default than 
defaultin 
default2020.
defaultRestore the right for candidates to stand on both a constituency and regional list during the Assembly electionsdefault1.38
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe draft 
defaultBill
default provides for
default the removal of the restriction on standing for election for both cons
defaulttituency
default and 
defaultelectoral regions.
default It
default should be straightforward for people to participate 
defaultin elections, whether voting or campaigning. This means there should be no unnecessary barriers to standing for election. We made our view clear when the initial proposals to prohibit dual candidacy in W
defaultales were published as part of the Government of Wales Bill 2006 that we did not believe that the case for introducing the change had been made, on the evidence available at the time. 
default1.39
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo our knowledge, no further evidence has become available that would s
defaultuggest that the prohibition should be retained. It continues to be the case that there is no similar prohibition for candidates in Scottish Parliament elections, where the same electoral system is in use
default.
default  We agree, therefore, that candidates should be abl
defaulte to stand in a constituency and a region in the same Assembly election. 
defaultEnsure that Assembly Members cannot be MPs at the same timedefault1.40
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe draft 
defaultBill
default provides for
default the disqualification of MPs from membership of the Assembly. 
defaultWhile we do
default not have a specific 
defaultview on the question
default of multiple mandates, issues to be considered are what the electorate
default expect
defaults of their representatives and how 
defaultrepresentative
defaults
default ensure the best possible leve
defaultl
default of service
default.
default Can this be
default achieved by representing the electorate
default at a variety 
defaultof different levels (for example at the UK Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales) and the experience which this brings about or should the focus be
default entirely on one legislature?
