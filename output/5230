[normal]Written evidence submitted by the Electoral Commission (DWB 09)[bold]Introduction[bold] [bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Electoral Commission is an independent body which reports directly to the UK Parliament. We regulate political party and 
[normal]election finance and set standards for well-run elections. We put voters first by working to support a healthy democracy, where elections and referendums are based on our principles of trust, participation, and no undue influence. We are responsible for pu
[normal]blishing reports on the administration of elections
[normal] and referendums
[normal]. 
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]O
[normal]ur comments on the 
[normal]draft 
[normal]Bill relate to matters concerning referendums and 
[normal]electoral arrangements
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Referendum about commencement of income tax provisions[bold]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have specific responsibilit
[normal]ies
[normal] in relation to the conduct of
[normal] 
[normal]referendums held under the framework of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA). The proposed 
[normal]referendum included within the D
[normal]raft Wales Bill
[normal] will
[normal] be 
[normal]conducted under that framework.
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In any such
[normal] referendum,
[normal] our role includes:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chair of the Commission, or someone she appoints, is Chief Counting
[normal] Officer,
[normal] responsible for the conduct of the referendum and ensur
[normal]ing the accuracy of the overall result. 
[normal]1.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A well-run referendum which has the confidence of voters and campaigners is underpinned by a clear and certain legal framework. Good legislation provides absolute clarity on the roles and responsibilities of those a
[normal]dministering the referendum and sets out fair rules governing cam
[normal]paign spending and fundraising.
[normal]1.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Commission’s comments 
[normal]on the draft Bill
[normal] 
[normal]draw
[normal] on lessons learnt from the 
[normal]Wales and
[normal] the UK-wide referendum
[normal]s
[normal] held in 
[normal]2011
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We published reports on the two 
[normal]referendums in 2011
[normal]. 
[normal]1.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The legislation for the
[normal] forthcoming
[normal] Scottish independence referendum addresses a number of our recommendations from 2011 and also contains provisions specific to that referendum. After the independence referendum, we will reflect on 
[normal]how those provisions have worked in practice and consider whether and how such provisions should apply to all referendums held under PPERA. 
[normal]Rules for the conduct of the referendum[bold]1.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The draft Bill provides f
[normal]or the referendum rules
[normal] to be contained in
[normal] an
[normal] Orde
[normal]r in Council
[normal]. The provision in the draft Bill is the same as that in the Government of Wales Act 2006
[normal] (GOWA
[normal]). 
[normal]1.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Following the referendums in 2011, 
[normal]we recommended
[normal] that the UK Government should use the powers pro
[normal]vided 
[normal]in the Political Parties, Elections and
[normal] Referendums Act 2000
[normal] (PPERA) to make a generic order providing for the conduct of any future referendum
[normal].
[normal] We said that i
[normal]ntroducing generic rules would:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK Government responded to our recommendation in December 2012
[normal], recog
[normal]nising
[normal] the benefits that a generic conduct order for refe
[normal]rendums would bring, and undertaking to consider this
[normal] further, including through discussion with the Law Commission in the context of their revi
[normal]ew of electoral law as a whole.
[normal]1.12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We continue to urge the
[normal] Government to make such an Order, which
[normal] in relation to
[normal] the draft Wales Bill would obvia
[normal]te the need for rules to be made in the
[normal] Order in Council
[normal] after the referendum h
[normal]as been triggered. 
[normal]1.13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Having a generic conduct Order in place would also ensure that the 
[normal]rules for the referendum are in place at least six months before t
[normal]he referendum takes place, as
[normal] should be t
[normal]he case for all polls
[normal].
[normal] We have already seen the benefit of this for the Scottish independence referendum, where the relevant legislation is in place 
[normal]nine months in advance of the poll.
[normal]1.14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We recommend that [bold]the [bold]rules that apply to the conduct of a referendum [bold]under the provisions of the draft Bill [bold]are in pl[bold]ace at least six months before the[bold] referendum [bold]is held[bold].[bold]Scope of the Order-making power[bold]1.15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Notwithstanding
[normal] our recommendation for a generic conduct order, we are concerned that t
[normal]he Order-making power in the draft Bill 
[normal]may not be sufficient in scope to allow for lessons learnt fr
[normal]om other referendums
[normal] to be applied
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Our concern is based on experience in the previ
[normal]ous referendum in Wales in 2011.
[normal]1.16
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The detailed rules 
[normal]for the referendum 
[normal]held under
[normal] the Parliamentary Voting Systems 
[normal]and Constituencies 
[normal]Act
[normal] 2011
[normal] (PVS
[normal]C
[normal]) 
[normal]were very similar to the rules used for the Wales referendum in March 2011, but with some notable differe
[normal]nces. The two sets of referendum rules could not be fully aligned at the time
[normal], 
[normal]because of limitations to the scope of
[normal] the Order-making power in in GOWA
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]1.17
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have 
[normal]recommended that 
[normal]changes should be made to the ge
[normal]neric
[normal] controls 
[normal]on campaigning at
[normal] any referendum held under the provisions of PPERA
[normal], to provide a robust and proportionate regulatory regime
[normal]. 
[normal]We recommend[bold], therefore, that these should
[normal] apply to any referendum held under the
[normal] provisions of the draft Bill. 
[normal] 
[normal]Again b
[normal]ased on experience from 
[normal]the
[normal] Wales referendum in 2011
[normal], 
[normal]it may not be possible for these
[normal] changes
[normal] to be introduced under the O
[normal]rder-making power in its current form.
[normal]1.18
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To illustrate the scope of the Order-making power
[normal] that will be needed, 
[normal]specific examples that the rules for the referendu
[normal]m should include
[normal] and the changes that need to be made to the regulatory controls of the referendum are set out in 
[normal]Annex 1[bold].
[normal]1.19
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]W[bold]e recommend tha[bold]t the Order-making power for a[bold] referendum in the draft Wales Bill should be sufficiently broad in scope to enable any[bold] recommendations about the conduct and regulation of referendums held under PPERA to apply to a referendum held under the provisions of the Bill. [bold]1.20
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If there is any 
[normal]doubt about whether the changes that are needed can be achieved through an 
[normal]O
[normal]rder
[normal] in Council, t
[normal]hen we suggest that amendments are incorporated in the 
[normal]primary legislation.
[normal]Designation and putti[bold]ng campaign arguments to voters[bold]1.21
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he issue of 
[normal]whether the referendum is likely to stimulate a level of debate which would generate willing and a
[normal]ble applicants for designation
[normal] 
[normal]as lead campaigner
[normal]s
[normal] on both sides 
[normal]of the argument 
[normal]is one that needs early consideration. 
[normal]1.22
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The generic 
[normal]statutory designation process 
[normal]in PPERA 
[normal]relies on the assumption that there will be campaign groups on either side of the re
[normal]ferendum question which are willing and able to use the benefits of designation to mount a lead campaign. If that is not the case – either because most prospective campaigners are on one side of the debate, or because a campaigner sees tactical advantage i
[normal]n not seeking designation – then the referendum campaign, and the process of putting the campaign arguments to voters, 
[normal]is likely to
[normal] suffer.
[normal]1.23
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]t the 2011 referendum in
[normal] Wales, we were unable to designate lead campaigners because there was no willing and able 
[normal]applicant for the 
[normal]‘no’ outcome.  
[normal]1.24
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We recommended[bold] in 2011 that when considering the case for future referendums, legislators should take into account whether the referendum is likely to stimulate a level of debate which would generate willing and able appli
[normal]cants for designation. We would of 
[normal]course be happy to work with the Government to consider how to take th
[normal]is recommendation into account.
[normal]1.25
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We also recommended
[normal] in 2011 
[normal]that t
[normal]he Government should take steps to reduce the potential advantages to a prospective l
[normal]ead campaigner of deciding not to apply for designation. In 2012, the Government responded to this recommendation by saying
[normal]:
[normal]‘
[normal]Designated organisations are important to the referendum process as they are a source of public awareness about the issues at hand
[normal]. It is important that support be provided for them through the legislative framework. Clearly, it runs counter to the interests of voters if there is any incentive for campaigners to refrain from applying to become designated organisations, as this may im
[normal]pede the proper development of public understanding during a referendum campaign…… The Government is therefore considering carefully how the designation process might be improved
[normal]’
[normal]1.26
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Scottish Government has addressed this recommendation 
[normal]in the 
[normal]Scottish 
[normal]Independence Referendum Act 2013 by providing for the Commission to designate for only one outcome if there are not willing and abl
[normal]e applicants for both outcomes.
[normal]180-day timetable for the Order in Council
[normal]1.27
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he draft 
[normal]Bill
[normal] provides for a 180-day period from
[normal] receipt by t
[normal]he Secretary of State 
[normal]of a notice from the First Mi
[normal]nister 
[normal]t
[normal]o the draft Order 
[normal]being laid
[normal] in Parliament
[normal]. This compares with 
[normal]a 
[normal]120-
[normal]day period 
[normal]in 
[normal]GOWA
[normal], which
[normal] was 
[normal]in practice suspended after
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] UK Parliamentary
[normal] general election
[normal] was held
[normal] in
[normal] Ma
[normal]y 201
[normal]0
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]1.28
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As described earlier, generic referendum rules would obviate the need for referendum rules to be made by Order in Council. Without generic rules, however, advance drafting of the rules will be essential to enable
[normal] 
[normal]statutory consultation
[normal] 
[normal]with the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] and others, as well as
[normal] scrutiny,
[normal] within the 180-day timetable.  
[normal]1.29
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he 1
[normal]80-
[normal]day period will include
[normal] the time the 
[normal]C
[normal]ommission needs to undertake our
[normal] statutory assessmen
[normal]t 
[normal]of 
[normal]the intelligibility of the referendum question
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Our approach to 
[normal]assessing ref
[normal]erendum questio
[normal]ns 
[normal]take
[normal]s
[normal] around 
[normal]10 weeks
[normal] to complete, which includes time
[normal] to undertake public opinion research to see what people think of the question
[normal]. We need time to undertake any necessary procurement and about two weeks’ notice 
[normal]to 
[normal]start 
[normal]test
[normal]ing
[normal] the que
[normal]stion
[normal]. 
[normal]1.30
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]F
[normal]oll
[normal]owing receipt of our assessment
[normal] the referendum question, the Secretary of State wi
[normal]ll need time to consider our recommendations. It is possible that further iterations will be required 
[normal]before the question
[normal] can be finalised for inclusion in
[normal] the Or
[normal]der in Council
[normal].
[normal]1.31
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 180-day period should allow sufficient time for assessing and finalising the referendum question for inclusion in the Order in Counci
[normal]l, providing advance preparation 
[normal]is undertaken. 
[normal]Legislative timetable[bold]1.32
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For completeness
[normal],
[normal] we 
[normal]highlight
[normal] the need for early consideration of the
[normal] timetable
[normal] for the referendum itself
[normal]. 
[normal]We recommended[bold] after the referendums held
[normal] in 2011
[normal] that there 
[normal]should be
[normal] at least 12 weeks between the campaign rules being finalised and the start of the 
[normal]regulated referendum peri
[normal]od. This period is important to enable the Commission to publish and disseminate guidance in time to allow campaigners to understand the rules before they come into force. 
[normal]Voter information[bold]1.33
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he Draft Wales Bill
[normal] provides for the Commission to have
[normal] respons
[normal]ibi
[normal]lity for 
[normal]providing informatio
[normal]n to voters. The provisions
[normal] mirror
[normal] those
[normal] of GOWA
[normal] 
[normal]2006 and we are content with their
[normal] inclusion
[normal].
[normal]National Assembly [bold]for Wales electoral arrangements[bold]F[bold]ive [bold]year fixed terms[bold]1.34
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he draft Bill
[normal] would lengthen
[normal] Assembly terms from four to five years. 
[normal]Whilst the C
[normal]ommission does not have a 
[normal]specific 
[normal]view on the question of whether an Assembly term should be a four or five year fixed term, we 
[normal]do
[normal] 
[normal]give
[normal] 
[normal]our 
[normal]views on particular combinations of elections.
[normal] 
[normal]The Commission’
[normal]s position is that each individual proposal should b
[normal]e considered on its merits and w
[normal]e advise on the particular risks and how they could be managed.
[normal] 
[normal]Our priority is that a poll
[normal] is well-run and delivered in a way that is easy for voters to 
[normal]understand and par
[normal]ticipate in.
[normal]1.35
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The election schedule is
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.36
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The combination of a UK Parliamentary general election, Welsh general election and Police and Crime Commissioner elections in 2020 would present significan
[normal]t challenges for voters. I
[normal]t would mea
[normal]n each voter
[normal] 
[normal]casting ballots
[normal] in up to three differently-drawn constituencies
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]an electoral region;
[normal] on four separate ballot papers and using
[normal] 
[normal]three different electoral systems
[normal].
[normal] It would also prove challenging for political parties and candidates, not least because of the risk of one campaign overshadowing another and the communication issues that campaigning across multiple elections presents. 
[normal]There would also be 
[normal]a
[normal]dministrative 
[normal]challenges
[normal] for
[normal] Ret
[normal]urning Off
[normal]icers
[normal]. Overall, these
[normal] issues would bring significant risks to ensuring well-run elections.
[normal] 
[normal]1.37
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Moving 
[normal]the Assembly term to five years avoids 
[normal]the risks inherent in 
[normal]combining three sets of elections i
[normal]n 2020
[normal], although 
[normal]it 
[normal]does then bri
[normal]ng
[normal] 
[normal]combination with local government elections
[normal] in Wales
[normal] 
[normal]in 2021
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In th
[normal]at combination, each voter would cast ballots
[normal] in 
[normal]a constituency
[normal], 
[normal]an electoral region
[normal] and 
[normal]a local ward
[normal], on three ballot papers and using two electoral systems. There would be 
[normal]risks
[normal] to add
[normal]ress
[normal], but less so
[normal] than 
[normal]in 
[normal]2020.
[normal]Restore the right for candidates to stand on both a constituency and regional list during the Assembly elections[bold]1.38
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he draft 
[normal]Bill
[normal] provides for
[normal] the removal of the restriction on standing for election for both cons
[normal]tituency
[normal] and 
[normal]electoral regions.
[normal] It
[normal] should be straightforward for people to participate 
[normal]in elections, whether voting or campaigning. This means there should be no unnecessary barriers to standing for election. We made our view clear when the initial proposals to prohibit dual candidacy in W
[normal]ales were published as part of the Government of Wales Bill 2006 that we did not believe that the case for introducing the change had been made, on the evidence available at the time. 
[normal]1.39
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To our knowledge, no further evidence has become available that would s
[normal]uggest that the prohibition should be retained. It continues to be the case that there is no similar prohibition for candidates in Scottish Parliament elections, where the same electoral system is in use
[normal].
[normal]  We agree, therefore, that candidates should be abl
[normal]e to stand in a constituency and a region in the same Assembly election. 
[normal]Ensure that Assembly Members cannot be MPs at the same time[bold]1.40
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he draft 
[normal]Bill
[normal] provides for
[normal] the disqualification of MPs from membership of the Assembly. 
[normal]While we do
[normal] not have a specific 
[normal]view on the question
[normal] of multiple mandates, issues to be considered are what the electorate
[normal] expect
[normal]s of their representatives and how 
[normal]representative
[normal]s
[normal] ensure the best possible leve
[normal]l
[normal] of service
[normal].
[normal] Can this be
[normal] achieved by representing the electorate
[normal] at a variety 
[normal]of different levels (for example at the UK Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales) and the experience which this brings about or should the focus be
[normal] entirely on one legislature?

[normal]Recommended changes to the 
[normal]conduct and 
[normal]regulation of PPERA referendums
[normal]1.41
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To illustrate the scope of the Order-making power
[normal] that will be needed, below are 
[normal]specific examples 
[normal]of what
[normal] 
[normal]the rules for the referendum should include
[normal] and the changes that we recommend 
[normal]to 
[normal]the regulatory controls 
[normal]in PPERA 
[normal]for 
[normal]referendum campaigns.
[normal]Rules for the conduct of the referendum[bold]The rules should be as contained in the Parliamentary Voting Systems and Constituencies Act 2011, including:

[normal]The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, our 2011 referendum report, 
[normal]and the Scott
[normal]ish Independence Referendum Act
[normal] 2013 also contained a number of other proposed amendments to the generic PPERA controls which reduce the burdens on campaigners and improve the workability and clarity of the rules. There would be considerable b
[normal]enefit in these amendments also applying at future PPERA referendums to:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If a designation process is to be used, then it will also be important to consider:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]New recommendations[bold]1.43
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]During 2011-12 the Commission undertook a review of the of the UK’s party and election finance laws
[normal]. 
[normal]We recommended new measures
[normal] to simplify the registration process, provide more detailed reporting of pre-registration spending, requiring imprints on electronic material and improvements to the workability of the provisions around sanctioning and late payment of fines. We would of c
[normal]ourse be happy to work with the Government to take these new recommendations forward.
