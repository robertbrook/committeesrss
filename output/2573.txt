[[[ CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND]]]2.1 This submission is based on my experience in the following roles and contexts in relation to the underachievement in education of white working class children.2.2 The doctorate study was designed to answer the research aim ‘who influences white working class boy’s higher education decision-making process?: the role of social networks’. As such, the evidence I provide is focused on white working-class boys, aged 15-16. Providing additional context to my empirical study, research was undertaken through qualitative primary data collection which comprised of 55 individual interviews and 7 group interviews with a selection of 10 working class boys across two secondary schools, their parent(s), a nominated teacher, a friend from school, head teacher of both schools, deputy head teacher from both schools and widening participation officers based at a local university. Data was collected between 2008-2010.2.3 I have always had a very strong interest in the educational attainment of working class young people, coming from that social background myself, hence undertaking a doctorate in that area. I therefore feel able to comment on the underachievement in education by white working class pupils from a local and regional perspective.

[[[ FACTUAL INFORMATION]]]3.1 This section presents the key empirical findings from my study and addresses a number of points set out in the briefing document. Firstly, I would like to clarify that whilst my study focused on the role of social networks on HE decision-making; underpinning HE decision-making is the role of prior educational attainment, aspirations and widening participation activities; these will be discussed throughout this submission.

[[[Extent of white working]]]

[[[class pupil’s educational underachievement]]]3.2.1 Notions of what it means to be working class is synonymous with disadvantage. Disadvantage in schools is generally measured by Free School Meals (FSM). The most recent Department for Education (DfE, 2012) results show only 34.6% of students entitled to FSM achieved 5+ A*-C including English and math’s, compared to 62% of those not entitled to FSM. In addition, there is a wealth of statistical data published by a range of government departments proving the educational underachievement of white working class pupils.

[[[The factors responsible for whi]]]

[[[te working class pupils’ educational underachievement, including the impact of home and family. ]]]&#xa0;3.3.1 The factors responsible for educational underachievement are very complex and situated in a wide range of social, economic and local factors.  These include, lack of prior attainment in school, which starts at a very young age; gaps are already large and visible at 22 months of age (Department for Children, School and Families, 2009) and these gaps continue to grow through school. In addition, literature highlights socio-economic disadvantage, race and gender, disengagement in education, impact of masculinity on boys’ attitudes to education, parents’ levels of education, parents’ occupations, parent’s income, neighbourhood, social identity, low aspirations and finally lack of access to social capital.  There is a wealth of information available on each of these factors; however, little has been written in the individual context of both white working class boys and girls, instead much of the research has treated the group as homogenous. &#xa0;

[[[3.4 ]]]

[[[Whether the problem is significantly worse for white working class boys than girls. ]]]&#xa0;3.4.1 Again, there is a wealth of statistical evidence available proving that the problem is significantly worse for white working class boys than girls. For example, the most recent DfE (Department for Education, 2012) report highlights the differences in gendered attainment; results show that 54.6% of boys achieved 5+A*-C including English and Math’s, compared to 61.9% of girls.  Unpacking this further, Chowdry et al (2008) identify that only 4% of white British boys move up from the middle of the educational attainment distribution at Key Stage 2  to the top of the attainment distribution at Key Stage 4, whilst for white British girls, this figure is 10%. These statistics highlight the importance of gender and show that there is an attainment issue for white British boys between Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 4. &#xa0;3.4.2 Poor attainment at Key Stage 4 also impacts upon HE participation. HEFCE (2010, p.2) quantifies that “the participation rate of young men now trails that of young women by a decade and over the past 15 years around 270,000 fewer young men than young women have entered HE”.  3.4.3 From my experience teaching students on an ‘access to HE’ course in HE, I have found this to be predominately made up of males from a range of ethnic groups. For example, this academic year 2013-14, the course has recruited 230 students, approximately 80% are male.

[[[What steps schools can tak]]]

[[[e to improve the educational outcomes and attainment of white working class ]]]

[[[pupils?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.5.1 My study found that disadvantaged families had high aspirations however; their immediate social networks had little educational experience. This directly impacted on the amount of educational social capital resource available within the network to help mobilise aspirations, which in turn raised motivation for attainment. &#xa0;3.5.2 My study researched into a ‘network approach’ whereby the boy, his family, friends and the school all identified their role in supporting with attainment and educational progression. Ultimately, everyone has a role to play in improving educational outcomes and attainment of white working class pupils. There needs to be joined up thinking between the school, the pupil and the home in order to develop a ‘collaborative influence’. Therefore allowing aspirations to be shared and aligning positive messages to the pupil in the network. This approach allows network members to compensate those disadvantaged families with limited access to social capital. For example, one boy in my study wanted to be a doctor, however this aspiration was not shared between the school or home.  The school was invited to send widening participation pupils to participate in a medical aspiration raising event at a local university, but the boy was not invited to attend. This left the boy feeling angry that he had not been chosen.  &#xa0;3.5.3 My research concluded that schools are best placed to support with aspiration raising which further impacts upon attainment; schools are a conduit between pupils and aspiration raising activities. In addition, schools are full of staff that have access to social capital and networks and know how to develop this capital. However there is a role for other members of the boy’s network, who may not be aware of the term ‘social capital’ and the benefits that it can bring to young people. I recommend that schools work more closely with network members in order to train and educate them on the role and value of social networks and how to utilise social capital that is available within the immediate and wider network. &#xa0;3.5.4 Teachers generally have access to social networks which possess social capital. Schools should encourage teachers to utilise their social networks in order to support pupils with aspiration raising. For example, the entire music department in one of the schools in my study developed strong relationships with the local colleges’ music departments and invited them to attend performances/recitals in order to support college aspiration and transition.  In turn, the pupils worked with focus and determination in their music lessons and attained well, allowing them to study music at college. &#xa0;3.5.5 A number of teachers had developed a ‘holistic approach’ to developing the pupils which focused on more than learning and teaching, specifically on raising aspirations and attainment for future life roles. These teachers understood the value of the social network to support working class pupils aspirations and attainment.&#xa0;3.5.6 My research found that the value of ‘talk’ was highly beneficial to raising aspirations and furthermore, talk was a catalyst for positive emotions and actions. Talking helped pupils to extract value from exposure to widening participation activities. However, whilst pupils attended widening participation events, there was very little follow up from their teachers, as their focus was on attainment within their subject, rather than on aspiration for attainment. &#xa0;

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;3.6.1 Citizenship education needs to include training on forms of capital, for example, what it is, how it is developed, benefits, barriers to development, etc. This way young people will be able to identify networks and social capital that is available and how best to develop/utilise it. 3.6.2 Distribution of widening participation resources should be assessed. Currently HEFCEs widening participation fund is directly given to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) who then decide on the best way to spend the money. Whilst I acknowledge that HEIs outreach staff do spend a considerable amount of time in schools, they generally attend an event and then depart, unable to spend more time in the school and unable to fully understand the barriers to widening participation, aspiration and attainment that the pupils at the school face. HEI outreach staff provide a very importance service, they are a conduit between the school and the university and have an invaluable role to play.

[[[What role Government can play in delivering improved educational outcomes for white]]]

[[[-]]]

[[[working class pupils.]]]3.7.1 Further work needs to be undertaken on targeting the correct group for outreach activities. My study found that those pupils who attended aspiration activities included advantaged pupils, who were chosen because they were well behaved and were up to date on coursework. However, these students had strong aspirations and were motivated to attain at school. The disadvantaged students who would have benefitted the most were not always invited. 3.7.2 Mothers play a nurturing role and genuinely valued education and understood how it could increase social mobility. The mothers in my study demonstrated a strong work ethic and a number had returned to education/training as mature adults. The mothers discussed how they talked to their children about their return to education/training and study experiences and their sons discussed how they were able to watch their mothers enjoy learning. The outcome of access to education/training allows mothers (and fathers) to access wider networks and resources, which can be drawn upon to support their children and raise their aspirations. The government should make available budgets to allow disadvantaged parents access to education/training including support for part-time provision. 3.7.3 University outreach is highly valued by pupils especially on campus visits, however teachers rarely attended due to their value in the classroom. This is a missed opportunity as teachers attending would allow them to further develop their social network with university staff and moreover be able to talk to their pupils about the aspiration raising activities in order to increase attainment. Schools need to be encouraged to let teachers attend outreach activities. 

[[[3.8 ]]]

[[[Recommendations for action by Government for committee to consider:]]]3.8.1 What I outline below are a number of recommendations that will go some way to making inroads on this complex social problem. The recommendations have been proposed to include the input of every social network member, however, more responsibility has been given to schools with support from the government. This is because schools are a constant in the white working class pupil’s lives and can represent a source of stability. In addition, schools have an understanding of the benefits of educational attainment and therefore have value to add in the process of raising aspirations for white working class pupil’s attainment. Finally, schools are conduits to local HEIs and other organisations that provide aspiration-raising activities. 3.8.2 Correct identification and targeting to ensure that white working class pupils are included in widening participation activities is vital for their aspiration raising. Schools are constrained in their decisions regarding who should attend events by the importance of academic attainment. This submission has already shown that white boys have the lowest academic attainment at Key Stage 4. However, the decision not to allow a poor academically performing pupil to attend events needs to be weighed up against the benefit and impact on aspiration and motivation that this could have. 3.8.3 Catalysts, such as specific widening participation activities for talking about aspirations have a fundamental impact on educational outcomes. Ultimately, no exposure to catalysts results in pupils not developing and talking about aspirations with network members, which in turn results in no reflection on the part of the pupils and what they fundamentally want to achieve in life and how important educational attainment is. It is not just the case of having catalysts, but also planning for how to make the most of the activity after the event, to encourage the pupils to talk and reflect on their experiences. This is where the real value of the widening participation experience is held, as such, planning for catalysts needs to be viewed holistically, so that maximum benefit can be gained. As catalysts for aspiration talk generally take place within the school environment, then the school along with the HE outreach teams must work together on these. Planning should include how all network members could also contribute to the process of talking to the pupil.3.8.4 Teachers obviously value the benefits of education and therefore this value could be included and extended into the classroom in a planned approach, through the role of continuing professional development (CPD).  The outcome of CPD will be to emphasise through teachers that education is a normal course of action and that pupils could benefit from attaining well in it. However, resources and training need to be provided to teachers working in schools with disadvantaged students who potentially present a highly complex and challenging environment. 3.8.5 Schools working with white working class pupils would benefit from the employment of a dedicated graduate, preferably a young white working class person from the local area who ‘made it’ to university. This graduate would act as a role model, whilst also undertaking a student mentor role. The student mentor would be in a position to understand and appreciate the complexities and constraints of the pervading social characteristics which impact upon educational attainment. This initiative of employing a young graduate as a student mentor has been successfully used with a number of schools and one of the schools in my study self-funded this role for two years, during 2009-2010, prior to cuts in the education budget, which unfortunately resulted in this post being removed. 3.8.6 The study itself added value to the boy’s attainment process and it had a powerful influence as the boys had their voices heard. The boys said that they had benefitted from participating in the study as it boosted their self-beliefs and made them feel that they were clever enough to continue with their education, therefore giving them a reason to attain at school. Adding to the role of the student mentor, could be the formation within school, and supported by HEIs, of inclusive white working class groups which allow the pupils to have their voices heard whilst discussing questions about their future decisions and career choices. This approach has the potential to unintentionally stigmatise the pupils, however this has to be weighed up against the benefits of forming this group, to increase educational attainment from this group. Ultimately, this group would support the pupils’ aspirations, growth and emotional development whilst boosting their self confidence, that they could ‘make it’ within their chosen field.

[[[3.9 ]]]

[[[Conclusions]]]3.9.1 In conclusion, I would like to highlight that there is still much to be done in order to increase the educational attainment of white working class pupils. One such way is to develop a partnership approach, whereby members of the pupils network work together in order to support their aspirations and to draw upon the social capital held within the network to enhance their educational attainment prospects.  The government’s role is pivotal in supporting networks to make a difference to the educational outcomes of white working class young people.
