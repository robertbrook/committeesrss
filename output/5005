defaultSUMMARY default&#xa0;
defaultHand in Hand’s Mission
default 
default1. 
defaultThe mission of Hand in Hand: The Center for Jewish-Arab Education in Israel (HIH) is to create a strong and inclusive shared society in Israel by (1) enabling Jewish and Arab children to study together in bilingual schools with a multicultural educational model that teaches respect and tolerance, and (2) developing community leadership and a range of community building events for Jewish and Arab adults which creates a social movement beyond the walls of the school.  Starting in 1998 with two schools and 50 children, HIH in 2013-14 has grown to five bilingual schools (Jerusalem, Galilee, Wadi Ara, Haifa, and Jaffa) and 1,080 Jewish and Arab students in grades K-12. Around each school HIH is developing a framework of shared community events to build an integrated and inclusive community. This is a singular accomplishment in a society that generally finds Arabs and Jews living apart, studying in separate institutions, and having minimal contact
default, a situation which fosters mistrust, reinforces stereotypes, and perpetuates conflict between the two groups.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultConflict 
defaultresolution requires daily interaction
default2. 
defaultResolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will require political creativity and resolve, but it cannot succeed without both sides 
defaultrecognizing the legitimacy of the other nation and the other’s 
defaultnarrative. HIH fo
defaultcuses its efforts on the Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel (the latter often considering themselves Palestinian citizens as well).  The creation of an inclusive society between Jews and Arabs living within Israel’s current borders
default is contingent upon both 
defaultsides legitimating the other.  This process of mutual 
defaultrecognition will 
defaultimprove 
defaultrelations and understanding between Jews and Arabs in Israel
default, and illustrate the viability of shared living.  This is applicable 
defaultnot only 
defaultto Jews and Arabs in Israel but 
defaultto 
defaultIsraelis and Palestini
defaulta
defaultns
default on both sides of the conflict as well.  
default&#xa0;
default3. 
defaultBringing the 
defaultJewish and Arab 
defaultpopulations together periodically for coexistence encounters and dialogue has proven to be insufficient. Daily contact starting in pre-kindergarten, in a sa
defaultfe environment where ongoing relationships and friendships can be developed is crucial. Providing the tools to deal with differences in per
defaults
defaultpectives is vital.

default&#xa0;
default4
default. 
defaultHIH bilingual schools are amongst the only places in Israel where Jews and Arabs engage 
defaulton a daily basis
default in an environment of mutual respect, with Hebrew and Arabic-speaking teachers, a shared calendar to celebrate the holidays of each culture, as well as a multicultural curriculum. 
defaultO
defaultur students excel academically, 
defaultwinning competitions in science and spelli
defaultng bees, and achieving above average scores on the matriculation exams.
default HIH’s bilingual multicultural educational model also 
defaultfosters understanding and friendship while breaking down barriers between Arab and Jewish youth, and promotes civic responsibility 
defaultin its students.

defaultin order to add
default special elements to promote the bilingual education and social values that are its reason for being:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe events that happened in Gaza and the south in 2008, was the first time that I personally had to deal with a politically sensitive issue as a mature person... Going to school that same day was difficult, but …the teachers had all kinds of activities pre
defaultpared to help us discuss our feelings and thoughts, and I felt my opinions were heard and respected by all students. This experience was important to me, because it tested the true values of the school, and I realized that things happen and they might be t
defaultough, but we are equipped with the best tools to handle them, by listening and respecting. I think this has really shown me that we don’t live in a bubble where everything is perfect, we live in the real world, where horrible things happen sometimes, but w
defaulte learn how to handle them in the best way.

defaultRole of HIH’s Education Department
default6
default. 
defaultAchieving academic excellence and promoting civic responsibility at HIH schools requires properly trained staff 
defaultwho
default can 
defaultprovide 
defaultcivic and 
defaultpedagogical leadership, 
defaultutilize 
defaultHIH’s unique co-teaching model and can implement multicultural curricula which teach tolerance and civic responsibility.
default 
defaultTo this end, HIH has created an Education Department
default.
default 
defaultHIH teachers
default, both veteran and new,
default 
defaultreceive 
defaultspecial pedagogic training
default 
defaultso that they are able to 
defaultwork 
defaultas equals 
defaultwith
defaultin
default the co-teaching model, 
defaultlearn to integrate
default both the core and supplementary curricula i
defaultnto their teaching, and 
defaultare equipped to
default manage
default the issues of culture and difference that arise.  
defaultThis training 
defaultinvolves both working closely with 
defaultindividual 
defaultstaff in particula
defaultr
default schools
default,
default as well as
default bringing the educational staff from all 
defaultof 
defaultHIH’s 
defaultcountry-wide network of 
defaultschools together for an intensive three-day conference 
defaultin order 
defaultto
default share ideas, problem solve, and learn from each other’s experiences
default.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultS
defaultince HIH’s Jewish and Arab teachers are essentially civic leaders who are training the next generation, it is vital that the teaching staff from 
defaultall
default five HIH bilingual schools strategize together as to the best practices for achieving their goals.
default 
default&#xa0;
default7
default. 
defaultIn addition to training and supervising the educational staff, the Education Department 
defaultdevelops the multicultural supplementary curricula used by HIH schools such as the Religious Cultural Heritage Curriculum which enables students from all three faiths o

default and

default. 
defaultThe Education Department 
defaulthas also developed a 
defaultPrincipals’ Forum
default, 
defaultan institutional framework for bringing together 
defaultprincipals, 
defaultvice-principals 
defaultand 
defaultsenior staff from all of 
defaultthe
default bilingual schools to learn from each other, share 
defaultproblems 
defaultand insights, and develop concepts and methodologies together in the field of bilingual

defaultmulticultural 
defaulteducation.

defaultRole of Community
default Activities Program
default8
default. 
defaultIn order to widen its impact 
defaultbeyond the school setting
default, HIH is 
defaultalso designing and implementing community building events in the five locations in which it currently has schools. The 
defaultgoals of this Shared Communities Program are: to establish a wide range of Jewish-Arab community activities, from sports and culture to dialogue, study and responding to discriminatory events, and open the community activity to all who are interested.  In new locations the communities play a central role in helping open new schools.

default. 
defaultAs of March 2012 HIH had 3 bilingual schools in Jerusalem, Wadi Ara, and the Galilee. Thanks to three-year core funding from the United States gover
defaultnment’s U.S. Agency for International Development and with matching funds, 
defaultHIH
default 
defaultlaunched its
default Shared Community Project
default. The goal of this project is 
defaultto establish community leadership and structures
default, and develop

defaultIn March 2012 
defaultHIH selected Jaffa and Haifa as its two new communities
default.

default activities to fit the needs and interests of the Jewish and Arab populations
default in these communities
default. Parents 
defaultand children 
defaultparticipated in cultural events, holiday celebrations, 
defaultand community gardening
default; 
defaultadults 
defaultenrolled in Arab and Hebrew language classes
default, pa
defaultrticipated in dialogue sessions, and played on 
defaultintegrated 
defaultbasketball teams
default. They got to know one another and formed friendships. As a result of these interactions, the Jaffa and Haifa communities strengthened the bonds between Jews and Arabs, enabling them
default to cooperate and open a bilingual pre-kindergarten in each of their 
defaultcommunities in September 2013 with an equal number of Jewish and Arab children
default enrolled and with hundreds on waiting lists
default.

default. 
defaultThe community organizers will continue to develop and run 
defaultlocal activities
default for the more veteran communities to insure strong parental involvement, a growing student body
default,
default and joint Jewish and Arab communal life. They will 
defaulthelp insure that the new bilingual schools in Jaffa and Haifa 
defaultcontinue to grow with 
defaultanother 
defaultgrade each year, 
defaultand will continue to develop and maintain relationships with the Municipality and the Ministry of Education.
default They will also help start new communities and new schools.

defaulto
defaultrganizers are also responsible 
defaultfor 
defaultorganiz
defaulting
default an annual event
default,
default bringing together the Hand in Hand communities from all around the country.  
defaultHIH
default piloted a country-wide 
defaultevent 
defaultaround Ramadan 
defaultfor the first time in July 20
default13 
defaultand it was a huge success. HIH
default expected 250 people
default, but 
defaultclosed registration with 650 
defaultArabs and Jews
default 
defaultcom
defaulting from all over the country. 
defaultThe program included a public discussion with a Rabbi, a Sheikh and a Priest about the notion of fasting and forgiving in the three religions as well as musical performances. Bringing community leaders together for the planning of such an event empowers th
defaultem as they realize that they are part of something much bigger than their own community. They are able 
defaultto share stories of success and failure and learn from each other’s experiences.

defaultPublicizing HIH’s Success
defaultes
default1
default3
default. 
defaultWhile our bi
defaultlingual schools and shared communities demonstrate that it is possible for Jews and Arabs to peacefully coexist, interact, and become friends, the experience of cooperation that we have demonstrated will have a limited impact if it remains known only to th
defaultose who have personally experienced it. Therefore, HIH has hired an 
defaultOrganizational Journalist
default to join the team, and help publicize our story of an inclusive society to as wide an audience as possible
default in Hebrew, English and Arabic
default.  HIH’s “doing” in the bil
defaultingual schools and in the shared communities will inform the telling
default, which will illustrate the viability of inclusion, shared society and equality.  
defaultThis will counter 
defaultthe 
default feelings
default of helplessness and despair that exists in no small part because of the media’s highlighting negative stories. Our stories 
defaultthat appear in radio segments, television reports, in the Israeli and international press, 
defaultand on Facebook 
defaulthttps://www.facebook.com/HandinHandil
default 
defaultprovide a powerful message that a different reality is possible 
defaultin 
defaultIsrael
default.

defaultVision for the Future
default1
default4
default. 
defaultOver the next ten years, Hand in Hand aims to create a network of 10-15 integrated bilingual schools, supported and enhanced by active communities, altogether involving 
defaultsome 
default20,000 
defaultIsraeli citizens.  These visibly integrated shared communities wi
defaultll not only help HIH schools succeed and expand, but will also show the broader public that the experience of social inclusion and mutual respect is viable not only for students but also for all citizens.  
defaultIsrael 
defaultcan be a 
defaultdiverse
default 
defaultdemocratic s
defaulttate where Jews and Arabs live together peacefully. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRequest for Funding
default1
default5
default. 
defaultTo accomplish its goals HIH must locate additional sources of funding. While it has submitted requests to the British Embassy, it has not been awarded funding
default in recent years. HIH 
defaultasks that a larger portion of 
defaultUK government 
defaultfunds be granted to organizations like HIH which have succeeded 
defaultthrough its bilingual, multicultural schools and 
defaultcommunity-oriented 
defaultactivities
default 
defaultin 
defaultbringing together Jews and Arabs on a daily 
defaultbasis, improving the relationships between them,
default and developing trust and respect for one another.
default 
defaultIn this way we will build a strong civil society in Israel
default 
defaultthat
