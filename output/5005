[normal]WRITTEN EVIDENCE SUBMITTED BY HAND IN HAND: CENTER FOR JEWISH-ARAB EDUCATION IN ISRAEL[bold] (HIH)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]SUMMARY [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Hand in Hand’s Mission
[normal] 
[normal]1. 
[normal]The mission of Hand in Hand: The Center for Jewish-Arab Education in Israel (HIH) is to create a strong and inclusive shared society in Israel by (1) enabling Jewish and Arab children to study together in bilingual schools with a multicultural educational model that teaches respect and tolerance, and (2) developing community leadership and a range of community building events for Jewish and Arab adults which creates a social movement beyond the walls of the school.  Starting in 1998 with two schools and 50 children, HIH in 2013-14 has grown to five bilingual schools (Jerusalem, Galilee, Wadi Ara, Haifa, and Jaffa) and 1,080 Jewish and Arab students in grades K-12. Around each school HIH is developing a framework of shared community events to build an integrated and inclusive community. This is a singular accomplishment in a society that generally finds Arabs and Jews living apart, studying in separate institutions, and having minimal contact
[normal], a situation which fosters mistrust, reinforces stereotypes, and perpetuates conflict between the two groups.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conflict 
[normal]resolution requires daily interaction
[normal]2. 
[normal]Resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will require political creativity and resolve, but it cannot succeed without both sides 
[normal]recognizing the legitimacy of the other nation and the other’s 
[normal]narrative. HIH fo
[normal]cuses its efforts on the Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel (the latter often considering themselves Palestinian citizens as well).  The creation of an inclusive society between Jews and Arabs living within Israel’s current borders
[normal] is contingent upon both 
[normal]sides legitimating the other.  This process of mutual 
[normal]recognition will 
[normal]improve 
[normal]relations and understanding between Jews and Arabs in Israel
[normal], and illustrate the viability of shared living.  This is applicable 
[normal]not only 
[normal]to Jews and Arabs in Israel but 
[normal]to 
[normal]Israelis and Palestini
[normal]a
[normal]ns
[normal] on both sides of the conflict as well.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. 
[normal]Bringing the 
[normal]Jewish and Arab 
[normal]populations together periodically for coexistence encounters and dialogue has proven to be insufficient. Daily contact starting in pre-kindergarten, in a sa
[normal]fe environment where ongoing relationships and friendships can be developed is crucial. Providing the tools to deal with differences in per
[normal]s
[normal]pectives is vital.
[normal] 
[normal]Hand in Hand believes that the 
[normal]daily
[normal], positive
[normal] 
[normal]and meaningful 
[normal]interaction
[normal] 
[normal]of its 
[normal]Jewish and 
[normal]A
[normal]rab
[normal] students
[normal], teachers, 
[normal]and 
[normal]parents 
[normal]taking place in 
[normal]its bilingual schools
[normal],
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]the connections 
[normal]and social awareness 
[normal]being developed 
[normal]between community members 
[normal]as a 
[normal]result
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]community 
[normal]building events
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]will create 
[normal]shared social and civic frameworks between Jews and
[normal] Arabs
[normal] that
[normal] 
[normal]will 
[normal]alter Israeli society
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal]. 
[normal]HIH bilingual schools are amongst the only places in Israel where Jews and Arabs engage 
[normal]on a daily basis
[normal] in an environment of mutual respect, with Hebrew and Arabic-speaking teachers, a shared calendar to celebrate the holidays of each culture, as well as a multicultural curriculum. 
[normal]O
[normal]ur students excel academically, 
[normal]winning competitions in science and spelli
[normal]ng bees, and achieving above average scores on the matriculation exams.
[normal] HIH’s bilingual multicultural educational model also 
[normal]fosters understanding and friendship while breaking down barriers between Arab and Jewish youth, and promotes civic responsibility 
[normal]in its students. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Special Elements in HIH Schools
[normal]5
[normal]. 
[normal]Although 
[normal]Hand in Hand schools 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]approved, supervised and supported by the 
[normal]Ministry of Education, 
[normal]Hand in Hand 
[normal]must raise
[normal] 
[normal]an 
[normal]additional 
[normal]$
[normal]2.7
[normal] million
[normal] 
[normal]in order to add
[normal] special elements to promote the bilingual education and social values that are its reason for being:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The events that happened in Gaza and the south in 2008, was the first time that I personally had to deal with a politically sensitive issue as a mature person... Going to school that same day was difficult, but …the teachers had all kinds of activities pre
[normal]pared to help us discuss our feelings and thoughts, and I felt my opinions were heard and respected by all students. This experience was important to me, because it tested the true values of the school, and I realized that things happen and they might be t
[normal]ough, but we are equipped with the best tools to handle them, by listening and respecting. I think this has really shown me that we don’t live in a bubble where everything is perfect, we live in the real world, where horrible things happen sometimes, but w
[normal]e learn how to handle them in the best way. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Role of HIH’s Education Department
[normal]6
[normal]. 
[normal]Achieving academic excellence and promoting civic responsibility at HIH schools requires properly trained staff 
[normal]who
[normal] can 
[normal]provide 
[normal]civic and 
[normal]pedagogical leadership, 
[normal]utilize 
[normal]HIH’s unique co-teaching model and can implement multicultural curricula which teach tolerance and civic responsibility.
[normal] 
[normal]To this end, HIH has created an Education Department
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]HIH teachers
[normal], both veteran and new,
[normal] 
[normal]receive 
[normal]special pedagogic training
[normal] 
[normal]so that they are able to 
[normal]work 
[normal]as equals 
[normal]with
[normal]in
[normal] the co-teaching model, 
[normal]learn to integrate
[normal] both the core and supplementary curricula i
[normal]nto their teaching, and 
[normal]are equipped to
[normal] manage
[normal] the issues of culture and difference that arise.  
[normal]This training 
[normal]involves both working closely with 
[normal]individual 
[normal]staff in particula
[normal]r
[normal] schools
[normal],
[normal] as well as
[normal] bringing the educational staff from all 
[normal]of 
[normal]HIH’s 
[normal]country-wide network of 
[normal]schools together for an intensive three-day conference 
[normal]in order 
[normal]to
[normal] share ideas, problem solve, and learn from each other’s experiences
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]S
[normal]ince HIH’s Jewish and Arab teachers are essentially civic leaders who are training the next generation, it is vital that the teaching staff from 
[normal]all
[normal] five HIH bilingual schools strategize together as to the best practices for achieving their goals.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]. 
[normal]In addition to training and supervising the educational staff, the Education Department 
[normal]develops the multicultural supplementary curricula used by HIH schools such as the Religious Cultural Heritage Curriculum which enables students from all three faiths o
[normal]f
[normal] 
[normal][object Object]
[normal] and 
[normal]a
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]H
[normal]istory 
[normal]C
[normal]urriculum that includes narratives of both populations
[normal]. 
[normal]The Education Department 
[normal]has also developed a 
[normal]Principals’ Forum
[normal], 
[normal]an institutional framework for bringing together 
[normal]principals, 
[normal]vice-principals 
[normal]and 
[normal]senior staff from all of 
[normal]the
[normal] bilingual schools to learn from each other, share 
[normal]problems 
[normal]and insights, and develop concepts and methodologies together in the field of bilingual
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]multicultural 
[normal]education. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Role of Community
[normal] Activities Program
[normal]8
[normal]. 
[normal]In order to widen its impact 
[normal]beyond the school setting
[normal], HIH is 
[normal]also designing and implementing community building events in the five locations in which it currently has schools. The 
[normal]goals of this Shared Communities Program are: to establish a wide range of Jewish-Arab community activities, from sports and culture to dialogue, study and responding to discriminatory events, and open the community activity to all who are interested.  In new locations the communities play a central role in helping open new schools. 
[normal]9
[normal]. 
[normal]As of March 2012 HIH had 3 bilingual schools in Jerusalem, Wadi Ara, and the Galilee. Thanks to three-year core funding from the United States gover
[normal]nment’s U.S. Agency for International Development and with matching funds, 
[normal]HIH
[normal] 
[normal]launched its
[normal] Shared Community Project
[normal]. The goal of this project is 
[normal]to establish community leadership and structures
[normal], and develop 
[normal]a range of 
[normal]vibrant 
[normal]community
[normal] 
[normal]activities (from sports, culture, family activities and excursions, to dialogue groups, language study, and responding to 
[normal]discriminatory
[normal] 
[normal]events)
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]hat will
[normal] create 
[normal]a civic infrastructure for social inclusion and civic equality 
[normal]beyond the wa
[normal]lls of the school
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal]. 
[normal]In March 2012 
[normal]HIH selected Jaffa and Haifa as its two new communities
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The Shared Community Project 
[normal]staff 
[normal]develop
[normal]ed
[normal] local leadership
[normal] and together 
[normal]they 
[normal]design
[normal]ed
[normal] activities to fit the needs and interests of the Jewish and Arab populations
[normal] in these communities
[normal]. Parents 
[normal]and children 
[normal]participated in cultural events, holiday celebrations, 
[normal]and community gardening
[normal]; 
[normal]adults 
[normal]enrolled in Arab and Hebrew language classes
[normal], pa
[normal]rticipated in dialogue sessions, and played on 
[normal]integrated 
[normal]basketball teams
[normal]. They got to know one another and formed friendships. As a result of these interactions, the Jaffa and Haifa communities strengthened the bonds between Jews and Arabs, enabling them
[normal] to cooperate and open a bilingual pre-kindergarten in each of their 
[normal]communities in September 2013 with an equal number of Jewish and Arab children
[normal] enrolled and with hundreds on waiting lists
[normal].
[normal]1
[normal]1
[normal]. 
[normal]The community organizers will continue to develop and run 
[normal]local activities
[normal] for the more veteran communities to insure strong parental involvement, a growing student body
[normal],
[normal] and joint Jewish and Arab communal life. They will 
[normal]help insure that the new bilingual schools in Jaffa and Haifa 
[normal]continue to grow with 
[normal]another 
[normal]grade each year, 
[normal]and will continue to develop and maintain relationships with the Municipality and the Ministry of Education.
[normal] They will also help start new communities and new schools.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Country-Wide 
[normal]Community 
[normal]Event
[normal]1
[normal]2
[normal]. 
[normal]Community 
[normal]o
[normal]rganizers are also responsible 
[normal]for 
[normal]organiz
[normal]ing
[normal] an annual event
[normal],
[normal] bringing together the Hand in Hand communities from all around the country.  
[normal]HIH
[normal] piloted a country-wide 
[normal]event 
[normal]around Ramadan 
[normal]for the first time in July 20
[normal]13 
[normal]and it was a huge success. HIH
[normal] expected 250 people
[normal], but 
[normal]closed registration with 650 
[normal]Arabs and Jews
[normal] 
[normal]com
[normal]ing from all over the country. 
[normal]The program included a public discussion with a Rabbi, a Sheikh and a Priest about the notion of fasting and forgiving in the three religions as well as musical performances. Bringing community leaders together for the planning of such an event empowers th
[normal]em as they realize that they are part of something much bigger than their own community. They are able 
[normal]to share stories of success and failure and learn from each other’s experiences. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Publicizing HIH’s Success
[normal]es
[normal]1
[normal]3
[normal]. 
[normal]While our bi
[normal]lingual schools and shared communities demonstrate that it is possible for Jews and Arabs to peacefully coexist, interact, and become friends, the experience of cooperation that we have demonstrated will have a limited impact if it remains known only to th
[normal]ose who have personally experienced it. Therefore, HIH has hired an 
[normal]Organizational Journalist
[normal] to join the team, and help publicize our story of an inclusive society to as wide an audience as possible
[normal] in Hebrew, English and Arabic
[normal].  HIH’s “doing” in the bil
[normal]ingual schools and in the shared communities will inform the telling
[normal], which will illustrate the viability of inclusion, shared society and equality.  
[normal]This will counter 
[normal]the 
[normal] feelings
[normal] of helplessness and despair that exists in no small part because of the media’s highlighting negative stories. Our stories 
[normal]that appear in radio segments, television reports, in the Israeli and international press, 
[normal]and on Facebook 
[normal]https://www.facebook.com/HandinHandil
[normal] 
[normal]provide a powerful message that a different reality is possible 
[normal]in 
[normal]Israel
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Vision for the Future
[normal]1
[normal]4
[normal]. 
[normal]Over the next ten years, Hand in Hand aims to create a network of 10-15 integrated bilingual schools, supported and enhanced by active communities, altogether involving 
[normal]some 
[normal]20,000 
[normal]Israeli citizens.  These visibly integrated shared communities wi
[normal]ll not only help HIH schools succeed and expand, but will also show the broader public that the experience of social inclusion and mutual respect is viable not only for students but also for all citizens.  
[normal]Israel 
[normal]can be a 
[normal]diverse
[normal] 
[normal]democratic s
[normal]tate where Jews and Arabs live together peacefully. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Request for Funding
[normal]1
[normal]5
[normal]. 
[normal]To accomplish its goals HIH must locate additional sources of funding. While it has submitted requests to the British Embassy, it has not been awarded funding
[normal] in recent years. HIH 
[normal]asks that a larger portion of 
[normal]UK government 
[normal]funds be granted to organizations like HIH which have succeeded 
[normal]through its bilingual, multicultural schools and 
[normal]community-oriented 
[normal]activities
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]bringing together Jews and Arabs on a daily 
[normal]basis, improving the relationships between them,
[normal] and developing trust and respect for one another.
[normal] 
[normal]In this way we will build a strong civil society in Israel
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]embodies
[normal] 
[normal]the values of inclusiveness and equality – values that were the foundation of the St
[normal]ate of Israel. As
