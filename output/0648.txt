[[[the Royal Meteorological Society (RMetS) ]]]

[[[(CLC028)]]]1. The Royal Meteorological Society is the professional and learned society for weather and climate. The Society serves not only those in academia and professional meteorologists, but also those whose work is affected in some way or other by the weather or climate, or simply have a general interest in the weather. The membership includes scientists, practitioners and a broad range of weather enthusiasts. 2. We administer the national vocational qualifications of the profession and under our Royal Charter pursue our purpose of the advancement of meteorological science.&#xa0; As meteorological science has developed it has come to include not just the science of weather and climate itself, but the application of this to disciplines such as agriculture, aviation, hydrology, marine transport and oceanography, as well as the impacts of climate change and the interaction between the atmosphere and the oceans. 3. The Society was established on 3 April 1850 as 'The British Meteorological Society', and was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1866, when its name was changed to "The Meteorological Society".&#xa0; The privilege of adding 'Royal' to the title was granted by Her Majesty Queen Victoria in 1883.&#xa0;

[[[What is the current state of public understanding of what is meant by climate change? How has this changed in recent years?]]]5. Public understanding of climate change and how these perceptions have changed have been in the subject of a number of studies in recent years. A series of polling results from 2005 to 2011 consistently find that more than three quarters of the UK population think that the climate is changing and that there is at least in part a human cause (Shuckburgh et al, 2012). These polling results also show that there has been a decrease in concern about climate change over this time period, with a drop from more than three quarters of the population agreeing that they were at least fairly concerned in 2005 to just less than two thirds of the population in 2011. &#xa0;              6. Pidgeon and Fischhoff (2011) found that over more than a decade of public polling in the US the majority of those asked believed climate change was occurring. Percentages ranged from 48% in 1998 to a peak of 65% in 2006 but then a relative decline to 52% was seen in 2010. Those 'unsure' in 2010 (36%) rose to near the peak level recorded in 1998 (39%) along with a rise of those who believed climate change was not occurring peaking at 10% in 2010 (up from 3% in 2006). 7. Therefore there is evidence to suggest that, while the majority of the public believes climate change is happening, in recent years the size of that majority has dropped. There is less certainty around the causes of climate change and its potential impacts.

[[[Which voices are trusted in public discourse on climate science and policy? What role should Government Departments, scientific advisers to Government and publicly funded scientists have in communicating climate science?]]]8. Shuckburgh et al. 2012 presented polling results from 2006 to 2011 concerning which groups the public trust to give correct information on climate change. There has been a decrease in trust in all groups over this time period, but “independent scientists” have consistently been scored as the most trusted group with 68% agreeing they could be trusted in 2006 and 51% agreeing in 2011. “Government scientists” were trusted by 21% in 2006 and just 13% in 2011, whereas “The government” was trusted by 14% in 2006 and 10% in 2011.9. Shuckburgh et al., 2012 indicated that 2011 views on whether climate scientists could be trusted were split. Over one-third of the UK public agreed that they could trust climate scientists to tell the truth about climate change and slightly less (about one-third) disagreed. 10. It is evident that there is potential for climate scientists to continue to build on this trust. The RMetS is actively engaged in a number of initiatives to help support this.11. Professor Tim Palmer FRS (and RMetS President 2010-2012) states: "The enormous interest in climate change does not, of course, arise from any inherent fascination in the science of the problem. Rather, interest stems from the perceived way that climate change will affect society.&#xa0; Some people worry about the impact on their freedom and prosperity, of policies that aim to reduce our carbon footprint. Others worry that without policy to curb emissions, the freedom and prosperity of future generations will be impacted even more. As a scientist I try to separate these from the science issues, especially when speaking in public. I believe that the public’s confidence in climate science and climate scientists may increase if it is felt that the scientists can take a mostly disinterested view on climate policy. From such a disinterested scientific perspective, the threat of substantial, even calamitous, climate change is unequivocal. However, at the same time, I myself do not believe we are yet doing all that is scientifically and technically possible to really understand and quantify the nature of this threat." (http://www.rmets.org/weather-and-climate/climate/climate-change-simulation-tim-palmer)12. Government needs to have a unified and well articulated view on climate change both internally and externally. It needs to be based upon robust independent scientific evidence. 

[[[How could public understanding of what is meant by climate change be improved? What are the main barriers to this? Does the media have a positive role to play?]]]13. The public understanding of climate change is significantly affected by the media, both positively and negatively. Much of the RMetS’s work with newspapers, radio and television, as well as handling public enquiries, relates to clarifying misunderstandings and misreporting by the media. Climate change is no exception. Effective communication to the public of climate science by the government and by professional organisations like RMetS is essential. Certainly the media have a positive role to play.14. The main route to enhancing public understanding must be through improved treatment of it in schools through the National Curriculum. In its submission to the Department for Education's consultation on reforming the English National Curriculum for Key Stages 1-3 (ages 5-14) the RMetS welcomed the increased focus on physical geography, including weather and climate. However, the Society argued strongly for the retention of climate change in the Geography curriculum, as well as some improvements to the coverage of weather and climate. It also argued for the introduction of basic physics relevant to climate change into the Science curriculum at KS3. The Society considers that the potential environmental, social and economic ramifications of climate change should be discussed in the core curriculum by all children and not left as options to be taken at a later stage. This will allow the next generation to make informed decisions about their future. 

[[[How important is public understanding in developing effective climate change policy? ]]]15. Public understanding of climate change is fundamentally important. Public support for funding decisions and policy priorities based around climate change can only be achieved by effective communication of the reasons behind those decisions. Individual actions by members of the public, either voluntarily or as a result of policy initiatives, can only work effectively if members of the public acknowledge the value of changing their behaviour to help climate change policies succeed. 16. Research conducted on behalf of the RMetS in 2009 highlighted that 100% of the general public surveyed on weather and climate matters were either ‘interested’ or ‘very interested’ in a "plain English explanation&#xa0; of the causes and effects of climate change".

[[[What evidence is there that public attitude to climate science affects their engagement with energy policies or initiatives?]]]17. The study by Shuckburgh et al 2012 found that: “Measures of public interest, engagement and trust associated with climate science are positively correlated, while the belief that climate change is exaggerated is negatively correlated, with concern about climate change and willingness to change behavior.” However, whether this means that public attitude to climate science affects their engagement with policies or initiative, or the other way around, could not be determined from the data.18. Researchers who study public atti&#xad;tudes to sci&#xad;ence used to think that providing more facts and fig&#xad;ures – increasing know&#xad;ledge – was the way to improve public engage&#xad;ment with sci&#xad;entific issues. This approach is known as the ‘deficit model’ of sci&#xad;ence com&#xad;mu&#xad;nic&#xad;a&#xad;tion – it was assumed that oppos&#xad;i&#xad;tion to a par&#xad;tic&#xad;ular sci&#xad;entific devel&#xad;op&#xad;ment was based on a deficit of know&#xad;ledge. However, it soon became clear that public engagement was more complex than this and requires a two-way dialogue. 

[[[Does the Government have sufficient expertise in social and behavioural sciences to understand the relationship between public understanding of climate science and the feasibility of relevant public policies?]]]19. The Society would welcome an increased representation in Parliament and in the civil service of those with a background in science.
