However, this is not enough. The local DPH should be a member of the Board of each CCG. There should be a qualified public health professional on the NHS Commissioning Board; and the Board should routinely take advice from qualified public health professionals when commissioning decisions are being taken.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“SCHEDULE 5\n \nIndividuals disqualified from membership of CCG governing bodies\n \n(2) The services and facilities mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) do not include services commissioned by the CCG in the exercise of its commissioning functions. \n(3) In this paragraph, the “commissioning functions” of a CCG are the functions of the group in arranging for the provision of services as part of the health service.” \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nInformation Governance&#xa0;\nPolicy development&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n BMA’s written evidence to the Health Select Committee, October 2011 \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmhealth/1048/1048we16.htm\n Code of Conduct: Public Health England - \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-conduct-public-health-england\n BMA members who work for PHE have expressed their concern that working for a civil service body has a significant impact on their ability to do their work. One doctor said that the regulations imposed by the civil service will “\nslowly strangle PHE to death\n.”\n \nThe doctor gave as an example the way in which cancer screening reports that are normally sent out after a quality assurance visit are regulated by having all of the commentary removed. The reports are then placed on the civil service publications list (the Gateway) which can cause significant delays and extra work. The doctor felt that this process could result in these reports becoming simply a box-ticking exercise.\n The 2003 Medical Dental Consultant Contract, 2003, p25 - \nhttp://www.nhsemployers.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/Consultant_Contract_V9_Revised_Terms_and_Conditions_300813_bt.pdf\n NHS Health Check implementation review and action plan, July 2013 - \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/224805/NHS_Health_Check_implementation_review_and_action_plan.pdf\n \n PHE \nConsultation Paper: \nLeading Local Health Protection Teams\n \nhttp://bma.org.uk/practical-support-at-work/contracts/academics-contracts/follett-review-principles\n \n \nThis will be sent out to all UK based public health consultants (both medics and non-medics) in November 2013\n \nThe BMA submitted its Freedom of Information request in October 2013 and are currently analysing the results of the responses that were received.
