[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Make it easier for young people to find out about and enrol for Apprenticeships, particularly by develo
[normal]ping a central admissions portal (as with UCAS).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Make it easier for small businesses to take on Apprentices. In the cultural and creative industries, by way of example, 90% of businesses have fewer than ten staff, which makes hiring an Apprentice an 
[normal]extreme challenge. As small businesses are often major potential employers in deprived areas such as Newham, this is particularly vital for improving the performance of working class learners.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Improve the assessment of Apprenticeships’ value, specifically
[normal] by developing a metric similar to that showing the percentage of students attending Russell Group universities or achieving top A level grades.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cease the publication of 
[normal]EBac
[normal] statistics with immediate effect, and avoid further policies which denigrate the
[normal] role of vocational learning.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]e)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Explore, and fund, particular programmes which have been valuable in improving the performance of white working-class boys specifically. We would be glad to provide data on which courses this might include in our own borough.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]f)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Incentivise the best teachers to work in the most challenging schools. The proposals in the Committee’s 2012 report on teacher quality – particularly those around career structure and performance-related pay – deserve more attention by Government, as the
[normal]y have been proven to work abroad.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]g)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Relatedly
[normal], continue to learn from countries such as Singapore and the US which have developed interesting schemes on teacher recruitment and on improving performance amongst poorer learners.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]h)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Consider the scope for ‘fami
[normal]ly education programmes’, which could encourage white working-class parents to learn alongside their children in a variety of ways. As many young people resent learning because their parents did, and do not have family support when it comes to furthering t
[normal]heir skills and knowledge, a new policy initiative along these lines could have significant value – and Newham (particular the areas such as Canning Town heavy in white working-class families) could provide a very interesting area for a pilot study.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Withi
[normal]n schools and colleges, encourage teachers to develop mechanisms for dispersing the learning efforts of high-performing groups (such as Chinese girls) to weaker groups (such as white working-class boys), and to finding other ways (such as functional method
[normal]ologies for teaching literacy and numeracy) of making core learning engaging to poorer students.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]j)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Better disseminate good practice: it is difficult to find, online, serious case studies of tackling working-class white underperformance, although Ofsted and 
[normal]others have some useful data and publications.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]k)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Improve careers guidance services, and reverse a number of the changes made by the current administration (we would be happy to provide details on which), as these are particularly valuable for poorer student
[normal]s who, for example, might not have easy internet access at home.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We hope these recommendations are of some interest to the Committee as it pursues this interesting and important line of inquiry. As a leading college in this and other arenas, we would be d[bold]elighted to contribute further to the inquiry,[bold] including by providing oral evidence. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]September 2013
