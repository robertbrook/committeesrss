[normal] or University of Manchester. Our research activity that has contributed to this submission has predominantly been funded by the EPSRC and National Grid. No other interests are declared.
[normal]The Tyndall Centre at University of Manchester has conducted a number of research projects both directly and indirectly relevant to this inquiry. 
[normal]This submission presents an overview of research on three topics, namely; i) public responses to CCS technology
[normal], and
[normal] ii) 
[normal]the performance of 
[normal]CCS
[normal] in relation to emissions budgets
[normal]. Our conclusions drawn from these research areas are structured according to th
[normal]e questions specified in the terms of the inquiry rather than by topic.
[normal]What are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they b
[normal]e overcome?
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What are the consequences of failing to develop CCS and what alternatives are available for decarbonisation if CCS fails?
