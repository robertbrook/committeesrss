defaultThe Tyndall Centre at University of Manchester has conducted a number of research projects both directly and indirectly relevant to this inquiry. 
defaultThis submission presents an overview of research on three topics, namely; i) public responses to CCS technology
default, and
default ii) 
defaultthe performance of 
defaultCCS
default in relation to emissions budgets
default. Our conclusions drawn from these research areas are structured according to th
defaulte questions specified in the terms of the inquiry rather than by topic.
defaultWhat are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they b
defaulte overcome?
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the consequences of failing to develop CCS and what alternatives are available for decarbonisation if CCS fails?
