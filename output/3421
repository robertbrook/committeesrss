defaultClause 35 -Repeal of President of Tribunals report - Draft Deregulation Bill
default&#xa0;
defaultIt would be completely inappropriate to remove a requirement to be transparent and externally accountable about DWP tribunal decisions at the point when a new benefits system is being transitioned in.  It would be seen as a cynical attempt to avoid scrutiny and suppress public information about difficulties inherent in the new system.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe level of appeals which have taken place since the WCA's introduction indicate there are serious flaws in the system.  We understood David Cameron had pledged this would be an open government and urge that publication of results from tribunals is of fundamental importance.
default&#xa0;
defaultPresumably this information could be obtained through a freedom of information request, but in the interest of double loop learning - understanding and improving services - the Campaign for a Fair Society urges this clause to be deleted from the Bill.
