default              
default Since 1945, the UK-US relationship has been a relative constant amidst a world in flux. It is a relationship that is overly scrutinized, misunderstood and all too often under appreciated. Like most relationships, it is at its best when it is being enjoyed and suffers most when over-analysed. The relationship has routinely been dismissed as a sop to British pride; been declared dead and irrelevant; and even described as a danger to UK interests. Despite this, it has endured and thrived. In keeping with the remit of the Call for Papers, this submission finds:

default              
defaultThat the UK Government would be ill advised to overact to any suggested ‘pivot to Asia’ by the United States.default Such an effort has been attempted previously and failed to develop as anticipated. Evidence suggests that such a pattern is being repeated with a distinct lessening of a Pacific Focus in President Obama’s second term. As his time in office draws to a close, it will continue to be of reduced significance
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
default 
defaultThat the UK Government should continue efforts to strengthen, not weaken, the vital intelligence links between our two nations, despite recent press revelationsdefault. The relationship between our two nations is based on tangible and intangible elements. One of the most misunderstood, yet essential and sensitive elements is within the intelligence community. At a time when attention is being paid to this aspect of the relationship, the two nations should seek to enhance our mutually beneficial dealings in this vital area of national interest and national security.

default2.1
default              
defaultThe Prime Minster has made a clear attempt to re-calibrate the UK-US relationship during his tenure in office. This came about as a reaction to the events that preceded the general election of 2010. There was a sense that Tony Blair was too willing to acquiesce to US requests without extracting tangible benefits for the UK. Gordon Brown appeared eager to go out of his way to cool relations with the outgoing Bush administration and far too eager curry favour with the incoming Obama White House, leading to a series of high-profile incidents.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultUpon taking office, the Prime Minster, as head of the Coalition Government, has taken a productive and sensible approach in regard to US-UK relations, seeking neither to be too close nor too distant from the American President. This balance has restored a degree of equilibrium to the relationship that was missing for many years. It has helped contribute to a number of high profile visits on both sides of the Atlantic, to the White House and to Downing Street, which have set the tone for relations in the current era.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultHyperbole surrounds and distorts considerations of the US-UK relationship. All too often it is viewed as a zero-sum game; when it is suggested that the US may be reconsidering its strategic outlook, it is viewed as a slight on its dealings with the UK. Several aspects are vital to consider, however. Firstly, US interests in Western Europe have altered dramatically following the end of the Cold War. Almost a quarter of a century after that ‘long twilight struggle’ came to an end it is unsurprising that the US may reconsider its strategic focus for the coming decades. This need not result in a reduced role for the UK in any future relationship with the United States, which will always remain an Atlantic power. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultSecondly, Europe often forgets that the United States is a Pacific Power. Its trade and security dealings with the Pacific Rim nations and beyond into central Asia are of vast importance to its economy and national well-being. 
defaultIt is easy to highlight the changes in emphasis that have accompanied this administration as Obama has more than hinted at a pivot to the Pacific. Obama's Pacific pivot appears all the more challenging to European sensibilities due to his personal narrative. The president’s roots in Hawaii and Kenya suggest a non-European focus that may be over emphasized, but which appears to coincide with historical trends away from an emphasis on Europe. Yet it is reinforced by his actions and statements. Witness his visit to Australia, his reinforcement of basses in the Pacific and recognition of the potential threat from China. Clearly, this is no longer the post-Cold War era of the 1990s. 
defaultWith key strategic assets spread across the Pacific, it is unsurprising that the US is giving thought to protecting its interests in the area in light of shifting regional power bases. Such an effort is not new, however. The UK should recognise this and respond accordingly. 
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default              
defaultIn the early 1990s Bill Clinton made a similar entreaty to Asia, a move compounded by a perceived slighting he received whilst a student at Oxford, that caused some to suggest an end to the Special Relationship and a shift from an Atlantic to a Pacific focus for U.S foreign policy in the last decade of the 20th century. President Clinton did not visit Europe in his first year in office and clearly sought a new relationship with the Pacific region. 
default2.6
default              
defaultThe Clinton administration initially focused particularly on China, and briefly dallied with making continued Most Favoured Nation Trading Status dependent upon changes to its human rights laws. What the Clinton administration discovered was that the region was not as welcoming to America overtures as he would have wished and all too soon his administration was forced to revert to first principles and embrace a Europe-first mentality. 
default&#xa0;
default2.7. 
default              
defaultWhilst the Pacific was an area of vital importance to the Clinton administration it make to realise that the timescales required to exact real and substantive change in the region would exceed its constitutionally mandated time in office. The need to show results in a tight electoral timeframe severely limits any American administration and this became apparent in the 1990s as the White House became increasingly involved in European initiatives where its influence was far more apparent. 
default&#xa0;
default2.8
default              
defaultSuch a shift is evident in the Obama administration. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who spent a great amount of time in the region, uttered the expression ‘Pacific Pivot’. Her second term successor, John Kerry, has a far more of European outlook and pointedly made his first trip overseas to London and the capitals of Europe, in sharp contrast to his successor. This has been noted in the Pacific.
default&#xa0;
default2.9
default              
defaultOn January 18, 2013, Leon Panetta delivered his final public remarks as outgoing U.S. Defence Secretary in a speech at King’s College, London. Panetta spoke warmly of the transatlantic relationship and of the many benefits it brought to both the United States and Great Britain. “
defaultThe United States and the United Kingdom are nations forever bound by a common history, common values, and common interests.
default&#xa0;
default These are the enduring bonds that guide our very special relationship and guide the broader transatlantic security project between Europe and North America.”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.10
default              
defaultOf most interest, however, was Panetta’s strong assurance in regard to the future direction of the transatlantic alliance. Despite the repeated references to a new Pacific focus for US foreign policy that have dominated the media, the out-going Defence Secretary sought to actively stress that “
defaultthose concerns should be put to rest,” insisting that “Global security is not a zero-sum game, but neither are the security commitments of the United States.” Rather than focusing on a pivot away from Europe, Panetta stressed the ties that bound Europe to Asia and called for a unified stance in that region. As he reminded his audience, the European Union is China's largest trading partner, ASEAN's second-largest trading partner, and ranks third and fourth with Japan and South Korea. With US defence cuts taking hold, Panetta urged 
defaultEurope to “join the United States in increasing and deepening our defence engagement with the Asia-Pacific region.”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.11
default              
defaultBy focusing upon an effort to engage in the Pacific region, Europe risks exaggerating the importance of a move that is already receding in importance to many in the Obama White House, an administration that is itself due to leave office in 3 short years. 
default&#xa0;
default2.12
default              
defaultLittle in the Obama administration’s actions, personnel hires or stated politics indicate that the Pacific will be prioritised in the second term, beyond those initiatives that were announced prior to the re-election campaign.

defaultAn Intelligence-led Relationship
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultDuring President Obama's state visit to Britain in May 2011, the White House and Downing Street jointly announced the establishment of a Joint Strategy Board to consider matters of long-term security, the threats posed by terrorism and rogue states. The White House said the new body presented the opportunity for the United Kingdom and the United States to work more closely together, to share intelligence and analysis, and address long-term security challenges rather than just immediate concerns. It also presented an opportunity to redress imbalances that had arisen in the past.
default  
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThe Joint Strategy Board promised to provide tangible evidence of the benefit derived from a relationship with the United States. At the time, the Government implied that the development marked a significant step: "The US and UK already work closely together on many national security issues. The new board will allow us to look ahead and develop a shared view of emerging challenges, how we should deal with them, and how our current policy can adapt to longer-term developments."
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultPresident Obama’s Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes noted: "There is no closer ally for the U.S. in the world than the U.K. We are in absolute alignment with the British on a range of core international security interests and, of course, our deeply shared set of values that have tied us together for many decades." The creation of the Joint Strategy Board appeared to be a manifestation of this. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultThe Board was expected to help enable a more guided, coordinated approach to analyse the “over the horizon” challenges we may face in the future and also how today’s challenges are likely to shape our future choices. It is designed to better integrate long-term thinking and planning into the day-to-day work of our governments and our bilateral relationship, as we contemplate how significant evolutions in the global economic and security environment will require shifts in our shared strategic approach.
default&#xa0;default3.5
default              
defaultIt was anticipated that the Joint Strategy Board would meet quarterly at locations that would alternate between the United States and United Kingdom. The long-term fate of the Board was to be decided by the US and UK National Security Advisors who would review its status after one year and decide whether to renew its mandate.
default That time has now elapsed. The Parliamentary National Security Strategy Committee has raised questions as to the status of the Board and received rudimentary responses. The extent to which the Joint Strategy Board has provided any tangible benefits is yet to be seen. The Board only met once in 2011 and there has been an agreement not to disclose the precise topics discussed at meetings.
default&#xa0;default3.6
default              
defaultThe status of the relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States is indeed in a unique position. For all of the attempts to define the relationship in recent years, as Special, Unique or Essential, the relationship is quintessentially unexamined in an official capacity within the Foreign and Commonwealth office. Unlike other nations that have dedicated analysts to consider the rudimentary aspect of the UK’s ongoing relationship across a range of issues, there is no full time dedicated experts considering the future direction of US global policy working in Whitehall. 
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultThis point has been lamented by the former Ambassador to Washington, Sir Christopher Meyer; “I sought regularly and in vain to get the Foreign Office to…draw the conclusion that if it was right to train cadres of specialists in the EU, the Middle East, Russia and China, as we do, then it was also right to create an American cadre, which we do not.”
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default              
defaultWith over 400 employees currently working in the UK embassy in Washington, it could be rightly asked why more analysts are required in Whitehall. However, those posted to Washington are not necessarily experts on U.S. policy and what is needed in Whitehall is nothing above and beyond the attention that is focused upon other nations, with whom the UK has far less interest.
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default              
defaultThere is a troubling tradition of assumption making in regard to the actions of the United States. Our shared language and related heritage makes for rushed assumptions in relation to intent and motivation. This is not a new phenomena; it was noted in an article by Boys and Keating in 2009 and by Professor Rob Singh in 2001.
default There is a fundamental problem that needs to be addressed regarding a misguided sense of familiarity with regard to American politics and its culture. This inadvertently causes a sense of dependency and reliance that is partially true but which is exaggerated to the detriment of both parties. As Meyer noted, “Think of American as Britain writ large and you risk coming to grief.”
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.10
default              
defaultIt blinds the UK to policy flaws that could be potentially detrimental to the national interest and has on occasion bound us to policy initiatives that have been harmful. There is simply not enough strategic, horizon-scanning analysis being conducted on the future direction of US foreign policy and the its potential implications for the United Kingdom.
default&#xa0;
default3.11
default              
defaultThe Joint Strategy Board could have been a solution to this but it does not appear to be addressing the challenges it was established to solve. As with the National Security Council, the JSB appears to be spending too much of its precious time addressing short-term issues rather than considering the far-reaching potential of a UK-U.S. alliance. 
default&#xa0;
default3.12
default              
defaultThe Joint Strategy Board as originally envisaged and advocated by the United Kingdom, would have been a transatlantic security council that enabled a dynamic flow of ideas and data in both directions across the Atlantic between London and Washington. The watered-down JSB is still a benefit to the United Kingdom but it is not the great asset that it could and indeed should have been. Judging its success is made all the more difficult by the decision not to reveal the topics under discussion or the minutes of meetings. The unnecessarily secretive nature of the Joint Strategy Board hinders any assessment of its relative standing or its impact on policy or processes. 
default&#xa0;
default3.13
default              
defaultWhilst the aspirations inherent in the Joint Strategy Board are to be applauded, it appears in retrospect that it was a case of appearance over substance. The sentiment behind the Joint Strategy Board was viable and distinct and would have provided a tangible foundation for a relationship that is often in need of definition and direction. 
default&#xa0;
default3.14
default              
defaultThe successful implementation of a Joint Strategy Board could be a bold assertion of intent and a commitment to a relationship at a time of increased speculation regarding the direction of U.S. foreign policy interests in the coming years and amidst talk of a Pacific Rim focus in the future. It is in both nation’s interests to see the Joint Strategy Board thrive and succeed and to be continued beyond its initial twelve month mandate.    
default&#xa0;
default3.15
default              
defaultThis report recommends an emphatic rededication to the concept behind the Joint Strategy Board, of continued and close working ties at the highest levels of government between the United Kingdom and the United States. The Joint Strategy Board is a logical and tangible development, whose mandate should be continued, whose status should be enhanced and whose remit should be clarified. It has the potential to be a source of great significance both structurally and symbolically and its demise into lethargy would be a sad loss and a missed opportunity.

defaultSusman
default highlighted the many areas of joint US-UK cooperation, that included intelligence sharing in relation to the Olympics, joint missions in Afghanistan, a united front in relation to Iran and on a personal basis, the warmth between the two families. Indeed, 
defaultSusman
default, who was a major contributor to the Obama campaign in 2008 and received his just reward, highlighted the relationship between the two men. “He has a very special relationship, as he calls it an essential relationship, with the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Cameron,” he said. 
default&#xa0;
default3.17
default              
defaultThe glowing reception on the White House lawn gave an insight to the bonds that the two nations share. Two hundred years ago, the British burnt the White House. Today the British Prime Minster visits as an honoured and valued guest. This journey demonstrates the Transatlantic relationship, be it special, unique or essential, is in all our best interest.

defaultThat the UK Government not overact to any suggested ‘pivot to Asia’ by the United States.default 
defaultSuch an effort has been attempted previously and failed. Evidence suggests that this pattern is being repeated with a distinct lessening of a Pacific Focus in Obama’s second term. As his time in office draws to a close, it will continue to be of reduced significance. Secretary Kerry and his second term cabinet colleagues are far more European in focus and by instinct as well as necessity, are focusing upon issues in the Middle East, rather than the Pacific Region. It will by Syria, not the Pacific that dominates the remainder of Obama’s time in office.
default&#xa0;
default4.2. 
default              
defaultThat the UK Government should continue efforts to strengthen, not weaken, the vital intelligence links between our two nations, despite recent press revelationsdefault. 
defaultThe US-UK relationship is based on tangible and intangible elements. At a time when undue attention is being paid to this aspect of the relationship, the two nations should seek to enhance our mutually beneficial dealings in this vital are of national interest and national security. A logical way to do this would be to enhance and capitalise upon an initiative that was inaugurated but seemingly not formalised sufficiently. The Joint Strategy Board is an ideal way to formalise a previous ad-hoc approach to intelligence sharing between our two nations.
