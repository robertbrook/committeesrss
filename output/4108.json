"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from Imtech GH Ltd (BRC 70)&#xa0;\nSince the introduction of Part P of the Building Regulations the industry has made great inroads in raising \nawareness of the requirements. This has helped to increase the standard for electrical installation work within dwellings. \n&#xa0;\nUnfortunately the enforcement bodies have not played their part in educating the homeowner as to the requirements and making it more\n difficult for the DIYâ€™ers and suchlike to operate. The scheme needs to be fully backed and promoted by \nthe \nenforcement \nbodie\ns and the industry.\n The current situation with different schemes and registers causes confusion and if anything may encourage poten\ntially rogue contractors to look bona fide.\n&#xa0;\nIn my view it is essential that the requirements of Part P are bought into the public domain and encouraged. They should also be publicised around the stockists of electrical installation materials so people und\nerstand their own limitations in this respect and the risk they take by breaching the requirements.\n&#xa0;\nAs a business we test many hundreds of domestic installations annually and the \nissues we find during these inspections are quite \nfrightening. The majority \nof these have been installed by the householder or a person claiming to be an electrician when they are clearly not competent for such works. This highlights the importance of having a scheme where all members are assessed to ensure they are and remain to \nbe competent.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
