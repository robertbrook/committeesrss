"Summary&#xa0;a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince the 1990s there has been a drift away from providing routine diabetes care within the hospital sector. This has been driven by a number of changes, most significantly the willingness of specialist diabetes teams to work outside the hospital setting. More recently, diabetes figured significantly in the QOF payment incentives. This, more than anything, persuaded primary care that they should manage diabetes in-house to ensure that their income was maximised. The Payment by Results system put a tariff on all referrals to specialist care which has also limited the flow of patients to the hospital sector. Unfortunately these changes have come about due to financial incentives and penalties, but any financial gains have not been ploughed back into diabetes care. The bill for diabetes care continues to grow, but this is largely made up of increases in the medicines budget with increases in the medical and social costs due to disability\n.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe end result has been that the percentage of patients seen in the hospital sector is already limited. This would probably range from a figure of 10-30% of patients being seen in a hospital setting, although that figure will vary according to local arrangements, and will usually be at the lower end of that range. People with diabetes now tend to be referred later in their disease process at which point they already have diabetes complications which may not be amenable to treatment at that stage\n.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is argued, therefore, that the UK has a practice nurse delivered diabetes system. With a few notable exceptions, it is the practice nurses who will deliver routine diabetes care. There are many reasons why this is inappropriate. However, the main problem is that although the practices nurses are well motivated and dedicated, they do not have the appropriate training for this role given the various other calls upon their time and generally work in isolation.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo allow diabetes care to be adequately delivered in primary care there will need to be a considerable expansion in staffing in that sector to allow for adequate care planning for the 5-6% of patients within the population who have diabetes. At the same time there is a requirement to design and commission an interface between the specialist team and primary care to allow the 2 \nsectors to work together. Diabetes specialist teams remain keen to work across the interface but the hardening of the organisational and financial barriers in the modern NHS make this increasingly difficult.\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe NHS is not optimally structured to treat patients with multiple morbidities in the community. Notionally, this would be the role of the GP, but the concept is now outdated due to increasing complexity of treatment and the increasingly pressurised role of primary care.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt its simplest, the healthcare system can be divided into primary care, secondary care and social services. In recent years, the concept of multiple providers has fragmented this system further by introducing new organisations which duplicate activity rather than innovate. Communication between organisations is poor and budgetary allocations harden divisions.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo be able to manage complex conditions in the community, there needs to be a team of healthcare professionals who can work within a common organisation which bridges all of the current functions. This team would include a senior doctor. In the context of diabetes, this would be a Consultant in diabetes given that the specialty remains wedded to the concept of general medicine rather than single organ systems. Patients with diabetes commonly have multiple morbidities, most commonly \nischaemic\n heart disease, heart failure, kidney failure, peripheral vascular disease, advanced eye disease and amputation. As a result of these co-morbidities, they are often poorly mobile with high social care needs. The wider team therefore needs connections with social services and the therapies on the one hand, but as this patient group is extremely vulnerable medically, there also needs to be a bridge with the acute hospital to organise complex investigations and to provide in-reach in the event that the patient is transported to hospital.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIdeally this team would operate within the same organisation, with shared management, a single budget and shared IT systems. Alternatively it would need to be set up as a virtual organisation with cooperation between the different providers.\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Association of British Clinical \nDiabetologists\n (ABCD) , as the national association representing Consultants in diabetes within the UK, has had input into a variety of documents to guide those who commission services for people with diabetes\n.\n The major message has been integration of care. Patients with diabetes require access to multiple services at different times in their lives, ranging from a diabetes pregnancy clinic to a wheelchair service to social services. The advice provided outlines practical steps to integration of care. \n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile GPs may remain as generalists, specialist care is increasingly organ or system specific. The practical result of this is that an individual with multiple morbidities, using their GP as a central point of referral, is sent to multiple appointments and locations and back to their GP with little communication between each of the services. The care pathway therefore resembles a cricket batsmanâ€™s stroke pattern rather than a smooth continuum. While Consultants in diabetes maintain one of the few specialties with an ongoing commitment to \ngeneralism\n rather than a single organ system, their work pattern is constrained by the current geography of the healthcare system.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFrom the perspective of an individual with diabetes, the care pathway must be made simpler\n.\n They wish to be referred to a single point of reference where all of their various problems can be managed. The NHS is currently not set up to do this. The system needs to be changed towards a model of integrated care organisations with a team which operates freely between primary care, social services and secondary care\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExamples of integration of care within diabetes extend only to limited integration of medical services. There have, for example, been social enterprises set up between primary and secondary care to manage diabetes. In other examples, secondary care teams have gained the contract for community care of diabetes by forming separate companies outside the acute Trust. Such examples do not extend to true integration of care as an integrated care organisation.\nCurrent examples of integration of care include :\nMay 2013\n \nHex et al Estimating the current and future costs of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the UK.
