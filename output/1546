[normal]This evidence is submitted in my capacity as Chair of Lostwithiel Transport Users Group, a group affiliated to the Lostwithiel Town 
[normal]Forum and with aims supported by Lostwithiel Town Council.
[normal] I am grateful for the chance to provide evidence that derives from personal experience and from discussions with local residents in the Transport Users Group. Evidence is cited from Lostwithiel and
[normal] the Great Western region, but the points made are generally applicable to communities across the country.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.[bold] The first point to note is that few communities are ‘isolated’ 
[normal]per se
[normal]. It is the lack of transport that isolates a community. 
[normal]‘Isolation’ is a 
[normal]co
[normal]nsequence
[normal] of transport policy. 
[normal]Transport provision must therefore be assessed in relation to the character and needs of a community and not simply in relation to its geographical position.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold] We do not feel that existing public transport provision is cons
[normal]idered in relation to the needs of different groups of (potential) passengers. While train and bus operators do consider, for example, the accessibility needs of disabled and elderly users, they do not consider the actual transport needs. Thus, transport p
[normal]olicy has to consider the different requirements of such groups.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold] The transport needs of sub
[normal]groups within a community are quite diverse. Working people with families require transport at peak work and school times, retired people require transport at ti
[normal]mes more appropriate for shopping and leisure. This means that transport provided only at peak times fails to make any provision for the non-working population.
[normal] The paradox is that it is the non-working population (especially the elderly) that are most dependent on public transport. Working families are generally car-owning families and have an alternative to public transport. Elderly people are less likely to dr
[normal]ive, yet transport is generally supplied at times suited to the car-driving population.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold] Each community has a distinct demographic profile and its isolation can depend on this as much as it does on the availability of a transport link. A community with 
[normal]a high proportion of elderly people (typical of many small towns and villages) will be more isolated than a commuter town if transport is not provided at appropriate times. Transport policy must consider the profile of a community.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.[bold] Rail providers often
[normal] claim that potential passengers can drive to nearby stations with a better service. An example is Lostwithiel, which has few stopping trains, where passengers are referred to Par (the online timetables provide connections through Par). However, there is i
[normal]nsufficient parking at Par. These kind
[normal]s
[normal] of arrangements work only if adequate parking is provided. However, those without cars are completely unable to take up such opportunities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.[bold] Some communities in tourist areas are particularly dependent on visitors
[normal]. The needs of visitors are quite distinct from those of residents, but are equally important to consider. If transport to a community is not provided from major centres, there will be fewer visitors and a loss of trade to local businesses. This can be exa
[normal]mpled from our local rail provider (First Great Western), though I have no reason to think that it is in anyway distinct in this respect. 
[normal]The company provides some summer alterations in services to better serve large resorts. However, this is often at the 
[normal]expense of regular services used by residents and trains do not make additional stops at smaller centres.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.[bold] The franchise proposals for the Great Western region take no account of the points raised above. An opportunity has been lost to improve transport
[normal] provision. It is proposed to reduce the number of through services from London to Penzance, terminating trains in Devon and providing ‘sprinter connections’ for the remainder of the journey. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](a) This fails to recognise the specific needs of visitors to 
[normal]Cornwall (who arrive in considerable numbers throughout the year, and not only in summer). Tourists travel with families and large amounts of luggage, which can be accommodated on the inter city 125 trains. The 2-car sprinter trains, however, have very lit
[normal]tle luggage space, and their seating capacity is insufficient to meet the demands of 400 or more passengers in addition to the existing local users.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b) The 2-car sprinters are already overcrowded with local users and these local users could be squeezed o
[normal]ut by large numbers of visitors gaining seats before local users are able to board at local stations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These issues could easily be resolved by continuing to run through services on appropriate trains.
[normal] If the franchise proposals are carried through, the wh
[normal]ole of Cornwall becomes an ‘isolated community’. This is a retrograde step. (Electrification of the West Country service provides no relief to Cornwall as the electrification is limited to the London to Bristol section of the line into Wales. There are no 
[normal]plans to electrify and improve services on the London to Penzance line)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.[bold] There is a further difficulty in using connecting services. When trains are running late, there is a reluctance to hold connecting services. This is apparently because (a) holding for more than 10 minutes will affect the reported service 
[normal]punctuality 
[normal]stati
[normal]stics, and (b) Rail Track applies penalties for late running. When trains are not held, passengers are made to wait for a long time for a connection (often impossible when services do not stop at particular stations) or must be provided with taxis at great
[normal] expense to the companies. I have been informed by staff at Plymouth Station that it is cheaper to put 400 people onto taxis into Cornwall than it is to pay the Rail Track fine for holding a train. This is not a sensible policy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.[bold] The lack of stopping services at rural stations is partly a consequence of the Rail Track charging policy: charging to stop at stations is a disincentive to provide a proper service. Transport provision is driven by Rail Track requirements rather than by 
[normal]passenger needs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.[bold] One issue
[normal] in determining rail provision h
[normal]as been the nature of the available rolling stock. On the western region, where many platforms are short and trains do not have centrally operated doors, a train manager must check doors on arr
[normal]ival and departure, making the stop at each station longer than necessary. Trains with centrally operated doors can more effectively be controlled by the train manager and result in shorter 
[normal]waiting times at small stations. Those communities with infrequent
[normal] train stops could have more trains stopping if trains were fitted with centrally operated doors.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.[bold] The reduction in the subsidy for concessionary travel has led to the disappearance of many bus services. Bus services to communities with a demographic 
[normal]profile that includes many elderly and retired people were made unprofitable by the change in the subsidy, further isolating those living in the communities. It has often been said by those affected that they would rather pay a reduced fare than lose the s
[normal]ervice, but they have not been given the option. While the ‘free’ concession is very valuable, its implications for transport provision have not been considered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.[bold] Where bus services are available, they are often neither frequent nor regular, which mini
[normal]mises usage. In some cases in rural areas, for example, a service to a particular town is provided on 
[normal]only 
[normal]one day each week, limiting the number of people able to use this. Some such services are timetabled in such a way that a ‘return’ journey within a d
[normal]ay is not possible or requires an almost immediate return. This further limits usage: it appears that a service is being provided, but it is not one that people can actually use. There is no indication that the kinds of journeys that people wish to make ha
[normal]ve been considered in planning the services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.[bold] Taxis are no substitute for a proper bus and rail service. They are expensive, both for the individual and for society, and they are not easily available. Many stations do not have a taxi rank and so cannot
[normal] be relied on for local transport. Many private hire cars in rural areas do not operate a 24 hour service. For example, the taxi services in Lostwithiel do not operate on a Sunday. Furthermore, communities with many elderly people are communities where peo
[normal]ple do not have the personal resources to use taxis, even over short distances. Taxi use for a shopping trip to the nearest big town can be completely prohibitive.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.[bold] Regularity and frequency
[normal] of provision
[normal] increase the level of usage. When people know tha
[normal]t they can catch a bus every day at convenient times, they will use the service. When the service is infrequent and variable, people cannot develop a habit of use that fits their needs.
[normal] This is a case of ‘chicken and egg’, but many feel that if a better se
[normal]rvice were provided, then people would use it. Transport providers operate on the contrary assumption, holding that until there is evidence of usage they will not provide the service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold]5[bold].[bold] Evidence on potential usage is difficult to collect. This is often 
[normal]gauged by ticket sales, but this means that potential demand is not adequately measured: those without transport or with transport provided at inappropriate times are unable to buy the tickets that are used as evidence of demand. Communities with rail link
[normal]s that are served infrequently are generally without ticket offices and this leads to further difficulties in using ticket sales as evidence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.[bold] Transport provision must be based on a proper analysis of the demand from potential users, and a wider policy should be geared to increasing that potential demand. We should be discouraging the use of private vehicles, rather than requiring their use and 
[normal]so isolating those without private transport. Providing better rail and bus services would, in the longer term, encourage more people to use public transport and so would reduce carbon usage and fuel dependence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.[bold] Transport policy must also be more inte
[normal]grated. There is little concern to ensure that bus and train services connect or complement each other. Relatively minor re-routings or alterations in schedule can significantly improve connectivity. There needs to be some way of factoring integrated trans
[normal]port into a policy for transport development.
