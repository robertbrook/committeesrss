default&#xa0;
defaultThis evidence is submitted in my capacity as Chair of Lostwithiel Transport Users Group, a group affiliated to the Lostwithiel Town 
defaultForum and with aims supported by Lostwithiel Town Council.
default I am grateful for the chance to provide evidence that derives from personal experience and from discussions with local residents in the Transport Users Group. Evidence is cited from Lostwithiel and
default the Great Western region, but the points made are generally applicable to communities across the country.
default&#xa0;
default1.default The first point to note is that few communities are ‘isolated’ 
defaultper se
default. It is the lack of transport that isolates a community. 
default‘Isolation’ is a 
defaultco
defaultnsequence
default of transport policy. 
defaultTransport provision must therefore be assessed in relation to the character and needs of a community and not simply in relation to its geographical position.
default&#xa0;
default2.default We do not feel that existing public transport provision is cons
defaultidered in relation to the needs of different groups of (potential) passengers. While train and bus operators do consider, for example, the accessibility needs of disabled and elderly users, they do not consider the actual transport needs. Thus, transport p
defaultolicy has to consider the different requirements of such groups.
default&#xa0;
default3.default The transport needs of sub
defaultgroups within a community are quite diverse. Working people with families require transport at peak work and school times, retired people require transport at ti
defaultmes more appropriate for shopping and leisure. This means that transport provided only at peak times fails to make any provision for the non-working population.
default The paradox is that it is the non-working population (especially the elderly) that are most dependent on public transport. Working families are generally car-owning families and have an alternative to public transport. Elderly people are less likely to dr
defaultive, yet transport is generally supplied at times suited to the car-driving population.
default&#xa0;
default4.default Each community has a distinct demographic profile and its isolation can depend on this as much as it does on the availability of a transport link. A community with 
defaulta high proportion of elderly people (typical of many small towns and villages) will be more isolated than a commuter town if transport is not provided at appropriate times. Transport policy must consider the profile of a community.
default&#xa0;
default5.default Rail providers often
default claim that potential passengers can drive to nearby stations with a better service. An example is Lostwithiel, which has few stopping trains, where passengers are referred to Par (the online timetables provide connections through Par). However, there is i
defaultnsufficient parking at Par. These kind
defaults
default of arrangements work only if adequate parking is provided. However, those without cars are completely unable to take up such opportunities.
default&#xa0;
default6.default Some communities in tourist areas are particularly dependent on visitors
default. The needs of visitors are quite distinct from those of residents, but are equally important to consider. If transport to a community is not provided from major centres, there will be fewer visitors and a loss of trade to local businesses. This can be exa
defaultmpled from our local rail provider (First Great Western), though I have no reason to think that it is in anyway distinct in this respect. 
defaultThe company provides some summer alterations in services to better serve large resorts. However, this is often at the 
defaultexpense of regular services used by residents and trains do not make additional stops at smaller centres.
default&#xa0;
default7.default The franchise proposals for the Great Western region take no account of the points raised above. An opportunity has been lost to improve transport
default provision. It is proposed to reduce the number of through services from London to Penzance, terminating trains in Devon and providing ‘sprinter connections’ for the remainder of the journey. 
default&#xa0;
default(a) This fails to recognise the specific needs of visitors to 
defaultCornwall (who arrive in considerable numbers throughout the year, and not only in summer). Tourists travel with families and large amounts of luggage, which can be accommodated on the inter city 125 trains. The 2-car sprinter trains, however, have very lit
defaulttle luggage space, and their seating capacity is insufficient to meet the demands of 400 or more passengers in addition to the existing local users.
default&#xa0;
default(b) The 2-car sprinters are already overcrowded with local users and these local users could be squeezed o
defaultut by large numbers of visitors gaining seats before local users are able to board at local stations.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese issues could easily be resolved by continuing to run through services on appropriate trains.
default If the franchise proposals are carried through, the wh
defaultole of Cornwall becomes an ‘isolated community’. This is a retrograde step. (Electrification of the West Country service provides no relief to Cornwall as the electrification is limited to the London to Bristol section of the line into Wales. There are no 
defaultplans to electrify and improve services on the London to Penzance line)
default.
default&#xa0;
default8.default There is a further difficulty in using connecting services. When trains are running late, there is a reluctance to hold connecting services. This is apparently because (a) holding for more than 10 minutes will affect the reported service 
defaultpunctuality 
defaultstati
defaultstics, and (b) Rail Track applies penalties for late running. When trains are not held, passengers are made to wait for a long time for a connection (often impossible when services do not stop at particular stations) or must be provided with taxis at great
default expense to the companies. I have been informed by staff at Plymouth Station that it is cheaper to put 400 people onto taxis into Cornwall than it is to pay the Rail Track fine for holding a train. This is not a sensible policy.
default&#xa0;
default9.default The lack of stopping services at rural stations is partly a consequence of the Rail Track charging policy: charging to stop at stations is a disincentive to provide a proper service. Transport provision is driven by Rail Track requirements rather than by 
defaultpassenger needs.
default&#xa0;
default10.default One issue
default in determining rail provision h
defaultas been the nature of the available rolling stock. On the western region, where many platforms are short and trains do not have centrally operated doors, a train manager must check doors on arr
defaultival and departure, making the stop at each station longer than necessary. Trains with centrally operated doors can more effectively be controlled by the train manager and result in shorter 
defaultwaiting times at small stations. Those communities with infrequent
default train stops could have more trains stopping if trains were fitted with centrally operated doors.
default&#xa0;
default11.default The reduction in the subsidy for concessionary travel has led to the disappearance of many bus services. Bus services to communities with a demographic 
defaultprofile that includes many elderly and retired people were made unprofitable by the change in the subsidy, further isolating those living in the communities. It has often been said by those affected that they would rather pay a reduced fare than lose the s
defaultervice, but they have not been given the option. While the ‘free’ concession is very valuable, its implications for transport provision have not been considered.
default&#xa0;
default12.default Where bus services are available, they are often neither frequent nor regular, which mini
defaultmises usage. In some cases in rural areas, for example, a service to a particular town is provided on 
defaultonly 
defaultone day each week, limiting the number of people able to use this. Some such services are timetabled in such a way that a ‘return’ journey within a d
defaultay is not possible or requires an almost immediate return. This further limits usage: it appears that a service is being provided, but it is not one that people can actually use. There is no indication that the kinds of journeys that people wish to make ha
defaultve been considered in planning the services.
default&#xa0;
default13.default Taxis are no substitute for a proper bus and rail service. They are expensive, both for the individual and for society, and they are not easily available. Many stations do not have a taxi rank and so cannot
default be relied on for local transport. Many private hire cars in rural areas do not operate a 24 hour service. For example, the taxi services in Lostwithiel do not operate on a Sunday. Furthermore, communities with many elderly people are communities where peo
defaultple do not have the personal resources to use taxis, even over short distances. Taxi use for a shopping trip to the nearest big town can be completely prohibitive.
default&#xa0;
default14.default Regularity and frequency
default of provision
default increase the level of usage. When people know tha
defaultt they can catch a bus every day at convenient times, they will use the service. When the service is infrequent and variable, people cannot develop a habit of use that fits their needs.
default This is a case of ‘chicken and egg’, but many feel that if a better se
defaultrvice were provided, then people would use it. Transport providers operate on the contrary assumption, holding that until there is evidence of usage they will not provide the service.
default&#xa0;
default1default5default.default Evidence on potential usage is difficult to collect. This is often 
defaultgauged by ticket sales, but this means that potential demand is not adequately measured: those without transport or with transport provided at inappropriate times are unable to buy the tickets that are used as evidence of demand. Communities with rail link
defaults that are served infrequently are generally without ticket offices and this leads to further difficulties in using ticket sales as evidence.
default&#xa0;
default16.default Transport provision must be based on a proper analysis of the demand from potential users, and a wider policy should be geared to increasing that potential demand. We should be discouraging the use of private vehicles, rather than requiring their use and 
defaultso isolating those without private transport. Providing better rail and bus services would, in the longer term, encourage more people to use public transport and so would reduce carbon usage and fuel dependence.
default&#xa0;
default17.default Transport policy must also be more inte
defaultgrated. There is little concern to ensure that bus and train services connect or complement each other. Relatively minor re-routings or alterations in schedule can significantly improve connectivity. There needs to be some way of factoring integrated trans
defaultport into a policy for transport development.
