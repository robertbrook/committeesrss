"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Radio Independents Group [FBB0063]&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;\n1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Radio Independents Group (RIG) represents independent radio / audio production companies based all around the UK. These companies are diverse - RIG members make radio for the BBC and commercial networks, plus other audio \nand \nmultimedia co\nntent for broadcasters and corporate clients. RIG members account for around 95% of industry turnover. Overall the sector is comprised of 1\n0\n0+ companies, over 1,000 skilled people – and spread all around the UK.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRIG greatly welcomes the inquiry into the ‘\nFuture of the BBC’, allowing as it does in-depth discussion ahead of the next formal Charter Review process. We hope the following thoughts are useful and would greatly welcome an opportunity to appear before the Committee to discuss the\nm\n further. Our subm\nission will touch upon many of the themes contained within the Committee’s inquiry, whilst centrally focusing on the Committee’s question: \n‘What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to other\ns to create?’\n&#xa0;\nThe Independent Radio / Audio Production Sector&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLike other creative industries, indie radio production companies are set up by entrepreneurs who seek to make diverse innovative content which has creative, cultural and, where appropriate, commercial value. \n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe sector is in a position to take its place a\nlongside the other creative industries in helping the UK economy to grow. Indie radio production companies already attract advertising and commercial sponsorship around \nprogrammes \non commercial radio, thus providing a boost to commercial radio income overa\nll. \nExamples of indie \nprogrammes \nfor commercial radio are 2013’s Classic FM Christmas Day \ndrama “Bethlehem Tales”\n, made by \nUnique\n (which also provides daily entertainment news on around 150 stations)\n, and \n‘\nThe Ronnie Wood Show\n’\n, made by Somethin’ Else for \nAbsolute Radio. \n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOverall the \nindie radio/audio \nsector is estimated to be worth £40m-£50m per annum and growing. Programmes originally commissioned for radio networks are sold on via companies that sell downloads and online streaming\n,\n \nand\n to overseas broadc\nasters. Shows such as Folded Wing’s ‘Jamie Cullum Show’, which is syndicated in France, Canada and SE Asia, are proving successful internationally.\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEach year indie radio producers win around 30% of product\nion-\nrelated Sony Gold Awards (the industry’s ‘Oscar\ns'), including for station branding and multiplatform content. And UK indie radio producers feature prominently at the International Radio Awards \nin New York \n– this year \nUK indie TBI Media \nwon the ‘Production Company of the Year’ Award and overall UK \ncompanies won 25 awards\n. \n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAudio production skills are not just important to radio, but to many other creative media sectors, particularly in an industry where skills are increasingly used across different types \nof \ncontent (eg computer games production req\nuire many traditional media skills including broadcast-quality sound production) and where content itself is increasingly multiplatform. The sector is investing in skills, and RIG was recently selected to take part in the UKCES Employer Ownership of Skills\n Pilot Scheme to develop skills, apprenticeships and training in the sector.\n&#xa0;\nPerspective on the BBC&#xa0;8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe BBC remains an important public service broadcaster which provides many services which may well not be provided otherwise, either at all or to the bre\nadth and depth of that which is currently on offer. The current state of commercial radio, heavily constrained by the need to grow and maintain advertising and sponsorship revenues, shows that it is difficult to produce certain types of content without pub\nlic support and a dedicated public service remit. RIG \ntherefore \nsupports both the continuation of the BBC in radio and television, and the Licence Fee as a practical way of collecting the revenue, notwithstanding the need to \ntackle how to deal with the gro\nwing number of people accessing the BBC through other devices than the traditional radio or television set.\n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever there is a need for the Licence Fee Payer to benefit as much as possible from the available innovation and creative talent available – and \nwith over 80% of BBC \nRadio’s \ncontent currently ring-fenced for in-house production, \nthe situation \nis\n at present\n far from \nideal\n. \n&#xa0;\n10.\n&#xa0; \nThe \nargument \nfor more independent production \ngains additional weight in the light of the need for the BBC to be ever more effi\ncient and show value for the Licence Fee\n,\n \nat \na time when it represents a considerable outlay for British households. The BBC needs to be increasingly fleet-of-foot and flexible in the digital converged era. In this context large in-house production centres\n are unwieldy and therefore contrary to this need.\n&#xa0;\nCurrent State of BBC Radio Commissioning&#xa0;\n11.\n&#xa0; \nProgress towards \nestablishing \na more diverse \nrange \nof programme-makers in BBC radio has been slow. A voluntary 10% quota has been operating since 1992. Although i\nndies had been successfully supplying \nprogrammes \nover and above that quota, there had been no further move towards allowing the sector to bid for more \nprogrammes\n. \n&#xa0;\n12.\n&#xa0; \nIn 2010 the BBC Trust revie\nwed\n the supply of content to BBC radio services. In its conclusions the BBC Trust required the BBC to “demonstrate a clear focus on delivering high quality and distinctive \nprogrammes \nto licence fee payers, in particular through \nensuring the best ideas are com\nmissioned regardless of source\n”\n.\n&#xa0;\n13.\n&#xa0; \nAs a first step towards meeting this requirement, the BBC was instructed by the BBC Trust to introduce, in addition to \nthe 10% \nquota, a \nfurther \n10% Window of Creative Competition (or ‘WoCC’). The intention of the WOCC is \nto allow indie production companies to \ncompete with\n in-house production teams to submit the best ideas for \nprogrammes \nacross the BBC’s radio schedules.\n&#xa0;\n14.\n&#xa0; \nThe BBC recently reported on the first year of the WoCC’s operation and it showed that indies were \nsuccessful in winning 80% of WoCC hours, against in-house competition\n.\n&#xa0;\n15.\n&#xa0; \nWhere given the chance, indie radio producers have proven success at delivering many types of programming, including large-scale live programmes. The ‘Radio 2 Folk Awards’ at the Albe\nrt Hall (produced by Manchester indie Smooth Operations) will be broadcast in January 2014 and TBI Media’s ‘Dambusters Live’ was a \nsignificant success for BBC Radio 2 last May. Indie-produced programmes slot neatly into the most vibrant of BBC radio schedu\nles, for \nexample Campbell-Davidson’s award-winning\n ‘Danny Baker Show’ and World’s End’s ‘Fighting Talk’ on a Saturday matchday morning on Radio 5Live. Shows such these and other examples such as ‘The Reunion’, made by Whistledown for BBC Radio 4, also dem\nonstrate the compelling original formats created by indies companies. Using indies also allows different production teams to contribute to a \nstrand\n, for example the ethical and religious discussion programme ‘Something Understood’, which is made variously \nby \nUnique Productions, Falling Tree Productions and \nWhistledown\n Productions for Radio 4.\n&#xa0;\n16.\n&#xa0; \nHowever RIG has been monitoring the types of \nWoCC \nprogrammes \nawarded\n to indies and, rather than being a diverse set of \nprogrammes \nfrom across the schedule, it has bee\nn found that WoCC commissions\n,\n especially on Radio 2 and Radio 1 / 1xtra, have been low-cost strands\n out of peak listening hours. The simple fact is that there are no independent productions on Radio 2 in daytime during the week. \nThis leads to a feeling \non the part of our members \nthat there is a form of \nprotectio\nnism\n being practised \nin BBC Radio\n, contrary to the Trust’s requirement to allow Licence Fee Payers access to the best ideas regardless of source.\n&#xa0;\n17.\n&#xa0; \nIndie producers are confident that their producti\nons are not obtained at any greater cost than a BBC in-house production. However to this date a\n d\nirect comparison of the cost of an in-house production and indie production has not been possible\n,\n due to the fact that the BBC’s accounting is less than trans\nparent \nwhen it comes to the overall cost of an in-house production\n.\n RIG has had conversations with the BBC on this issue on many occasions but the information has yet to be made available.\n&#xa0;\n‘Eligible Hours’&#xa0;\n18.\n&#xa0; \nIt should be noted that all the hours made avail\nable to TV and radio indies - either through the quota or the WoCC - are expressed as a proportion of those deemed ‘eligible’. These ‘eligible’ hours exclude news, current affairs\n, repeats and continuity broadcasts. \nBearing in mind the amount of news on BB\nC networks, the amount of hours open to indie radio companies is therefore significantly less than 20%. All percentages cited should be viewed \nin the knowledge\n that they represent less of a proportion of BBC \nprogrammes \nthan it might appear.\n&#xa0;\nThe Lessons from BBC TV Commissioning&#xa0;\n19.\n&#xa0; \nIt is important to consider what has happened in BBC television commissioning. As far back as the 1980s the Government realised it was important to develop an independent TV production sector, to allow more creativity and innovat\nion to take place and supply the PSB networks with a broader range of talent\n,\n voices and ideas. Hence the introduction of a 25% TV indie production quota in the 1990 Broadcasting Act, and also the creation in 1982 of Channel 4 and S4C, whose publisher-broa\ndcaster model means they commissions all of their content from indies.\n&#xa0;\n20.\n&#xa0; \nSubsequently the Government enshrined \nindie TV \nproducers’ intellectual property rights in the 2003 Communications Act, which has made sure that terms of trade between \nthose \nproducers a\nnd PSB broadcasters are overseen by Ofcom.\n&#xa0;\n21.\n&#xa0; \nAll of this has resulted in one of the most successful TV production sectors in the world, responsible for ever-growing exports of programmes and formats and a burgeoning sector which remains a success story even\n in times of economic difficulty.\n&#xa0;\n22.\n&#xa0; \nThe next step for TV will be to move further towards competition for commissioning over and above the 50% currently available – ie the removal of the current 50% ‘in-house guarantee’. The BBC’s Creative Director, Alan Yen\ntob, told the 2013 Edinburgh TV Festival that he predicted that the in-house guarantee in TV might be removed within five years\n.\n&#xa0;\n23.\n&#xa0; \nWhilst radio / audio would never be on the same scale in terms of sheer amounts of money involved, it nevertheless has the ca\npacity and ability to grow much \nlarger\n, both in the UK and internationally. In the case of the lat\nt\ner\n,\n formats, skills and expertise can be exported to countries with existing or developing radio services, such as India or China, whose growing middle-class\nes are fuelling a demand for English-language \nprogrammes\n. \n&#xa0;\n24.\n&#xa0; \nIt is important to make clear that the \nindie \nradio sector \nis not simply \nlooking at TV and saying ‘me too’ – it is \nmore to make the case \nthat there are more similarities than differences with TV\n,\n and the same \ninterventions \ncould be very effective in growing the UK’s indie radio production sector. The BBC has sought to argue, including to members of the Select Committee during its inquiry into ‘Supporting the Creative Economy’, that radio is a ‘dif\nferent market’ and can\nno\nt be treated in same way\n. However the fact that there are no other real sources for PSB radio than the BBC \nsurely \nmeans \nthe Corporation \nhas an even greater responsibility to make use of the benefits which working with indie radio c\nompanies can bring to the listener.\n&#xa0;\n25.\n&#xa0; \nThere is no reason why indie productions\n could not contribute to any part \no\nf\n the BBC’s schedule. In fact this is more the case with the BBC than commercial radio, the latter having some \nprogramming\n which is based around stra\ni\nghtforw\na\nrd music play and advertising and sponsorship. But even BBC music shows are individual \nprogrammes\n, with a dedicated production team and unique built-in features\n. \nAnd \nsuch s\nhows are already made, but only in a minority of\n cases, by indies, for example \nSmooth Operations\n’ \n‘\nRadcliffe and Maconie\n’\n \nprogramme \non BBC 6Music.\n&#xa0;\nVoices From Across the UK&#xa0;\n26.\n&#xa0; \nDuring its evidence session on the BBC Annual Report in November 2013, the committee raised issues of making sure voices, stories\n and perspectives from across the UK are fully represented on the BBC. Clearly one way of making this happen is to have the content on the BBC’s services, including radio, commissioned from a wide range of production companies all around Britain. The map s\nupplied in Appendix 1 shows how the BBC has a few large production centres, but that there is a much more extensive network of indie radio /audio production companies.\n&#xa0;\n27.\n&#xa0; \nRIG members have welcomed out-of-London initiatives such as the Salford Media City, whi\nlst recognising that it \ndoes not \naddress the issue of how the BBC engages more with the creative sector across all UK, not just where it has regional centres of production.\n&#xa0;\nBBC Trust \n&#xa0;\n28.\n&#xa0; \nRIG has had regular dialogue with the BBC \nTrust \nsince 2010, when it en\ngaged with the Trust on its Radio Network Supply Review.\n&#xa0;\n29.\n&#xa0; \nWhilst the sector did gain from the 2010 review, the experience nevertheless indicated that the lines between the BBC Executive and Trust appeared to be insufficiently drawn, with the Trust reluctan\nt to go as far as many had expected and also holding back from arguing for a quota by value, despite the wording of the BBC Agreement which mentions the value of commissions as an indicator of whether or not a true diversity of content is being commissione\nd from the indie sector.\n&#xa0;\n30.\n&#xa0; \nOverall, from dealing with the Trust, RIG has the perception that members of the BBC Executive are well-qualified and appear to be diligent in their roles. Institutionally, however, it is still questionable whether the Trust can r\neally be even-handed with external and internal stakeholders when one considers its dual regulatory / ‘cheerleader’ role which still exists. Seemingly small details such as the Trust sharing the same e-mail system as the BBC Executive point to a possibly g\nreater problem of the Trust remaining too close to the organisation it is supposed to regulate.\n&#xa0;\nLooking to the Future&#xa0;31.\n&#xa0; \nIn looking forward to the next Charter it is important to take stock of the broadcasting world and what kind of PSB broadcasters we \nneed, specifically what the BBC’s role should be.\n&#xa0;\n32.\n&#xa0; \nWhilst TV channels have proliferated, RIG is nevertheless of the opinion that a large-scale service which is not dependent on advertising remains important. Having the distinct licence fee model ensures th\nat whatever happens elsewhere in the sector UK audiences and citizens have an independent, objective and comprehensive news service, along with a wide range of other services.\n&#xa0;\n33.\n&#xa0; \nHowever what has changed is improved technology, introducing the ability for co\nntent to be made far more easily and in many more locations \nthan \nwas the case when the BBC was first set up. There is no reason why in this day and age the vast majority of the BBC’s content cannot be made all around the country\n and, \nwhilst it is impractic\nal for the BBC to have its own centres of production in many locations\n,\n it is not so difficult for a\nn independent\n production company to set up more or less where it wishes. This is the case even more with audio than it is with other forms of production. \n&#xa0;\n34.\n&#xa0; \nIt could be argued that many of the serious problems the BBC has faced in recent years have been\n,\n in one way or another\n,\n the result of its being such a large institution. The solution is a firm new direction for the BBC, via the Charter, to make itself mor\ne fleet-of-foot, more flexible and more able to adapt to the challenges that will continue and develop over the period of the next Charter.\n&#xa0;\n35.\n&#xa0; \nWhilst \nthe BBC Trust’s conclusions in its 2010 radio supply review\n were welcome, it failed to establish \na clear tim\netable for achieving its objective of ‘the best ideas regardless of source’. This means that listeners are being deprived of the benefits of competition for the best programme ideas.  It also makes it difficult for most indies to invest in their companies \non anything but a short-term basis\n&#xa0;\n36.\n&#xa0; \nWhilst RIG was recently able to agree terms of trade which will mean more BBC-commissioned indie content is available online, with a fair return to indie producers, this is of limited value to both the audience and the i\nndustry if the latter is not given more access to BBC \nprogrammes\n.\n&#xa0;\n37.\n&#xa0; \nIn his keynote speech in October 2013, BBC Director General Tony Hall stated that “the BBC must be the risk capital for the UK’s creative industries“\n and RIG has welcomed this. \nUltimately \nwe would like to see a position where most if not all non-news BBC Radio content was open to competition for ideas from indie \nproduction companies. The TV example demonstrates the type of steps that can be taken to move towards such an aim.\n&#xa0;\n38.\n&#xa0; \nThe success of\n the TV model has shown a clear path and RIG has been asking for parity – namely a 25% quota \nand\n 25% WoCC for BBC Radio commissioning. Opening up the BBC’s commissioning on such a scale would allow existing companies to grow and new entrants to market – bu\nt always on the basis that they could come up with innovation ideas, exciting talent and fresh stories to tell.\n&#xa0;\n39.\n&#xa0; \nWe would of course recommend that such a model was phased in \nwithin a short number of years, rather than implemented in one go, \nto prevent unne\ncessary cost and upheaval for the BBC in terms of re-organising its in-house operation to allow for a lower future output.\n \nAll the evidence from TV suggests that o\nnce \nthis change ha\ns\n been \nachieved\n, the Licence Fee Payer \ncan \nbe more certain of being given \ncontent which had been through a competitive process to determine that it was among the best available.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\nAppendix – Radio Production Centres Across the UK&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \nRadio Independent Supply.
