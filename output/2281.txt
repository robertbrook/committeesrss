EIS 17&#xa0;

[[[Written evidence submitted by ]]]

[[[Tearfund ]]]Tearfund is a Christian relief and development agency working in partnership with organisations in around fifty countries, often working alongside or through networks of local churches, as well as responding directly in response to significant disasters.&#xa0;Tearfund welcomes the opportunity to input into this inquiry. &#xa0;As an active member of the Publish What You Pay Coalition, we endorse their submission but wish to build on this with some specific points. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Impact of the UK signing up to EITI]]]&#xa0;1. The UK formally launched the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) over ten years ago. &#xa0;&#xa0;Worldwide, the EITI is seen to have several benefits, including; strengthening accountability and good governance; tackling corruption and enabling missing funds to be recovered; &#xa0;a more efficient system of revenue collection; &#xa0;a systematic framework for collaboration between companies, civil society, government and other stakeholders; reducing corporate risk to extractive companies by clearly showing what a company is paying to a government; demonstrating the contribution that the extractive sector makes to a country; and providing information that &#xa0;enables citizens and civil society to hold governments accountable for their use.2. Cases such as the 2009 Nigerian EITI audit, which identified an $800 million USD discrepancy in what oil companies said they paid in taxes, royalties and signature bonuses and what the government claimed to have received, highlights the potential for greater transparency which the EITI process can bring. &#xa0;The Nigerian EITI has made efforts to collect this money, as well as further unpaid taxes identified in previous and subsequent audits, and has thus far succeeded in collecting over $400 million USD in unpaid taxes.3. In May 2013, the UK committed to become an EITI implementing country. &#xa0;This was a welcome statement, with the UK demonstrating global leadership on this issue ahead of the G8 Summit. &#xa0;With the UK calling for a ‘global standard’ for extractive industry transparency, the UK EITI commitment signals that the UK is ‘practicing what it preaches’. &#xa0;4. However, the real benefit and impact of the UK joining the EITI will be determined once the UK makes strides to become EITI compliant, and whether the UK models and implements the highest degrees of transparency and the optional recommendations in the revised EITI standard. &#xa0;5. &#xa0;Tearfund’s research in Peru has demonstrated that for the EITI to be useful to communities and to result in the desired accountability, the revised EITI standards need to be implemented in full - both here in the UK and in other EITI countries. &#xa0;In particular:- There needs to be contract transparency in order that communities know the terms and conditions of contracts. &#xa0;In Peru there were concerns that many of the contracts were not negotiated in the interests of the country but were the result of underhand political deals - greater contract transparency would help address this. &#xa0;- &#xa0;The EITI reports need to include context, in order to convey the bigger picture. &#xa0;In Peru, the lack of contextual analysis and the lack of links with other initiatives severely undermines the potential impact of the EITI reports. &#xa0;The requirement in the revised standard to publish the context, including production figures; disclosure of the license holders; the revenue allocations to state, local and other accounts; and a description of the fiscal regime, is welcome but in time must go further so that EITI reports also link to other kinds of information (e.g. on local government budgets and environmental laws).6. The UK has the opportunity to model best practice with its EITI compliance - to implement the optional recommendations in the revised EITI standard, to link the EITI report to other relevant information and to present the EITI data in an accessible, comprehensible and usable format - in line with the UK’s commitment under the Open Data Charter. &#xa0;This will enable UK citizens to more readily understand the data and ensure that the UK continues to act as a world leader on this issue, living up to its ambition to be the most open and transparent government in the world. &#xa0;

[[[Best practice in engagement between the extract]]]

[[[ive industries and NGOs]]]7. Tearfund’s joint research in Peru has highlighted some of the challenges of NGOs engaging in the EITI process, particularly in terms of the discernible impact on promoting transparency, public debate and accountability for the revenues obtained by the extractive industries. The research found that in Peru, the EITI reports were published at public meetings in the capital Lima (where specialists, state officials, NGOs and representatives of extractive firms attended), but in the regional meetings the attendance was much poorer and the meetings not well publicised. &#xa0;This led to less accountability and sometimes greater mistrust.8. The UK can learn from this experience and consider how to ensure that citizens and local groups based outside of London, particularly where based relatively near to extractive industry projects such as accessing unconventional gas, can be supported and engaged in the process. &#xa0;Again, the way the UK publishes the EITI report and data will be an important determinant as to how NGOs and local communities engage in the process.

[[[Going forward - the UK as a global leader on extractive industry transparency]]]9. The UK is to be commended for taking forward this agenda - most notably for supporting the passage of the EU Accounting and Transparency Directives and for making progress on extractive industries transparency at the G8 in June. &#xa0;10. To prevent the momentum from stalling, the UK should continue to work to transpose the EU Directives quickly, as it committed to do at the G8, completing transposition by the end of 2014. &#xa0;The UK must ensure that the data resulting from the implementation of the EU Directives is accessible and usable in accordance with the principles outlined in the G8’s Open Data Charter, in order that communities worldwide can easily view and interpret the payments made by UK extractives firms.11. In addition, the UK has the opportunity to build on the ongoing international progress and call for a global mandatory reporting standard, equivalent to the EU Directives. &#xa0;A global agreement is needed to ensure that all extractive companies, no matter where they are listed, are required to publish what they pay to foreign governments, on a country-by-country and project-by-project basis. &#xa0;As countries with the largest global share of extractive companies, the G20 has a key role to play - particularly Australia, South Africa and Brazil. &#xa0;With Australia soon to assume the G20 Presidency, the UK Government should work with other G20 members to ensure that there is an agreement on, and a commitment to, mandatory legislation at next year's G20 Summit in Brisbane.&#xa0;&#xa0; Implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative - applying early lessons from the field, World Bank (2007) http://eiti.org/files/Case%20Study%20-%20EITI%20in%20Nigeria.pdf p2http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/neiti-recovers-n69bn-unremitted-oil-revenue/133876/ See here for the revised EITI standard as adopted in May 2013: http://eiti.org/document/standard Tearfund’s joint research in Peru can be found here: http://tilz.tearfund.org/en/resources/policy_and_research/governance_and_corruption/eiti_extractive_industries_transparency_initiative_report_feb_2013/&#xa0; https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/francis-maude-speech-to-mark-the-launch-of-new-government-transparency-commitments
