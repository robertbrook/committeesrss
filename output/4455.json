"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by CBM&#xa0;CBM recognises that \ndisability and\n poverty are inextricably linked in a \ncycle \n-\n disability\n \ncontributes to and deepens\n poverty on an individual, family and community level\n,\n and poverty \nis often a cause of disability\n.\n \nThis means that poverty cannot be addressed without addressing disability.\n&#xa0;\nCBM’s work is \naligned to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and explicitly promotes inclusive development in relation to all articles, and with specific emphasis on articles 11 (humanitarian assistance) and article 33 (international cooperation\n).\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCBM and Livelihoods&#xa0;\nCBM’s strategic framework for livelihood development stresses the importance of inclusive approache\ns to skills development, access to financial services, and paid employment, with the underlying aim of enabling persons with disabilities to become productive contributors to social insurance systems. \n&#xa0;\nCBM is working actively with the Centre for Financial\n Inclusion, an industry-facing think tank, at Accion (a global microfinance pioneer) on inclusive livelihood development and access to financial services. CBM is also in dialogue with the Village Savings and Loans organisation (VSL), with a view to includi\nng persons with disabilities. VSL is a pioneer in village savings and loans, and has nearly \nnine\n million members, mostly in Africa.\n&#xa0;In recent years there has been marked growth in the number of persons with disabilities becoming involved in open employment, cooperatives, micro-finance and savings &amp; loans schemes. Last year, CBM skills development and work creation programmes reach over\n 100,000 people with disabilities. \n&#xa0;\nParticipatory planning is used to involve the individual with a disability and his or her family, together with the economic realities of the community in which the individual lives, taking into account what products an\nd services are in high demand and short supply. \n&#xa0;\nA twin-track approach of economic empowerment of persons with disabilities, together with sustained advocacy for inclusive livelihood development at local, national and international levels has been shown t\no be a successful model of engagement.\n&#xa0;\nCase Study: Inclusive Development through Organic Farming &#xa0;\n“Inclusive Development through Organic Farming” is a five\n-\nyear project\n and initiative of \nCBM\n partner Naman\n Seva Samiti\n, with the aim of providing livelihood\n opportunities for a total of 1,500 farmers with disabilities and their families in Madhya Pradesh\n,\n central India. \n&#xa0;\nThis is the first project in India which trains people with disabilities in organic farming in their local language. Participants in the pr\nogramme include people with physical, hearing and visual impairments as well as parents of children with disabilities. During the project, farmers will develop a cooperative movement where they are responsible for the entire production and marketing cycle.\n&#xa0;Each year, 300-350 farmers receive training in soil testing, the production of organic manure, crop selection and processing of products through a mix of both theory lessons at the training centre and practical sessions in the fields. Farmers also take p\nart in exposure visits to learn from the experiences of other farmers’ \ngroups and organisations in different parts of the country. In addition to training, Naman provides transportation, promotion and marketing support and reaches out to larger markets and\n suppliers of bigger supermarkets wherever feasible.\n&#xa0;\nNaman’s advocacy activities at government level in Madhya Pradesh have led to the state government providing technical support for the project and declaring Athner block as an ‘organic block’. \nAlready,\n other \norganis\nations\n are approaching Naman to share its experiences and gain help in establishing \npilot projects\n \nin other parts of India.\n              \n              \n              \n              \n&#xa0;&#xa0;Farmer showing her organic vegetable production \n \n&#xa0;\nMost importantly, the project is bringing significant change \nto the lives of persons with disabilities and their families. Pe\nrsons\n with disabilities are leading a process of economic empowerment and agricultural innovation, changing perceptions within the wider community, giving hope to thousands of persons with dis\nabilities in rural India. \n&#xa0;CBM and Inclusive Education&#xa0;\nThere is a growing recognition that the inclusion of children with disability in mainstream schools builds self-confidence and self-respect through social inclusion, as well as increasing employment choices. Governments around the world are therefore start\ning to introduce inclusive education as a strategy in their mainstream education programmes. \n&#xa0;\nCBM is working with our partners to forward the inclusive education agenda through targeted programme work and advocacy initiatives in a number of inclusive educ\nation projects.\n C\nhallenges\n of \nthe q\nuality of \neducation\n for all childre\nn\n (in particular\n children wi\nth \ndisabilities\n)\n, \nac\ncessibility of school sanitation and toilets\n \nalso \nremain high on the \nCBM\n agenda.\n \n&#xa0;\nCBM is\n also\n a key partner in the Global Campaign for Ed\nucation 2014 which is highlighting the inclusion of \nc\nhildren \nw\nith \nd\nisability in Education.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Case Study: Chamkol, Karnataka, India&#xa0;\nCBM and Mobility India are supporting pe\nrsons\n with disabilities and their families to \ngain greater inclusion in their communtiies by taking \npart in decision making,  and to gain\ning access to employ\nment, health and education\n.\n&#xa0;\nMobility India train\ns\n and supports after\n-\nschool club coordinators to run daily after\n-\nschool clubs for children from \nfamilies\n \nwith disabilities\n. These coordinators serve as inspiring role models as many \nare persons with disabilites \nthemselves\n, \nso they bring their own valuable exper\nience\n to their work.\n In addition\n, government\n teachers are trained on inclusive approaches to their classroom practise and how to develop individual education plans for children with disabilit\nies\n and special educational needs. \n&#xa0;\nThe after\n-\nschool clubs and school teachers work together to meet the needs of the children and ensure that the individual education plans provide a framework for \neach\n child to \nprogress towards \nreach\ning\n his or her full potential.\n&#xa0;\nLocal advocacy initiatives are starting to grow as the inclusive education trained teachers and after school club \ncoordinators raise\n awareness of disability\n-\nrelated issues.\n&#xa0;CBM and Mental Health&#xa0;\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 1 in 4 p\neople will experience an episode of mental illness in their lifetime, and that 300-400 million people worldwide are disabled as a consequence. 85% of these people are in \nl\now and \nm\niddle \ni\nncome \nc\nountries.\n&#xa0;\nCBM is an active\n member of \nt\nhe Movement for Global Mental Health, \nand supports\n three call\ns\n for action related to the post-2015 development agenda\n and mental health\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Case Study: A voice for mental health in Sierra Leone&#xa0;\nIn Sierra Leone, mental health needs are especially great as \na result of the 1991-2002 civil war that left deep scars on the nation's psychological well-being and its social capital. \nA whole generation of young people missed out on education, and continues\n to struggle to participate in the economy. \nPeople with psychosocial disabilities in\n Sierra Leone are often ostracis\ned\n from their communities and human rights violations are common. This may be due to traditional beliefs that attribute mental illness to spiritual causes and often blame the person with the problem. A lack of public health awareness and negative attitudes s\nurrounding mental illness has contributed to high levels of stigma and discrimination.  \n&#xa0;\nExisting services consist of a single national psychiatric hospital, which has shortages of staff, medication, and other essential resources, resulting in \nchallenging\n conditions\n, including routine chaining of patients. The few civil society services that started after the war are now closed. With no \ndecentralized\n mental health services available through government health services, people must rely on traditional treatm\nent or travel to the hospital in \nthe capital \nFreetown.\n&#xa0;\nThe Mental Health Coalition of Sierra Leone&#xa0;The Mental Health Coalition of Sierra\n Leone was founded in September\n 2010\n with the purpose of creating a body that empowers stakeholders to advocate for t\nheir rights, promoting practical change that will improve quality of life and inclusion in society.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFirst group of psychiatric nurses in Sierra Leone&#xa0;\nThe achievement of the \nMental Health Coalition of Sierra\n Leone,\n within the \n‘\nCBM \nEnabling \nAccess to MH in Sierra Leone Programme\n’\n,\n include:\n&#xa0;\nCBM and Disaster Preparedness&#xa0;\nCBM knows that the involvement of pe\nrsons\n with disabilit\nies\n disaster management planning saves lives.  \nDisasters have a huge impact on human infrastructure, and livelihoods. The key \nto\n diminishing their impact is to reduce people’s vulnerability. Through inclusive Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) programmes, incorporated in human development plans and poverty \nreduction programmes, risks can be reduced and communities’ resilience to disasters can be strengthened.\nPersons with disabilities are often overlooked throughout the disaster management cycle and especially during relief operations, and are seldom \nconsidered as important actors in conflict prevention even though they are often more exposed during conflicts and displacement\n. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), in its articles 11 and 32\n, requires that persons with di\nsabilities benefit from and participate in disaster relief, emergency response and disaster risk reduction strategies \nas pe\nrsons\n with disabilit\nies\n are the most vulnerable in a disaster situation. The disaster preparedness and disaster risk reduction traini\nng run by CBM partners in \nt\nhe Philippines before Typhoon Haiyan struck has shown how effective this can be through the number of lives saved.  \n&#xa0;\nCBM adheres to the \nk\ney principles for inclusive disaster risk reduction policies which include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Case Study: Putting Disability on the agenda of Disaster Risk Management&#xa0;The Disability \nI\nnclusive Disaster Risk Reduction Network for Asia and Pacific participated in the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Management in Geneva in May 2013. The network achieved its objective of assuring that disability is included and \nmainstreamed across disaster risk reduction management projects \nand working towards a disability\n-\ninclusive post Hyogo Framework for Action. For the first time disability was included in the outcome document. \n“Even the best early warning systems and prepar\nedness efforts to evacuate populations in dangers do not address fully the diversity of disabilities that we have in our societies. The only way to address this is to ensure that persons with disability are involved in the deism and planning of the systems\n that are designed to protect the safety of the population in all countries.” \nMargareta Wahlstrom, Special Rep\nresentative\n for UNISDR.\n&#xa0;\nCBM and Community Based Rehabilitation &#xa0;CBM has been instrumental is the adoption of the Community\n-b\nased \nr\nehabilitation (CBR) approach which is now an integral part of most CBM supported partners approach to \ndisability\n-\n inclu\nsive development, ensuring that\n projects and programmes meet the \nrequirements\n \nof people with disabilities and their families in their own\n communities through a holistic approach to a person and their environment in the areas of health, education, livelihood, social inclusion, skill development and empowerment.\n&#xa0;Case Study: Elim Programme, Igede Nigeria &#xa0;\nThe Christian Vocational Training C\nentre “Elim” runs a \nc\nommunity\n-\n \nb\nased \nr\nehabilitation \np\nrogramme, \naiming to empower and build the capacities of \npersons with disabilities\n. It\n covers a large rural area in Benue State in central Nigeria with a population of about 300,000. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNeeds assessments \nby community workers \nclearly identify the problems faced by \npersons with disabilities\n \nand mothers/parents who have children with disabilities in this region\n. These include\n: \n&#xa0;\nServices \nare then \noffered to \npersons with disabilities\n \nand \ninclude eye surgery, orthopaedic surgery, \nrehabilitation services\n, special education for both \npeople \nwith \nhearing and visua\nl impair\nments\n and an economic integration programme. An orthopaedic workshop has also recently been developed. \n&#xa0;\nExperts in education and physiotherapy provide additional support in the community\n.\n \nThe Elim\n programme team also dedicates a significant amount of time and effort to raising awareness of disability within the local communities to reduce the stigma and discrimination that many \npersons with disabilities\n \nface.\n \n&#xa0;CBM Key Recommendations&#xa0;December 2013\n              \n              \n1. \nThe MH Coalition of Sierra Leone was started under the Enabling Access to MH in Sierra Leone programme, funded by EU and CBM, and implemented by CBM, GIP, University of Makeni, City of Rest, and CAPS. It is also supported by the \nUniversity of Ibadan \nmhLAP \nprogramme, funded by the Australian Government and CBM  \n \nWomen’s Commission for Refugee Women and Children. “Disabilities among refugees and conflict affected populations”, Women’s Commission for Refugee Women and Children, New York, 2008.\n \nArticle 11 -\n States Parties shall take, in accordance with their obligations under international law,… all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian e\nmergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters. Article 32 – International Cooperation a) Ensuring that international cooperation, including international development programmes, is inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities.\n \nThe rehabi\nlitation and reconstruction phases after a disaster provide a good starting point for building a better and a more inclusive society for all. If disability is taken into account in reconstruction of physical infrastructures (schools, hospitals, clinics, pu\nblic buildings, roads etc.), in community planning, in workforces, in monitoring and evaluation, a solid ground for a more equitable society can be built.\n"
