defaultAnti-social Behaviour
default&#xa0;defaultBad Driving Practicesdefault&#xa0;
defaultA strong thread permeating much (but not all off-
defaultroading
default) is a sort of “macho” culture rooted in the challenge of difficult conditions and mastering nature. This can lead to a number of behaviours which may be different from those exhibited when driving on conventional roads. These include travelling in large groups, excessive speed for the conditions and aggressive revving of engines.

default). Others provide local amenities for dog-walkers or families with toddlers or young pony riders. Many horse riders need access to unsealed routes near their stabling – unlike vehicle users they may not be able to go elsewhere. Increasingly, non-vehicle users are being driven off these lanes or their use of them spoilt by anxiety, noise or unwelcome evidence of vehicle passage striking a discordant and incongruous note in otherwise peaceful countryside.

defaultThis discouragement of other users is to be deplored. It risks undermining government attempts to get people to take more exercise and if it becomes more widespread could threaten a local economy very dependent on tourism.

defaultView from Long Causeway February 2011. This fine stretch of open country cannot be truly appreciated by ordinary users now because of the likely discordant presence of vehicles and the sound of revving engines. The revetment to the left of the track in the middle of the picture is old but of uncertain date. Its 
defaultstrengthening  to
default support vehicles is a major contributor to the £235k budgeted by DCC for repairs to Long Causeway in 2013/14. 
defaultAppendix default3 default defaultProblemsdefault With Off-defaultRoadingdefault in Selected National Parks &amp; Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.default&#xa0;
defaultOur knowledge is mainly about the Peak District. Nevertheless, we are aware of problems in other areas which are described below. This is not attempting to be a comprehensive report on the rest of the country but key messages coming from environmental groups in a selection of obvious areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur feeling is that the problem particularly affects the main upland areas of the country, with the possible exception of 
defaultDartmoor
default (for reasons which are unclear but possibly because it is remote from large urban areas). In the words of DEFRA “Partly because of their often challenging terrain, some National Parks have seemed to attract considerable numbers of recreational vehicle users. The Government considers that in many cases a level of recreational vehicular use that may be acceptable in other areas will be inappropriate within National Parks and incompatible with their purposes.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe area where there has been the most success in dealing with the problem is the Yorkshire Dales. However we believe the increasing militancy of off-
defaultroading
default groups would not see that success repeated there now.
default&#xa0;
defaultPeak Districtdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe area has an acute problem aggravated by its central location within the 
defaultUK
default and ready accessibility to a huge urban catchment area. It provides a magnet for off-roaders not only from other areas in the country but also from 
defaultEurope
default. It suffers too from the operations of both local and outside commercial companies offering off-
defaultroading
default guided tours.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe NPA started taking matter seriously about two years ago. Thirty six Priority Routes were identified but TROs are only being pursued in piecemeal fashion. Work is on-going on a mere five and progress on these is pitifully slow. Vehicle user groups seem determined to fight tooth and nail probably because of the success of Yorkshire Dales NPA. The consultation process is being abused by orchestrating mass objections on trivial grounds, which nevertheless have to be answered individually. Only one TRO has finally been approved by members after two years.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe situation is complicated by the existence of seven highway authorities none of which seem interested in actively helping the NPA, in spite of their statutory duty to do this. Derbyshire County Council has been the most active but seems to be concentrating on repairs rather than using TROs. They seem immune to arguments that the expenditure will be wasted in the absence of regulation. Other HAs seem to be doing nothing – we believe that Staffordshire is not even processing DMMO claims.
default&#xa0;
defaultLake Districtdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThis was the first National Park to recognise the problem. At the instigation of one of the off-
defaultroading
default organisations (the Land Access and Recreation Association), it adopted an approach to managing off-
defaultroading
default through establishing a hierarchy of routes - classifying them according to the seriousness of the problem. The methodology was flawed because it concentrated only on surface conditions and ignored environmental and conflict issues. However off-
defaultroading
default organisations continue to extol the virtues of this approach – possibly because its limitation to surface conditions encourages HAs and NPAs to put the emphasis on repairs.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe NPA has mainly tried to use various partial measures short of full TROs. These have proved unsatisfactory because of the administrative burden and circumventions by vehicle users 
defaulteg
default circulation of keys for combination locks.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a continuing problem in some areas particularly through the activities of commercial companies offering “off-
defaultroading
default experiences”.
default&#xa0;
defaultYorkshiredefault Dalesdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe NPA was sceptical about the 
defaultLake District
default’s approach and carried out its own lane by lane survey incorporating the missing environmental and conflict factors. Similar methodologies are now being used by the NPAs in the Peak District and North York Moors
default&#xa0;
defaultIt had the advantages that it was responsible for the DMS and only has to liaise with two HAs –thus reducing the co-ordination problem so evident in the Peak District.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe NPA grasped the nettle and imposed 13 TROs in 2008. Four of these were quashed in the High Court but one was successfully implemented subsequently. The other three routes were found not to have through public motor vehicle rights.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe NPA was also fortunate in that the levels of public response in the TRO consultation processes were an order of magnitude less than those experienced in the Peak District. Off-
defaultroading
default groups at that time were not misusing the TRO regulations to overload the process and thus discourage HAs and NPAs from using them. We would expect attempts to impose further TROs would generate the same abuse of the consultative process seen in the Peak District.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe NPA feels that the worst of the problem has been addressed. In 2012/3 it reports encouraging compliance with TROs, a low level of complaints, limited reports of illegal off-
defaultroading
default and a slight decrease in legal off-
defaultroading
default. It seems to us that this is probably because of displacement activity to other areas – particularly the Peak District. This is why, in our opinion, it is important to have action on a national scale.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, although there are far fewer UCRs than in the Peak District, plenty of vulnerable green lanes remain in the Yorkshire Dales. However the NPA is short of money and staff resources and is having to hand back delegated ROW powers to North Yorkshire County Council, who are 
defaultlikely
default be far less effective in tackling off-
defaultroading
default. We understand there are further problems in the 
defaultNidderdale
default AONB.
default&#xa0;
defaultNorth Yorkdefault Moorsdefault&#xa0;
defaultOff-
defaultroading
default is a significant problem and the damage is very bad in some areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe area has 173 UCRs totalling 253km but only 4 BOATs totalling 12 km. 201 routes have been assessed under the NPA’s methodology of which 165 (280km) have been classified as highly vulnerable. The highly vulnerable routes have been prioritised according to vulnerability on the most number of criteria. Seven of these fell into the top category.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2012 one of the HAs (North Yorkshire County Council) consulted on a policy to rank UCRs according to their ability to support vehicle use and to implement TROs on those which were unsustainable. The NPA welcomed this approach but 
defaultNYCC  decided
default not to proceed with the policy.
default&#xa0;
defaultSubsequently, as in the Peak District, the NPA is finding it has to bear the burden of combating off-
defaultroading
default on its own. Currently there are 7 TROs covering 6 UCRs and 1 BOAT totalling 25km which NYCC implemented some years ago.
default&#xa0;defaultSouth Downsdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThe South Downs Society say that off-
defaultroading
default is not in their top 10 problems which is surprising since a study by the Council for National Parks found it of serious concern in 2005. The NPA has been in existence for only 2 years and is reported to be adopting a hands-off approach and relying on local councils for action. However, in its state of the park report for 2012, the NPA says that “conflicts of interest occur in some places, for example, where 4x4 vehicles have caused significant damage to some BOATs making them inaccessible to other users.”
default&#xa0;
defaultExmoordefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThe Council for National Parks recorded marked problems in 2005 but we have been unable to contact the Exmoor Society to ascertain the current position.

defaultWales
default because of devolution but are aware of significant problems in the Brecon Beacons. Periodically, there are also well publicised incidents in Snowdonia, with 4x4s being driven up and abandoned on 
defaultSnowdon

default 
defaultUnsealed Byways 
defaultOpen
default to all Traffic (BOATs)
default 
defaultto be 
defaultregraded
default as Restricted Byways on the definitive map and statement on the date of commencement. The only exceptions are identified in 5 below.
default&#xa0;
default2. This legislation would apply to 
defaultEngland
default and, where appropriate, 
defaultWales
default.
default&#xa0;
default3. Landowners and occupiers who access their property by a way which is added or 
defaultregraded
default as a restricted byway by these measures to have the right to use the restricted byway to access their property in a mechanically propelled vehicle and to give legal authority to their visitors to do the same.
default&#xa0;
default4. The emergency services, including the Coastguard and recognised mountain rescue teams, would be able to use restricted byways created by this measure in mechanically propelled vehicles.
default&#xa0;
default5. Where a right of way for mechanically propelled vehicles was created by an enactment or instrument or otherwise which specifically provided for it to be a right of way for mechanically propelled vehicles or it was constructed in exercise of powers conferred by virtue of any enactment with the intention from the outset that it should be a right of way for mechanically propelled vehicles the way will continue to be a public right of way for mechanically propelled vehicles. [As now]
default&#xa0;
default6. With respect to unsealed ways (and only unsealed ways) the exceptions in NERCA 2006 subsection 67 (2) 
default(a), (b) and (e)
default would no longer apply.
default&#xa0;
default7
default.
default 
defaultOnly applicable if 1.2 above is not accepted. Where an application to add a UUCR to the definitive map has not been confirmed as footpath, bridleway or byway open to all traffic by the commencement date, the UUCR
default 
defaultis to be added as a Restricted Byway to the definitive map and statement on the date of commencement.
default&#xa0;
default8. A Surveying Authority (SA) would be able as a matter of judgement to designate within a period of 1 year, in a way similar to clause 13 of the Draft Deregulation Bill:
default              
default8.1 UUCRs which are part of the ordinary road network
default              
default8.2 UUCRs which are patently bridleways or footpaths.
defaultThe process thereafter would follow clause 13. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDefinitionsdefault&#xa0;defaultCounty road means a way shown on the relevant (whether county or unitary) Highway Authority’s list of streets (the list of highways maintainable at the public expense described in subsections 36(6) and 36(7) Highways Act 1980
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultUnclassified means not classified by the relevant highway Authority as an A, B or C road.
default&#xa0;
defaultAn “unsealed way” is defined by reference to 
defaults22BB(
default1)(b)(ii) Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 as a way whose ‘surface, or most of whose surface, does not consist of concrete, 
defaulttarmacadam
default, coated

defaultIf it is considered that such blanket coverage should only be applied to a subset of unsealed ways, we regard it as imperative that the PDGLA proposals should apply at least to those in National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
default&#xa0;
defaultShould Parliament reject either proposal (as to UUCRs or unsealed BOATs) then the improvement to the TRO system proposed by GLEAM becomes essential. In essence, that proposal is to amend the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to provide for an appeal system against inaction or unreasonable refusal by highway authorities or national park authorities to impose Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs)

defaultway. Such appeals would be heard by magistrates.

defaultNumber of Routes Affecteddefault&#xa0;
defaultWe have inspected 153 routes which looked from the map as if they could be of interest to off-
defaultroading
default groups. Eight of these turned out to be sealed leaving 145 unsealed (of which 36 are BOATs and 109 UCRs).
default&#xa0;
defaultPDNPA have been seriously addressing the problems caused by off-
defaultroading
default for about 2 years. They have assigned 36 routes to a Priority List (16 BOATs and 20 UCRs). Five of these have been initially ranked as probable candidates for TROs and are at various stages in the consultation process. Only 1 has completed the process, and Members have agreed to go ahead with implementation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBecause the other 4 TROs are at different stages of completion, it is difficult to assign a completion rate to PDNPA but it appears to us that one per year is a realistic expectation. Even if only half the Priority Routes were eventually selected for TROs (which seems to us a most conservative estimate), this would imply another 16 years to deal with the current situation.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever the situation will not remain static – we find routes which we had previously believed free from off-
defaultroading
default suddenly to show signs of this. Where these routes are 
defaultunsurfaced
default, deterioration occurs very quickly. We expect most of the Priority Routes will eventually need TROs to protect them.
default&#xa0;
defaultOf the routes we have inspected, we ranked 42 as being vulnerable if vehicle use increased. Seventeen of these were already on the Priority List leaving 25 which we would expect to see added to the list in the future.

defaultFigures for other SAs in the Peak District are not available but we believe Staffordshire County Council does not feel it has the resources to discharge its duties in this area and is not processing DMMO claims.
default&#xa0;
defaultDEFRA has made some estimates of the cost of adding routes to the DMS under the current procedures for contested claims. This indicates a maximum of £12k for cases settled by written representation and £15k for those which go to public inquiry. These figures include both local and central government costs (PINS). We find it difficult to believe these estimates comprise fully allocated costs and from our experience they look low even if they are restricted only to direct labour costs. A typical public inquiry takes 3 days and there is significant preparation work by SA staff beforehand. DCC has typically had 3 legal people present at the inquiry and an 
defaultarchivist to look after the historical documents. The planning inspector needs preparation time too and also needs to write up conclusions. There

defaultIn 2012/13 DCC budgeted £143.5k for their Green Lanes Action Plan (of which (£3.5k came from Natural England)
default.
default This covered just 6 routes of which 5 are on the PDNPA Priority List. Of these Long Causeway took £20k.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2013/14 £375k was budgeted - £140k to unspecified green lanes and £235k to Long Causeway.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt seems to us that DCC are adopting repair rather than the imposition of TROs to address the problems affecting PDNPA’s Priority Routes. On current progress, this repair programme has many years to run. The scale of the work sometimes necessary can be seen in the amount budgeted already for Long Causeway - £255k. Similarly, it should be noted that DCC’s planned expenditure in 2012/13 included a further £24k on the 
defaultRoych
default. Prior to the opening of the Pennine Bridleway, something in excess of £500k was spent in repairing the 
defaultRoych
default section of the route.

defaultPDNPA has 2 full time and 1 part time staff working on surveying/monitoring routes and

default their TRO Initiatives. Our feeling is that this equates to 2 full time equivalents. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAn unknown amount of Ranger time is devoted to the initial assessment of potential Priority Routes. There is no regular systematic survey of all routes in the National Park. In our opinion this would be essential if the rapidly changing situation on the ground were to be monitored effectively.
default&#xa0;
defaultPDNPA have had to fight a High Court case arising from their attempt to put an Experimental TRO on Chapel Gate. We have no figures on this but are aware they consulted external lawyers as well as their own staff and would have employed barristers to present their case in the Court.
