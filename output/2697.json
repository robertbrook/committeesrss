"&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by the Refugee Council (LAI 0075)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Refugee Council gives advice to asylum seekers and refugees, most notably for adults relating to asylum support and to unaccompanied children on a range of issues relating to their pr\notection and care. We provide support to refugees on integration matters, such as accessing housing, employment and education.\nIntroduction&#xa0;\nThe Refugee Council welcomes this inquiry by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in to human rights issues raised by the government’s proposed changes to legal aid.  \n&#xa0;\nThe government is, through the proposed reforms to legal aid in \n“Transforming Legal Aid:\n delivering a more credible and efficient system”\n, proposing to make wholesale changes to an individual’s ability to access justice through secondary legislation.  It is not appropriate to make these changes without parliamentary scrutiny. Furthermore, the\n consultation paper was issued a week after the implementation of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO Act 2012). During the passage of the Bill that was to become the LASPO Act 2012, the government stated in Parliament tha\nt legal aid would be retained for matters of ‘the utmost priority’ such as those seeking asylum.\n&#xa0;\nIn the wider debate about legal aid the focus is often in relation to the criminal law and therefore the impact on asylum seekers and refugees has received le\nss scrutiny.  \nHowever, the proposals will dramatically reduce the access to justice of those seeking asylum and\n, for many in \nthe first year after their successful claim, those who have been granted asylum in the UK.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nWe do not agree \nwith \nthe proposal to limit legal aid to those with a ‘strong connection’, defined as a person who has been continuously lawfu\nlly resident for 12 months, with the UK.\n&#xa0;\nWe acknowledge that people with an extant claim for asylum will be exempt from the residence test and the reasons given for this are entirely appropriate.  We \nalso acknowledge \nthe Government’s \nclarification \nin \ntheir ‘Transforming Legal Aid; Next Steps’ consultation (5 September 2013) that ‘\nin the case of successful asylum seekers, the continuous period of lawful residence required under the test will begin from the date they submit their asylum claim, rather tha\nn the date when that claim is accepted.\n’  \nThis is a welcome step forward, although it \nwill mean that some refugees will \nstill \nhave to wait to be able to receive legal aid support \n(if the date when they claimed asylum is less than a year from when they are \ngranted status\n). This \nwill \nalso \nbe the case for refugees resettled under the Gateway programme\n who are eligible for settlement immediately on entry to the \nUK but have previously been li\nving in refugee camps. \n \nThis may \nerode the support they need to fully i\nntegrate into the UK.  These r\nefugees will not have access to legal aid for housing, child law or any other matter.  Article 16 of the 1951 Refugee Convention enjoins States to provide refugees with access to courts and legal assistance on a par with the t\nreatment granted to nationals of that host country. We strongly urge the Ministry of Justice to remove the proposed residence test for\n all\n refugees and allow access to legal aid for new claims arising immediately after recognition or resettlement to the UK\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe retain \nother serious \nconcerns about the residence test proposal:\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe recommend that this proposal be reconsidered, particularly in the light of the assessment that it will re\nsult in negligible financial saving.  \nBoth the introduction to the consultation document and the Ministerial foreword cite financial savings as a motivation for these proposals. The impact assessment included as an annex to the consultation document assess\nes that the financial impact \nfor this proposal \nwill be negligible or very small. We are therefore concerned that the reasons for introducing these proposals may be at best confused and at worst, misrepresented.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Refugee Council has serious concerns about the proposal that \nproviders should only be paid for work carried out on an application for judicial review (including a request for reconsideration of the application at a hearing, the renewal hearing, or an o\nnward permission appeal to the Court of Appeal) if permission is granted by the Court (but that reasonable disbursements should be payable in any event). \n&#xa0;\nGiven the precarious situation in which legal aid providers find themselves, even individuals with m\neritorious cases are likely to experience severe difficulties in accessing representation given that legal aid providers will, under these proposals, not be paid for any of their work unless and until permission if granted. Such work is “at risk” and there\nfore poses a direct liability to the legal aid provider who is likely to be constrained as to the cases that they are willing to take.\n \nWork to research, prepare and present a judicial review is often substantial, especially to address concerns in the hand\nling of the most complex asylum claims. This proposal would act as a disincentive for providers to undertake judicial review work even where merits are established, as any work prior to permission being granted by the court would have to be undertaken pro \nbono. This will make it very \ndifficult for people facing destitution to access JR, particularly to apply for urgent injunctions\n.  This is likely to increase the number of people facing destitution, with an increased cost to society.\n&#xa0;\nClients of the Refuge\ne Council are frequently wrongly denied their legal rights. Common issues affecting them include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNGOs and other advocates do not turn to judicial review lightly. Individual advocacy would always be the first port of call. However, when such intervention is not successful, a legal rep\nresentative’s assistance is a necessary part of the action that has to be taken to challenge the decision made by a statutory authority. In order for the work to take place it has to be funded.  In our opinion the proposed change would result in an increas\ne in unlawful decisions relating to access to services with disastrous effects on the individual and/or an increase in the number of individuals who seek to ask the court to intervene without the assistance of a properly qualified representative. This is n\not in the interests of justice. \n&#xa0;\nJudicial review has historically acted as a counterbalance with regard to decisions either made in error or without the introduction of all information pertaining to the case.  Mistakes and omissions such as these are inev\nitable in any decision making process, no matter how well-developed.  Without legal aid, the ability for individuals to check whether these decisions were correct will be severely limited. \n&#xa0;\nThe rationale given by the Ministry of Justice  for this proposal\n is to reduce the cost of legal aid, but we do not feel that there is a strong enough financial argument to justify this proposal. In the ‘Case for Reform’ (3.61), the consultation paper states that ‘legal aid is being used to fund a significant number of \nweak cases which are found by the Court to be unarguable and have little effect other than to incur unnecessary costs for public authorities and the legal aid scheme’. Yet the Impact Assessment report (IA No: MoJ194, para 30) states that it would make a sa\nving of only £1 million. £1 million is equivalent of 0.45% of the total savings that the Ministry of Justice intends to make per year by 2018/19. Given the small saving it makes, we believe this proposed change will bring an entirely disproportionate impac\nt on individuals and should be dropped.\n&#xa0;\nIndeed, it is somewhat difficult to establish from the statistical information provided in paragraphs 3.63 to 3.68 of the consultation document that there are significant number of weak cases for which legal aid for\n judicial review was obtained. At best, only 13%, a small minority of those cases for which legal aid for judicial review related work was sought in 2011-12, could fall into this category. This is in sharp contrast to the general impression that has been e\nngineered by the Lord Chancellor in the media that the vast majority of judicial review challenges are unmeritorious and made in bad faith, and that the reason for further changes to the legal aid system is to close this loophole\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;We do not agree with this proposal. It is important to recognise that ‘borderline’ in this instance does not mean ‘with less merit’ but rather ‘less clear’.  \nOne of our \n key concern\ns\n relates to children’s asylum appeals. Most of the children we help are unaccompanied and in need of expert assistance; \nindeed in domestic and European law special provision is made for the legal assistance in relation to children i\nn the asylum system and specifically their legal representation. \n&#xa0;\nAfter working closely with the Legal Services Commission in 2005, a policy\n was introduced to ensure that children received assistance in lodging and presenting their appeals. The policy st\nated that children appealing a refusal of asylum should be considered to reach at least ‘borderline’ status with regard to the merits of their case when deciding to grant funding for the advice and representation relating to the appeal. If the ‘borderline’\n status were to be removed this policy could not continue to work. It is important that the ‘borderline’ category is retained for matters of wider public interest so we recommend that the proposal to remove it is not taken forward.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Legal Services Commission immigration team newsletter June 2005.\n \nFor example, Nick Clegg, \nDeputy Prime Minister speaking at the Refugee Council in 2011, quoted by Asylum Aid in ‘I feel as a woman, I am not welcome’ 2012\nAmnesty International UK (AIUK) response to the Ministry of Justice public consultation on “transforming legal aid: \ndelivering a more credible and efficient system”\n Asylum Aid’s submission to Transforming Legal Aid (Ministry of Justice) 4 June 2013\n See the Public Law Project’s analysis of the Secretary of the State’s interview on The Today Programme on 23 April 2013\n \nhttp://www.publiclawproject.org.uk/documents/PLPResponseChrisGrayling.pdf\n from  Th\ne Detention Forum response to the Ministry of Justice consultation paper: ‘Transfor\nming\n legal aid: delivering a more credible and efficient system’\n"
