defaultTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultEXECUTIVE SUMMARY
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1. DIFFICULTIE
defaultS
default&#xa0;
default  1.1  So far, only part of AR5 has been published: the “Summary for Policymakers” 
default(the SPM)
default,
default 
defaultbased on “The Physical Science Basis” report from Working Group I (WGI) – the latter available only as a “final draft”. 
defaultTherefore, it’s not possible to comment on how climate scientists might view AR5 as a whole. Accordingly this submission assumes that the Committee’s question relates only to the SPM. 
default&#xa0;
default  1.2  But there’s a difficulty 
defaulteven 
defaultwith this
default: t
defaulthe SPM covers four es
defaultsentially discrete matters: “Observed Changes”, “Drivers of Climate Change”, “Understanding the Climate System” and “Future … Change” – each 
defaultdealing
default with a range of considerations. Does the Committee’s question refer to the whole SPM 
defaultor should its parts be
default considered separately?
default 
default&#xa0;
default  1.3  The phrase “climate scientist” is a third problem. Climate science covers a wide range of scientific disciplines – from, for example, paleoecology to atmospheric physics – each working on different pieces of an extraordinar
defaultily complex puzzle. Even closely related disciplines can present a difficulty
default: in an interview with the BBC 
defaultin 2010
default,
default Professor Phil Jones of the University of East Anglia (whose research include
defaults
default the detection of climate change), 
defaultwhen asked whether natura
defaultl influences 
defaultcould have contributed to global warming, 
defaultreplied
default, “
defaultThis area is slightly outside my area of expertise
default”. If attribution is outside Professor Jones’s expertise, it must be far outside the expertise of, say, an expert on how temperature change affects agriculture. 
defaultTherefore, as WG1 is concerned exclusively with “The Physical Science Basis”, the opinion of a 
defaultclimate scientist whose expertise is outside that “Basis” is, at best, marginal to the Committee’s question
default: a problem referred to below as the “Beyond Expertise 
defaultProblem
default”.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.  A SOLUTION
default&#xa0;
default  2.1 
defaultT
defaulthese considerations
default raise complex issues 
defaultmaking
default it virtuall
defaulty impossible to provide a useful answer to the Committee’s question
default. To simplify matters, 
defaultthis submission 
defaultwill focus
default on the SPM’s 
defaultthree 
defaultessential findings
default:
default 
default 
default(i)  
default“defaultWarming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed 
defaultchanges are unprecedented over decades to millennia.
default”
default default(B. – page 2)
default 
default(ii)  “
defaultIt is 
defaultextremely likely
default 
defaultthat human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century
default.”
default (D.3 – page 15)
default 
default(iii)  “
defaultContinued emissions of greenho
defaultuse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions
default.
default” (E. – page 17)
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default  2.
default2
default  The question now is this: 
defaultWhat evidenc
defaulte is there of the extent to which these findings 
defaultreflect the range of views among climate scientists?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.  
defaultEVIDENCE
default  
default&#xa0;
default  3.1 
default 
defaultAs
default 
defaultit’s a common claim that 
defaulta “consensus” of around 
default97% of climate experts 
defaultagrees
default humans are causing global warming
default, 
defaultthe answer 
defaultshould be easy
default. 
defaultSuch claims
default, if valid, would seem to confirm (or at least go a long way towards confirming) that, 
defaultat least regarding
default its findings 2.
default1
default (i) and (ii) above, AR5 does indeed reflect the range of views among climate scientists.
default&#xa0;
default  3.2  
defaultBut w
defaulthether these 
defaultclaims 
defaultare v
defaultalid
default 
defaultdepends on the quality of the research on which they’re based. Three papers are 
defaultusually
default cited: 
defaultDoran and Zimmerman 2009
default, Anderegg 
defaultet al.
default 2010
default and Cook 
defaultet al
default. 2013
default.
default              
default(i)
default              
defaultDoran 
defaultThis
default study was based on an opinion poll: 10,257 “earth scientists” were polled, of whom 3,146 responded. However, only about 5% of respondents described themselves as climate scientists and, of these, only 79 had “
defaultpublished more than 50% of their recent peer-r
defaulteviewed papers on the subject of climate change”. The 97% claim was based on the responses of these 79, i.e. only 2.5% of respondents. But 79 is a barely adequate sample size (certainly inadequate to be representative of all climate scientists), the 50% of
default recent papers restriction might have excluded knowledgeable respondents and, with a preponderance of respondents (96%) from North America, the sample’s demographic is too limited for global representation. Moreover, the “climate scientist” self-selection 
defaultis unlikely to have resolved the 
defaultBeyond Expertise 
defaultProblem
default (1.3 above).
defaultThese are serious problems. However, the principal problem with Doran is that only two questions were asked, both poorly drafted
default (
defaultthe second especially so
default)
default: 
default(1) 
defaultWhen compared with pre-
default1800s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?
default 
default(2) 
defaultDo you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures
default?
defaultWhat 
defaultdoes “a significant 
defaultcontributing factor” mean? (As there was little human contribution before 1800, even a 5% contribution might properly be regarded as “significant”.) That 97% responded “yes” to these questions does nothing to illuminate the probable view of climate scienti
defaultsts regarding the very precise AR5 findings (2.
default1
default above). For example, Professor Richard Lindzen of MIT (probably the worlds’ leading sceptical scientist), when asked the same questions, responded
default:
default“My answer to (1) is probably, but the amount is surprisin
defaultgly small -- suggesting that global mean temperature anomaly is not a particularly good index. My answer to (2) would be yes, but dependent on what is meant by significant.”
defaultMoreover, the Doran study does not consider the subject matter of the AR5 findings
default at 2.
default1
default (iii) 
default(
defaultabove
default)
default.
defaultFor 
defaultthe above 
defaultreasons, 
defaultDoran
default does little to help this submission.  
default              
default(ii)
default              
defaultAnderegg 
defaultAnderegg is more helpful in that it addresses a key matter raised by AR5: whether or not “anthropogenic greenhouse gases have been responsible for mo
defaultst of the “unequivocal” warming of the Earth’s average global temperature over the second half of the 20th century”.
defaultHowever, there are problems
default. 
defaultThe first is that, unlike Doran, it wasn’t an opinion poll (no one was asked for a view) but a subjective interpretation of published material of some scientists’ views; 
defaultselection being
default based on signatures on pro/anti statements. 
defaultHowever 
defaultMedix’s experience
default 
default(see the introduction to this submission) 
defaultis 
defaultthat the only reliable way of determining professionals
default’
default 
defaultopinion 
defaultis to ask them directly, and not to try to infer their views from secondary evidence. 
defaultAnother problem is that 903 “climate researchers” were con
defaultsidered to have accepted the above statement compared with 472 who did not: i.e. 66%, not the claimed 97%. The researchers got to 97% by restricting their findings to researchers “most actively publishing in the field” – 
defaulti.e.
default the findings did not cover all
default “climate scientists”. Further, it was essentially confined to North America, was not concerned with 
defaultthe AR5 findings at 2.
default1
default (iii) 
default(
defaultabove
default) 
defaultand made no attempt to resolve 
defaultthe 
defaultBeyond Expertise 
defaultProblem
default 
default(1.3 above).
default 
defaultFor 
defaultthe above
default reasons, Anderegg is of 
defaultonly 
defaultlimited value 
defaultregarding
default the extent to which the principal AR5 findings reflect climate scientists’ views. 
default              
default(iii)
default              
defaultCook 
defaultCook concluded there was “an overwhelming consensus” (over 97%) 
defaultsupporting
default human causation of global warming. But, like Anderegg, the study was based, not on an opinion poll, but on an attempt to establish scientists’ views by inferring them from secondary evidence. Its methodology was to examine the abstracts of 
defaultsome
default 12,000 cli
defaultmate-related papers published from 1991 to 2011 (hardly a reflection of current opinion) and to assess the extent to which they endorsed the man-made global warming hypothesis – a subjective interpretation, as authors were not asked about their view. In an
defaulty case, its main finding “that humans are causing global warming” is almost valueless: does it mean all the warming, most of the warming or some unspecified proportion of the warming? The paper is unclear about this. (Compare that with the clarity of AR5’s
default “
defaultdominant cause … since the mid-20th century
default” finding.) It’s a
default methodology that demonstrates why the only way to determine professionals’ current views is to directly ask them clear, unambiguous questions.   
defaultThe Cook finding of a 97% consensus that CO
default2
default i
defaults a greenhouse gas and that mankind’s emissions have warmed the world to some unspecified extent is one with which many, 
defaultpossibly
default most, sceptical scientists would agree. In any case, it wasn’t a worldwide study, didn’t attempt to resolve 
defaultthe 
defaultBeyond Experti
defaultse 
defaultProblem
default 
default(1.3 above) and, most important, was not concerned with
default the 
defaultAR5 findings at
default 2.
default1
default (iii) above.
defaultFor the above reasons, 
defaultCook
default is of 
defaultonly 
defaultlimited 
defaultvalue regarding
default the extent to which 
defaultt
defaulthe principal AR5 findings reflect climate scientists’ views.
default&#xa0;
default  3.3  
defaultTwo other studies are 
defaultrather 
defaultmore helpful: an opinion 
defaultpoll
default of climate scientists
default 
defaultconducted
default in 2008
default (
defaultBray and von Storch 20
default10
default) and an opinion poll of American Meteorological Society (AMS) members 
defaultconducted 
defaultin 2012
default. 
default              
default(i) Bray and von Storch
defaultA
defaultlthough
default 66.5% 
default(of 373 respondents from 35 countries) 
defaultagreed that “
defaultmost of present or future climate change is, or will be, a result of anthropogenic causes", only 32% 
defaultthought
default "the current state of scientific knowledge is developed well enough to allow for a reasonable assessment of the effects of green-house gases emitted from anthropogenic sources" and only 17.75% that "the state of theoretical understanding of climate change
default phenomena is adequate"
default. 
defaultSo 
defaultit would seem that 
defaultmost of the
default 66.5%
default 
defaultbased their assessment more on a
defaultn educated guess 
defaultthan on the science
default; h
defaultardly a position that supports the IPCC. 
defaultThe 
defaultstated 
defaultdemographics 
defaultare unsatisfactory
default: 
defaultonly 78% of respondents 
defaultare descri
defaultbed as
default climate scientists and they as being concerned with 
default"physics of the climate system (modelling, model development, data acquisition,
default theory development
default, etc.)"
default; 
defaultthere’s no breakdown of skills explaining
default h
defaultow many were climate modellers
default 
defaultand how many
default observational physicists
default.
default Therefore it’s unclear what scientific specialties were represented by the sample addressed – which, in any case, was 
defaultnot 
defaultglobally balanced: of 373 respondents, 
default97% were based in the West – mostly the USA, UK and Germany
default.
default 
defaultMoreov
defaulter, the survey 
defaultdoesn’t address issues covered by
default SPM finding 2.1 iii (above)
default and 
defaultis five years old – opinions could have changed since it was conducted, especially regarding the reliability of models
default, the capability of which was 
defaultalready a matter of concern
default to 
defaultmany 
defaultrespondents
default.
default 
default 
default              
default(ii) AMS
defaultOnly
default 5
default2
default% of respondents thought global warming was happening and was mostly anthropogenic
default; moreover, at most 
default34
default% 
default(
defaultand 
defaultprobably less) 
defaultbelieved
default warming 
defaultwas happening, wa
defaults mostly anthropogenic 
defaultand
default would be “very harmful” if nothing were done about it. However, the questionnaire is unsatisfactory in phrasing and structure, making interpretation 
defaultuncertain
default; also 
defaultAMS members may not be representative of “climate scientists” as a whole and certainly not
default of such scientists worldwide. Nonetheless, 
defaultlike 
defaultBray and von Storch
default, 
defaultthis 
defaultsurvey indicates 
defaultthat the 
defaultprincipal 
defaultAR5 
defaultfindings
default 
defaultprobably
default reflect climate scientists’
default views to 
defaultno
default more than a limited extent.
default&#xa0;
default  3.4  There’s more evidence of this from
default 
defaultwithin the 
defaultSPM itself. It’s interesting to compare the key SPM finding – “
defaultIt is 
defaultextremely likely 
defaultthat human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century” – with Table SPM.1 (SPM page 5). The latter consists of four columns:
default of these, column 1 lists various phenomena (e.g. “Warmer and/or fewer cold days and nights over most land areas”) and column 3 consists of assessments of “human contribution to observed changes”. For example, it assesses that a human contribution to “Warm
defaulter and/or fewer cold days and nights …” was “very likely” (Note: not “extremely likely”). 
defaultBut “
defaultcontribution
default” is a very different concept from the “
defaultthe dominant cause
default” of the 
defaultkey
default AR5 finding
default: a
defaults noted 
defaultabove
default, a contribution could be relatively trivial. So th
defaulte assessment that a contribution is “very likely” is hardly a useful finding: many sceptical scientists would agree. 
defaultThis
default huge difference between the key SPM finding and the Table SPM.1 assessment, suggest
defaults t
defaulthat the scientists who compiled the Table may ha
defaultve had a different view about attribution from those who drafted the overall finding.
default&#xa0;
default  3.5  
defaultOne thing that would seem clear from the above evidence is that there’s widespread scientific agreement that mankind has made a significant 
defaultcontribution to global
default warming. However, there’s some evidence that it’s a view that may not be shared universally. For example, Ding Zhongli, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (described as “
defaultthe final word on climate science for the Chinese Communist Party
default”)
default, 
defaulthas observed that a significant relationship between temperature and CO2 “
defaultlacks reliable evidence in science
default”
default default. And h
defaultere’s a comment
default made 
defaultin 2010 
defaultby Xie Zhenhua, who led China’s delegation at the recent UN climate summit in Warsaw:
default"
defaultThere are disputes in
default the scientific community. We have to have an open attitude to the scientific research. There's an alternative view that climate change is caused by cyclical trends in nature itself. We have to keep an open attitude
default."
defaultThere’s 
defaultsome 
defaultevidence that Russian
default, 
defaultIndian
default 
defaultand possibly Polish
default 
defaultscientists may share this view.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.  CONCLUSIONS 
default&#xa0;
default  4.1 
defaultAs only a small part of AR5 has so far been published, it’s not strictly possible to answer the Committee’s question. However, even if the question is modified to addres
defaults that part of AR5 that has been published (the SPM), there are still practical problems – because, for example, of the substantial detail comprised by the SPM. And even the expedient of focusing on the 
defaultthree principal SPM findings
default fails to provide a satis
defaultfactory answer. Taking the SPM findings in turn:
default 
default(i)  
default“defaultWarming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia
default.” 
defaultAlthough the evidence (of worldwide opinion) is thin, suc
defaulth as there is indicates that it’s almost certain that climate scientists agree with the first part. However, the phrasing of second part is so vague (“
defaultmany of the observed changes
default” and “
defaultdecades to millennia
default”) as to be almost meaningless. So scientists’ opi
defaultnion
default, even if available, 
defaultwould be of little value. 
default(ii)  “
defaultIt is 
defaultextremely likely
default 
defaultthat human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century
default.” 
defaultHuman influence on the climate 
defaultwas
default specifically covered by 
defaultall the 
defaultabove
default studies. However, none consulted a representative sample of scientists worldwide and most have not resolved
default 
defaultthe 
defaultBeyond Expertise 
defaultProblem
default (1.3 above). And even the commonly held view that climate scientists agree that mankind has made a significant co
defaultntribution to global warming is essentially meaningless (
defaultsee 
default3.2 (i) and (iii) above) and, in any case, may not be universally accepted (
defaultsee 
default3.5). 
defaultBut, in particular
default, there appears to be little useful evidence 
defaultthat climate scientists agree 
defaultwith 
defaultthe AR5’s  “dominant cause” finding.  
default (iii)  “
defaultContinued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse 
defaultgas emissions
default.
default” 
defaultNeither of these claims seems to have been the subject of any 
defaultsignificant examination of climate scientists’ opinion – except perhaps the AMS survey (3.3 
defaultii 
defaultabove), which 
defaultindicates
default that only a minority of scientists agree with these findin
defaultgs.
default&#xa0;
default  4.2  These difficulties and uncertainties 
defaultlargely 
defaultstem from the fact that the only way to establish a satisfactory answer 
defaultwould be
default 
defaultto conduct a 
defaultworldwide, 
defaultproperly constructed and correctly implemented opinion survey
default, unambiguously covering all the
default SPM’s main findings.
default 
defaultThe AMS survey and especially 
defaultthe 
defaultBray and von Storch 
defaultsurvey 
defaultg
defaultot
default close
defaultst
default to 
defaultt
defaulthis
default. But 
defaultnot entirely
default: for example, 
defaultBray and von Storch 
defaultdidn’t cover 
defaultthe 
defaultAR5 findings 
defaultat 
default2.2 iii (above)
default, its sample 
defaultwas
default inadequate and
default 
defaultthe study 
defaultdoes 
defaultnot 
defaultseem to have resolved the 
defaultBeyond Expertise 
defaultProblem
default.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultcomplexity of such a survey and
default, in particular, 
defaultthe need for 
defaulta
defaultn accurate and consistent
default worldwide response make it unlikely that it would be practicable
default – consider, for example, translation difficulties
default.
default&#xa0;
default  4.
default3
default  
defaultIn summary, the inadequacy of useful evidence 
defaultmeans that 
defaultthe extent to which the SPM reflects climate scientists’ views is both unknown and likely to continue to be unknown
default. Therefore it’s 
defaultimpossi
defaultble to provide a reliable answer to the Committee’s question. However, such evidence as does exist indicates that the answer 
defaultwould probably be
default that AR5 r
defaulteflect
