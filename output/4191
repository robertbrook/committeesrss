[normal]Written evidence submitted by Robin Guenier[bold] (IPC0024)[bold]This evidence is a response to the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee’s inquiry concerning the 5
[normal]th
[normal] Assessment Review (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
[normal] (IPCC)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have 
[normal]an MA from 
[normal]Oxford University and am a barrister. I’ve
[normal] been an independent business consultant for several years, specialising most recently in project risk, and was founder chair (now non-executive director) of the medical online research company, Medix UK. In 1996, 
[normal]I was Chief Executive of the Central Computing and Telecommunications Agency reporting to the Cabinet Office. This note is written in my private capacity; it is not intended to represent the views of Medix.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  As a result of experience acquired at Medix, I
[normal] am familiar with the practical difficulties involved in designing, conducting and analysing surveys of professionals’ opinion
[normal]s
[normal] in such a way as to be confident that the results of such surveys are an accurate reflection of 
[normal]those
[normal] opinion
[normal]s
[normal]. Drawing on that 
[normal]experience, this evidence will address the following question: 
[normal]“
[normal]To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. DIFFICULTIE
[normal]S
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  1.1  So far, only part of AR5 has been published: the “Summary for Policymakers” 
[normal](the SPM)
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]based on “The Physical Science Basis” report from Working Group I (WGI) – the latter available only as a “final draft”. 
[normal]Therefore, it’s not possible to comment on how climate scientists might view AR5 as a whole. Accordingly this submission assumes that the Committee’s question relates only to the SPM. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  1.2  But there’s a difficulty 
[normal]even 
[normal]with this
[normal]: t
[normal]he SPM covers four es
[normal]sentially discrete matters: “Observed Changes”, “Drivers of Climate Change”, “Understanding the Climate System” and “Future … Change” – each 
[normal]dealing
[normal] with a range of considerations. Does the Committee’s question refer to the whole SPM 
[normal]or should its parts be
[normal] considered separately?
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  1.3  The phrase “climate scientist” is a third problem. Climate science covers a wide range of scientific disciplines – from, for example, paleoecology to atmospheric physics – each working on different pieces of an extraordinar
[normal]ily complex puzzle. Even closely related disciplines can present a difficulty
[normal]: in an interview with the BBC 
[normal]in 2010
[normal],
[normal] Professor Phil Jones of the University of East Anglia (whose research include
[normal]s
[normal] the detection of climate change), 
[normal]when asked whether natura
[normal]l influences 
[normal]could have contributed to global warming, 
[normal]replied
[normal], “
[normal]This area is slightly outside my area of expertise
[normal]”. If attribution is outside Professor Jones’s expertise, it must be far outside the expertise of, say, an expert on how temperature change affects agriculture. 
[normal]Therefore, as WG1 is concerned exclusively with “The Physical Science Basis”, the opinion of a 
[normal]climate scientist whose expertise is outside that “Basis” is, at best, marginal to the Committee’s question
[normal]: a problem referred to below as the “Beyond Expertise 
[normal]Problem
[normal]”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.  A SOLUTION
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  2.1 
[normal]T
[normal]hese considerations
[normal] raise complex issues 
[normal]making
[normal] it virtuall
[normal]y impossible to provide a useful answer to the Committee’s question
[normal]. To simplify matters, 
[normal]this submission 
[normal]will focus
[normal] on the SPM’s 
[normal]three 
[normal]essential findings
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal](i)  
[normal]“[bold]Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed 
[normal]changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia.
[normal]”
[normal] [bold](B. – page 2)
[normal] 
[normal](ii)  “
[normal]It is 
[normal]extremely likely
[normal] 
[normal]that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century
[normal].”
[normal] (D.3 – page 15)
[normal] 
[normal](iii)  “
[normal]Continued emissions of greenho
[normal]use gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions
[normal].
[normal]” (E. – page 17)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  2.
[normal]2
[normal]  The question now is this: 
[normal]What evidenc
[normal]e is there of the extent to which these findings 
[normal]reflect the range of views among climate scientists?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.  
[normal]EVIDENCE
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  3.1 
[normal] 
[normal]As
[normal] 
[normal]it’s a common claim that 
[normal]a “consensus” of around 
[normal]97% of climate experts 
[normal]agrees
[normal] humans are causing global warming
[normal], 
[normal]the answer 
[normal]should be easy
[normal]. 
[normal]Such claims
[normal], if valid, would seem to confirm (or at least go a long way towards confirming) that, 
[normal]at least regarding
[normal] its findings 2.
[normal]1
[normal] (i) and (ii) above, AR5 does indeed reflect the range of views among climate scientists.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  3.2  
[normal]But w
[normal]hether these 
[normal]claims 
[normal]are v
[normal]alid
[normal] 
[normal]depends on the quality of the research on which they’re based. Three papers are 
[normal]usually
[normal] cited: 
[normal]Doran and Zimmerman 2009
[normal], Anderegg 
[normal]et al.
[normal] 2010
[normal] and Cook 
[normal]et al
[normal]. 2013
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal](i)
[normal]              
[normal]Doran 
[normal]This
[normal] study was based on an opinion poll: 10,257 “earth scientists” were polled, of whom 3,146 responded. However, only about 5% of respondents described themselves as climate scientists and, of these, only 79 had “
[normal]published more than 50% of their recent peer-r
[normal]eviewed papers on the subject of climate change”. The 97% claim was based on the responses of these 79, i.e. only 2.5% of respondents. But 79 is a barely adequate sample size (certainly inadequate to be representative of all climate scientists), the 50% of
[normal] recent papers restriction might have excluded knowledgeable respondents and, with a preponderance of respondents (96%) from North America, the sample’s demographic is too limited for global representation. Moreover, the “climate scientist” self-selection 
[normal]is unlikely to have resolved the 
[normal]Beyond Expertise 
[normal]Problem
[normal] (1.3 above).
[normal]These are serious problems. However, the principal problem with Doran is that only two questions were asked, both poorly drafted
[normal] (
[normal]the second especially so
[normal])
[normal]: 
[normal](1) 
[normal]When compared with pre-
[normal]1800s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?
[normal] 
[normal](2) 
[normal]Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures
[normal]?
[normal]What 
[normal]does “a significant 
[normal]contributing factor” mean? (As there was little human contribution before 1800, even a 5% contribution might properly be regarded as “significant”.) That 97% responded “yes” to these questions does nothing to illuminate the probable view of climate scienti
[normal]sts regarding the very precise AR5 findings (2.
[normal]1
[normal] above). For example, Professor Richard Lindzen of MIT (probably the worlds’ leading sceptical scientist), when asked the same questions, responded
[normal]:
[normal]“My answer to (1) is probably, but the amount is surprisin
[normal]gly small -- suggesting that global mean temperature anomaly is not a particularly good index. My answer to (2) would be yes, but dependent on what is meant by significant.”
[normal]Moreover, the Doran study does not consider the subject matter of the AR5 findings
[normal] at 2.
[normal]1
[normal] (iii) 
[normal](
[normal]above
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]For 
[normal]the above 
[normal]reasons, 
[normal]Doran
[normal] does little to help this submission.  
[normal]              
[normal](ii)
[normal]              
[normal]Anderegg 
[normal]Anderegg is more helpful in that it addresses a key matter raised by AR5: whether or not “anthropogenic greenhouse gases have been responsible for mo
[normal]st of the “unequivocal” warming of the Earth’s average global temperature over the second half of the 20th century”.
[normal]However, there are problems
[normal]. 
[normal]The first is that, unlike Doran, it wasn’t an opinion poll (no one was asked for a view) but a subjective interpretation of published material of some scientists’ views; 
[normal]selection being
[normal] based on signatures on pro/anti statements. 
[normal]However 
[normal]Medix’s experience
[normal] 
[normal](see the introduction to this submission) 
[normal]is 
[normal]that the only reliable way of determining professionals
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]opinion 
[normal]is to ask them directly, and not to try to infer their views from secondary evidence. 
[normal]Another problem is that 903 “climate researchers” were con
[normal]sidered to have accepted the above statement compared with 472 who did not: i.e. 66%, not the claimed 97%. The researchers got to 97% by restricting their findings to researchers “most actively publishing in the field” – 
[normal]i.e.
[normal] the findings did not cover all
[normal] “climate scientists”. Further, it was essentially confined to North America, was not concerned with 
[normal]the AR5 findings at 2.
[normal]1
[normal] (iii) 
[normal](
[normal]above
[normal]) 
[normal]and made no attempt to resolve 
[normal]the 
[normal]Beyond Expertise 
[normal]Problem
[normal] 
[normal](1.3 above).
[normal] 
[normal]For 
[normal]the above
[normal] reasons, Anderegg is of 
[normal]only 
[normal]limited value 
[normal]regarding
[normal] the extent to which the principal AR5 findings reflect climate scientists’ views. 
[normal]              
[normal](iii)
[normal]              
[normal]Cook 
[normal]Cook concluded there was “an overwhelming consensus” (over 97%) 
[normal]supporting
[normal] human causation of global warming. But, like Anderegg, the study was based, not on an opinion poll, but on an attempt to establish scientists’ views by inferring them from secondary evidence. Its methodology was to examine the abstracts of 
[normal]some
[normal] 12,000 cli
[normal]mate-related papers published from 1991 to 2011 (hardly a reflection of current opinion) and to assess the extent to which they endorsed the man-made global warming hypothesis – a subjective interpretation, as authors were not asked about their view. In an
[normal]y case, its main finding “that humans are causing global warming” is almost valueless: does it mean all the warming, most of the warming or some unspecified proportion of the warming? The paper is unclear about this. (Compare that with the clarity of AR5’s
[normal] “
[normal]dominant cause … since the mid-20th century
[normal]” finding.) It’s a
[normal] methodology that demonstrates why the only way to determine professionals’ current views is to directly ask them clear, unambiguous questions.   
[normal]The Cook finding of a 97% consensus that CO
[normal]2
[normal] i
[normal]s a greenhouse gas and that mankind’s emissions have warmed the world to some unspecified extent is one with which many, 
[normal]possibly
[normal] most, sceptical scientists would agree. In any case, it wasn’t a worldwide study, didn’t attempt to resolve 
[normal]the 
[normal]Beyond Experti
[normal]se 
[normal]Problem
[normal] 
[normal](1.3 above) and, most important, was not concerned with
[normal] the 
[normal]AR5 findings at
[normal] 2.
[normal]1
[normal] (iii) above.
[normal]For the above reasons, 
[normal]Cook
[normal] is of 
[normal]only 
[normal]limited 
[normal]value regarding
[normal] the extent to which 
[normal]t
[normal]he principal AR5 findings reflect climate scientists’ views.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  3.3  
[normal]Two other studies are 
[normal]rather 
[normal]more helpful: an opinion 
[normal]poll
[normal] of climate scientists
[normal] 
[normal]conducted
[normal] in 2008
[normal] (
[normal]Bray and von Storch 20
[normal]10
[normal]) and an opinion poll of American Meteorological Society (AMS) members 
[normal]conducted 
[normal]in 2012
[normal]. 
[normal]              
[normal](i) Bray and von Storch
[normal]A
[normal]lthough
[normal] 66.5% 
[normal](of 373 respondents from 35 countries) 
[normal]agreed that “
[normal]most of present or future climate change is, or will be, a result of anthropogenic causes", only 32% 
[normal]thought
[normal] "the current state of scientific knowledge is developed well enough to allow for a reasonable assessment of the effects of green-house gases emitted from anthropogenic sources" and only 17.75% that "the state of theoretical understanding of climate change
[normal] phenomena is adequate"
[normal]. 
[normal]So 
[normal]it would seem that 
[normal]most of the
[normal] 66.5%
[normal] 
[normal]based their assessment more on a
[normal]n educated guess 
[normal]than on the science
[normal]; h
[normal]ardly a position that supports the IPCC. 
[normal]The 
[normal]stated 
[normal]demographics 
[normal]are unsatisfactory
[normal]: 
[normal]only 78% of respondents 
[normal]are descri
[normal]bed as
[normal] climate scientists and they as being concerned with 
[normal]"physics of the climate system (modelling, model development, data acquisition,
[normal] theory development
[normal], etc.)"
[normal]; 
[normal]there’s no breakdown of skills explaining
[normal] h
[normal]ow many were climate modellers
[normal] 
[normal]and how many
[normal] observational physicists
[normal].
[normal] Therefore it’s unclear what scientific specialties were represented by the sample addressed – which, in any case, was 
[normal]not 
[normal]globally balanced: of 373 respondents, 
[normal]97% were based in the West – mostly the USA, UK and Germany
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Moreov
[normal]er, the survey 
[normal]doesn’t address issues covered by
[normal] SPM finding 2.1 iii (above)
[normal] and 
[normal]is five years old – opinions could have changed since it was conducted, especially regarding the reliability of models
[normal], the capability of which was 
[normal]already a matter of concern
[normal] to 
[normal]many 
[normal]respondents
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal](ii) AMS
[normal]Only
[normal] 5
[normal]2
[normal]% of respondents thought global warming was happening and was mostly anthropogenic
[normal]; moreover, at most 
[normal]34
[normal]% 
[normal](
[normal]and 
[normal]probably less) 
[normal]believed
[normal] warming 
[normal]was happening, wa
[normal]s mostly anthropogenic 
[normal]and
[normal] would be “very harmful” if nothing were done about it. However, the questionnaire is unsatisfactory in phrasing and structure, making interpretation 
[normal]uncertain
[normal]; also 
[normal]AMS members may not be representative of “climate scientists” as a whole and certainly not
[normal] of such scientists worldwide. Nonetheless, 
[normal]like 
[normal]Bray and von Storch
[normal], 
[normal]this 
[normal]survey indicates 
[normal]that the 
[normal]principal 
[normal]AR5 
[normal]findings
[normal] 
[normal]probably
[normal] reflect climate scientists’
[normal] views to 
[normal]no
[normal] more than a limited extent.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  3.4  There’s more evidence of this from
[normal] 
[normal]within the 
[normal]SPM itself. It’s interesting to compare the key SPM finding – “
[normal]It is 
[normal]extremely likely 
[normal]that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century” – with Table SPM.1 (SPM page 5). The latter consists of four columns:
[normal] of these, column 1 lists various phenomena (e.g. “Warmer and/or fewer cold days and nights over most land areas”) and column 3 consists of assessments of “human contribution to observed changes”. For example, it assesses that a human contribution to “Warm
[normal]er and/or fewer cold days and nights …” was “very likely” (Note: not “extremely likely”). 
[normal]But “
[normal]contribution
[normal]” is a very different concept from the “
[normal]the dominant cause
[normal]” of the 
[normal]key
[normal] AR5 finding
[normal]: a
[normal]s noted 
[normal]above
[normal], a contribution could be relatively trivial. So th
[normal]e assessment that a contribution is “very likely” is hardly a useful finding: many sceptical scientists would agree. 
[normal]This
[normal] huge difference between the key SPM finding and the Table SPM.1 assessment, suggest
[normal]s t
[normal]hat the scientists who compiled the Table may ha
[normal]ve had a different view about attribution from those who drafted the overall finding.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  3.5  
[normal]One thing that would seem clear from the above evidence is that there’s widespread scientific agreement that mankind has made a significant 
[normal]contribution to global
[normal] warming. However, there’s some evidence that it’s a view that may not be shared universally. For example, Ding Zhongli, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (described as “
[normal]the final word on climate science for the Chinese Communist Party
[normal]”)
[normal], 
[normal]has observed that a significant relationship between temperature and CO2 “
[normal]lacks reliable evidence in science
[normal]”
[normal] [bold]. And h
[normal]ere’s a comment
[normal] made 
[normal]in 2010 
[normal]by Xie Zhenhua, who led China’s delegation at the recent UN climate summit in Warsaw:
[normal]"
[normal]There are disputes in
[normal] the scientific community. We have to have an open attitude to the scientific research. There's an alternative view that climate change is caused by cyclical trends in nature itself. We have to keep an open attitude
[normal]."
[normal]There’s 
[normal]some 
[normal]evidence that Russian
[normal], 
[normal]Indian
[normal] 
[normal]and possibly Polish
[normal] 
[normal]scientists may share this view.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.  CONCLUSIONS 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  4.1 
[normal]As only a small part of AR5 has so far been published, it’s not strictly possible to answer the Committee’s question. However, even if the question is modified to addres
[normal]s that part of AR5 that has been published (the SPM), there are still practical problems – because, for example, of the substantial detail comprised by the SPM. And even the expedient of focusing on the 
[normal]three principal SPM findings
[normal] fails to provide a satis
[normal]factory answer. Taking the SPM findings in turn:
[normal] 
[normal](i)  
[normal]“[bold]Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia
[normal].” 
[normal]Although the evidence (of worldwide opinion) is thin, suc
[normal]h as there is indicates that it’s almost certain that climate scientists agree with the first part. However, the phrasing of second part is so vague (“
[normal]many of the observed changes
[normal]” and “
[normal]decades to millennia
[normal]”) as to be almost meaningless. So scientists’ opi
[normal]nion
[normal], even if available, 
[normal]would be of little value. 
[normal](ii)  “
[normal]It is 
[normal]extremely likely
[normal] 
[normal]that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century
[normal].” 
[normal]Human influence on the climate 
[normal]was
[normal] specifically covered by 
[normal]all the 
[normal]above
[normal] studies. However, none consulted a representative sample of scientists worldwide and most have not resolved
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]Beyond Expertise 
[normal]Problem
[normal] (1.3 above). And even the commonly held view that climate scientists agree that mankind has made a significant co
[normal]ntribution to global warming is essentially meaningless (
[normal]see 
[normal]3.2 (i) and (iii) above) and, in any case, may not be universally accepted (
[normal]see 
[normal]3.5). 
[normal]But, in particular
[normal], there appears to be little useful evidence 
[normal]that climate scientists agree 
[normal]with 
[normal]the AR5’s  “dominant cause” finding.  
[normal] (iii)  “
[normal]Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse 
[normal]gas emissions
[normal].
[normal]” 
[normal]Neither of these claims seems to have been the subject of any 
[normal]significant examination of climate scientists’ opinion – except perhaps the AMS survey (3.3 
[normal]ii 
[normal]above), which 
[normal]indicates
[normal] that only a minority of scientists agree with these findin
[normal]gs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  4.2  These difficulties and uncertainties 
[normal]largely 
[normal]stem from the fact that the only way to establish a satisfactory answer 
[normal]would be
[normal] 
[normal]to conduct a 
[normal]worldwide, 
[normal]properly constructed and correctly implemented opinion survey
[normal], unambiguously covering all the
[normal] SPM’s main findings.
[normal] 
[normal]The AMS survey and especially 
[normal]the 
[normal]Bray and von Storch 
[normal]survey 
[normal]g
[normal]ot
[normal] close
[normal]st
[normal] to 
[normal]t
[normal]his
[normal]. But 
[normal]not entirely
[normal]: for example, 
[normal]Bray and von Storch 
[normal]didn’t cover 
[normal]the 
[normal]AR5 findings 
[normal]at 
[normal]2.2 iii (above)
[normal], its sample 
[normal]was
[normal] inadequate and
[normal] 
[normal]the study 
[normal]does 
[normal]not 
[normal]seem to have resolved the 
[normal]Beyond Expertise 
[normal]Problem
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]complexity of such a survey and
[normal], in particular, 
[normal]the need for 
[normal]a
[normal]n accurate and consistent
[normal] worldwide response make it unlikely that it would be practicable
[normal] – consider, for example, translation difficulties
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]  4.
[normal]3
[normal]  
[normal]In summary, the inadequacy of useful evidence 
[normal]means that 
[normal]the extent to which the SPM reflects climate scientists’ views is both unknown and likely to continue to be unknown
[normal]. Therefore it’s 
[normal]impossi
[normal]ble to provide a reliable answer to the Committee’s question. However, such evidence as does exist indicates that the answer 
[normal]would probably be
[normal] that AR5 r
[normal]eflect
[normal]s
[normal] the range of views among climate scientists 
[normal]to only 
[normal]a very limited extent.
