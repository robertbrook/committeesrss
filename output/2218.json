"&#xa0;\nJoyce Poulter – Written Evidence&#xa0;\nI have lived for 41years in a small village in the Peak District National Park (PDNPA) and for several years \nI\n was a \nvoluntary  PDNPA\n ranger. I have always been a keen walker and have a deep concern for the protection of Rights of Way.\n&#xa0;\nFor the past 3 .5 yrs. I have been involved in monitoring  the use of a local route,Chertpit and Leys Lane,Great Longstone, and I will be happy to submit all records if required. The lane became classified as a BOAT following a public Inquiry in\n \nFeb.\n \n2010.\n \nThe\n \ninspector's \ndecision\n \nwas\n \nbased\n \non\n \nhistorical\n \nevidence-\n \nthat\n \nis\n \nthe\n \nprobability\n \nthat\n \nthe\n \nroute\n \nhad\n \nhistorically\n \nbeen\n \nused\n \nby\n \nhorse\n \nand\n \ncarriage.\n \nLocal\n \npeople\n \nfound\n \nthis\n \ndifficult\n \nto\n \ncomprehend as the narrowest section of the route is only 2 metres wide between the\n \nancient walls. This concern was reflected in the number who attended  the inquiry- over 90 on the first day\n \nand slightly less on the next two days. This is in a village with a population of 843.\n&#xa0;\nOver the previous 10 years the route was used occasionally mainly by trail bikes but now, as a BOAT, it is used frequently not only by trail bikes but  also by quad bikes and 4x4's. Please see the photograph number 1. This was taken in the narrowest section of the route. Please notice that the rear left wheels are touching the foundation stones of the field walls and the right side wing mirror  is touching the opposite wall. Please see photograph number 2. This again was taken in the narrowest section. Where do walkers, cyclists and horse riders\n \ngo? The horse riders are no longer able to use the lane as it is too dangerous for both horse and rider, cyclists have had to lift bikes over the walls, or in some cases over the vehicles, and walkers have to retreat,climb walls or give up using the lane.\n&#xa0;\nFollowing the Inquiry in Feb. 2010 appeals were made to the Highway Authority  Derbyshire County Counci for a Traffic Regulation Order without success. In Feb.2o12 the local campaigning group \"rocking the BOAT\" submitted a request for a TRO to the\n \nPeak District National Park Authority. We are still waiting for a public consultation  process. Meanwhile\n \non\n \nthe\n \nlane\n \ndamage\n \nto\n \nthe\n \nroute\n \nand\n \nthe\n \nwalls\n \ncontinues. \n \nPlease see photograph  number 3 taken in April this year and notice the damage to the walls. The grass verges have all been eroded and vehicles are now damaging the foundation stones. There is more anxiety felt\n \nby the walkers and cyclists and it is reported that it is\n \nnot only the horse riders who feel prohibited but also walkers and cyclists.\n&#xa0;\nThese\n \nare\n \nmy\n \ncomments\n \nabout\n \njust\n \none\n \nlane\n \nin\n \nthe\n \nPeak\n \nDistrict\n \nNational\n \nPark\n \nbut\n \nI\n \nknow \nthat\n \nthere\n \nare\n \nmany\n \nothers\n \nin\n \na\n \nsimilar\n \nsituation \n \nthroughout\n \nthe\n \nPDNP.\n&#xa0;\nMuch\n \ncould\n \nbe\n \ndone\n \nby\n \namendments\n \nto\n \nthe\n \nDeregulation \n \nBill\n \nto\n \nease\n \nthe\n \nproblems\n \nI have\n \nmentioned.\n&#xa0;\nI propose\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn addition to my personal proposals I expressly support the formal submissions made by the Green Lanes \nEnvironmental  Action\n Movement (GLEAM),  the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG),the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance  (PDGLA),the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance(YDGLA) and the local group \"rocking the BOAT\"\n.\nYours\n \nsincerely\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nPictures 1 and 2 not published here.\n"
