[normal]Summary
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Level crossings are one of the major risks of a catastrophic derailment, and would not be countenanced if the railway were being built new today. Network Rail has transformed its approach to level crossings in the current control period, reducing risk by 2
[normal]5% since 2009 and meeting our target a year early. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To keep improving safety and reducing risk, we would like to see improved co-operation with local authorities to help us close crossings, stronger and more consistent penalties for driving offences at le
[normal]vel crossings, and most importantly, support from government for our ambition for the next control period.
