[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]Section 10 of the Chief Executive’s report to the CQC Board Meeting of 18
[normal]th
[normal] September 2013 reads as follows, so far as is relevant to this submission:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10 Registered Managers
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An unacceptably high proportion of services are operating without having a registered manager (RM). In June 2013 there were over 3900 locations which did not have a RM, and of these over a quarter had not had a RM for over two years. This represents 2% of locations where a RM is a required condition of registration. ...
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When a provider registers with CQC they commit to meet the requirements of their registration. The failure to have a registered manager, where this is required, 
[normal]without reasonable excuse[bold] is a breach of a condition of a provider’s registration and an offence under Section 33(b) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (the Act). It is the provider’s legal obligation to comply with such a condition. Analysis of our inspection findings shows that adult social care locations without a RM have had significantly higher non-compliance rates than those with a RM at some point over the last two years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As a failure to comply with a condition of registration is an “offence” under the Act, CQC can take criminal action, which includes a caution, fixed penalty notice, or prosecution. To date the usual response from CQC is to write to providers informing them of the need to take action in this regard. One warning notice has been served. We therefore need to take more effective and robust action against providers who have failed to comply with the conditions of their registration with regard to appointing a RM. We propose to focus initially on providers where active locations have been in breach of this condition over the longest period of time (initially over two years – i.e. those least likely to have “reasonable excuse”, and with no application in the process of being considered). These providers will be alerted to CQC’s intention to issue a fixed penalty notice. We need to have a consistent and proportionate approach, whilst not fettering our discretion.
[normal].....
[normal]We expect to commence issuing fixed penalty notices from October 2013. Having looked into each location without a RM for 24 months for phase 1, we will evaluate the work and aim to move on to those locations which haven’t had a RM in place for 12 months as phase 2 of this work.
[normal][My emphasis][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]If this number is correct it begs the question as to why new 
[normal]‘action
[normal]’ deemed appropriate is being taken only now.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]On 18
[normal]th
[normal] September 2012 I made a FOI request as follows:
[normal]Please would you supply the numbers of regulated services of each type that are subject to a registered manager condition but which do not currently have a registered manager, with totals of currently registered services for each type.
[normal]The response dated 16
[normal]th
[normal] October 2012 stated as follows, so far as relevant here:
[normal]We are unable to provide you with figures for care services that do not currently have a registered manager. The only way we could determine this information would be to read the text of each registered manager condition and interrogate each certificate of registration relating to the 3,472 care services.
[normal].....
[normal]This request has highlighted this issue and moving forward we hope to implement a fix into our system to allow for this information to be easily reported.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We can advise that your request is similar in its nature to one we have received from the Department of Health. Although we are unable to provide you with a definitive answer to your request at this point in time we will endeavour to provide you with the information once we are able to report this from our system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We do not currently have a set date for the fix to be implemented but when it is we will provide a response to the Department of Health and to you.
[normal]Thus it appears that the trigger for action at the present time is the recent availability of the figures, and not an increase in such concerns as there may be as to the effects of registered manager vacancies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]All services, including those to be targeted first, have been subject to routine inspections 
[normal]within the last year
[normal], and if the situation demanded urgent action or enforcement in any of them presumably such action would have been taken at that time.
[normal] 
[normal]The inspecting officer would have direct knowledge of registration status at each location, and where no enforcement action was taken there would be a legitimate expectation that the provider had been deemed by the inspecting officer to have a reasonable excuse.
[normal] 
[normal]However embarrassing the new figure might be at this particular time, the Board of CQC is bound by those judgements, and the figures are not, without more (namely relevant new findings on re-inspection), a valid basis for reversal of those judgements in any individual case, or for a blanket threat to 3,900 providers of £4,000 penalty notices.
[normal] 
[normal]The fixed penalty notice is a sanction under the criminal code, requiring discharge of the corresponding burden of proof not evident in the proposed plan of action.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]The regulatory authority could not honestly believe that there are 3,900 suitable applicants for registered manager posts currently growing on trees near to where they are needed.
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]most immediate, and insoluble, problem with the declared new policy is that is incapable of being applied fairly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]              
[normal]The starting position of CQC appears to be that the existence of a “reasonable excuse” falls to be determined by the lapse of time since there was a registered manager, with the implication that the excuse will (normally) lapse after an arbitrary period, with protection perhaps only in the event of some exceptional circumstance, and such a position would be in error as to the law of reasonable excuse.
[normal] 
[normal]Given the serious consequences of enforcement in this area CQC
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]should consult on and publish clear guidance as to the criteria they propose to apply.
[normal] 
[normal]Indeed section 23(1) of the Act requires CQC to do so.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7
[normal]              
[normal]In 
[normal]Barbara Ellen Joyce v NCSC [2003]
[normal] the Tribunal allowed the appeal against cancellation of registration, rejecting cancellation on the ground of a vacant registered manager post alone.
[normal] 
[normal]There is no reason to believe that the later change of legislation makes this case ‘bad law’.
[normal]1.8
[normal]              
[normal]Given the information available to the Commission it would be perfectly possible, and arguably much more appropriate and proportionate, to determine “reasonable excuse” against the performance of the service and of its registered provider.
[normal] 
[normal]If the provider has, adopting the words of Regulation 27(4) of the Regulated Activities Regulations 2010, 
[normal]taken all [bold]reasonable[bold] steps[bold] to appoint a registered manager and in the meanwhile has 
[normal]exercised all due diligence[bold] in ensuring that any identifiable risks consequent on the vacancy are minimised, then surely that should satisfy the defence of reasonable excuse independent of arbitrary time criteria.
[normal] 
[normal]Services that have maintained good control of the quality of the service over a long period would be no less likely to have a reasonable excuse, albeit that they would not be immune from continuing efforts to find a suitable applicant.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.9
[normal]              
[normal]This analysis can readily be tested against actual and/or predictable scenarios in the industry.
[normal] 
[normal]From my feedback from providers there are some services where there has not been a registered manager in post for months or longer; but where there is a manager in post who has declined to take on the legal responsibilities attaching to registration (understandable in view of the events of the last two years); and where the service is running smoothly without (other) findings of non
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]compliance with the regulations; and where the unthinking replacement or sidelining of the manager by the first available applicant with little or no experience who might only stay for six months until the next career move would have serious consequences for the stability of the service.
[normal] 
[normal]Furthermore, for CQC to pursue the service in such a way would be incompatible with its statutory duty under section 3(1) of the Act, which provides that “
[normal]The main objective of the Commission in performing its functions is to protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of people who use health and social care services”.
[normal]1.10
[normal]              
[normal]The power of CQC to issue fixed penalty notices was not exercised at all until the end of 2012, and as far as one can tell from the relevant inspection reports has been applied sparingly in cases of serious and unresolved non-compliance with the Regulations with proven attendant high risks to the health safety and welfare of service users.
[normal] 
[normal]Mindful of the evidence that some regulatory authorities have treated penalty systems as a revenue provision, any temptation to raise £15.6m for the Secretary of State by the blanket issue of fixed penalty notices, whatever the pressures, is one that the Commission must resist.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2[bold]              [bold]Rights of representation[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]It is a basic position of domestic law that when a person is accused of a criminal offence there must be a right of reply commensurate with article 6 of the Convention.
[normal] 
[normal]Inspecting officers of the CQC are not infallible in their judgements, published for all the world to see.
[normal] 
[normal]Under pressure from leading legal experts CQC has made some minor changes to representation procedures, but significant deficiencies remain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]A draft inspection report is accompanied by an invitation that “If you have any comments relating to any factual inaccuracies in the report” they may be submitted; in some cases on a “Factual inaccuracy comments log” that is wholly unfit for purpose.
[normal] 
[normal]This is deficient as to the rights of the provider; it is inhibitory to the making of valid challenges to a report; and it evidences fettering of discretion in the handling of representations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]In respect of warning notices CQC’s guidance on representations, amended May 2013, states:
[normal]Representations against a Warning Notice may include that the Warning Notice contains an error, that it is based on inaccurate ‘facts’, that it would be unfair to publish it for some other reason or that it should not have been issued for some other reason.
[normal]The relegation of challenge to the basis for a warning notice to ‘some other reason’ is misleading as to the right of reply and remains deficient as to the rights of the provider; it is inhibitory to the making of valid challenges to the notice; and it evidences fettering of discretion in the handling of representations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Fixed penalty notices
[normal]The Act provides, in effect, a 28 days’ window for reply to a penalty notice.
[normal] 
[normal]CQC guidance makes no reference whatever to the rights of reply to a fixed penalty notice.
[normal] 
[normal]Given that providers will be accustomed to a ‘right’ of reply on factual inaccuracy, this is deficient as to the rights of the provider; it is inhibitory to the making of valid challenges to a notice; and it evidences fettering of discretion in the handling of any representations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]Proposed changes - the fundamental standards
[normal]Criticisms of the proposals of “A new start” mean that we do not yet have full information on the proposed shakeup of the regulatory system, but it is assumed that the new arrangements will bring sharp focus to any evidence of abuse or neglect, with heightened regulatory response.
[normal] 
[normal]The current deficiencies in the effective rights of representation will be of immense importance to a provider who is accused of a breach of “fundamental standards” but whose response, if permitted, might distinguish between the scenario of a Winterbourne View and that of an organisation that goes to the ends of the Earth to safeguard the quality of care but where someone has let them down despite their best efforts.
[normal] 
[normal]The current position does not meet the needs for an effective right of reply.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]A possible path to resolution of the difficulties here might be for the Joint Committee on Human Rights to be asked to review the current status of representations in response to draft inspection reports and statutory notices with a view to recommendations for change.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]              [bold]Unregistered dental practices?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]At a recent seminar in Slough it was put to me that an inspection of the Yellow Pages showed considerable numbers of dental services that were not registered with the Care Quality Commission, and I have carried out my own survey to check this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]I found 
[normal]nine[bold] locations advertising dental services in the Yellow Pages for Ipswich 2012/13 that are, so far as I can tell, not matched by entries in the listing of registered locations from the CQC website for 10
[normal]th
[normal] October 2013 against either the name or the postcode, although I cannot be absolutely sure that any of them are not registered under another identity.
[normal] 
[normal]I have sent the information to the Chief Executive and self-evidently such checks should be made on a national basis.
[normal] 
[normal]While the Commission has 
[normal]powers
[normal] of inspection, it has 
[normal]duties
[normal] to 
[normal]protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of people who use health and social care services; which are not met if it does not take all reasonable steps to ensure that all services are registered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As a matter of courtesy, and in particular in the hope of an urgent review of the approach on vacant manager posts, I have sent a copy of this submission to the Chief Executive David Behan.
