"FBA0014/13-14\n&#xa0;\nAbout the BVCAThis response is submitted on behalf of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (\"BVCA\").  \nThe BVCA is the industry body and \npublic body advocate for the private equity and venture capital industry in the UK.  More than 500 firms make up the BVCA members, including over 2\n0\n0 private equity, mid\n-\nmarket and venture capital firms, together with over 2\n0\n0 professional advisory firms, \nincluding legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisers, corporate financiers, due diligence professionals, environmental advisers, transaction services providers, and placement agents. Additional members include international investors and funds-of-funds\n, secondary purchasers, university teams and academics and fellow national private equity and venture capital associations globally.\n \nThe House of Lords is interested in the context in which the proposed changes would be applied and the evidence should co\nnsider whether the approach of the legislation is appropriate or whether the provisions such as those in the draft Finance Bill 2014 are a symptom of underlying problems with that approach. \nIntroductionThe draft Finance Bill 2014 covers four areas of par\ntnership taxation.  \nOf \nmost \nconcern \nfor the private equity\n and venture capital\n industry are the provisions relating to\n the taxation of limited liability partnership\ns\n \n(\n“\nLLP\ns”\n)\n,\n \nin particular the\n introduction of the concept of a “salaried member”\n.\n \n \nThe LLP is now the industry standard entity through which investment management and advisory businesses \n(“Manager\ns\n”)\n \noperate in the UK\n.\n \n \nIn a private equity \nand venture capital \ncontext, \nManager\ns\n \ntypically\n \ncomprise \nexperienced \nsenior\n executives \nwith \nan esta\nblished investment track record\nrelevant industry experience\n (\nthe \n“LLP Partners”\n)\n.\n   \nAlthough the BVCA is supportive of the aims of the anti-avoidance legislation, our members \nare\n concerned that the draft Bill and the accompanying guidance results in \nvalid \ngenuine \nLLP Partners being reclassified as employees for tax purposes.\n \nHMRC Consultation May 2013T\nhe \nHMRC consultation document published in May 2013 ‘Partnerships: A review of two aspects of the tax rules’ \nproposed \ntwo tests, a case law test and an econ\nomic test\n, for establishing the tax status of \npartners\n. \n \nOur preference was and remains a case law test. \n An approach limited to a purely economic test will not capture the ‘partner’ status of members of the LLP.  In a private equity and venture capital co\nntext, LLP Partners have responsibility for sourcing\n and arranging investments\n, \nand \nmanaging and realising growth from \nthe companies that comprise the investment fund\n.  \nInvestors\n in the funds\n \ncommit to \nmake \na\n long term \ncommitment \nto\nrelationship with\n the\n \nLL\nP Partners\n, who are entrusted\n to utilise \ninvestors’\n money over the life of the fund in order to create growth\n. \n \nAs far as the investors are concerned, the ‘partner’ status of the LLP Partners is generally best determined by a wide range of factors which m\night be described as ‘human capital\n.\n’ \nThis will \ninclud\ne factors such as\n the involvement of the individual in the management of the \nfirm\n and the importance of the individual to long-term \nfund \nperformance\n.\n \n \nThese facts are in addition to the basis of the LLP Partners’ profit allocation and exposure to risk. \nFurthermore\n,\n \nself-employed members \nwithin an LLP structure \ndo not have the benefit of employment law rights. \n \nYet if they were re-classified as a salarie\nd member, they could be liable to income tax and primary NICs as an employee, \nwhile \nnot benefiting \nfrom employment \nprotection\n.\n \n \nUnder current tax rules LLP \nPartner\ns \nare treated as partners and taxed as self\n-\nemployed \nrather than as\n employees.\n \n \nDraft Finance Bill 2014 D\nraft legislation \nwas \npublished on \n10\n December \n2013, \nto be implemented in Finance \nBill 2014\n, setting out new provisions\n to prevent the avoidance of employment taxes through the disguising of employment relationships using an LLP structure\n. \n \nIt\n is important to note\n \nthat we can see the beginnings of our concerns reflected in the legislation because consideration is given to \na range of\n factors\n in the\n determination of ‘partner’ status. \n \nI\nt is helpful that an LLP \nPartner \nhas to meet all three \ncondit\nions (outlined below) \nto be reclassified\n as an employee\n, \nbut there remains scope \nfor genuine partners to be reclassified incorrectly. \n- \nCondition A\n is that the \nrewards\n \nreceived are \nnot varied \nby reference to the profits or losses of the partnership.\n \n&#xa0;\n \nThe\n key question here is whether the relatively predictable income flow and profits of a private equity and venture capital Manager means that \nindividual \nLLP Partners’ shares of profits are “fixed” or “not in practice affected by the overall amount of those p\nrofits or losses”.  \nOver a\n number of years the \nprofit\n \nof a Manager will\n rise or fall depending on\n a number of factors -\n for example, \nthe\n investment period\n of a fund coming to an end\n – but on an annual basis\n,\n w\nith fee income largely dependent on investor \ncommitments\n, \nprofits can be reasonably predictable.  \nMost partnership agreements effectively provide some discretion to vary profits between partners\n so i\nn this context \nsome \nManagers are concerned that their remuneration arrangements \nfall into the category\n of “disguised salary” as set out in the draft legislation\n.\n \n- \nCondition B\n is that the individual \ndoes not have\n \n‘significant influence’ over the affairs of the partnership.\n \n \nThis \narea is causing most concern among \nManagers at\n \nlarge\nr\n private equity and vent\nure capital \nhouses\n.\n \n \nT\nhere are \nvarious governance groups within a typical firm\n that\n approve \no\nperational \nand \ns\ntrateg\nic\n matters of the LLP and also \ni\nnvestment \nc\nommittees which decide on investment matters. \n \nIt is clear that individuals \nin these groups \ndo \nexert significant influence over the partnership but if the legislation is insufficient\nly\n tailored or overly restrictive, the contribution of these individuals could be missed. \nThere is a further issue that even the term ‘\nsignificant\n influence’ cannot cap\nture all of what ‘partner level’ contributions amount to.\n \n This is because individuals can provide essential services without which the firm \ncould not \nfunction\n, that are not necessarily ‘board level’ functions\n. \n \nFor example the \nC\nompliance \nO\nfficer makes a c\nontribution without which the partnership \ncould not operate effectively \n(UK Managers are regulated by the \nFinancial Conduct Authority\n)\n. \n \nOther individuals \nc\nould be considered \nto be\n exercising significant \ninfluence\n by virtue of their investment track recor\nd\n: senior investment professionals\n \nare often identified as\n ‘Keymen’\n in the partne\nrship agreements that set out the terms of private equity and venture capital funds\n.\n \n \nWithin our industry, s\nimply defining ‘significant influence’ using a corporate governance framework could easily miss such individuals and incorrectly reclassify \nthese LLP partners \nas salaried members. \n- \nCondition C\n is that the individual \nhas\n contributed \nless than\n 25% of any f\nixed profit share from the partnership in the form of a capital contribution. \nP\nrivate equity and venture capital\n is a people business and therefore, regulato\nry requirements aside, there is\n not a large amount of working capital required to be invested by th\ne \nLLP P\nartners\n in the \nLLP \nitself\n. \n Very few firms will have asked LLP partners to contribute this level of capital.  It is also worth noting that LLP partners in our industry bear the risk of not raising successor funds and in this sense have significant p\nersonal \n(\nrather than financial\n)\n \ncapital tied up in the business.\nThe nature of this \ndraft \nlegislation \nmeans that\n \nindividual firms \nneed \nto make their own determinations of who should remain a partner before seeking approval of their arrang\ne\nments from HMRC. \n \nIf this is to be feasible in practice, the accompanying guidance and sector specific examples must be thorough. \n \nAs currently drafted there is not enough certainty \nfor our industry and w\ne would \nideally seek \nspecific examples on each of the conditions that\n take a nuanced approach to how LLPs in th\ne\n \nprivate equity and venture capital \nsector work in practice.\nConclusionsWith\n the Alternative Investment Fund\n Managers\n Directive now in force, the \ncontinued promotion of the competitive of the UK as a financial centre, \nis all the more important and we should not deter businesses from using the LLP structure\n, with its inherent flexibility and commercial advantages, \nas a result of any \nnew\n \ntax\n legislati\non. \n \nIndeed as announced in the 2013 Budget, the Government is \ntaking forward a new \nA\nsset \nM\nanagement \nS\ntrategy designed\n to bolster \nexisting competitive strengths.\n \n \nThis is to encourage all fund managers, whether domestic or \ninternational\n,\n to keep raising th\neir funds in the UK\n.\n To be compatible with this approach, \nthe \nFinance Bill 2014 cannot be seen to be adding uncertainty as to how \nfund managers \nmay be taxed. \nNext stepsThe BVCA \nis working \nconstructively \nwith HMRC\n, \nas these changes have a potentially wide\n-ranging impact on the private equity \nand venture capital \nindustry\n. \nW\ne have responded to the\n \nearlier \nconsultation\n and are following up with \nHMRC \nofficials \nto see if we can provide support in drawing up \nindustry-\nspecific \nguidance\n that address\nes\n our concerns. \n \nJanuary 2014 \n
