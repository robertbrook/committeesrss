defaultWritten evidence from Margaret McCartney (GMC0009)default&#xa0;
defaultI am Margaret McCartney, a GP in Glasgow. I write for the medical and lay press, broadcast for Radio 4’s Inside Health, and am the author of The Patient Paradox – why sexed up medicine is bad for your health. 
defaultI have several concerns about the GMC. 
default1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt the moment I can find out what financial conflicts of interest my MP has. But I can’t find out what potential COIs my doctor has – and my patients can’t find out that about me easily (though they have been listed for some time on my blog). So when a doc
defaulttor prescribes me a drug, I’d like to know whether they are a paid consultant to that drug company, whether they have received education from that drug company, etc. The GMC is there to protect patients. Knowing what COIs your doctor has protects patients 
default– not just pharma, but gifts or relationships with PR companies advertising health or other products. The GMC make contact with every doctor every year. Doctors have to pass appraisals every year when ‘probity’ issues are discussed. Why can’t that informat
defaultion be held by the GMC for patients to check, just as they can to see if that doctor is registered with them or not?

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe GMC does not put resources to investigate doctors in the right place. I am aware of many incidences where parking or driving fines or c
defaultharges began a lengthy GMC investigation. There is no robust evidence that driving charges relate to poor medical practice. It is entirely reasonable and right that the GMC should investigate swiftly in cases of sexual assault or violence for example. Howe
defaultver the time and effort to investigate a relatively large amount of doctors is misused. It would be far better to swiftly investigate cases where doctors raise concerns about poor practice. I have evidence that this has taken up to 2 years in recent cases.
default This does not protect patients well enough.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe GMC has recently decided not to investigate doctors who have advertised services which are not evidence based and which make exaggerated claims for medical interventions. Why does the GMC not ensure that do
defaultctors who advertise services must do so fairly, with due regard to tell readers about uncertainties and potential harms?
