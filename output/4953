defaultWritten evidence submitted by the defaultTrade Union Friends of Israel defaultThe UK’s Development Work in the Middle EastdefaultExecutive SummarydefaultThis submission is from Trade Union Friends of Israel (TUFI) and we are delighted to be able to submit relevant 
defaultevidence to this
default important and timely
default inquiry.
default We are particularly interested in the terms of reference to look at building relationships between Israeli and Palestinian organisations as part of conflict resolution
default,
default as well as the important task of state b
defaultuilding for the Palestinians.
defaultTUFI exists to forge a better understanding in the UK of 
defaultthe 
defaultIsraeli and Palestinian trade unions. 
defaultWe also work towards developing relations between the Israeli trade union centre, the Histadrut
default (Israeli equivalent of the UK T
defaultUC)
default and the Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU).
defaultTUFI and our 
defaultsupporters
default 
defaultbelieve 
defaultthat
default supporting and developing a working trade union relationship with practical 
defaultmeasures
default is essential for long lasting peace between Israelis and Palestini
defaultans. Trade unions have a 
defaulthistoric
default 
defaultrole in uniting workers across political divides 
defaultand national borders, and 
defaultw
defaulte believe 
defaultcurrent 
defaultwork
default and future projects 
defaultbased on trade union cooperation 
defaultshould be supported by DFID.
defaultThis submission looks at the existing 
defaultrelationship
default betwee
defaultn the Histadrut and the PGFTU, 
defaultpast and present
default,
default and will make recommendations for fu
defaultture work and financial support

defaultthe Histadrut, the Israeli TUC has commented;
default“
defaultWe strongly support the two state solution and we will 
defaultback an agreement 
defaultwhen the legitimate parties, the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority, reach one. Our practical deeds promote and protect 
defaultthe rights of the 
defaultPalestinian employees. We do no
defaultt “support the occupation”; we support the Palestinian employees. We 
defaultact as a trade union federation which 
defaulttreats
default all the workers in Israel whether they are 
defaultIsraelis
default (Jews and non-Jews), migrant and of course 
defaultPalestinian
default equally. We 
defaultbelieve the 
defaultauthorised 
defaultbodies to 
defaultsolve the conflict are not the trade unions but the 
defaultIsraeli 
defaultgovernment and the Palestinian Authority. We call on both to resume their negotiations and to reach a final settlement which will

default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultThe Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions default(PGFTU)defaultThe PGFTU is a national trade union centre with an estimated membership of 290,000, and is affiliated with the ITUC. The union in its current form is historically aligned with F
defaultatah, but other parties have also worked within its organisation
defaultThe PGFTU traces its modern history to 1965, under Jordanian control of the West Bank, as the successor to the Arab Labourers Society that had been set up in 1921 in Haifa. Its current 
defaultgeneral secretary is Shaher Sa
default'
defaulted, who has held the position for many years. The PGFTU consists of 13 national unions, each with regional and local organizations, in sectors such as Hotels/Tourism, 
defaultHealthcare
default, Textile/Clothing and Construction. 
default&#xa0;
defaultC
defaultooperation between the two federations started in 1993 after the signing of the Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultIn 1995 the Histadrut and the PGFTU 
defaultsigned a precedent-setting agreement 
defaultthat the Histadrut would 
defaultprovide legal representation to Palestinians working for Israeli employers. The PGFTU were to receive 50 per cent of all 
defaulttrade union
default 
defaultfees 
defaultcollected 
defaultfrom Palestinian employees working in Israel.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultHowever, the arrangement froze due to the deteriorating poli
defaulttical and security conditions
default at the end of 2000
default. Differences emerged between the two parties about how much money the Histadrut still owed the PGFTU.
default&#xa0;
default This became increasingly difficult to evaluate over time as the number of Palestinians working in Israel
default significantly dropped during the second intifada.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultA number of critics of Israel within the trade union movement, especially in the UK and Ireland, emphasised the disagreement; repeatedly using it as a justification for promoting trade union boycotts, di
defaultsinvestment and sanctions against Israel.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultHowever, throughout even the most difficult times, the two organisations continued to have dialogue. In time, improved relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led to better union to union cooperati
defaulton. 
default defaultAt the Histadrut’s 2007 annual Congress, the PGFTU was officially represented and the delegation present affirmed its commitment to maintain and extend constructive relations.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultIn October 2007 the Histadrut successfully petitioned Israel’s High Court
default of Justice for Israeli labour law to be applied in the occupied territories.
default&#xa0;
default Nine judges ruled that Palestinians working for Israeli employers in West Bank settlements should be given the same work benefits provided
default to Israeli workers
default by Israeli law.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultI
defaultn another program of joint cooperation, over 20 Israeli and Palestinian transport union representatives signed a number of agreements at a bilateral meeting organised by the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) in June 2007.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe Histadrut an
defaultd the PGFTU continue to meet under the auspices of the ITF.
default&#xa0;
default In February 2008, both parties agreed to facilitate the passage of professional drivers at checkpoints and road blocks in the West Bank.
default&#xa0;defaultOn 24 July 2008, a landmark agreement was reached between the Histadrut and the PGFTU. Facilitated by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) to which both are affiliated, the agreement ‘a
defaultimed at increased protection of Palestinian workers and advancing fraternity and coexistence between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.’  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe agreement’s key features:default&#xa0;
defaultThe agreement involved planning for joint projects:default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 2008 Histadrut-PGFTU Agreement was supported by Global Trade Union movementdefaultAt the default2010 ITUC Congress defaultthere was a rdefaultesolutiondefault that said “defaultCongress welcomes the la
defaultndmark agreement between Histadrut and the PGFTU on the rights of Palestinian workers, which was finalized with the assistance of the ITUC in August 2008, and initiatives by Global Union Federations in their sectors to support cooperation in defense of wor
defaultkers’ rights. This agreement and other actions to promote decent work and end discrimination are crucial to building the basis for just and equitable economic development….[Congress] support the strengthening of cooperation between the Palestinian and Isra
defaulteli trade union movements…’
defaultThe ITUC Secretary-General Guy Ryderdefault hailed the agreement as ‘tremendously significant, at a time when the political authorities in Israel and Palestine and the international community are failing to find just and lasting soluti
defaultons to the political impasse.’ Ryder continued: ‘It means that the PGFTU will be able to ensure much more effective representation for Palestinian workers, while those working for Israeli employers will also benefit.’ 
default ‘The agreement calls upon the ITUC and its affiliates to continue to support future cooperation, and we are fully committed to do this.’ 
defaultPGFTU General Secretary Shaher Sae’ddefault hailed the agreement as good for the Palestinians. ‘This removes a key obstacle 
defaultto future cooperation and the full respec
defaultt of the rights of Palestinian w
defaultorkers. Decent work is a foundation stone for political and economic justice, and we will now be in a position to devote even more attention to tackling the appalling state of the Pal
defaultestinian economy and playing a fuller part in the quest for justice, fairness and democratic rights in the building of a Palestinian state.” 
defaultHistadrut Chairperson Ofer Einidefault hoped the agreement would be the first step towards a greater unity.
default ‘defaultEvery worker
default, whether of Israeli, Palestinian or other origin, must have full rights to the protections offered by international labour standards. The outcome of our dialogue with the PGFTU can only help achieve this, and help lay the foundations for future cooperatio
defaultn between Israeli and Palestinian trade unions and progress in our shared quest for justice, peace and prosperity for all in the region.”   
defaultIn the UK, 
defaultthe 
defaultthen 
defaultTUC General Secretary Brendan Barberdefault praised the 
defaulttwo federations for “carving a path that polit
defaultical leaders could now follow”.
defaultThe International Labor Organisation (ILO)default hailed the agreement as ‘
defaultdisplaying hope on the way to peace’ and a “unique example of cooperation providing a basis for reinvigorated partnership.’ 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Palestinian Human Rights defaultMonitoring Groupdefault noted in their 2010 report that ‘The rights of Palestinian workers have been strengthened over the last two years with increased cooperation between the PGFTU and the Histadrut.
default 
defaultThe 2008 Histadrut and the PGFTU Agreement calls on the intdefaulternational trade unions to build links not break them.defaultThe Histadrut and the PGFTU made a direct appeal to the international movement in their 2008 agreement. Clause 5 states ‘It is agreed by the parties that relations between the Israeli and Palestinian t
defaultrade unions shall be based on negotiations, dialogue, and the conduct of meetings and joint projects (e.g. professional courses and workshops) that will promote the rights of Israeli and Palestinian workers and pensioners and will advance fraternity and co
default-existence between the two peoples.’ Crucially, for UK trade unionists, clause 6 ‘
defaultcall[s] for support from ITUC and its affiliates throughout the world, and other trade unions throughout the world and other international organisations in order to fulfil thdefaulte provisions of defaultthe defaultclause default&#xa0;
defaultThe Histadrut
default 
defaultreleased a statement to the world-wide trade union movement outlining its supp
defaultort for a two-state solution, Israeli and Palestinian workers’ rights and its developing relationship with Palestinian trade unions.
defaultThe Histadrut urges “the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority (PA) to immediately resume their negotiations,” 
defaultand says it understands and is concerned “by the effects the restrictions on movement and the security fence/wall can have on the lives of Palestinian workers and their families”.
default&#xa0;
default The federation says it supports the decision to remove security checkpoints
default in the context of the renewed security situation and calls upon the “Israeli government to dismantle all illegal outposts”.
defaultThe statement goes on to say that the Histadrut recognises these problems and steadfastly works with the Palestine General Federati
defaulton of Trade Unions (PGFTU) to mitigate them whilst negotiations on the wider issues take place.
defaultIsraeli and Palestinian trade unions have been successfully working together and signing 
defaultco-operation agreements
default over the last few years, and the Histadrut’s statement says it is their duty, as trade unionists, to be involved with the peace process and serve 
defaultas role-models. 
defaultThe Histadrut says: “
defaultThe ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine is very complex and our goal is to reach an understanding and to look for common denominators. We believe that the only way to overcome the hostility is through peace a
defaultnd trust, such as that which exists today between the Histadrut and the PGFTU.”
defaultGuy Ryder, the
default then
default ITUC General Secretary hailed the Histadrut 
defaultstatement
default as 
default"an important and welcome call for dialogue and progress to achieve the objective of two states co-existing in conditions of peace and security, and full respect for the rights of all working people.” He 
defaultsaid Israeli-Palestinian
default trade union co-operation has an important “contribution to make in promoting peace and mutual understanding in the Middle East.”
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAfter meeting with senior Israeli and Palestinian trade unionists in Israel and the West Bank, Guy Ryder said ‘with the pea
defaultce process effectively in stalemate at present, the ITUC’s working together with our Israeli and Palestinian affiliates is especially important.’
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the years 2011-2013 the Histadrut has continued to set as a primary goal the enhancement of 
defaultthe ongoing relationship with PGFT
defaultU. Throughout all these years they 
default have provided legal support for Palestinian workers (in Arabic), encouraged participation in educational and vocational training workshops (particularly in the construction sector where 
defaultthe majority of Palestinians are employed), and distributed brochures printed in Arabic outlining their rights. Most significantly, a new joint Histadrut-PGFTU project for providing legal assistance for Palestinians employed by Israeli employers was set up
default. The project allows Palestinians legally employed by Israeli employers to lodge complaints with the PGFTU who addresses the Histadrut's Legal Department who manages the cases opposite the Israeli employers and if necessary in the Israeli Labour Courts.
defaultT
defaulthroughout 2011-2013 the Histadrut continued to fulfil its financial obligations set out in the 2008 landmark agreement with the PGFTU, according to which half the 
defaulttrade union
default 
defaultfees collected by the Histadrut from legal Palestinian workers employed by Israel
defaulti employers are transferred to the PGFTU. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Histadrut also continues to assist and provide solidarity to the PGFTU in any additional ways it can. For example, in 2011, the Histadrut, upon the request of the PGFTU, assisted the Scottish Fire Brigade's U
defaultnion in transferring humanitarian aid in the form of fire engines, lifesaving firefighting equipment and uniforms to the Nablus fire station.
defaultIn 2013 PGFTU requested the assistance of the Histadrut in finding employment opportunities in the Israeli constr
defaultuction sector for Palestinian workers who are PGFTU members and the Histadrut is currently implementing this venture.
defaultSpecifically in the construction sector where the majority of Palestinians are employed, over the last year the Israeli union has been ho
defaultsting a senior grievance committee which settles all labour disputes between employees and employers. In the framework of the cooperation between the Histadrut and the PGFTU, 
defaultthe Histadrut
default 
defaultrequest
defaults
default 
defaultthe participation of PGFTU representatives in meetings whe
defaultre disputes between Palestinian workers and Israeli employers are discussed.
defaultIn addition, they also allocated in 
defaultthe 
defaultconstruction union headquarters an additional attorney, an Arab citizen, who provides legal consultation specifically for the Palestinian 
defaultemployees. The union also provides vocational training to thousands of Palestinians and migrant workers on the topic of health and safety in working on skyscrapers.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe 
defaulthistory of the relationship between the Israeli and Palestinian trade 
defaultunions demonstrates a willingness to work across the divide of this long standing conflict. Therefore we would welcome the committee to recognise the work that exists and make recommendations for support of future work that we have outlined in this evidenc
defaulte.
