[normal]Written evidence submitted by the [bold]Trade Union Friends of Israel [bold]The UK’s Development Work in the Middle East[bold]Executive Summary[bold]This submission is from Trade Union Friends of Israel (TUFI) and we are delighted to be able to submit relevant 
[normal]evidence to this
[normal] important and timely
[normal] inquiry.
[normal] We are particularly interested in the terms of reference to look at building relationships between Israeli and Palestinian organisations as part of conflict resolution
[normal],
[normal] as well as the important task of state b
[normal]uilding for the Palestinians.
[normal]TUFI exists to forge a better understanding in the UK of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Israeli and Palestinian trade unions. 
[normal]We also work towards developing relations between the Israeli trade union centre, the Histadrut
[normal] (Israeli equivalent of the UK T
[normal]UC)
[normal] and the Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU).
[normal]TUFI and our 
[normal]supporters
[normal] 
[normal]believe 
[normal]that
[normal] supporting and developing a working trade union relationship with practical 
[normal]measures
[normal] is essential for long lasting peace between Israelis and Palestini
[normal]ans. Trade unions have a 
[normal]historic
[normal] 
[normal]role in uniting workers across political divides 
[normal]and national borders, and 
[normal]w
[normal]e believe 
[normal]current 
[normal]work
[normal] and future projects 
[normal]based on trade union cooperation 
[normal]should be supported by DFID.
[normal]This submission looks at the existing 
[normal]relationship
[normal] betwee
[normal]n the Histadrut and the PGFTU, 
[normal]past and present
[normal],
[normal] and will make recommendations for fu
[normal]ture work and financial support
[normal]. 
[normal]Trade Union friends of Israel (TUFI) calls on the Department for International Development to consider funding and supp
[normal]orting 
[normal]the following Histadrut and PGFTU projects:

[normal]Talking[bold] to the Histadru[bold]t[bold]Avital Shapira-Shabirow
[normal] [bold]is the Director of International Relations in the International Department of 
[normal]the Histadrut, the Israeli TUC has commented;
[normal]“
[normal]We strongly support the two state solution and we will 
[normal]back an agreement 
[normal]when the legitimate parties, the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority, reach one. Our practical deeds promote and protect 
[normal]the rights of the 
[normal]Palestinian employees. We do no
[normal]t “support the occupation”; we support the Palestinian employees. We 
[normal]act as a trade union federation which 
[normal]treats
[normal] all the workers in Israel whether they are 
[normal]Israelis
[normal] (Jews and non-Jews), migrant and of course 
[normal]Palestinian
[normal] equally. We 
[normal]believe the 
[normal]authorised 
[normal]bodies to 
[normal]solve the conflict are not the trade unions but the 
[normal]Israeli 
[normal]government and the Palestinian Authority. We call on both to resume their negotiations and to reach a final settlement which will 
[normal]resolve 
[normal]all the bones of contention, including the issue
[normal] of the borders
[normal]”
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions [bold](PGFTU)[bold]The PGFTU is a national trade union centre with an estimated membership of 290,000, and is affiliated with the ITUC. The union in its current form is historically aligned with F
[normal]atah, but other parties have also worked within its organisation
[normal]The PGFTU traces its modern history to 1965, under Jordanian control of the West Bank, as the successor to the Arab Labourers Society that had been set up in 1921 in Haifa. Its current 
[normal]general secretary is Shaher Sa
[normal]'
[normal]ed, who has held the position for many years. The PGFTU consists of 13 national unions, each with regional and local organizations, in sectors such as Hotels/Tourism, 
[normal]Healthcare
[normal], Textile/Clothing and Construction. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]C
[normal]ooperation between the two federations started in 1993 after the signing of the Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]In 1995 the Histadrut and the PGFTU 
[normal]signed a precedent-setting agreement 
[normal]that the Histadrut would 
[normal]provide legal representation to Palestinians working for Israeli employers. The PGFTU were to receive 50 per cent of all 
[normal]trade union
[normal] 
[normal]fees 
[normal]collected 
[normal]from Palestinian employees working in Israel.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]However, the arrangement froze due to the deteriorating poli
[normal]tical and security conditions
[normal] at the end of 2000
[normal]. Differences emerged between the two parties about how much money the Histadrut still owed the PGFTU.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This became increasingly difficult to evaluate over time as the number of Palestinians working in Israel
[normal] significantly dropped during the second intifada.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]A number of critics of Israel within the trade union movement, especially in the UK and Ireland, emphasised the disagreement; repeatedly using it as a justification for promoting trade union boycotts, di
[normal]sinvestment and sanctions against Israel.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]However, throughout even the most difficult times, the two organisations continued to have dialogue. In time, improved relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led to better union to union cooperati
[normal]on. 
[normal] [bold]At the Histadrut’s 2007 annual Congress, the PGFTU was officially represented and the delegation present affirmed its commitment to maintain and extend constructive relations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]In October 2007 the Histadrut successfully petitioned Israel’s High Court
[normal] of Justice for Israeli labour law to be applied in the occupied territories.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Nine judges ruled that Palestinians working for Israeli employers in West Bank settlements should be given the same work benefits provided
[normal] to Israeli workers
[normal] by Israeli law.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n another program of joint cooperation, over 20 Israeli and Palestinian transport union representatives signed a number of agreements at a bilateral meeting organised by the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) in June 2007.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]The Histadrut an
[normal]d the PGFTU continue to meet under the auspices of the ITF.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In February 2008, both parties agreed to facilitate the passage of professional drivers at checkpoints and road blocks in the West Bank.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]On 24 July 2008, a landmark agreement was reached between the Histadrut and the PGFTU. Facilitated by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) to which both are affiliated, the agreement ‘a
[normal]imed at increased protection of Palestinian workers and advancing fraternity and coexistence between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.’  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The agreement’s key features:[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The agreement involved planning for joint projects:[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 2008 Histadrut-PGFTU Agreement was supported by Global Trade Union movement[bold]At the [bold]2010 ITUC Congress [bold]there was a r[bold]esolution[bold] that said “[bold]Congress welcomes the la
[normal]ndmark agreement between Histadrut and the PGFTU on the rights of Palestinian workers, which was finalized with the assistance of the ITUC in August 2008, and initiatives by Global Union Federations in their sectors to support cooperation in defense of wor
[normal]kers’ rights. This agreement and other actions to promote decent work and end discrimination are crucial to building the basis for just and equitable economic development….[Congress] support the strengthening of cooperation between the Palestinian and Isra
[normal]eli trade union movements…’
[normal]The ITUC Secretary-General Guy Ryder[bold] hailed the agreement as ‘tremendously significant, at a time when the political authorities in Israel and Palestine and the international community are failing to find just and lasting soluti
[normal]ons to the political impasse.’ Ryder continued: ‘It means that the PGFTU will be able to ensure much more effective representation for Palestinian workers, while those working for Israeli employers will also benefit.’ 
[normal] ‘The agreement calls upon the ITUC and its affiliates to continue to support future cooperation, and we are fully committed to do this.’ 
[normal]PGFTU General Secretary Shaher Sae’d[bold] hailed the agreement as good for the Palestinians. ‘This removes a key obstacle 
[normal]to future cooperation and the full respec
[normal]t of the rights of Palestinian w
[normal]orkers. Decent work is a foundation stone for political and economic justice, and we will now be in a position to devote even more attention to tackling the appalling state of the Pal
[normal]estinian economy and playing a fuller part in the quest for justice, fairness and democratic rights in the building of a Palestinian state.” 
[normal]Histadrut Chairperson Ofer Eini[bold] hoped the agreement would be the first step towards a greater unity.
[normal] ‘[bold]Every worker
[normal], whether of Israeli, Palestinian or other origin, must have full rights to the protections offered by international labour standards. The outcome of our dialogue with the PGFTU can only help achieve this, and help lay the foundations for future cooperatio
[normal]n between Israeli and Palestinian trade unions and progress in our shared quest for justice, peace and prosperity for all in the region.”   
[normal]In the UK, 
[normal]the 
[normal]then 
[normal]TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber[bold] praised the 
[normal]two federations for “carving a path that polit
[normal]ical leaders could now follow”.
[normal]The International Labor Organisation (ILO)[bold] hailed the agreement as ‘
[normal]displaying hope on the way to peace’ and a “unique example of cooperation providing a basis for reinvigorated partnership.’ 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Palestinian Human Rights [bold]Monitoring Group[bold] noted in their 2010 report that ‘The rights of Palestinian workers have been strengthened over the last two years with increased cooperation between the PGFTU and the Histadrut.
[normal] 
[normal]The 2008 Histadrut and the PGFTU Agreement calls on the int[bold]ernational trade unions to build links not break them.[bold]The Histadrut and the PGFTU made a direct appeal to the international movement in their 2008 agreement. Clause 5 states ‘It is agreed by the parties that relations between the Israeli and Palestinian t
[normal]rade unions shall be based on negotiations, dialogue, and the conduct of meetings and joint projects (e.g. professional courses and workshops) that will promote the rights of Israeli and Palestinian workers and pensioners and will advance fraternity and co
[normal]-existence between the two peoples.’ Crucially, for UK trade unionists, clause 6 ‘
[normal]call[s] for support from ITUC and its affiliates throughout the world, and other trade unions throughout the world and other international organisations in order to fulfil th[bold]e provisions of [bold]the [bold]clause [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Histadrut
[normal] 
[normal]released a statement to the world-wide trade union movement outlining its supp
[normal]ort for a two-state solution, Israeli and Palestinian workers’ rights and its developing relationship with Palestinian trade unions.
[normal]The Histadrut urges “the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority (PA) to immediately resume their negotiations,” 
[normal]and says it understands and is concerned “by the effects the restrictions on movement and the security fence/wall can have on the lives of Palestinian workers and their families”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The federation says it supports the decision to remove security checkpoints
[normal] in the context of the renewed security situation and calls upon the “Israeli government to dismantle all illegal outposts”.
[normal]The statement goes on to say that the Histadrut recognises these problems and steadfastly works with the Palestine General Federati
[normal]on of Trade Unions (PGFTU) to mitigate them whilst negotiations on the wider issues take place.
[normal]Israeli and Palestinian trade unions have been successfully working together and signing 
[normal]co-operation agreements
[normal] over the last few years, and the Histadrut’s statement says it is their duty, as trade unionists, to be involved with the peace process and serve 
[normal]as role-models. 
[normal]The Histadrut says: “
[normal]The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine is very complex and our goal is to reach an understanding and to look for common denominators. We believe that the only way to overcome the hostility is through peace a
[normal]nd trust, such as that which exists today between the Histadrut and the PGFTU.”
[normal]Guy Ryder, the
[normal] then
[normal] ITUC General Secretary hailed the Histadrut 
[normal]statement
[normal] as 
[normal]"an important and welcome call for dialogue and progress to achieve the objective of two states co-existing in conditions of peace and security, and full respect for the rights of all working people.” He 
[normal]said Israeli-Palestinian
[normal] trade union co-operation has an important “contribution to make in promoting peace and mutual understanding in the Middle East.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]After meeting with senior Israeli and Palestinian trade unionists in Israel and the West Bank, Guy Ryder said ‘with the pea
[normal]ce process effectively in stalemate at present, the ITUC’s working together with our Israeli and Palestinian affiliates is especially important.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the years 2011-2013 the Histadrut has continued to set as a primary goal the enhancement of 
[normal]the ongoing relationship with PGFT
[normal]U. Throughout all these years they 
[normal] have provided legal support for Palestinian workers (in Arabic), encouraged participation in educational and vocational training workshops (particularly in the construction sector where 
[normal]the majority of Palestinians are employed), and distributed brochures printed in Arabic outlining their rights. Most significantly, a new joint Histadrut-PGFTU project for providing legal assistance for Palestinians employed by Israeli employers was set up
[normal]. The project allows Palestinians legally employed by Israeli employers to lodge complaints with the PGFTU who addresses the Histadrut's Legal Department who manages the cases opposite the Israeli employers and if necessary in the Israeli Labour Courts.
[normal]T
[normal]hroughout 2011-2013 the Histadrut continued to fulfil its financial obligations set out in the 2008 landmark agreement with the PGFTU, according to which half the 
[normal]trade union
[normal] 
[normal]fees collected by the Histadrut from legal Palestinian workers employed by Israel
[normal]i employers are transferred to the PGFTU. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Histadrut also continues to assist and provide solidarity to the PGFTU in any additional ways it can. For example, in 2011, the Histadrut, upon the request of the PGFTU, assisted the Scottish Fire Brigade's U
[normal]nion in transferring humanitarian aid in the form of fire engines, lifesaving firefighting equipment and uniforms to the Nablus fire station.
[normal]In 2013 PGFTU requested the assistance of the Histadrut in finding employment opportunities in the Israeli constr
[normal]uction sector for Palestinian workers who are PGFTU members and the Histadrut is currently implementing this venture.
[normal]Specifically in the construction sector where the majority of Palestinians are employed, over the last year the Israeli union has been ho
[normal]sting a senior grievance committee which settles all labour disputes between employees and employers. In the framework of the cooperation between the Histadrut and the PGFTU, 
[normal]the Histadrut
[normal] 
[normal]request
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]the participation of PGFTU representatives in meetings whe
[normal]re disputes between Palestinian workers and Israeli employers are discussed.
[normal]In addition, they also allocated in 
[normal]the 
[normal]construction union headquarters an additional attorney, an Arab citizen, who provides legal consultation specifically for the Palestinian 
[normal]employees. The union also provides vocational training to thousands of Palestinians and migrant workers on the topic of health and safety in working on skyscrapers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The 
[normal]history of the relationship between the Israeli and Palestinian trade 
[normal]unions demonstrates a willingness to work across the divide of this long standing conflict. Therefore we would welcome the committee to recognise the work that exists and make recommendations for support of future work that we have outlined in this evidenc
[normal]e.
