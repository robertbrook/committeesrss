defaultCapital
default 
defaultCity
default enjoys the benefits of a strategic transport body, Transport for 
defaultLondon
default, with an integrated single set of policy and investment powers to plan for transport in the cap
defaultital. Across our core cities there is no equivalence which can ensure
default that
default transport maximises economic, socia
defaultl and environmental benefits – 
defaultCore Cities
default are operating under a structure that is heavily centralised to central government. Excluding recent cha
defaultnges to business rate local retention, which makes little difference in this respect, 
default 
default 95% of all tax raised in English Cities goes to national government.

defaultThe 
defaultUK
default ranks only 34th in the world for its infrastructure, 6th in the G8 countries, and only spen
defaultds 1.5% of GDP on infrastructure compared to 6% in 
defaultJapan
default and 3% in 
defaultFrance
default. Public transport investment in the capital now stands at £644 per head compared with £243 per head for the 
defaultWest Midlands
default and the North of England combined.
default  
defaultLondon
default’s performance is 
defaultcritical to the nation, but Core Cities are important too and in fact deliver more economically.  The capital has enjoyed very significant transport investment over 
defaultthe last two decades. Over the last 20 years 
defaultLondon
default has benefited from the implementation o
defaultf significant new transport infrastructure, including 
defaultThames
default link
default, Jubilee Line extension, upgrades for the Olympics, and HS1 we estimate this to be around £40bn. The rest of the country has on the other hand benefited from the West Coast Main Line upgrade
default, New Street Gateway, 
defaultBirmingham
default and under construction the Northern Hub, around £12bn. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWith HS2 most of our great cities will be connected, so they can become a single and powerful engine for economic growth. However to maximise this it is imperative to
default maximise connectivity within and between Core Cities. The Transport network has a crucial role in supporting growth and rebalancing the  economy. Independent forecasts demonstrate that our Core Cities have the potential to deliver an additional 1.16 milli
defaulton jobs and £222 billion into the national economy by 2030. Supported by Core Cities research Oxford Economics, Arup and Volterra have estimated that there is a potential for HS2 to deliver a further 400,000 additional jobs in the Core Cities and support t
defaulthe delivery of 1 million jobs in total across the wider urban area.
defaultThe Chair of the Committee, Louise Ellman MP, has said: 
default“There have been a number of changes in the arrangements for funding and delivering transport projects locally. We want to investigate the complex network of bodie
defaults involved in local transport decisions and find out how they work together both within and across local authority boundaries. We are also interested in hearing about the different funding schemes that are available and the extent to which these meet local
default needs.”
defaultThe key messages from the Core Cities in relation defaultto this line of inquiry are the need for:default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Core Cities response to the inquiry questions are outlined below.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1. What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantagesdefault and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThe Governments proposals were welcome, based as they were on the rationale that they can be focused on providing local areas with flexibility to ensure priorities meet local 
defaultneeds and be proactive to lever in economic development. Whilst it did not reduce the number of funding pots, Major Scheme, Integrated Transport ITB and Capitalised Maintenance blocks, local control over all 3 meant less silo based approach to transport fu
defaultnding and a more integrated approach to solutions.
defaultThe positive experience of devolution in the 
defaultUK
default is also reflected in Europe where 
defaultEuropean
default 
defaultCities
default and Regions have far more influence over their local transport networks in terms of planning, managing and
default 
defaultdeveloping and running these networks than is the case in 
defaultEngland
default outside of London TfL. In 
defaultFrance
default for example a transport tax on salary is provided directly to the local authorities for transport and allows their Mayor to for example stand on a mandate to
default deliver a tram in their first 5 year term. A key reason why so many more cities in 
defaultFrance
default are benefiting from modern urban transport systems.
defaultCertainty of funding is also key, the initial allocation of 4 years is welcome however as part of their City Deal
default some Core Cities negotiated a 10 year deal (6 years fixed, 4 years indicative). This should be extended to all Core Cities. Such certainty of funding is a key requirement for the current ongoing review of future operating models for the Highways Agency.
defaultT
defaulthe Assurance requirements required by the DfT have however effectively required the same assessment requirements and techniques, such as WEBtag, which has resulted in little or no saving in respect of scheme appraisals. It is not uncommon for the cost of a
defaultppraisal to be upwards of 10% of the scheme construction cost.
defaultFor the period beyond 2015, Major Scheme funding and prioritisation was devolved to Local Transport Bodies constituted of LEPs, ITAs and other key stakeholders. However in 2013, the requirement
default of Strategic Economic Plans by LEPs, which includes Major Scheme and ITB funding within the associated Single Local Growth Fund, now leaves the role and function of ITAs and LTBs in this regard under question. 
defaultA single allocated pot comprising all capita
defaultl funding streams should be made available to all Core Cities, based on the TfL model, as a 10 year allocation.
defaultAdvantages
defaultA single pot of funding as outlined for a 10 year period will provide certainty over funding and appropriate planning, development an
defaultd prioritisation. We believe this should become a permanent on-going arrangement, bring local transport for Core Cities into alignment with the national transport bodies and Transport for 
defaultLondon
default.
defaultBig improvement on previous process of annual Funding Settle
defaultment approach which left little time to plan accordingly
defaultAllows for programme flexibility especially to react to external influences or opportunities e.g. ability to capture and support new development opportunity
defaultDisadvantages
defaultIn 2010, the reduction in th
defaulte number of funding pots available from the DfT was combined with major reduction in capital allocations. In 2009/10 for example the total West Midlands Metropolitan Area capital allocations via all funding streams was £77.062M. For 2011/12 the same capita
defaultl allowances was £41.071M, a 47% cut. 
defaultMajor Scheme funding devolution to LEP areas means the ability to fund larger strategic schemes is not seen to be feasible. A scheme of £20M 
defaultapprox.
default is now effectively the largest scheme which could be practically fun
defaultded through the Major Scheme allocations for 2015-19
defaultDevolution of Major Scheme funding to local areas could have been an opportunity for Local Areas to reduce development costs and speed up approval timeframes, however imposition of WEBtag based appraisal
default requirements by Government is likely to see such benefits minimised.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2. Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the cadefaultpacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?default&#xa0;defaultGovernments original rationale of devolution was to empower local areas and allow flexible, dynamic transport government and delivery structures reflective of local economic geographies. However, Government does appear to have contradicted this approach by
default imposing new structures and bodies, Local Transport Body’s LTB’s, rather than allowing local determination towards transport through the exiting local authority processes. 
defaultMost of the Core Cities effectively have 8 different organisations undertaking sim
defaultilar transport functions: Core City, Integrated Transport Authority ITA, Passenger Transport Executive PTE as promoter and deliver of Passenger Transport schemes, LTBs prioritising Major Schemes, Local Enterprise Partnerships developing SEPs and promoting 
defaulteconomic development which includes access to transport funding with the Single Growth Fund, Highways Agency, Network Rail and DfT for rail franchises. In practice, the differing remits, funding and covering geographies is likely to lead to inefficiencies 
defaultbetween strategic planning, development and delivery of schemes and initiatives.
defaultA model similar to London TfL for Core Cities would greatly simplify and streamline the system.
defaultWhilst the significant cuts in Local Authorities is obviously having an impact,
default the ability for local authorities to determine their appropriate processes and structures together with certainty of funding, would greatly reduce the resource requirement. This together with a reduction in the overdependence of national government of com
defaultpetitive bids, 3 major bidding rounds in 2013 alone, would greatly assist with capacity.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3. What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the Core Cities, strategic
default cross boundary transport planning across the travel to work areas is vital and reflects the realities of transport patterns and requirements of an urban area both for internal cross boundary movements and wider within the economic catchment of the metropo
defaultlitan area.
defaultAgain, the differing bodies, organisation an
defaultd authorities covering varying
default geographical areas with different responsibilities towards funding allocation, strategic planning and delivery is likely to lead to inefficiencies between strategic plan
defaultning, development and delivery.
defaultIn the West Midlands for example, whilst the ITA is presently tasked by the Local Transport Act (2008) to undertake strategic cross boundary transport planning, decision making on Major Schemes is now undertaken by 3 separat
defaulte LEP/ LTBs who have a specific focus on promoting economic development, covering different geographical areas to existing structures such as ITAs/ Shire Counties and their Metropolitan District Authorities. There is a danger such a focus misses other tran
defaultsport needs and priorities such as connecting people to jobs, addressing severe road congestion, reducing environmental impacts.
defaultHowever
default a number of other 
defaultCore
default 
defaultCity
default areas are
default moving toward a model similar to that of a Combined Authority which will see the 
defaultLeaders directing Transport Strategy and Policy within the wider 
defaultarea.
defaultTo enable this model to work effectively however the Core City’s and their regions need a mechanism akin to ‘duty to cooperate’ not only with adjacent authorities but also with the High
defaultways Agency and Network Rail and be involved in Policy development in respect of Rail Franchising, Aviation and Seaports.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultQ4. How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?default&#xa0;
defaultCore Ci
defaultties believe that local bodies largely do work well together, a number have or are implementing Combined Authority models. This reflects historical working processes and relationships. However, there does need to a stronger responsibility for national tran
defaultsport agencies, such as the Highways Agency and Network Rail, to work closely with local bodies such as ITAs and LEPs to ensure alignment between local needs and their investment programmes. 
defaultCore Cities itself has a Cabinet arrangement, led by Sir Richard
default Lease, Leader of Manchester with each of the Core Cities Leader’s having a portfolio. Sir Albert Bore having the Transport Portfolio. Supporting this are a number of working groups that share good practice and help make a collective case for better transp
defaultort in their areas.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5. Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAs previously stated there has been a significant cut in 
defaulttransport capital spend
default,
default although the significant proposed increase in the last spending review is acknowledged
default,
default notwithstanding that a significant proportion of this is not within the li
defaultf
defaulte of this parliament. For example the 
defaultWest Midlands
default has seen a signi
defaultficant reduction in capital funding blocks. In 2009/10 total West Midlands Metropolitan Area capital allocations via all funding streams was £77.062M. For 2011/12 the same capital allowances was £41.071M, a 47% cut. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition there is as previously sta
defaultted a significant funding gap with 
defaultLondon
default. 
defaultPublic transport investment in the capital now stands at £644 per head compared with £243 per head for the 
defaultWest Midlands
default and the North of England combined.
default  
defaultLondon
default’s performance is critical to the nation, but Core
default Cities are important too and in fact deliver more economically.  The capital has enjoyed very significant transport investment over the last two decades. Over the last 20 years 
defaultLondon
default has benefited from the implementation of significant new transport infr
defaultastructure, including Thameslink, Jubilee Line extension, upgrades for the Olympics, and HS1 we estimate this to be around £40bn. The rest of the country has on the other hand benefited from the West Coast Main Line upgrade, New Street Gateway, 
defaultBirmingham
default 
defaultand under construction the Northern Hub, around £12bn. 
default&#xa0;
defaultInvestment in any transport scheme is a highly efficient approach to supporting the economy as materials are purchased, jobs are created in building the scheme and it improves productivity of the 
defaultwider economy. It is estimated that for every £1 invested in construction generates £1.86
default to the economy
default. Whilst the Government has recognised this and has increased funding for national agencies to historical high levels for the period 2015-19, local tran
defaultsport funding (covering Major Schemes, Integrated Transport and Maintenance Blocks) for 2015-19 is 
defaultonly 
default£2.244bn per annum compared to £1.968Bn in 2009/10 an increase of 14% or the equivalent of 1.9% per annum.
default&#xa0;
defaultRing fencing of conc
defaultessionary fares budget i
defaults also helping to distort
default local transport support spending and can now account for around 50% of most authorities public transport spending.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultQ6. What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the defaultSingle Local Growth Fund have?default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThe Single Local Growth Fund (SLGF) is an opportunity for the underinvestment in local transport to be addressed as discussed in previous answers. But it must be recognised that the majority of the funding is disproportion
defaultately from local transport pots, Major Schemes, ITB and Local Sustainable Transport Funding LSTF 
default and as such 
defaultadds another element in the local transport framework in an area and could possible lead to a democratic deficit.
defaultDespite this the £2bn per annum 
defaultpot is a welcomed start, however given the competitive nature of the fund, the government still retains control over funding allocations – against the premise of devolution. 
defaultThe original Major Scheme and ITB Funding was formulaic, a significant
default proportion 
defaultof this, over 50%, 
defaultis now competitive.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is also a question re the future role of the LTB’s beyond 2019 that has yet to be addressed.
default&#xa0;
defaultA more equitable solution would be for the complete devolution of this fund, and other transport sources, to
default 
defaultCore 
defaultCities
default and their regions 
defaultso that they can focus the resource on urban areas which are often the focal point of journeys, hubs of economic activity, population growth and therefore the location where investment in transport issues will generate the largest 
defaultbenefits. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultQ7. How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough
default the Government’s approach will allow for investment in smaller scale schemes l (&lt;£20M 
defaultapprox.
default) and larger schemes (&gt;£500M 
defaultapprox.
default) by the national agencies/ companies, the ability to fund ‘mid-range’ schemes i.e. £20M - £500M locally, vital for transforma
defaulttional changes to local area economies, is considerably more challenging. Mid-range schemes across conurbations largely cover rapid transit (light rail and bus), rail schemes or stations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis means funding opportunities for these types of schemes will 
defaultfocus on sovereign/ private investment funds
default, EIB and general borrowing
default, 
defaultwith repayment through a mix of fare box, 
defaultcouncil tax levy increases (noting the Governments statutory requirements for a local referendum to facilitate such increases
default. Such a mechani
defaultsm was agreed with Leeds City Deal only for it to be subsequently legislated against!), Workplace and Congestion Charging, 
defaultTax Incremental Financing or private sector contributions through mechanisms such as the Community Infrastructure Levy. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo maximise
default the Transport requirement 
defaultto
default enable Core Cities to operate at their full potential in terms of Growth and GVA requires significantly enhanced flexibility, to the level enjoyed by TfL, in maximising public transport benefits, including reviewing Transport 
defaultLevy Referendum arrangements and simplifying public transport contracting processes.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese funding approaches all require the promoting area/ authority to take on financial risks/ guaranteed investment returns not otherwise required by the public funding 
defaultof the smaller scheme or national schemes identified above. Equally, such investment funds expose themselves to risk that result in projected patronage and revenues being optimistic. Such risk is therefore priced into schemes, inflating costs or returns.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith small schemes and nationally significant schemes not exposed to such risks, Government could expedite delivery through underwriting risk to provide a proportionate balance of risk between the public and private sector. For example, the DfT presently u
defaultnderwrites new rail services for a period of time until patronage, revenues and operating costs become established to inform further decision making. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIf a similar approach was applied to mid-range schemes, the public sector funding could pump-prime a sch
defaulteme with a long term concession then let after a pre-determined number of years. Once the public sector underwriting period was complete and revenues known, growth and operating costs could be 
defaultmodelled and valued with certainty. The capital raised from the
default concession could then be recycled to fund other mid-range transport schemes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWith such measures in place, the lower cost of risk built into financial models and decision making by local areas and the private sector would be reduced by creating an enviro
defaultnment of greater funding certainty to unlock investment to create jobs and growth.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultQ8. How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThe Core Cities already consider there to be strong lines of local democratic accountability, however 
defaultthere is concern re the potential accountability in respect of LEP’s and SEP’s. For the Local Growth Fund it needs to be the case that democratic accounta
defaultbility is a key requirement. However 
defaultin the spirit of devolution, local areas should be allowed to develop appropriate structures to undertaken government requirements 
defaultrather than imposing structures. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt could be argued that at present the national gover
defaultnments organisational and technocratic hold over local transport decision – making in 
defaultEngland
default outside of 
defaultLondon
default is overriding the local decision making particularly in areas such as bus deregulation and train franchising to the local electorate to too grea
defaultter degree.
default&#xa0;
defaultEngland
default after all is recognised as having one of the most centrally controlled governance structures in Europe (Second Tier Cities in 
defaultEurope
