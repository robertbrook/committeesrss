defaultSupplementary written evidence from Chris 
defaultBazlinton
default (SLC 044)
defaultI am just writing to thank you for giving us the opportunity to present our experience and thoughts at the hearings of the Transport Select Committee on level crossing safety.
defaultI am concerned about evidence given by Robin 
defaultGisby
default at the second hearing on Monday 4 November.
default&#xa0;
default During his evidence he ‘revealed’ that:
default"I do not know why those things [the ‘missing’ 
defaultHudd
default memo and risk assessment Part B] were not produced. They certainly should have been; they were somewhere within the 
defaultorganisation
default, and we have investigated why they did not come out until much later in the day, as have other 
defaultorganisations
default. I think that was covered by the judge when Network Rail was sentenced. I think it was also covered in the ORR investigation."

defaultQ161
defaultThe reason that I am concerned about this is that it is the first I have heard of any internal investigation.
default&#xa0;
default We met David Higgins shortly after the missing documents appeared in 2011.
default&#xa0;
default He assured us that everything Network Rail had would be given to us, and I believe he did.
default&#xa0;
default But as I say, we were never told of any internal inquiry.
default&#xa0;
default Either we were yet again fobbed off, or Network Rail never did carry out an inquiry
default&#xa0;
default - I suspect the latter.
defaultThe second part of that quote relates to the fact that the judge for some reason announced that there was no suggestion of a cover-up – yet no-one has ever carried out an investigation on whether there was a cover-up or not.
default&#xa0;
default ORR certainly did not – their role was to investigate the breaches of Health and Safety legislation within Network Rail and they have told me they were unable to get any answers other than ‘don’t know’ from the people they questioned about what went wrong.
default&#xa0;
default They certainly did not exonerate Network Rail.
default&#xa0;
default The “other 
defaultorganisations
default” 
defaultGisby
default referred to are RSSB and RAIB – neither of these investigated why the documents had not appeared.
defaultGisby
default, of course, has been Head of Operations at Network Rail from before the accident at 
defaultElsenham
default until now, and therefore - ultimately - the officer responsible for any failings.
default&#xa0;
default If he did not know what went on, then his performance as a manager must be brought into question.
defaultI do not wish to be vindictive about this but it seems that he and other people at Network Rail have not taken the responsibility they should.
default&#xa0;
default Another senior person who has failed, I believe, is Richard Smith, Network Rail’s solicitor.
default&#xa0;
default From documents provided by ORR under Freedom of Information we know that he had possession of the 
defaultHudd
default Memo in February 2011 at the latest (we believe he probably knew back in 2006) but it did not ‘appear’ until March 2011 when it was eventually handed to David Higgins who passed it on to us.
defaultI do exclude David Higgins from any responsibility – of course, he was not there until 2011 and the matter only became public in the week he arrived at Network Rail.
default&#xa0;
default And without his support I suspect Network Rail would have put up a fight.
default&#xa0;
default As it was, he insisted that the organization was guilty – he made this known to staff, some of whom in 2012 were saying that Network Rail had only pleaded guilty for ‘political’ and ‘PR’ reasons.
defaultI appreciate that there is a lot of minutiae in all this but unfortunately, some of the devil is in the detail in our case.
defaultFor me, this is an issue of accountability – no one has so far taken responsibility.
default&#xa0;
default The response seems to be merely a shrug of the shoulders.
defaultI do hope the committee in its report will make some reference to this.
