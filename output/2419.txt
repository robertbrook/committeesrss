[[[Industrial Communities Alliance]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Industrial Communities Alliance is the all-party association of local authorities in the industrial areas of England, Scotland and Wales.  The Alliance was formed in 2007 by the merger of longer-standing associations dating back to the 1980s.  The Alliance works with the Westminster government, the devolved administrations and the EU to deliver policies and funding that support economic and social regeneration.  Some 60 local authorities are currently members.&#xa0;Welfare reform has been a regular topic of discussion at regional and national meetings of the Alliance.  The present submission draws on these discussions and on published academic evidence to illustrate the impact that welfare reform in general, and reform to housing benefits in particular, is having in much of older industrial Britain.  The submission was prepared by staff in the National Secretariat and endorsed by the Alliance Executive, comprising senior elected members from around the country.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Context]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Britain’s older industrial areas include some of the most economically deprived parts of the UK.  Over many years, substantial parts of Scotland, Wales and the North of England, and even some areas further south, have seen the decline of the industries on which their economies and communities were once based.  Coal, steel, shipbuilding and textiles, for example, have now disappeared entirely from some places and survive only on a much diminished scale in others.  This has cast a long shadow over economic and social well-being.  Regeneration efforts have brought new jobs, but rarely on a sufficient scale to offset previous job losses.&#xa0;The result is that Britain’s older industrial areas mostly suffer from high levels of worklessness.  Even in the years prior to the 2008 recession, they remained a long way off full employment.  The worklessness is far more extensive than just conventional ‘unemployment’.  For example, one of the long-term consequences of a weak demand for labour in older industrial Britain has been that very large numbers of men and women with health problems or disabilities have ended up parked outside of the labour market on incapacity benefits.&#xa0;The consequence is that individuals are more likely to be out-of-work on benefits in older industrial Britain than in more prosperous local economies.  Because of lower wages for those in work, they are also more likely to draw on in-work benefits.&#xa0;Welfare reform tends to be discussed with little reference to its impact in specific places up and down the country.  However, because benefit claimant rates vary so much across Britain, the places where claimants are concentrated – such as older industrial areas – are clearly most exposed to financial losses.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Case study: under-occupation of social housing (‘bedroom tax’)]]]&#xa0;To illustrate the disproportionate impact of welfare reform on older industrial areas it is worth looking at the new under-occupation rules governing support for housing costs in the social rented sector, generally known as the ‘bedroom tax’.  The rules on under-occupation are of course the same across the whole country but the impact differs from place to place for two main reasons.&#xa0;First, the share of the housing stock in the social rented sector varies a great deal across the country.  This often reflects complex historical reasons – the aftermath of the redevelopment of slum housing for example, and the differing priority that authorities once attached to building council houses.  Older industrial Britain, with a legacy of slum clearance and a tradition of municipal activism, has some of the highest proportions of social housing.&#xa0;Second, the proportion of working-age households who claim Housing Benefit varies according to the scale of worklessness and the extent of low wages.  Older industrial Britain is among the places where the claimant rate is highest.&#xa0;Figure 1 shows the estimated impact of the ‘bedroom tax’ by district across the whole of Great Britain.  The figures here are taken from a report by Sheffield Hallam University, published earlier in 2013, and are ultimately rooted in the Treasury’s own estimates of the financial savings and in DWP benefits data for local areas.  The map shows the annual financial loss per adult of working age – i.e. averaging the financial loss across the whole working age population of each area, including non-claimants.  This is the best measure of the intensity of the financial ‘hit’ in each part of the country.&#xa0;Anyone familiar with the economic geography of Britain will see that the areas hit hardest by the ‘bedroom tax’ include the industrial areas of northern England, the Welsh Valleys, the Birmingham and Glasgow areas and a number of inner London boroughs.  By contrast, substantial parts of the south and east of England outside London are relatively lightly affected.&#xa0;

[[[10]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Source: Sheffield Hallam estimates based on official data&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;To underline the highly uneven impact of the ‘bedroom tax’, Table 1 shows a range of figures for each of the GB regions.&#xa0;The first column shows that in total 660,000 households are thought to be affected – the Department for Work and Pensions own figure – but of these just 40,000 are in the South East of England, compared to 240,000 in the three regions of northern England.&#xa0;The second column shows that the annual financial loss to Housing Benefit claimants in the South East totals £30m.  In the three regions of northern England it totals £160m.&#xa0;The third column shows the proportion of households affected by the ‘bedroom tax’.  In the North East it affects 440 out of every 10,000 households , four times as many as in the South East.&#xa0;The fourth column averages the financial loss across the whole working age population (including non-claimants).  The loss is more than three times greater in the North East than the South East.&#xa0;The point here is that the highly uneven impact of the ’bedroom tax’ has largely been overlooked.  Yet it is increasingly leading to widespread distress in some of the most disadvantaged communities in Britain.  According to reports to Alliance national meetings, the ‘bedroom tax’ is leading to a sharp rise in rent arrears, to high levels of demand for smaller accommodation that is simply  not available, and to difficulty in letting the larger properties owned by housing associations and councils.  Local authorities are also aware that a move from social-rented housing to smaller but more expensive accommodation in the private-rented sector would not normally reduce benefit payments.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Other reforms to housing support]]]&#xa0;The evidence on the other elements of support for housing costs confirms an uneven impact across the country, though not always in quite the same way as for the ‘bedroom tax’.  The Sheffield Hallam study, for example, indicates that the household benefit cap impacts to a major extent only in London, where rent levels have hitherto driven up Housing Benefit entitlement.&#xa0;The reforms to Local Housing Allowance, which apply to the private-rented sector, impact on London because of high rent levels but quite a number of older industrial areas in the North West, Yorkshire and North East are also badly affected because of the high proportion of tenants out-of-work or on low wages.  There are reports that in some places private landlords have become nervous about letting or re-letting to Housing Benefit claimants and that this is feeding through to levels of homelessness.  Indeed, government figures show that the proportion of households citing loss of a private tenancy as the trigger for their homelessness is rising and now at an all-time high.&#xa0;The impacts of the reforms to Council Tax Benefit are complex.  It might have been expected that older industrial areas would be hit hard because of high worklessness.  In the event, the devolved administrations and a number of English local authorities, such County Durham and Northumberland, have chosen not to pass on the reduction in government grant.  But as the Sheffield Hallam report shows, in the older industrial areas where the cut in government grant has been passed on in full the financial losses are among the largest in the country.&#xa0;Looking a little further ahead, there are worries that the intention to pay the ‘rent’ component of Universal Credit to claimants rather than direct to landlords, and to do so on a monthly rather than fortnightly basis, will have damaging repercussions for housing associations and local councils.  The fear is that the financial pressures on tenants will mean that rents go unpaid and arrears develop.  Since social landlords borrow against their anticipated income stream, this also has potential knock-on consequences for the volume of new building.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The cumulative impact o]]]

[[[n households]]]&#xa0;It would be misleading to take the housing-related benefit changes out of their wider context.  Changes to incapacity and disability benefits, to tax credits and to Child Benefit are underway at the same time, and in several cases are substantially larger in terms of their financial impact.  The effect is that several different elements to the welfare reform package impact simultaneously on the same households and individuals.&#xa0;It is the cumulative aspect of the reforms that often make them so pernicious.  Drawing on official data, the Sheffield Hallam report quantifies the average annual loss, per affected household or individual, when each of the reforms has come into full effect:&#xa0;              Incapacity benefits                                          £3,480              Tax Credits                                                        £   810              Child Benefit                                                        £   370              Housing Benefit: LHA                            £1,220              Disability Living Allowance                            £3,000              Housing Benefit: ‘bedroom tax’              £   740              Non-dependant deductions              £1,130              Council Tax Benefit                                          £   140              Household benefit cap                            £4,820&#xa0;The point here is that some of the households adversely affected by reductions in housing support are also likely to find that that they will lose money as a result of other elements of the reforms.  Indeed, this is already happening.&#xa0;The group that is perhaps most exposed to reductions in entitlement are older working age couples who have hitherto combined entitlement to a number of benefits.  Many incapacity claimants, for example, also claim DLA, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit.  Some of those within this group who have lesser disabilities will find that they are unable to claim Employment and Support Allowance or Personal Independence Payments and that they must now pay some Council Tax for the first time.  If they live in social housing and their children have moved away, which is often the case, the ‘bedroom tax’ will also come into play.&#xa0;This group – older out-of-work couples – is especially numerous in many older industrial areas, where meaningful job opportunities for them have long since dried up.  They will often find that the cumulative effect of the reforms is to push them down to the poverty line.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The overall impact on places]]]&#xa0;Likewise, the cumulative impact of the reforms on specific places and local economies should be a major cause for concern.&#xa0;Table 2 lists the 50 local authority districts which, according to the Sheffield Hallam report, are worst affected by the welfare reforms as a whole.  The measure used here is again the financial loss averaged across the whole of the working age population.&#xa0;

[[[Concluding r]]]

[[[emarks]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Reforms to housing benefits, such as the introduction of the ‘bedroom tax’, will in most cases widen the divides in prosperity between the best and worst local economies across Britain.  The current welfare reforms, taken as a whole, also have this impact.  Britain’s older industrial areas are especially exposed to losses of benefit income.&#xa0;Ministers argue that one of the main effects of the welfare reforms will be to increase the financial incentive to work, and that because more people will look for work, more people will find work.  That work incentives for many will increase is not in dispute.  However, the Industrial Communities Alliance and its member authorities do not share the view that the welfare reforms will raise the overall level of employment.  Some benefit claimants will intensify their job search, and some will find work, but in Britain’s weaker local economies, where there remains a shortfall in job opportunities, this will mostly be at the expense of other jobseekers.&#xa0;In the view of the Alliance, the key to reducing the number of working-age benefit claimants is regional and local economic growth.  In practice, by reducing household incomes and local spending power in older industrial Britain, the current welfare reforms are likely to have precisely the opposite effect.&#xa0;&#xa0;
