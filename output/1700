[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This evidence is submitted on 
[normal]a corporate basis by Equality Challenge Unit
[normal] (ECU)
[normal]. 
[normal]ECU i
[normal]s a charity which works to further and support equality and diversity for staff and students in higher education across all four nations of the UK, and in colleges in Scotland. ECU receives its core 
[normal]funding from 
[normal]Universities UK, GuildHE, the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, the Scottish Funding Council and the Department for Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Athena SWAN Charter[bold]One of ECU’s core activities is the Athena SWAN Charter. 
[normal]Founded in 2005, the Athena SWAN Charter is a scheme that recognises excellence in science, engineering
[normal], 
[normal]technology
[normal], mathematics and medicine (STEMM
[normal]) employment
[normal] for women in higher education.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]Charter receives addition
[normal]al
[normal] funding from the Royal Society, the Biochemical Society, the Department of Health and the Scottish Funding Council.
[normal]Any university or research institute embedded within a university that is committed to the advancement of the ca
[normal]reers of women 
[normal]in STEMM 
[normal]can become a member of the Charter, accepting and promoting the six Charter principles:
[normal]There are currently 
[normal]91
[normal] members of the Charter. Once Charter signatories, universities and their S
[normal]TEMM 
[normal]departments are encouraged to submit for Athena SWAN Charter recognition awards at Bronze, Silver or Gold level.
[normal]The Charter recognises the commitment of universities and university departments to reduce the
[normal] 
[normal]decline in the numbers 
[normal]of women in 
[normal]S
[normal]TEMM
[normal] ac
[normal]ademic careers 
[normal]further up the career ladder, and 
[normal]retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers
[normal].
[normal]This response is based on ECU’s work, in particular the experience of working with universities on Athena SWAN.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[normal]=
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Committee structures and balance of representation – e.g. women at least proportionally represented and not restricted to the least influential committees
[normal]=
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Departmental openness and inclusivity – e.g. all staff invited to a weekly coffee morning, at which senior staff are accessible

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Departmental roles and responsibilities – e.g. less desirable tasks assigned fairly and transparently 
[normal]=
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Visibility of women – e.g. care taken to ensure that the images around the university are not male-dominated, and a good balance amongst invited speakers
[normal]=
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Valuing staff contribution – e.g. achievements of men and women equally valued, and

[normal]=
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Induction and training – e.g. all staff given a comprehensive induction and may be assigned a mentor, with the opportunity to express a preference about that person’s identity.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Data collection (so the university/department knows what it must act on and can prioritise)

[normal]the London Mathematical Society (who’s recently launched

[normal]This groundswell of support indicates that now is a very apposite time to capitalise on this.
