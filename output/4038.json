"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Action on Hearing Loss [FBB0037]&#xa0;&#xa0;About usAction on Hearing Loss is the new name for RNID. We\n'\nre the charity working for a world where hearing loss doesn't limit or label people, where tinnitus is silenced â€“ and where people value and look after their hearing. \n&#xa0;Our response will focus on key issues that relate to people with hearing loss. Througho\nut this response we use the term 'people with hearing loss' to refer to people with all levels of hearing loss, including people who are profoundly deaf.\n&#xa0;\nWe are happy for the details of this response to be made public. \n&#xa0;CommentsAction on Hearing Loss\n wel\ncomes the opportunity to \nprovide written evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee\n concerning the future of the BBC\n. \nWe\n believe the BBC should be \nthe \npioneer\ning \nbroadcast\ner\n in terms of accessibility. \nThe BBC to date ha\ns\n played an extremely important role within the broadcasting industry in promoting accessibility. The BBC \nis \nthe most accessible broadcaster for people with hearing loss (although there ar\ne still improvements they can make)\n and w\ne believe the BBC has been fundamental in encouraging other broadcasters to also improve their accessibility\n through demonstrating the possibilities. The BBC has also helped to \nraise expectations amongst deaf people\n \nabout what level of service \nthey can and should expect from all broadcasters. We therefore believe that ensuring everyone has access to BBC services has and should continue to be a key role for the BBC. \n&#xa0;\nThis is particularly important with the development\n of catch up television and video on demand services, which are not currently regulated in terms of access services. \nAccessibility is not currently explicit within the Public Purposes. However, the Agreement between the BBC and the Secretary of \nState for Culture, Media and Sport does include the requirement to have regard to the need to make services accessible to people\n with a visual or hearing impairment. \nWe welcome the BBCs commitment to provide 100% subtitles on the majority of its programmes. We would like to see the accessibility \nsolutions \nextend\ning\n further, for example, with the provision of subtitles on online vid\neo clips. \nWe would welcome an explicit statement within the public purposes regarding accessibility. This would help to highlight the importance of ensuring BBC services\n are accessible to disabled people. \nPlease see answer\ns\n to questions two and three above. \nThe BBC should absolutely retain \nand build on \nits commitment to provide accessible services to ensure that people with hearing loss are able to enjoy TV programmes to the same extent as everyone else. \nWe urge the BBC to ensure that all programmes, whether produced in house or commissioned externally, are accessible to people with hearing loss. This includes ensuring that producti\non staff are aware of the issues around background noise and know how to reduce this. \nBackground noise, such as music, sound effects and ambient noise, can make it difficult for people with hearing loss to follow dialogue during a programme.\n \nIn our 2008 an\nnual survey 87% of respondents agreed that background noise affects their ability to hear speech on television.\nIt is also important that \nall \nprogrammes are delivered to the BBC \non schedule, \nwith enough time to produce subtitles in advance of broadcast. \nLi\nve subtitles have much higher error rates and therefore \npre-recorded subtitles are always preferable except for truly live programmes\n. \nNo comment. \nWe believe the BBC should\n play a key role in developing technology. The BBC \nis\n the only broadcaster who ha\ns\n ensured that subtitles are available on the BBC iplayer when watched through the majority of platforms. \nCurrently no other broadcaster provides this functionality, meaning t\nhat deaf people do not have the same access to catch up and video on demand services as other people. \nWe believe this \npioneering \nrole \nis important, demonstrating to other broadcasters that accessibility is technologically feasible. \n&#xa0;\nConclusionThe BBC has\n played a pioneering role within the broadcast industry in terms of accessibility for deaf people. We would like to see this role continued and built upon, ensuring that all BBC services are accessible to people with hearing loss, thereby encouraging other\n broadcasters to do the same. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
