[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government.  We work with councils to support, promote and 
[normal]improve local government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the 
[normal]issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The LGA covers every part of England and Wales, supporting local government as the most efficient and accountable part of the public sector.
