A ‘prompt’ is a verbal, visual, written or recorded cue that reminds people to carry out a specific target behaviour. A ‘normative message’ is a verbal, visual, written or recorded communication that contains information about what types of behaviours are typically performed (descriptive norms), what types of behaviour are socially approved or disapproved of (injunctive norms), or that appeals to a personal moral obligation to engage in a particular behaviour (personal norms).
