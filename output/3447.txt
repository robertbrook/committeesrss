[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The County Councils Network (CCN) represents 37 English local authorities that serve counties. CCN membership includes both upper tier and unitary authorities who together have over 2500 councillors and serve 23 million people (46% of the population) across 85% of England.  CCN develops policy, shares best practice and makes representations to government on behalf of this significant proportion of the country outside the big conurbations. CCN is a member-led organisation which works on an inclusive and all party basis and seeks to make representations to government which can be supported by all member authorities.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CCN welcome this opportunity to respond to the Health Select Committee investigation into public expenditure on health &amp; social care. As a body representing the interests of 37 county council and county unitary authorities in England, our submission focuses solely on the Committee lines of inquiry into the provision of adult social care and integration activity with the health service (areas 5 &amp; 7).

[[[Submission]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1.

[[[              ]]]Before setting out the specific impact of the 2010 spending review on CCN member authorities, it is important the committee consider the following factors: &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; During 2013/14 CCN member authorities will account for 47% of the total estimated expenditure on adult social care services in England. The average expenditure by a CCN member authority in 2013/14 is an estimated £186m, whilst a two-tier CCN county council member will on average spend £215m. This compares to £158m for the average Core Cities authority, £88m for Metropolitan Boroughs and £72m for London Boroughs.&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whilst CCN member authorities represent 47% of total expenditure, they are expected to spend less per head of the population on adult social care during 2013/14. CCN members on average spend £269 per head of the population compared to an average spend for a Core Cities authority of £294, £276 for a Metropolitan Borough and £283 for a London Borough. The CCN average is also below the average for all upper tier councils in England (£280). &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The continuing demographic shift towards an aging population is most acute in county areas. CCN members have witnessed the largest growth in those aged 60 above, resulting in increasing demand for care and support. The 2011 census showed that county councils have the largest proportion of those aged 60 and above in England at 25.6%. This represents an increase of 3.2% since 2001, the largest in England and Wales. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; LGA projections on local authority expenditure show that by 2019/20 adult social care expenditure will account for 49% of total expenditure for the average county council compared to 38% for the average single tier authority.* This will represent a 10% increase for county councils since 2011/12. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; By 2015 CCN member authorities will have seen at least a 33% cut in revenue support grant (RSG) as part of the Government’s deficit reduction programme. The same LGA projections show that adult social care will account for 42% of county council expenditure by 2014/15. It is inevitable that this 33% reduction in RSG will have meant CCN members have needed to deliver a significant proportion of savings from adult social care budgets. &#xa0;*Please note that these projections do not take into consideration the specific impact of self-funders on county councils and the wider reforms to care and support. Therefore, with the initial £335m start-up funding for the reforms top-sliced from the local government settlement in 2015/16 (see below), adult social care as proportion of spending power will be higher than these projections.    &#xa0;2.2              The 2013 ADASS budget survey showed that local authorities will make a net saving of £2.68bn (20%) from adult services departments between 2011/12 and 2013/14. With CCN member authorities representing almost half of all adult social care expenditure in England during 2013/14, our members will deliver the most significant percentage of this £2.68bn net saving. &#xa0;2.3              The committee will be fully aware of the demographic shift towards an aging population and the challenges this creates for public service providers. The 2013 ADASS budget survey showed that the cost of demographic change accounted for 3% of 2013/14 adult social care budgets. Based on this estimate, increased demand is costing the average CCN member authority £5.6m in 2013/14, or £6.5m for the average CCN two-tier county council member. As stated above, however, the demographic shift towards an aging population is most acute within county areas. Therefore, with a higher percentage of those aged 60 above, demand pressures are likely to be costing CCN members in excess of ADASS’s 3% assumption. &#xa0;2.4              To meet fiscal challenges imposed by the 2010 spending review at a time rising demand, CCN member authorities have needed to focus on innovation, service transformation and the integration of health and social care services.

[[[ ]]]The

[[[ ]]]ADASS Budget Survey indicated that the £2.68n savings up to 2013/14 consists of efficiency savings (75%); service reductions (18%); and increases in income and charges (7%). Specific examples from counties include: &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Cheshire West and Chester Council achieved a saving of £3.74m worth of efficiency savings during 2012/13 (4.1% net budget) through their ‘Shaping the Future Together’ programme. A further £0.6 million is projected for 2013/14.  The council aim to achieve a 15% reduction in residential care of older people.&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Kent County Council set out to achieve a 5% shift in activity from the acute sector towards community services saving approximately £59m per year. A 5% shift is only the starting point, as there are also opportunities to reduce the overall level of activity by empowering patients to better self-manage, alongside the integration of services. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lincolnshire County Council has delivered savings of £8.981 million in 2012/13 following savings of over £12 million in 2011/12. This means savings of over 15% of the net budget have been achieved over the two year period. Reforms included completing the delivery of a fit for purpose structural review, with staffing reduced by 25%. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Suffolk County Council chose to undertake a full service review, with a particular focus on demand management and joint-working with health partners, savings £12 million in 2012/13. Savings were secured through improved contract management and procurement.&#xa0;2.5               Despite the innovative work of our member authorities, the toxic combination of funding reductions and growing service demand is leading to unsustainable funding pressures on adults social care services. CCN’s Caring for Our Future survey showed 100% respondents felt ‘funding shortfalls’ ahead of the introduction of the reforms to care and support were a ‘major concern’. Qualitative responses highlighted this was principally driven by existing pressures within the system being compounded by unfunded new duties and rapid increases in service demand, particularly in relation to the extension of certain services (i.e. assessments &amp; care accounts) to self-funders. &#xa0;2.6              

[[[The funding picture is significantly worse for CCN member authorities (particularly county councils) compared to the rest of the sector]]]. CCN’s 27 county council members are much more restricted in their ability to limit the level of savings and efficiencies required from adult social care budgets. County councils will need to deliver additional savings in adults social care budgets but within structural limitations compared to a unitary authority with the same statutory adult social care responsibilities; &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; County councils retain a smaller set of largely statutory, demand-led, services such as children’s services, waste removal and education. This limits their capacity to spread the 33% cut in RSG since 2010. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Council councils have few fee paying or discretionary services to raise additional local income to offset the 33% RSG reductions. In two-tier areas, districts administer discretionary income raising services such as parking, licensing, planning and building control. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Current Government policies on growth and incentive-based funding, such as the New Homes Bonus (NHB) and Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), do not adequately reward the contribution of county council services to promoting growth. Local funding shares, such as the 80/20 split in NHB payments (and proposal to withdraw 100% NHB from county councils), are disproportionately weighed towards district councils, whilst a unitary authority would receive 100% of local payments. This results in additional funding reductions for county councils with these funds largely top-sliced from the 

[[[total]]] local government settlement. &#xa0;2.6              In reviewing the impact of the 2010 spending review on adult social care provision, the Committee must consider the implications of the announcements in the June 2013 spending review and proposals contained within the Care Bill and Caring for Our Future consultation. &#xa0;2.8              Whilst CCN research has shown that our members strongly support the reforms, the extension of duties and responsibilities, particularly to self-funders, will have major financial consequences for councils in the short, medium and long-term. &#xa0;2.8.1              

[[[Extension of duties to self-funders]]]&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CCN member authorities have the largest proportion of self-funders of adult social care services. Many CCN member authorities have in excess of 50% self-funders, with some as high as 80%. The high level of self-funders for CCN member authorities will have important implications in relation to specific elements of the reforms, including the provision of information and support, assessments, care accounts and deferred payments. For instance, Leicestershire County Council estimates they will have to undertake an additional 7,000–8,000 care assessments per year following the introduction of the reforms at a cost of £3m per annum. CCN member authorities are most likely to see a surge in demand in the lead-up to 2016 and beyond. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our research suggests the Government currently underestimates the increase in demand and workloads for CCN member authorities. Over 80% of our members were concerned or very concerned by the extension of duties to self-funders. Moreover, in a response that can be directly linked to this, 38% said workforce capacity to meet increased demand was a concern, whilst 57% said it was a major concern. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Forthcoming regulations on assessments, charging and care accounts will have important implications on the provision in of adult social care services in the lead to 2016. Our research suggested that whilst our members support a clearer national approach to care and financial assessment, local flexibility is essential to ensure local authorities are able to organise their workforce locally to meet the expected surge in demand for care assessments.&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is important that local authorities are provided with the flexibility in areas such as care assessments to meet the increased demand and the additional cost pressures placed on CCN member authorities. For instance, a ‘two-tier’ workforce may emerge, with lower skilled employees recruited to provide financial information, support and care accounts for self-funders to start progress towards the cap, whilst skilled professional social workers would be allocated to the more complex high-end cases. There will also be extensive use of self-assessment tools, particularly for self-funders, and increased use of voluntary and private sector providers.&#xa0;2.8.2              

[[[Deferred Payments]]]&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A major part of the reforms is the extension of deferred payments to a ‘universal’ basis. Whilst 78% of our members agreed with the extension of deferred payments, there remains major concern amongst CCN member authorities over this area of the reforms.&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CCN’s Caring for Our Future Survey and consultation response outlined a number of significant concerns on the provision of universal deferred payments, including the increased demand and resource implications, loss of council tax income, the financial risks for local authorities, and the impacts on local housing stocks. We also outlined our concerns over the eligibility criteria. For instance, if the Government is to remove the requirement for a means-test this will increase the cost of providing an extended deferred payment schemes. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Government’s response to these points will have important implications for the provision of adult social care in the led to 2015 (when universal deferred payments are to be introduced). Local authorities face increased financial risks, which are potentially unsustainable for some authorities. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In light of our members concerns over the financial risks and additional costs created by universal deferred payments we have urged the Government to introduce a 

[[[Government Guarantee]]] for universal deferred payments. The Government should act as a national underwriter for universal deferred payments and assume the financial and reputational risk councils will be exposed to. In addition, we have also recommended that the Government explores additional policy options to ensure the extension in deferred payments does not pose an unsustainable financial risk or cost to CCN member authorities, including the potential creation of National Bank/Deferred Payment Company.&#xa0;2.8.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Funding]]]&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our members are currently working with ADASS to model the costs of the reforms. This analysis is still at the early stages and only includes the cost of the cap, not the more immediate costs associated with assessments, deferred payments and a more wide-ranging information and support offer for local residents. However, Leicestershire County Council has indicated the costs will be in the region of £30m pa. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The severe funding pressures already within the system, and implications of the reforms outlined above, mean current funding shortfalls and how the reforms will be funding in the short, medium and long-term remain the biggest concern for CCN member authorities. When asked what concerned them most about the reforms 100% of respondents ranked funding shortfalls as a ‘major concern’. Moreover, 71% said it wasn’t ‘sufficiently clear about how local authorities will fund care once the cap is reached’. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A principal driver of these concerns in the additional cuts faced by local authorities following the 2013 spending review and a complete lack of clarity over long-term funding. LGA analysis of the local government financial settlement 2014/15 &amp; 2015/6 consultation showed that the reduction in grant was 15% in real terms for 2015/16, not the 2% announced by the Government. This will result in an additional £1bn cut. This decline in RSG exceeds the pace of cuts seen over the period covered by the 2010 Spending Review. A key driver of the disparity between the Government and LGA figure is the top-sliced funding of implementation costs for the Care &amp; Support Bill. The settlement consultation revealed that the £335m ‘additional’ funding announced in the 2013 spending review to cover the costs of the reforms was top-sliced from the local government settlement. This effectively means the reforms are being funded from existing local government resources. &#xa0;2.8              CCN feel that the Government has severely underestimated the impact of the 2010 and 2013 spending reviews are continuing to have on the provision of adult social care in England, particularly for CCN member authorities. Our survey findings and the early indications on the costs implications of the reforms from CCN member authorities also suggest the Government has underestimated the total costs of the reforms. Moreover, recent developments lead us to question the Government’s willingness to fulfil their pledge to fully fund the extensive new burdens placed on local authorities. Not only has the funding decisions since 2010 left the system chronically underfunded, unfunded reforms could fundamentally undermine the successful implementation of the reforms to Care &amp; Support in England. &#xa0;2.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To ensure the provision of adult social care is put on a more sustainable baseline and the Care Bill does not worsen an already strained system and achieves its important aims, the Government must;  &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Address the funding shortages already within the social care system and place the existing baseline on a stable footing]]]. The £3.8bn integration fund will provide some support (see below); however a fairer and more proportionate approach to deficit reduction across the public sector is needed. Adult social care spend will represent at least 38% of single-tier expenditure and 49% for county council expenditure by 2019/20. Counties are already spending less per head of the population on adult social care compared to the rest of the sector due to increased demands. The deeper cuts announced in the 2013 spending review, including the top-slicing of the Dilnot implementation funding, will mean further reductions in care and support services, as well as other vitally important health services, are required at a time when local authorities will be preparing for the additional responsibilities introduced by the Care Bill.    &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Rather than retaining arbitrary departmental ring-fences that result in disproportionate reductions in key local government services, the Government should intensify its focus on health and social care integration and wider ‘whole-place’ public sector integration. ]]]We welcome many of the Government’s reforms here, including Whole-Place Community Budgets, Integration Pioneers and creation of the £3.8bn integration fund. However, we need to ensure that disproportionate cuts to local authority services do not result in the closure of key preventive and early intervention services. The full range of health and social care services delivered by CCN member authorities have a vital role to play in prevention and early intervention. These services are fundamental in reducing the reactive costs to the health service and the growing pressures facing A&amp;E departments, particularly those associated with the elderly and frail. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Provide greater clarity on how the reforms will be funded]]]. As previously stated, it still remains unclear how much the annual running costs of the reforms will be and how the costs will be meet in the short, medium and long-term. We believe that the Government’s initial estimates outlined in the Impact Assessment are overly optimistic and CCN member authorities could face higher costs. Local authorities must be provided with greater clarity over how the reforms will be funded and we urge the Government to confirm that they do intend to fulfill their pledge to fully fund the reforms. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Ensure the reforms are fully funded and not top-sliced from existing local authority budgets]]]. At present the £335m top-slice funding in 2015/16 for implementation effectively means the Government is not providing local government with any additional funding to cover the implementation of the reforms, which, given the above points, will only lead to further pressures being applied to the care and support system. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The £3.8bn integration should not be used to fund the costs of implementation during 2015/16]]]. We welcome the introduction of this pooled fund to pump-primp essential integration activity across health and social care. The fund will go some way to addressing current shortfalls in adult social care funding by yielding savings for re-investment – however it is too early to say with any confidence the extent of savings that will be secured. A recent letter from the LGA and NHS England provided greater clarity on the details behind the fund and what local authorities will need to do to access the fund. As the letter makes clear, it must be remembered that the £3.8bn is already committed expenditure across health and social care and is essentially a reallocation of resources. It is therefore imperative that £3.8bn is used to address existing pressures within the social care system; not cover the cost of implementing these proposals. The consultation does not provide clarity on the role of the integration fund, referencing it throughout.  As the letter from the LGA and NHS England stated, the fund must be focused on helping ease existing strains within the adult social care system.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[A fair and sustainable approach to the distribution of additional funding.]]] CCN are committed to ensuring that our members receive a fair and sustainable distribution of local government grants, which have historically failed to recognise the complexity and diversity of county populations, growing demand pressures and the costs of delivering services over large geographic areas. CCN member authorities will witness the largest increase in financial burdens due to the reforms to care and support in England, and on average already spend less per head of population on adult social care. It is imperative that the funding formula recognises the unique and specific challenges facing CCN member authorities and allocates funding in fair and sustainable manner. This includes the distribution of the Integration Transformation Fund, with a ministerial decision expected in the coming weeks.  &#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; DCLG.
