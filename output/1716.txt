&#xa0;&#xa0;2Co Energy was established three years ago as a dedicated CCS company.  It has a particular strategic focus on using CO2 for Enhanced Oil Recovery which reduces the overall cost of CCS.2Co Energy Limited is the developer of the Don Valley CCS power project – the only CCS project in the UK to have both its planning permission and to have completed the Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) work.  Don Valley is also the only UK project to have been awarded funding - €180 million – under the EU’s European Energy Programme for Recovery.   To date, jointly with National Grid Carbon as developer of the transportation and saline storage option, approximately £100m has been invested in the project.  The project was on track to be operational and providing 900MW of new-build, incremental low-carbon power in 2016.The project was de-selected from the UK CCS Commercialisation Programme in October 2012 but it had been ranked as the top project in Europe for funding under the NER300 programme and was ranked in the Top 10 projects globally by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The project is now being restructured so that it can be developed outside, but parallel with, the UK commercialisation programme and intends to apply for a Final Investment Decision (FID) enabling CfD so that it can make a Final Investment Decision at the end of 2015.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]There are three basic carbon capture technologies for the power sector – capturing CO2 either pre or post combustion of the fuel and the use of oxy-fuel turbines.  Each of these can be used with either coal or natural gas.  Each of these technologies is ready to be deployed at scale today.  Experience of deployment of the technologies will be the best way to identify the areas that will benefit most from further research and development.&#xa0;Further substantial volumes of CO2 can be captured from energy intensive industrial sectors such as steel and cement.  Some sectors, such as gas processing and ammonia production, already separate and capture CO2 as part of the industrial process and the additional costs represent very low cost CCS opportunities.  2Co looks forward to opportunities to be the offtaker of additional volumes of CO2 such as this and to use them for EOR and storage.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Aside from the environmental benefits of substantial reductions in CO2 emissions, there are substantial potential benefits to the UK economy from the deployment of CCS technology:  CCS is not simply a cost.  CCS needs to be deployed widely around the world and although a few countries such as the USA and Canada are already proceeding with a small number of projects, the UK’s CfD mechanism offers both support beyond single demonstration plants and the opportunity for the UK to gain advantages from being an early mover.   &#xa0;The benefits of CCS range from the opportunity to build domestically and in international markets, a global leadership in the CCS industry, which if deployed extensively globally cold rival the oil and gas industry in the sale of investment involved.   The employment and trade benefits to the UK would be extensive.&#xa0;The USA has used CO2 for Enhanced Oil Recovery for more than 30 years and today some 6% of US oil production is produced this way.  The UK’s North Sea oil industry has a large number of oil fields that are at a point in their life where the use of CO2 for EOR and storage could significantly increase the proportion of oil that can be recovered.   If widely used, this technology could deliver billions of pounds of incremental tax revenue to The Treasury and extend the life of oil fields with all the associated employment and security of energy supply benefits that flow from that.  &#xa0;Work by the AEA has estimated benefits for UK-based firms to be £3-6.5bn per annum in the late 2020s but the case for CCS would be better understood and appreciated if there was a comprehensive analysis of the economic, fiscal and social benefits of CCS.&#xa0;&#xa0;The principal barrier to the development of large-scale integrated CCS projects is the lack of the policy incentives with sufficient long term certainty that will make what are multi-billion projects bankable.  The UK is addressing this with the creation of Contracts for Difference under the Electricity Market reform process.  However, EMR does not provided any clarity on longer term CCS objectives.  The draft Delivery Plan released in July includes scenarios which show anything from virtually no CCS projects through to a possible 12GW by 2030 whereas greater clarity exists for renewable technologies.   The lack of clarity around support for CCS also extends to a lack of guidance on a CfD price setting and allocation process for CCS projects.  &#xa0;The technologies needed for the construction and operation of large scale CCS projects - carbon capture, CO2 transportation and storage – are all proven at scale in different industries around the world and do not require further development to be used in the first large scale CCS projects.  It is the integration of these technologies to create a new CCS industry that is novel.&#xa0;The capturing, transporting and storage of CO2 are all activities that are already carried out safely at scale in different industries around the world.  The EU CCS Directive, implemented by the UK, has already put in place the framework for the regulation of the industry.  The Directive may be reviewed and possibly revised as early as 2015. While there are concerns in the industry about onerous and unpredictable liabilities on CO2 storage in saline formations in the EU, 2Co does not anticipate the issue causing the same concerns where the CO2 is used for Enhanced Oil Recovery and storage.     &#xa0;The majority of CCS projects that are making the most progress share at least three of four aspects of what is an emerging business model for early stage CSS projects:--&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A capital grant to assist with project development and possibly as a contribution to capital expenditure (examples include the EU (EEPR and NER300 programmes), UK, Canada and USA).-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Enhanced Oil Recovery to reduce the overall costs of CCS by offering low, or zero, cost CO2 storage.  In some onshore situations, such as the USA, rather than acting as a cost to the project it is a commodity with a value and can be sold.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Government backed debt as an important source of funding and to reduce the costs of financing.  For instance, there have been Federal backed loans available in the USA and export credit agencies (such as Japanese and Chinese) are active.  -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A premium price for the cost of the low-carbon electricity that will support the operation of the plant.  The UK’s Contract for Difference is an example.&#xa0;&#xa0;As both the original plans for a CCS project at Peterhead and the UK government’s first CCS competition failed to lead to the construction of the UK’s first CCS large-scale CCS project, industry is wary.  The current government has also scaled back its ambition for support for four projects to a maximum of two.  The approach in the roadmap also seems to lack pace and scale.  &#xa0;The Commercialisation Programme and work on follow-on projects need to move in parallel.  If there is a hiatus after the commercialisation programme, the opportunities afforded by early mover advantage will be lost, companies will dis-band CCS teams and move activity overseas and it will take the UK years to re-establish the skills and experience that have been nurtured to date.  In order to justify continued investment, the CCS industry needs a clear signal there will be a CCS market in the long term in the UK. &#xa0;If project partners and investors are to be comfortable about committing additional funds in projects that are not part of the Commercialisation Programme, they will quickly need greater clarity around the process and timing of support under the CfD mechanism.  These projects need the EMR process to establish a predictable CCS CfD strike price setting and allocation process that offers a bankable CfD for CCS.&#xa0;&#xa0;If widespread deployment of CCS in the UK does not start now the costs of meeting UK emissions reduction targets will be significantly higher than would otherwise be the case.  Delaying deployment of CCS until the 2020s or 2030s and trying to deploy CCS at a faster rate would stretch supply chains and drive up costs considerably.  Given the technologies used in CCS are all proven at scale around the world, 2Co does not foresee CCS failing technically.  The company’s detailed estimates of costs also give 2Co confidence CCS is a cost competitive source of low-carbon power.  The principal risk to the success of CCS is a lack of pace and scale in CCS policy and whether the CfD for CCS will be fit for purpose.Fossil fuels still account for the majority of power generated in the UK and are an important part of a robust and diverse electricity supply for the country.  CCS is the only way to secure the future of the UK’s coal mining and coal power industries and also the longer term future for the natural gas power generation industry while also meeting the UK’s legally binding emissions reduction targets.  With CCS, fossil fuels can fill an important role in meeting the energy demands of a low-carbon future – both as baseload power and as flexible power to balance the intermittency of renewables.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
