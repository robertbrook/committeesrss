[[[ (LAI 0056)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;The Justice Alliance is a coalition of charities, community groups, grass roots and other campaigning groups, trade unions, legal organisations and individuals united against the Government's proposed attack on legal aid. We believe that the residence test should be rejected in its entirety because it is:

[[[&#xa0;]]]-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; unworkable; and-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; unjust and discriminatory.&#xa0;The proposals are vague as to how the residence test will be satisfied. Our members support marginalised groups like domestic violence victims and child migrants and have drawn attention to the difficulties that clients will face when they need to provide evidence about residence and legal status. The residence test will present a bar to those who will be eligible for legal aid but unable to prove it.&#xa0;Worse still, the proposals will inevitably result in those in desperate need of legal help being prevented from getting it. This will not only have dire consequences for the people involved but will promote a culture of impunity where abuse and unlawful action against those who cannot afford to pay for legal aid will go unchecked.  This is unacceptable in our view and will weaken the rule of law by creating a two-tier justice system.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]We are an alliance&#xa0;of charities, community groups, grass roots and other campaigning groups, trade unions, legal organisations and individuals who are united in our opposition to the Government's proposed attack on legal aid and the criminal justice&#xa0;system. These legal aid proposals are part of the larger assault on essential parts of the welfare state.&#xa0;&#xa0;This submission provides evidence in relation to the proposed introduction of a residence test for civil legal aid claimants so as to limit legal aid to those with a ‘strong connection with the UK’. The reason we have focused on the residence test is that this proposal is most likely to affect those who our members support and advocate for and deny individuals access to justice. We are also concerned about the other areas to be considered by the Committee, including the proposals to change payments in judicial reviews which will make it hard for individuals to find lawyers and the proposals to remove legal aid for most prison law issues. However, we are aware that others will be addressing the Committee on these important issues.  &#xa0;We are aware that the JCHR’s call for evidence was issued prior to the consultation on judicial review published on 6 September 2013. We have deep concerns about proposals that would restrict campaigning groups from bringing judicial reviews or having costs protection. It is in our view vital that the residence test is seen in the context of these proposed wider restrictions on civil society that will prevent groups from accessing justice on behalf of those who are unable to help themselves.

[[[&#xa0;]]]We have grave concerns about how this policy will work in practice.  The proposals are unclear about what will be required to prove that a person has the appropriate amount of lawful residence. We are concerned that efforts to prove this will distract from the important task of getting legal help that is needed and will deter vulnerable people from getting legal assistance.&#xa0;The Government’s proposals would require legal aid providers to see and retain evidence on their files about lawful residence. This will place a substantial bureaucratic burden on advisers and could deter them from undertaking work for migrants as the risk of incorrect assessment would lead to a claim for their work being refused. The assessment is also likely to be far more complex than the Government suggests, especially for providers who do not specialise in immigration, an area which is now largely out of scope for legal aid. One of our members, Just Rights, observes it can take a specialist judge days to determine questions on lawful residency and a lawyer committed to protecting the rights of children and young people will simply not have the resources to do this. The Association of Prison Lawyers argues it is too simplistic to suggest that the provider will be able to make a straightforward judgement based upon a passport as the Government has previously asserted. Neither does a stamp in a passport give an easy answer. Further, prisoners simply do not have easy access to such documents, if they have them at all. The Home Office will also hold passports when an application is under consideration and communicating with them to get documents back or clarify issues of status is very difficult.  &#xa0;The Coram Children’s Legal Centre agrees that the Government has vastly simplified the issue of understanding both what is lawful residence and how it can be proven. They give the example of European Economic Area (EEA) nationals, whose lawful residence comes from the exercise of rights under the Treaties that set up the European Union. The rights of EEA nationals exist without the need for documents like a visa. For example, a French national working here is lawfully resident by the fact of their employment. Also, migrants who have made an application to extend their leave or appeal against the refusal of leave have lawful permission to be in the UK under a provision of the law that automatically extends status while an application is pending. In the experience of our members, such subtleties of immigration law are commonly misunderstood by public bodies such as the Department of Work and Pensions and private individuals like employers. The existence of a mechanism for NHS staff to check the immigration status of patients in secondary healthcare with the Home Office recognises both the complexity of this area and that sometimes documentary evidence of status will not exist. It is unreasonable to expect a legal aid lawyer to make determinations about lawful residence when most have no expertise in immigration law and the same burden is not placed on other public servants.&#xa0;In addition to proving lawful residence at the point of an application for legal aid, the Government will require migrants to show a 12-month continuous period of residence at any point in the past. This could raise difficulties for an applicant and legal aid provider if the period had taken place long ago, as illustrated by the Coram Children’s Legal Centre:&#xa0;“M is a national of France. When she was at university she lived in the UK for a year on an exchange programme. She is now 27 and has been living in the UK for the past six months with her young child and has been working. She and her child are about to be evicted and would qualify for legal aid for her housing matter, but her housing solicitor is unsure whether she meets the residence test. M cannot remember exactly how long she was in the UK when at university and cannot locate the exact dates to prove it was for 12 months. Additionally, during this time she went back to France during the holidays to see her parents and does not know whether this means she was not ‘continuously’ in the UK. Her housing solicitor asks her for evidence of her being in the UK lawfully, and does not know what to do when M says she has no visa or document to prove her lawful residence.” 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]It is clear that the residence test will result in excluding some of the most vulnerable in our communities from justice.&#xa0;&#xa0;It is clear that the residence test is designed to shut out foreign nationals from challenging government complicity in torture, inhumane and degrading treatment. This would include those subjected to extraordinary rendition and detention at Guantanamo Bay such as Binyam Mohamed and Bisher Al-Rawi, whose lawyers acted to secure their release while they were still outside the UK. If the residence test is imposed, not one of Reprieve’s clients who have been victims of human rights violations associated with the ‘war on terror’ would be eligible for legal aid. Reprieve cites how Yunus Rahmatullah, a Pakistani citizen wrongfully arrested by British forces in Iraq in February 2004 and handed over to US forces for rendition to Bagram, may not have been able to bring a judicial review claim in the UK enabling him to be formally identified. As has been widely reported, Mr Rahmatullah’s writ of habeas relief was recently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, reaffirming the importance of the UK’s obligations towards those it takes into its custody. The Justice Alliance believes that this is tantamount to immunity for unlawful Government action against those without independent means. Challenging unlawful behaviour is in the public interest, to reinforce the values we hold as a society, and for how Britain is seen by the rest of the world. And as stated by the Government’s Treasury Counsel:&#xa0;“..to prevent people bringing legal proceedings who are subject to the actions of the UK acting abroad, often in ways which are alleged to be contrary to the most fundamental human rights, is in our view impossible to reconcile with the rule of law.”

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;The people and communities most likely to be hit by the residence test are also the most likely to be at risk of unlawful abuse.&#xa0;&#xa0;The recent case of sexual exploitation at Yarl’s Wood immmigration removal centre illustrates how individuals most likely to fall foul of the residence test can be prime candidates for institutional abuse. Without the availability of legal aid to demand a full investigation, we are concerned that such practices will continue with impunity.&#xa0;The Justice Alliance also highlights the over representation of people from non British backgrounds in other cases of state abuse. The family of Jean Charles de Menezes, an innocent member of the public shot dead by police, would have been prevented from commencing civil proceedings to expose the police’s attempted cover up surrounding Jean Charles’ killing because they would not meet the residence test.  &#xa0;&#xa0;The Government has stated that victims of trafficking will now be exempt from the residence test for certain cases. However, they will be subject to the test for any case that is not about an application for leave to enter or remain, employment or a claim for damages in connection with their trafficking. The consequence of this is that an alleged victim of trafficking may be denied legal assistance at the time it is most needed. They will still have to pass the residence test to get help with cases falling under any other area of law like housing or community care. &#xa0;The residence test would also prevent an applicant getting legal aid to challenge the Government’s decision that there are no reasonable grounds to conclude they are a potential victim of trafficking. This is what happened in a recent landmark case in the High Court, where a claimant was removed to Nigeria after the Home Office determined she was not a victim of trafficking. This court found the decision to be unlawful and the Government has been ordered to return her to the UK. This claimant would have failed the residence test as she was brought here on a visitor’s visa for six months by her trafficker and was not lawfully resident at the point where she applied for legal aid and did not have 12 months of lawful residence.&#xa0;That judgment found that the Home Office policy on "historical victims" of trafficking is itself unlawful and this will have wide ranging implications for many other people. &#xa0;&#xa0;Victims of domestic violence are also likely to suffer because of the residence test. &#xa0;The Government has now introduced an exemption to the residence test for certain victims of domestic violence who need legal advice on an immigration application, but this would not extend protection to everyone who needed help. &#xa0;The Southall Black Sisters have told us about ‘Raheena’ who arrived in the UK in May 2012. &#xa0;“Although her husband was a British National, Raheena was granted ‘leave outside the immigration rules’ as she was unable to satisfy the criteria for a spouse visa. Raheena was subjected to violence and abuse from her husband on a daily basis, and kept a prisoner in her own home. As part of the abuse, her husband often threatened to send her back to Ethiopia and to forcibly remove her daughter from her care. Raheena fled the matrimonial home in December 2012. She was refused assistance by Social Services as they claimed that they only owed her daughter a duty of care as she alone was a British National. Raheena approached Southall Black Sisters and we assisted her in submitting an application for the Destitution Domestic Violence Concession (‘DDV Concession’) as she had been treated for all intents and purposes by the immigration authorities as a spousal visa applicant. This was refused. &#xa0;With our assistance, Raheena instructed immigration solicitors in March 2013 who challenged the UK Border Agency’s (UKBA) decision by way of judicial review. At a hearing at the High Court, the judge agreed with our view and overturned the UKBA’s decision not to accept Raheena’s application for the DDV Concession. The High Court also ordered the local authority to assist Raheena and her daughter with accommodation and support under the relevant provisions of Children Act 1989. &#xa0;Raheena then instructed her immigration solicitor to submit an application for settlement under the Domestic Violence Rule, which she was granted legal aid for as a result of the successful judicial review.”&#xa0;Under the residence test, Raheena would not have been eligible for legal aid to challenge the UKBA’s decision by way of judicial review as she had not been resident in the UK for 12 months. &#xa0;&#xa0;Many of those with the most pressing housing and community care needs would also suffer under the residence test.  Again, the Southall Black Sisters have told us the story of Jenna who fled Uganda in 2009 fearing persecution on the grounds of sexual orientation:&#xa0;“Jenna’s partner was killed by a mob following the discovery that they were homosexuals. Jenna entered the UK on a visitor’s visa which she overstayed. Jenna then claimed asylum on two occasions and on both occasions, she was refused. As of February 2012, she once again became an overstayer. In August 2012, Jenna was raped in the UK as a result of which, she fell pregnant. When she was seven months’ pregnant, Jenna approached her local authority for help which was refused. &#xa0;In April 2013, Jenna attended a routine hospital appointment where she disclosed her homelessness and destitution to the midwife who referred her to our services. &#xa0;Southall Black Sisters assisted Jenna in instructing community care solicitors who intervened on her behalf and eventually sent a pre-action protocol letter. On receipt of the letter, Jenna was immediately accommodated by her local authority.”&#xa0;Under the residence test,  Jenna would be excluded from legal advice from solicitors who were able to quickly and effectively help her obtain accommodation. Had she not obtained this advice, it is likely that she would still be homeless and her child could have been taken into care, depriving the child of its mother and creating an additional and unnecessary burden on public finances. &#xa0;&#xa0;The residence test would also exclude migrants with significant support needs despite a legitimate right to be in the UK. The Coram Children’s Legal Centre give the example of a child with leave to remain as a refugee dependent who would fail the residence test because he had not been in the UK for twelve months. This child would lose the chance to get help that could ensure his best interests and welfare are met, through no fault of his own:&#xa0;“L and her son came to the UK three months ago from Iran through refugee family reunion to join L’s husband. L’s son is eight and has autism and L is struggling to know how to find him suitable support and education. The local authority has not done an assessment and has not complied with its duties to L’s son. L was advised to call the Civil Legal Advice telephone gateway and established that she is eligible for legal aid and that her son’s special educational needs fall within the scope of legal aid. However, she and her son have only been in the UK for three months, so he will have to wait another nine months before he passes the residence test and can qualify for legal aid.”&#xa0;We recommend that:&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the JCHR consider the proposals to restrict legal aid in the wider context of legal aid, including any measure to restrict representative groups from bringing applications for judicial review;&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the JCHR seeks evidence from the Ministry of Justice as to how the proposed scheme will work and the impact that the proposed requirements are likely to have on access to justice;&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The JCHR concludes that the residence test must not be brought into force.&#xa0;&#xa0;We would be happy to provide further evidence or oral evidence if this would assist the committee.&#xa0;27 September 2013&#xa0;7&#xa0; www.savelegalaid.co.uk/justicealliance  Ministry of Justice, Judicial Review: Proposals for further reform, September 2013 https://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/judicial-reviewJust Rights, response to Transforming Legal Aid, 4 June 2013, para 5.6 www.justrights.org.uk/?q=resources/publications/transforming-legal-aid-consultation-response-june-2013  Association of Prison Lawyers, response to Transforming Legal Aid, 4 June 2013, para 95 www.associationofprisonlawyers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/APL-Legal-Aid-Consultation-Response.Final_.03.6.13.pdf  Coram Children’s Legal Centre, response to Transforming Legal Aid, 4 June 2013, para 36www.childrenslegalcentre.com/userfiles/Transforming_Legal_Aid_Coram_Childrens_Legal_Centre_consultation_response_June_2013.pdf  Immigration Act 1971, s.3C.
