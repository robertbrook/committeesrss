Are there good examples from other countries that could be applied in the UK? \n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow should the Highways Agency be reformed to make it “the world’s \nleading highway operator”? What roles should Government and the private sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network\n?\n&#xa0;\n1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe government plans to triple spending on road enhancements by 2021, and resurface \nover 3000 miles\n of the strategic road network, in an effort to\n \nredress the effects of\n past underi\nnvestment, as well as \npreparing for\n large increases in\n required\n capacity, and researching and implementing solutions for \nareas with enduring traffic issues.\n If properly implemented, this programme may alleviate the congestion that is estimated to cost the British economy up to £14bn per annum by 2025.\nMany opportunities are presented for efficiencies and smarter road usage.\n The government recognises the impo\nrtance of local road networks in supporting the strategic network, and is providing \n£6 billion for their maintenance over the next six years. Building on this, we suggest that\n \nr\nedefining the strategic road network to include key entry points and junctions \nwould help avoid congestion at intersections between the SRN and the local system.\nThe programme also offers £500 million in support of low-carbon technologies, with the aim of reducing the environmental footprint of road travel. Economies of scale in larg\ne highway projects offer more opportunities to invest in environmental mitigation.  The potential spread of the managed motorways programme could deliver both cost and environmental efficiencies; the effects of this and other technological innovations are \ndiscussed in section 4.\n \nIn accordance with the recommendations of the Cook Report, independence from central government will \nallo\nw the Highways Agency to realise large improvements for the strategic road network, \nwhich will be discussed in \ngreater\n detail below.\n The introduction of 5-year control periods will also allow for \na much longer planning horizon by freeing the Agency from the uncertainty of the annual Budget cycle. Furthermore, regulatory pressure is expected to create efficiencies of up to\n 20%\n in\n unit costs within 5 years of implementation, translating to £600 million in savings by 2020.\n Building on these plans, new funding options will also be available to the Agency.\n2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the era of austerity, the potential\n efficiency\n gains from effective implementation\n of multi-modal transport planning are relatively higher\n. Integrated planning with other modes of transport is essential; for example, freight distribution centres \nand ports \nshould \nhave excellent \nlink\ns\n to both the strate\ngic road network and the rail network.\n  \nThe success of the Olympic Games in London showed that when planning for all modes is linked together there can be a significant imp\nrovement in overall performance; \nCH2M HILL’s work as Delivery Partner on \nthis proje\nct\n \nrequired \nthe integration of water, rail and road systems for the efficient management of traffic, particularly freight. \nExternal multi-modal passenger information screens were deployed\n, greatly streamlining travel times to and from venues. Widespread \nimplementation of such a technology would be greatly beneficial to users of all forms of transport.\nThe government is currently collating the results of a consultation on potential reforms to Inte\ngrated Transport Block funding. \nOne area for potential impro\nvement is the planning and coordination of integrated transport in the six Metropolitan Areas; in particular, the divided responsibility for road planning and investment has been detrimental in the London area. \nThe weighting of\n public transport and congest\nion\n needs in the funding formula is being reconsidered, and may be raised. \nIn accordance for our regulatory recommendations below, the establishment of a High-Level Output Specification for roads would be directly analogous to that for the rail network; a\ns such, it would be relatively easy to integrate plans for both networks, particularly if the regulatory cycles for both utilities are aligned.\n \n3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn recent years, travel by car has dropped somewhat in Britain, using kilometres travelled per person as a metr\nic. \nThe Department for Transport’s forecasts acknowledge this decline, but do not appear to account for the reasons for it.\nStudies show that the\n \ndecline is \nlargely due to external factors, such as rising fuel prices, the cost of insurance and \ntaxation.\n Should this trend continue, \nprivate car \ndemand may be lower in the coming years than currently predicted by the \ngovernment.\n \n \nOn the other hand, r\noad freight is also sharply increasing; in conjunction with the fall in car travel, this trend may be \nconnected with the steady rise \nin internet shopping\n. Thus\n, the fall in individual demand may be counterbalanced by the rise in commercial transport.\n As above, integrated planning is essential to deliver the capacity for increased freight traffic.\nThe gover\nnment can deal with uncertainty in \ndemand \nforecasts through the use of a range of \ndifferent \nforecasts\n rather than a monolithic one\n, and \nalso by understanding how forecasts have been produced by \nbreaking down predictions into \ntheir \nconstituent parts. For example, an exogenous growth forecast could be based upon \nchanges in factors such as \nGDP\n (for disposable income)\n, population growth, employment, fuel costs and insurance costs\n. \nBy understanding the assumptions behind and the signific\nance of each of these factors, forecasts can be updated as economic indicators \nchange over time.  \nThe Department for Transport currently utilises a \nregularly updated Rail Usage Demand Database from which \nforecasts of \nrail \npassenger demand\n are derived\n.\n A si\nmilar system could be established for roads.\n4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe r\neliability \nand efficiency of travel \non the strategic road network can be improved through \nthe implementation of \nsmarter technology. \nFor example t\nhe provision of real-time information to users \nand the \nphasing of traffic lights to minimise delays\n lead to tangible improvements in journey times. The Highways Agency is seeking to launch a workable driver information service through \nsmartphones\n and GPS in 2014.\nThe use of laser scanners by police to record n\necessary information from traffic incidents provides an average reduction of 40 minutes in road closures. \nThis technology is currently being used by \n27 police forces, and further investment should prove beneficial. By the same token, investment in safety m\neasures prevents incidents and further improves the reliability of the network. \nThe results of the M42 managed motorway trial suggest that widespread implementation of this programme \nc\nould sharply reduce the incidence of accidents and fatalities, increase \ncapacity a\nnd decrease journey times. Additionally, emissions and noise levels are also reduced.\nOne aim of t\nhe government’s current investment programme\n is to resurface 80% of the strategic road network by 2021, as well as carrying out other maintenance and enhancement projects.\n Res\nurfacing\n \nreduces the amount of damage caused \nto vehicles from potholes, decreasing the number of breakdowns and improving\n eff\niciency\n. \nHowever, the challenge of managing road space and maintaining journey time reliability during such a significant programme of investment must be addressed; as most work is already carried out at night, options for avoiding disruption are limited.\nRevising the Agency’s funding cycle to a 5-year regulatory period would facilitate a constant stream of maintenance work, as opposed to the discontinuous nature of the annual budgetary cycle. \nThis transition also presents the opportunity to redefine the st\nrategic road network to include key entry points and junctions, helping to avoid congestion at intersections between the SRN and local system\ns\n.\nOther new technology can address environmental concerns while delivering efficiencies and reliability; \ncurrently, a system of ‘smart’ highways is being piloted in the Netherlands, which includes solar-powered street markings to indicate wet or icy sections of road, and windmill-powered efficient street lighting that is only active when vehicles are within a\n certain range, saving large amo\nunts i\nn energy costs. This project should be closely observed, and if successful and cost-effective, implemented in the UK.\nAs detailed below, converting the strategic road network into a regulated utility will create a clea\nr, long-term output specification for performance with well-defined standards for safety and resilience, and the Highways Agency will be held to account for failures.\n \n5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe implementation of a Regulatory Asset Base (R\nAB) model is one option for increasing i\nnvestment in the strategic road network,\n and has been used extensively in the corporatisation of other public ass\nets in the UK\n and across Europe\n. Rail is the most similar sector, but it also applies to water, power and airports in the UK. \nThis mo\ndel uses \nthe valuation of network assets as a basis for setting access charges, outputs and incentive structures across predetermined control periods.\n Using such a structure would provide certainty of funding for the network, reducing the costs of uncertainty from \nthe annual budgetary cycle. Instead, longer regulatory cycles would be used, providing investment horizons of 5 years or longer.\nT\nhe \nstrategic road network\n would form the core \nof a highways\n \nRAB\n. The model has several advantages over a PPP or PFI model; \nnamely that its cost of capital is cheaper, the valuation of its assets forms a solid and consistent foundation for a sustainable price control, and a pricing cap imposed by an independent regulator provides transparency and reassurance to consumers and fi\nnance providers. However, an accurate valuation of the entire SRN is likely to require a lengthy audit. Thus, an approximation will be necessary, with initial financing based on this valuation.\n Such an approximation\n was used\n in establishing the RAB for Net\nwork Rail.\n As a case s\ntudy, \nthe use of the model in restructuring Scottish Water serve\ns\n as an example of best practice\n, with drastic increases in quality of service concurrent with a 35% decrease in operational expenditures over a 10-year period\n.\nAs a \ngovernment-owned company, the Highways Agency will be capable of borrowing from the private sector, allowing for increased financial flexibility.\n \nThis is a\n \nfeature of most regulatory regimes and \nallows the company\n to manage\n \nits business \neffectively over \nre\ngulatory period\ns. \nSuch a reserve could also protect the\n \nconsumer by \nproviding insulation\n between long-term planning requirements and the shorter\n \nterm public expenditure framework\n.\nThe precise method of securing a revenue \nstream,\n and associated financing fo\nr the SRN cannot be finalised until broader policy questions on road charging have been considered. We are experienced in various approaches to tolling that are used to charge road users for access to strategic highways assets: for example, the Agency may \nwish to adopt systems tailored by factors such as peak time, location and vehicle emissions. The European Union mandates that electronic toll systems be compatible with those on the continent, so it may be sensible to use a ‘badge’ system such as that used\n by the French, which seamlessly integrates toll systems from all regions with no work required on the part of the road user.\nIf an alternative method of charging is implemented, a transition\nal\n period of shadow tolling \nis likely to be essential\n, in which\n the government\n \npay\ns operators for road\n usage rather than \nconsumers\n. \nThis payment is \nbased on the num\n&#xad;\nber and type of vehi\n&#xad;\ncles using the road, with adjust\n&#xad;\nments made for lane clo\n&#xad;\nsure and safety per\n&#xad;\nfor\n&#xad;\nmance\n.\n This system is useful in\n transferring\n \nt\nraffic risk \nto developers and \noperator\ns\n as it\n \ndoes not impair traffic levels in the same manner as\n real tolls or toll increases\n do\n; \nit \nallows the government to draw upon m\nultiple sources of revenue\n \nto contri\nbute to a shadow toll fund; and p\nroject cost obli\ngations to the public se\nctor sponsor\n in terms of \ncapi\ntal, maintenance and operations costs \nshould\n be reasonably known in advance\n,\n and\n can be\n guaranteed \nfor a particular traffic level.\nTo \novercome\n the general aversion to tolling that is historically observed in the UK, it is \nour \nrecomm\nendation\n that Vehicle Excise Duty, \no\nr a portion thereof,\n b\ne phased out. In the transition period, VED could be used as a source of revenue for shadow tolls, while \nbeing replaced by actual tolls over a set period of time; 5 to 10 years\n (one to two regulatory cycles)\n may be appropriate.\nIn the same fashion as Network Rail, we expect that Government will set out the funding requirements for the ne\ntwork in a High-\nLevel \nOutput Specification,\n an outcome-based programme for \nthe framework. This will probably be done \nover\n five year periods. We expect that HA will work with the independent regulator and the government to finalise this specification. The independent regulator will determine an affordable price cap and the level of returns allowed on the RAB, and HA will set \na planning framework, overall objectives and licensing agreements for regional operators. The operators will draw their capital from the financial markets, and provide access to road users who will pay VED, tolls, and/or analogous charges to the operators,\n and taxes to the government. \nAn\n interpretation of this\n system is laid out in the diagram below.\nBased on the size of the network and experience with other utilities, the use of several regional operators is recommended. A simple method of dividing the reg\nions would be to use the 13 existing HA areas. This allows for performance to be benchmarked between regions, enabling the regulator to compare unit costs and identify efficiencies.\n6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe World Economic Forum\n’s Global Competitiveness Report\n ra\nnks\n France as \nthe best highway operator in the world\n, with the UK in twenty-fourth place\n. However, \nthe metric used in this survey was strictly output-based, in that it relied on the opinions of business leaders regarding the quality of road infrastructure in their own country. As such, it is theoretically possible that the leading agency could be ineffi\ncient in the allocation of its resources, yet still delivering a good set of outputs. By contrast, \nwe believe the leading agency should follow\n the\n aforementioned\n example of Scottish Water; achieving increased quality of service for road users, while delive\nring cost efficiencies from \nwithin\n.\n \nA \nwell implemented\n RAB offers the opportunity for both\n.\n Private sector expertise in corporatisation should be drawn on extensively during the transition.\nThe reformation of the Highways Agency is \nkey\n to the successful\n implementation of a RAB model, and many of the \nnecessary \nchanges specific to this issue are outlined in the previous section.\n Other benefits to reform in line \nwith the reco\nmmendations of the Cook Report\n are detailed below\n.\nDistance from central government \nwould\n remove the HA’s focus from \npolitically charged \nhigh-profile local matters, specific schemes and programmes, and operational and\n \nmethodological techniques in areas such as traffic management, information services and\n \nreliability measures\n, allowing for strategic policymaking in terms of value for money, resource allocation and the customer experience.\nThe use of a High-Level Output Specification would provide: \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nnecessary pressure on the Agency to create an evidence base\n for informed asset management decisions; \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ntransparency regarding long term goals and success in achieving these;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nforesight regarding capacity and maintenance needs; and\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ncertainty\n of policy direction and freedom from reactive political decisions.\nAs the st\nrategic road network is a natural monopoly, \ncompetition does not exist to drive costs down or incentivise good performance. \nHowever\n, regulatory pressure can fill \nthe gap\n, providing these public goods\n.\n This\n benefit\n has been observed in the corporatisation of other public utilities in the UK.\n It is recommended that this function be carried out by an entity separate from the Department for Transport which would be appropriately resourced and insulated from political p\nressures.\nThe removal of civil service constraints would also be beneficial to the Agency in several areas. Most importantly, if wages are improved at senior levels and performance related bonuses implemented, the Agency will be able to compete with the pr\nivate sector to recruit and retain the best commercial talent.\n A relaxation of bureaucratic controls would reduce wastage, and allow p\nrocedural flexibility \nto\n improve responsiveness \nto operational issues.\n \nI\nnternal benchmarking should be used to maintain be\nst practice.\nConclusionIn summary, \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe government’s plans for the strategic road network have the potential to deliver great improvements in quality of service, cost efficiencies and environmental concerns, as well as laying the groundwork for intensive \nreforms to the Highways Agency.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMulti-modal \nplanning is essential to deliver quality of service and cost efficiencies. By moving the Agency to a similar regulatory regime to Network Rail, it will be easier to plan for both networks at once.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are sever\nal methods the government can use to add rigour to its road use demand forecasts. It is also advised that research into the ongoing decline in individual private car use be carried out.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nContinuing investment into the adoption of new technologies will deliv\ner safer, more environmentally friendly and more efficient roads. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe use of a Regulatory Asset Base is proven to deliver efficiencies in many public utilities, and will provide opportunities for the Highways Agency to decrease unit costs while increasing\n quality of service.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo this end, a variety of supporting reforms are recommended.\n&#xa0;\nIdeally, a workable long-term investment strategy and business plan for the SRN should be delivered by the end of 2014, in preparation for a transition process starting in \nearly 2015. \nThe Agency\n will also need to deal with challenges and constraints\n \nsuch as skills/training and network occupancy while the annual capital expenditure on major road schemes triples over the next decade to accommodate expected growth. Many changes\n are expected, but with careful management and advice, \nthe Highways Agency can\n ensure that the transition to a fully effective corporate body is smooth, and that the supply chain and wider industry have the capacity and capability to deliver the required l\nevel of investment. \n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n CBI: Bold Thinking: \nA model to fund our future roads\n, 2012\n"
