"Written evidence submitted by Mr Robert F Fleet&#xa0;I have been involved with my local community woodland; \nWooplaw\n, for over 20 years and visited many others in Scotland. Submitted as an individual in a personal capacity. \n&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;1              How does Scotland compare to other countries in terms of the pattern of land ownership?&#xa0;\nFor vast areas of Scotland it is unknown who the actual owners are.\n&#xa0;\nRegistration is allowed for nominee companies, trusts and consortia with no reference to those financing them.\n&#xa0;\nThere should be a register of land ownership for Scotland with no exclusions.\n \nCommunities and individuals have found it difficult if not impossible to determine ownership in some cases where a development might be proposed. This is wrong.\n&#xa0;\nWithout the knowledge of who owns and benefits from the land it is possible that criminal activity could be supported and even subsidies paid to criminals who invest in land.\n&#xa0;\nCrown \nCommissioners\n should be consistent and take action against all who attempt fraud such as selling half of the \nCuillins\n when they don’t own it. The land register should show this definitively.\n&#xa0;\nReading of Andy Wightman’s book ‘The poor had no lawyers’ should be compulsory. Perhaps a chapter at a time to allow anger to subside.\n&#xa0;\n2              What are the benefits and disadvantages of the current pattern of land ownership, and to what extent is this pattern sustained and reinforced by subsidy and taxation arrangements?\n&#xa0;\nLand ownership applies a secondary planning policy on any tenants of that land. If the owner disagrees then it will not happen. There is no incentive or provision for tenants to benefit from improvements on land\n&#xa0;\nSingle Farm Payment Schemes should be just that. Any owner should not be entitled to more than one. \nLarge estates with multiple tenanted farms should be classified as one farm unless they are sold to separate farmers. This is a subsidy which is not reaching those who it is intended for.\n&#xa0;\nLarge estates argue that they are businesses due to a minority affording to hunt and fish on them. They should therefore pay business rates. In fact they employ few people and then only seasonally.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nBalmoral\n Estate should not be subject to a separate legislation avoiding tax.\nMoney laundering for criminals is almost encouraged – what better way to hide funds when ownership is hidden?\n&#xa0;\n3              Is the current system of land tenure in Scotland the most efficient model for food security? In particular, is the current land ownership pattern contributing to, or inhibiting, economic and community development? Is it socially just?&#xa0;Land buy-outs by communities show how they feel to have an ‘unjust’ landlord.\n \nKnoydart\n and \nEigg\n and Rum show this and are thriving communities.\n \nLarge areas of land are at the whim of an absentee landlord.\n&#xa0;\n4              Given mounting political interest in, or commitment to, a programme of land reform in Scotland, what form should this programme take?Named ownership for a start.\n \nThe community right to buy should be extended.\n \nSchemes to allow ownership to transfer without coming onto the market should be curtailed, except perhaps inheritance.\n&#xa0;\nPerhaps it is asking too much for political parties to follow through on their pre-election rhetoric.\n&#xa0;\nProperties which is not being managed or intentionally left to become derelict should be taxed additionally. The land value is often being inflated due to a derelict building circumventing planning rules. It is criminal to see so many houses being left to rot rather than sold or renovated at the same time as a housing demand.\n&#xa0;\n5              What sort of subsidies and grants are available to landed estate owners in Scotland? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the subsidy regime? In particular, are support payments being capitalized into land values and making these higher than they otherwise would be?&#xa0;\nRental for \nwindfarms\n is an incredible amount compared to that \npayed\n to the local communities\n.\n&#xa0;\nSingle farm payments should mean that. Only a single payment for only one farm to any owner.\n&#xa0;\nSRDP grants are set up to benefit large landowners and are extremely difficult for community groups to access. They do not recognise the need or pathway to accommodate them.\n&#xa0;\nAny public subsidy should bring with it some public ownership. The poor are being fleeced to subsidise the rich in many cases.\n&#xa0;\nWhy do we pay some subsidies when there is no market for what we \nsubsidi\nse\n?. If people don’t want to buy wool or beef then the market should decide. How long do we support a non sustainable industry? Do we continue to pay unemployed bobbin makers or crinoline designers? There are alternative uses for land.\n&#xa0;\nIf sheep don’t pay then perhaps timber will. Break the vicious circle and pay to diversify not continue a dead industry. If an industry is failing then public funds are used to retrain the staff not pay them indefinitely.\n&#xa0;\n6              How does the tax regime affect the way in which land is owned in Scotland? For instance, does it offer landed estate owners the opportunity to minimize the tax they pay, thereby increasing the value of land, adding to speculative interest (on the part of those looking for ways to minimize or avoid tax) and making it less likely that it will be made available to others?&#xa0;Of course it does. You don’t even know who owns the land, yet alone where they are domiciled or pay tax.\n&#xa0;\nInvestors make money from the land not the property or improvements on it.\n&#xa0;\nIt cost\ns\n the same to build a house on two different plots but the purchase cost differs due to the land value. Hence the land value should be taxed.\n&#xa0;\nReference ‘\nThe poor had no lawyers’\n.\n&#xa0;\n7              How easy is it for communities in Scotland to take ownership of land and other assets? Should it be made easier in the light of the substantial achievements of existing community ownership groups?&#xa0;\nIt is not easy. For instance why were the crafting counties in the North East excluded from crafting legislation?\n&#xa0;\nSRDP grants are extremely difficult for community groups to access.\n \nThey seem to be set up to maintain the status quo and subsidise large estates. There is no great profit or turn over for some of these groups so they seem inconsequential as they obviously have no value.\n&#xa0;\nWhy is it impossible for publicly owned land held by the Forestry Commission to be handed over to Community ownership? It seems that the state insists it is bought by grants from the like of the lottery fund hence filling the state coffers from the lottery. This is immoral and not what the lottery is for.\n&#xa0;8              How easy is it for tenant farmers in Scotland to buy their farms? Should they be granted an absolute right to buy? Would such a right be compatible with human rights conventions and declarations?&#xa0;\nYes, it will increase the population’s investment in the land.\n&#xa0;\n9              Is there a case for establishing a Land Agency to facilitate both the expansion of community ownership and the creation of new, especially “starter”, tenancies on land acquired for this purpose?&#xa0;\nYes!\nIt should also encompass all Crown Estates, SNH and Local Authority held land.\n&#xa0;\n10              How easy is it for land in public ownership to be transferred to communities and other private individuals, where that would be in the public interest? Should steps be taken to make it easier? For instance, should the UK and Scottish Governments compile a register showing land and assets for disposal? Should there be changes in the way in which such land and assets are valued? What UK Treasury rules are relevant to this area?&#xa0;\nIt is too complex – Community groups are expected to buy the land from the\n \nForestry Commission often through grants such as the National lottery. The public buying from the public.\n \nThere should be a register of all public land and common land\n&#xa0;\n11              Should a Land Value Tax of some sort be introduced in Scotland, as a replacement or addition to council tax and business rates?&#xa0;YES.\n \nHouse prices vary by the area and land value independently of the actual house built on them.\n \nThe house is an improvement to the land and is to be encouraged not always taxed.\n \nLand used as a business such as a sporting estate should be taxed as a business.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n"
