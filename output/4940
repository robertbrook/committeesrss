defaultWritten evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Greater Manchester [CST0061]default&#xa0;
defaultThank you for your letter concerning crime statistics. I would like to take this opportunity to further explain the approach to crime statistics and performance management in Greater Manchester. This follows the evidence provided at the Home Affairs Committee by myself and Sir Peter 
defaultFahy
default, the Chief Constable.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy Police and Crime Plan for Greater Manchester contains nine specific police and crime objectives. The Chief Constable has set three commitments which are the foundation of the action to deliver the plan (please see the attached document). Following the Home Secretary's decision to abandon national crime targets, I have agreed with the Chief Constable a number of objectives rather than setting targets which can distort behaviour. There are no specific numerical targets set for the police force but five high level indicators, which are reported to me on a monthly basis together with a contextual view of performance. On a quarterly basis, a formal performance discussion takes place in public. The high level indicators are:

default&#xa0;
defaultObservers from my office regularly attend the key internal police performance meetings including the Senior Leadership Forum and quarterly reviews, providing feedback. Although measures and indicators are used to monitor and identify performance threats, no statistical crime reduction or solved crime targets are set internally at a force or divisional level.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe HMIC Inspection Programme for this year includes a review of crime data integrity, examining the effectiveness of the police in dealing with reports of crime by members of the public. It is expected that this inspection will include whether the police determine correctly that there has been a crime and that the correct crime category has been used.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe role of the Force Crime Registrar at Greater Manchester Police is to provide independence to the incident and crime recording process within the Force and also to provide day to day advice and guidance. There is also a designated decision maker for each territorial Division and the Public Protection Division, responsible for all aspects of crime recording and integrity locally. Regular audits of crime recording (based on HMIC methodology) for various crime categories are currently undertaken by the Force Crime Audit Unit at the direction of the Force Crime Registrar. Liaison meetings take place between the Force Crime Registrar and my office, together with independent reality checking and dip sampling of crime and incidents, also carried out by my office. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI am, however, keen to improve the reality checking processes in relation to crime recording, especially in the light of recent publicity. I have initiated an internal audit review of crime recording in GMP. This audit of crime figures and recording processes will be overseen by the professional audit team. This should help to improve independent oversight and provide further reassurance around crime statistics.

defaultGMP's commitmentsdefault&#xa0;defaultThe Police and Crime Commissioner has set nine specific police and crime objectives for Greater Manchester. These form the basis of the Police and Crime Plan 2013-2016.
default&#xa0;
defaultGreater Manchester Police's response to this is the Force Delivery Plan, which sets out some key actions, but not everything, that the Force will do to meet the Commissioner's objectives. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe nine objectives have been grouped into three commitments that the Chief Constable has stated are at the foundation of the action required to deliver the plan:
