defaultOrganisation overview
defaultEurogroup for Animals is an international, non-governmental organisation that acts as the leading voice for 
defaultanimal welfare at the European Union level providing a voice for the billions of animals kept in laboratories, farms and homes or living in the wild. As a federation of 40 animal welfare organisations across Europe
default, we mobilise millions of citizens to def
defaultend the welfare of animals and act to ensure European, national and local decision makers take note and respond to our concerns.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultReason
default for written submission
defaultAs an animal welfare policy organisation, we believe strongly that scientific evidence exists 
defaultjustifying the prohibition of primates as pets. 
defaultSeveral of our member organisations operate rescue centres and sanctuaries for confiscated and unwanted exotic pets
default and are well
default-
defaultacquainted with welfare suffering of primates being unsuitably kept as pets. A few of these organisations (e.g. RSPCA, One Kind, Stichting AAP) will be submitting
default detailed
default evidence directly on this issue
default regarding the number of animals rescued and related 
defaultwelfare concerns. Therefore, we are focusing our submission of evidence to studies and statements by experts documenting the risks of primate pet keeping and related trade. Furthermore, we provide evidence of 
defaultthe regulatory actions by other European countr
defaulties to restrict the keeping of primates as pets.
default&#xa0;
defaultExecutive Summary
default&#xa0;
defaultComments
defaultPrimates are highly intelligent animals with specialised dietary, social and environmental needs that are difficult, if not impossible, to meet in a household environment. Primates of all ages and size can pose a significant physical and health threat to o
defaultwners. Many primates, including great apes, are still sourced from the wild, threatening wild populations 
defaultand contributing to biodiversity loss
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHealth &amp; safety risks to humans
default&#xa0;
defaultPrimates pose a significant health risks to humans due to their phylogenetic
default proximity. Furthermore, they can inflict severe bites and injuries to humans. A bibliogra
defaultphic review of zoonotic disease
default risks from exotic pets commissioned by Eurogroup for Animals identified a number of zoonoses (diseases spread between animals and huma
defaultns) documented in primates, including: rabies, monkey B virus, tuberculosis, Ebola virus, as well as zoonoses transmitted through bites and parasites
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultEndangered species 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe trade in primates for pets has been linked to wild population declines in many
default species. One of the most endangered primates, the Barbary macaque (
defaultMacaca sylvanus
default) from North Africa
default,
default is suffering drastic declines due to 
defaulthabitat loss and 
defaultthe illegal pet trade to Europe
default,
default. The Trade Sustainability 
defaultImpact Assessment of the free trade 
defaultagreement currently being
default&#xa0;
defaultnegotiated between the EU and Morocco documents this illegal trade
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultUNEP’s Great Ape 
defaultSurvival Partnership report, Stolen Apes, estimates that 3000 chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos and orangutans are lost 
default(
defaulteither sold, killed duri
defaultng the hunt, or dying in captivity)
default&#xa0;
defaultfrom the wild in Africa and Asia each year
default. 
defaultExamining confiscation records, international trade databases, law enforcement reports, and arrival rates from sanctuaries and rehabilitation centers between 2005 and 2011, 
defaultthe report estimates that for every chimpanzee confiscated or confirmed in illegal trade, 10 more animals died during the capture
default or trafficking. Markets for tourist entertainment, disreputable zoos and pets are generating the demand and illegal permits ar
defaulte often used to traffic wild animals. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLegislative restrictions on the keeping of primates
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2012, Eurogroup for Animals conducted a
default comprehensive legislative review on the keeping and sale of exotic animals in 31 European countries
default. The analysis
default found 
defaultthat 22 countries restrict keeping
default of exotic animals as pets
default based on negative lists of prohibited species
default. Belgium is the one country that regulates keeping via a positive list of acceptable mammal species (this list does not include primates). 
defaultThe competent authority in Belgium has noted that a positive list has been a cost-effective and useful enforcement approach to regulating pets, as the public 
defaultreports illegal sales online and in pet shops
default. 
defaultPeople holding species not on the positive list at
default the time of its adoption were allowed to maintain their animals provided they registered them with the competent authority
default.
default 
defaultThe Netherlands has announced it will switch to a positive list for mammals in 2014 (primates are not allowed to be kept)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSeve
defaultral countries have included primates (or certain groups of primates) on their negative lists
default of species which cannot be kept as pets
default, including: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, 
defaultFrance, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Sweden. The report contains tables summarising restrictions on the keeping and sale of exotic animals across European countries, as well as one-page country summ
defaultaries on legislative restrictions and 
defaultfuture legislative plans. An Executive 
defaultS
defaultummary brochure is also available
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultScientific studies examine primate pet keeping and use in entertainment
default&#xa0;
defaultA University of Bristol study on the welfare and suitability of 
defaultprimates kept as pets concluded “it is unlikely that the welfare of pet primates can be adequately addressed in normal households” and argued the practice should end (Soulsbury et al. 2009)
default. 
defaultIt noted that the majority of primate-related complaints received by the RSPCA between 2000-2005 concerned neglect. This might suggest owners are unaware and perhaps incapable of meeting the complex needs of primates in a household setting. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA study 
defaultby Sc
defaulthroepher et al. 2011
default 
defaultexamining the use of chimpanzees in entertainment (e.g. movies, commercials, print advertisement) 
defaultsuggested a strong distortion in the public’s view of chimpanzees as endangered species and suitability as pets
default. It noted the use of med
defaultia 
defaultwith chimpanzees interacting with humans as “pets” 
defaultin non-range countries may 
defaultencourage animal traffickers and poachers in range countries to capture infants for this market. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultScientists and veterinarians caution against primate pet keeping
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2013,
default the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe issued a policy statement calling on competent authorities to establish lists of animals to regulate the keeping of companion animals. It noted positive 
defaultlists may be preferable and that lists should be based on sc
defaultientific criteria including “risks for the animals itself, its owners and the society, the indigenous species and ecosystems.”
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the United States, a consumer information program on exotic pet choices called PetWatch
default was developed by EcoHealth
default Alliance, an international organization of scientists focused on the conservation of biodiversity by examining the relationships between, wildlife, ecosystems and human health. A team of scientists conducted searches on 
defaultgeneral, popular, industry and acad
defaultemic databases to acquire information
default&#xa0;
defaulton four criteria (
defaultsource sustainability, invasion threat, animal welfare and health threat) 
defaultto generate a list of 
defaultthe Best, Fair and Worst choices of exotic pets. 
defaultThe primate species assessed (
defaulte.g. common marmoset, rhe
defaultsus macaques, squirrel monkeys) 
defaultwere all classified as “worst choices” and not recommended for pet keeping. 
default&#xa0;
defaultConfiscated and unwanted pet primates
default&#xa0;
defaultSeveral of Eurogroup for Animals’ member organisations 
defaultfacilitate the 
defaultrescue 
defaultof 
defaultconfiscated and unwanted pet primates each year. As 
defaultstated
default 
defaultabove, 
defaultsome of these groups will be submitting written evidence directly
default and we would refer you to their submissions
default for data on the trade and keeping in the UK
default and related conclusions on the effec
defaulttiveness of the current 
defaultregulations and 
defaultcode of practice
default. An indication of the types of 
defaultmammals (including primates)
default in need of rescue
default in other EU Member States
default can be found in the data published online by Stichting AAP (one of our Dutch member 
defaultorganisatio
