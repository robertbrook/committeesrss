"Written evidence submitted by Telespazio VEGA (ESA014)&#xa0;0.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK has a \ndynamic \nspace industry that has been \ninfluenced \nby successive UK Gover\nnments. Britain’s investment in E\nuropean Space Agency (\nESA\n)\n programmes is a \nkey driver in\n this success story \nand continued UK involvement will \ncontinue to support\n \nthe \nsector’s \nexport and growth ambitions\n;\n&#xa0;\n0.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nformation\n of the UK Space Agency \n(UKSA) \nhas helped to drive a more ambitious\n,\n growth\n-oriented\n space policy, yet more needs to be done to strengthen the \nA\ngency and focus its resources and skills to \nmaximise economic opportunities\n, including exploiting EU budgets\n and stronger support to the export market\n;\n&#xa0;\n0.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMuch progress has been made in recent years to maximise UK value from (and influence in) ESA, through strategic investment in ESA operational programmes and in developing the ESA Harwell facility.  However, \ncontinued and growing \nsuccess in Europe requires a \nsignificantly\n larger \nUK \nnational space programme, as \nin \nFrance, Germany and Italy;\n  \n&#xa0;\n0.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe\n believe that the UKSA should\n play a more assertive role in ESA itself, for example in pushing for UK \nD\nirectors\n at ESA\n, an\nd stronger influence on the key decisio\nns made by the Programme Boards;\n&#xa0;\n0.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTelespazio VEGA played a leading role in producing the UKspace Trade Association input and fully endorses its key messages.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nESA has played a crucial role in building a competitive and innovative space industry in Europe. ESA’s procurement principles ensure that investment by Member States helps to shape ESA programmes and they ensure that this investment is channelled back proportionately into national priority areas. \nJ\nuste retour\n has provided a reliable \n–\n and\n \naccountable \n–\n mechanism\n \nfor guaranteeing return on investment by ESA member states.\n \nWe\n want to see these principles retained. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the UK has won a greater share of EU space research grants and infrastructure and service contracts thus far than it has invested by virtue of its membership of the EU, suggesting that the UK fares well out of both ESA’s and the EU’s procurement processes\n;\n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nESA has changed considerably over the last decade\n.\n ESA has developed world-class skills and competences that must be retained and utilised.\n \nIt has\n broadened its horizons from a s\ncientific R&amp;D organisation into one that also ha\ns a strong focus on supporting i\nndustry. Especially through its ARTES \nt\nelecommunications \np\nrogrammes\n,\n it is helping \ni\nndu\ns\ntry \ndevelop/retain\n world-leading expertise and service offerings to the large, and growing commercial market\n. It has also \nbegun to create \nthe \ns\npace \ni\nnfrastructure for \nn\navigation and \ne\narth \no\nbservation that will allow \ni\nndustry to exploit these grow\ning downstream services markets;\n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor multinationals \nsuch as the Telespazio Group, \nESA has had a fundamental role in developing competence, competitiveness and trans-national supply chains\n. This has \nallow\ned an\n overlap of technologies which helps \nprovide core \n capabilities \nrequired on the \ndifferent\n National Programmes;\n&#xa0;\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nESA and specifically \nthe \nE\nuropean Space Operations Centre in Germany (E\nSOC\n),\n has helped the UK d\nevelop European leadership in satellite ground segment and o\nperations at a low cost to the UK \n(\nas \nthe \nreturn is partially allocated to Germany\n)\n;\n&#xa0;\n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe flexibility of the Optional Programmes has allowed the UK to develop leading technologies in th\ne more commercial Space sectors by targeting its investment in ESA in the most appropriate Programmes;\n&#xa0;\n1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nESA has a long history of managing complex high\n \ntechnology\n-\nri\nsk programmes. In most cases these have been successful and delivered on time and \nto \nbudget. \nHowever, \nthe Galileo procurement processes of both the European Commission and ESA proved susceptible to \np\nolitical \nintervention, leading to cost overruns and delays, underlining the \nneed for\n strong UK political engagement in \nboth\n organisations\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcome the arrival of the EU into space policy. Space is increasingly vital for delivering public policy at local, regional, national and supra-national levels, and has a key role in reaching Lisbon Treaty objectives of a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy by creating high-skilled jobs, commercial opportunities, boosting innovation and improving citizens’ well-being and security. For example, Copernicus (formerly GMES) is a vital tool for the EU in environmental protection.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiven ESA\n’\ns success, \nwe\n share the UK Government\n’s concern about any \noverly hasty move to bring ESA under the wing of the EU, and \nsupport\n the Government\n’\ns cautious approach to moving the two institutions closer together.\n \nTo align the need for coordination with the importance of maintaining distinct roles, t\nhe \nCommission’s proposal\n for ESA to set up a specific ESA directorate in charge of implementing EU programmes, under EU rules, should be evaluated.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nWe\n \nstrongly support an EU role as space p\nolicy lead and sponsor for downstream services dedicated to socio-economic applications.\n \nWe\n would like to see this EU role, promoting space exploitation, \nbetter\n reflected \nand co-ordinated \nin Horizon 2020.\n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOverall UK advocacy in EU space areas remains under-resourced and under-structured, partly reflecting the fast evolving natur\ne of the EU’s space landscape. W\ne encourage UKSA to review and strengthen its own resourcing in\n relation \nto EU space matters\n, including, for instance, \npromotion of\n more UK nationals in the EU’s growing space policy community\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nR&amp;D is \nan important enabler \nof economic growth\n and underpins the competitiveness of the space industry\n.  \nThe innovation component of the EU’s next seven-year budget is\n an opportunity to \nbuild\n a platform for growth \nand competitiveness\n. Asia, for example, currently reinvests 3.5% of total GDP in R&amp;\nD\n, whilst Europe commits just 2%. Placing Horizo\nn 2020\n at the centre of Europe's \neconomic plans \nwould send a very clear message that the EU and its \nM\nember \nS\ntates are committed to fostering innovation and \neconomic \ngrowth\n;\n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe long-term nature of R&amp;D cycles in the space sector means that stable funding is especially important for businesses. EU funding should focus on the very early stages of technology development in order to mitigate the risks for companies, universities and individuals investing in experimental technology and in \nproving the feasibility of new\n satellite-enabled service capabilities\n;\n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA specific weakness of the EC’s FP7 research programme has been lack of funding for satellite communications and satellite navigation applications.\n&#xa0;\n DG ENT\nR\n’s space research programme largely ignores telecommunications, despite the contribution of satellite communications to growth and public policy, \ne.g.\n in the EU Digital Agenda targets for 2020 for deployment of high-speed broadband to all European citizens. \n&#xa0;\nFunding for developing satellite navigation applications has also been lacking in recent years, despite the progress made on the launch of the \nGalileo\n satellites\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is essential that these \nomissions \nare \ncorrected\n in Horizon 2020\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUKSA has been significantly under-resourced, affecting its relationships with industry, and degrading the perceived transparency of its decision-making.  Examples are in dealing with EC communications and in producing the\n promised National Space Policy;\n  \n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe\n believe that there are a number of improvements that could be made by UKSA\n.\n These\n include the need for UKSA to\n:\n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe failure of the UK to achieve any director in ESA, compared with three each for France, Italy and Germany, is a failure of\n ambition and influence by UKSA;\n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn the European front to maintain momentum with ESA \nthe UKSA\n must influence their Programmes to meet UK policy objectives. \nThey\n must \ntry to \noptimise the return from our\n ESA subscriptions in terms of noble w\nork which is focused on technologies with real market potential wherever possible\n;\n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUKSA must work closely with industry to ensure that together \nwe\n are delivering on growth. The current work on the IGS is vital to reach the target 10% share of the global market by 2030.   Growth is driven by the downstream services market so we must target key sectors for growth and work with the other Catapults to fully exploit these markets. \nWorking in partnership with other government departments the UKSA can work pro-actively to unlock barriers to market, support access to export markets and thus take science and technology into the global marketplace\n;\n&#xa0;\n4.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEffective ESA \nand EC \nengagement requires complementary national funding to create the conditions in which industry can win greater share\ns\n of ESA noble work\n and EU funding\n. This approach is well recognised and practised by our \ninter\nnational competitors. \nWe\n therefore welcome the establishment of the National Space Technology Programme (a key recommendation of the first Space IGS in 2010) and its refinancing in the Autumn Statement of 2012. However, a stronger NSTP \nis \nan essential test of UKSA’s commitment to help maximise UK economic return from EU and ESA space spend\n. This is also key to\n risk reduction of new commercial initiatives which can then attract City funding.\n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK has \ndeveloped world leadership in both space science and in commercial export markets, part\nly from \ntargeted investment in ESA programmes with proven \nscientific and \neconomic \npotential, notably ARTES.  However, \na better balance between national and ESA investment is essential if the UK is to fully explo\nit its ESA (and EU) investments;\n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nESA is a vital wealth creation mechanism for the UK space-enabled economy, providing an excellent means for UK\n-\nbased operators to leverage off leading edge UK technologies\n,\n \nenabling \nUK exports of high value \nsatellite systems and services\n;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEarly decisions on investment in ESA programmes helps create a more strategic and long-term UK agenda in ESA; it helps industry plan ahead, develop technology roadmaps and identify export opportunities. It is vital that the UK invest strongly in the early phases of major programmes, in order to get sufficient control to deliver UK technology priorities an\nd maximise growth opportunities;\n&#xa0;\n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nIndustry\n has demonstrated that there are strong\n commercial spinoff benefits from \nearth observation, \nspace science\n \nand robotic exploration \nin terms of\n&#xa0;\ntechnologies\n,\n and also in terms of software and services to the global Space market\n;\n&#xa0;\n5.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK has demonstrated that it achieves a better return on investment than other ESA Member States. This is primarily through its highly developed capacity to take ESA developed technology to the commercial market. It is also strongly influenced by the UK selection of ESA optional programmes that are better aligned to the global marketplace. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere \nshould be a\n clear UK owner or overseer of resilience plans for the satellites and ground-based supporting infrastructures that provide critical UK \ncapabilities\n and\n \na\n comprehensive analysis of space systems critical to the UK\n. This should \ninclude \nan analysis of\n the level of resilience of space-related capabilities or of mitigation measures in the event of disruption\n;\n&#xa0;\n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe threats from natural events in space are well understood\n and ESA has an on-going programme to provide monitoring and \nwarnings of Space Weather events\n;\n&#xa0;\n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n Due to the sensitivities associated with Space Debris and the associated tracking of objects in earth orbit, the UKSA should look to other European nations such as Germany and France to develop ground based national systems to protect critical national space assets outside of ESA programmes.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nApril 2013\n \n"
