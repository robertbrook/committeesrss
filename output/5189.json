"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Norfolk [CST0066]&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThank \nyou for your letter, relating to \nthe Public \nAdministration Select Committee's inquiry into crime statistics\n. \nI \nshare your view that it is essential that we ensure that crimes are \nrecorded properly.\n&#xa0;\nWithin your \nletter \nyou ask two questions, which \nI \nhave \nincluded \nbelow, \ntogether \nwith my response:\n&#xa0;\nWhat, if any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?&#xa0;My Police and Crime Plan sets out policing objectives, which are one of the ways in which I hold the Chief Constable to account on behalf of those who live; work and visit Norfolk\n. \nEach objective \nincludes \na performance measure. The performance measures that \nrelate to \ncrime statistics \nlink \nto crimes, which are referred \nto \nas 'Priority Crimes\n'\n, \nand are those \nI \nhave \nagreed \nwith the Chief Constable are the most serious. \nThis is in the \nunderstanding that some crimes, such as hate crimes and sexual offences are under reported and an \nincrease in \nthe recording of these is \nencouraged. The impact \nof including performance \nmeasures in \nthis way \nis \nthat resources are focussed on the crimes that present the greatest harm, \nthe \nChief Constable holds his staff to account \nfor performance in \nthese areas and the \npublic, in \nturn, holds me to account.\n&#xa0;\nHow do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area.&#xa0;In Norfolk, the Crime Registrar \nhas \noversight and is the final decision maker for the Constabulary in respect of crime \nrecording. The \nRegistrar and his team work \nindependently \nfrom those with investigative roles and \nreports \ndirectly to the Chief Constable. \nI \nreceive \nregular \nwritten reports from the Chief Constable regarding the Registrar's work in this area and the result of monitoring and audits\n. \nThe Registrar attends \nmy \nmeetings with the Chief Constable when these reports are presented, so \nI \ncan discuss any concerns \nthat \narise with the Chief Constable and \nthe \nRegistrar\npersonally.\n&#xa0;\nDespite these safeguards, \nit \nis \ninevitable \nthat \nfrom \ntime to time decisions will be made regarding crime recording that others may later \nreview \nand come to different conclusions with regards to the classification. Audits show that this \nis \non the minority of occasions and when this occurs, \ninterventions \nare made to rectify emerging \nissues.\n&#xa0;\nKey to ensuring that statistics are recorded accurately \nis \nclear and unambiguous \nnational \nguidance regarding the \nrecord\ni\nng of crime, so that objective decisions can be made regarding \nclassifications, \nwhich are clear for the professionals and for the public to understand.\n&#xa0;\nShould you have any further queries please do not hesitate to contact me.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
