[normal]Submission from the US Embassy, London[bold]The U.S.-UK Relationship[bold] (USA 20)[bold]Our Story
[normal]Relations between the United States and the United Kingdom are unlike those between any other two countries.  
[normal]The Times of London wrote in 1913, “
[normal]Great Britain and the United States
[normal] stand to one another in a special relationship, and between them some departure from the merely official attitude is most natural.”
[normal]  The relationship is still 
[normal]special and it is still 
[normal]natural
[normal].  In a 20
[normal]12
[normal] poll, 
[normal]ninety 
[normal]percent of the American public 
[normal]viewed 
[normal]the United Kingdom 
[normal]favorably and the trend was rising
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Pr
[normal]esident Obama 
[normal]reflected the American view when he said
[normal], “…our people – and the people around the world – are more secure and more prosperous when the United States and the United Kingdom stand toget
[normal]her.”
[normal]The history of the U.S.-UK relationship is not one of unrelieved harmony starting, as it did, with the American Revolutionary War and carrying on into the War of 1812.  
[normal]During the 
[normal]twenty-year period from 1895 to 1915
[normal], historians note that 
[normal]U.S. and Br
[normal]itish foreign policies moved into general
[normal], cooperative
[normal] alignment; they call it the “Great Rapprochement.”  
[normal]W
[normal]hen the U.S. in 1917 overcame its reluctance to ent
[normal]er World War I, 
[normal]it 
[normal]clearly 
[normal]would do so on the side of the Anglo-French Entente.  
[normal]President Woodrow Wilson said the U.S. 
[normal]entered the war
[normal] “to make the world safe for democracy.” 
[normal] 
[normal]President Franklin Roosevelt 
[normal]echoed that theme 
[normal]when he announced in 1940 the 
[normal]U.S. 
[normal]intention to serve as the “Arsenal of Democracy
[normal]” even before entering World Wa
[normal]r II
[normal],
[normal] and in the 1941 Atlantic Charter, in which Roosevelt and 
[normal]Winston 
[normal]Churchill pledged to advance democracy around the world after the defeat of Nazi Germany. 
[normal] 
[normal]The wartime alliance
[normal] -- 
[normal]based 
[normal]o
[normal]n joint planning and shared intelligence -- 
[normal]proved resilient as
[normal] the U
[normal]nited States
[normal] and UK partnered 
[normal]with 
[normal]other 
[normal]allies 
[normal]to win the Cold War and then to deal with post-Cold War terrorism threats.
[normal]  
[normal]All along, however, there have been areas of disagreement, as one would expect between two countries 
[normal]with
[normal] global interests.  In the longer sweep of history,
[normal] however,
[normal] what appeared to be fundamental U.S.-UK disagreements now look like
[normal] dated
[normal] disagreements.
[normal]  Most Americans probably are more understanding of the UK’s refusal to commit troops to Vietnam than the A
[normal]merican public was at the time.  The Skybolt affair
[normal], which involved
[normal] nuclear weapons 
[normal]systems
[normal],
[normal] bedeviled the otherwise excellent relationship between John Kennedy and Harold Macmillan
[normal].  F
[normal]ar from marking “the end of the special relationship
[normal],
[normal]” as was 
[normal]then 
[normal]fear
[normal]ed
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]today 
[normal]it is 
[normal]barely remembered.  Issues have come and gone, the 
[normal]strong 
[normal]relationship has endured.
[normal]Close by Values, Close by Choice
[normal]The U.S.-UK relationship withst
[normal]ood
[normal] shocks because 
[normal]it is based
[normal] largely
[normal] on common values (which usually
[normal],
[normal] but not always
[normal],
[normal] lead to shared interests)
[normal].  It’s also
[normal] based on the American and British publics’ preference for each other’s products, 
[normal]management styles, 
[normal]culture, entertainment, and sense of humor.
[normal]  
[normal]Monty Python and Benedict Cumberbatch’s Sherlock Holmes are hugely popul
[normal]ar in the United States
[normal], as is “Downton Abbey”
[normal] (but Marmite has yet to gain a foothold in 
[normal]America
[normal])
[normal];  
[normal]”Homeland” 
[normal] is the top-rated show
[normal] 
[normal]with British audiences
[normal].  
[normal]We are the largest investors in each other’s economies and high
[normal], mutual
[normal] levels of tourism and 
[normal]foreign 
[normal]study reflect personal 
[normal]choices
[normal] by Americans and Britons to remain close
[normal].
[normal]  It is not simply a matter of a shared language.  Many countries share languages but lack the instinctive affinity that exists between the United States and the United Kingdom
[normal].  Americans 
[normal]know more place names from Lon
[normal]don (Westminster, Baker Street,
[normal] Trafalgar Square, Hyde Park, 
[normal]Charing Cross
[normal]) than they do from 
[normal]some
[normal] 
[normal]American cities.  Britons have an enduring fascination with the American West
[normal], jazz, and Hollywood personalities
[normal],
[normal] and British tabloids have a 
[normal]strong predilection for 
[normal]carrying 
[normal]American human interest stories
[normal].  If evidence is needed that this shared 
[normal]attraction
[normal] is 
[normal]persisting
[normal], consider that 
[normal]a large part
[normal] of America’s youth have grown up 
[normal]imagining themselves 
[normal]in Middle Eart
[normal]h, Narnia, 
[normal]or at Hogwarts.
[normal]  
[normal]Meanwhile, Elvis Presley, Madonna, and Michael Jackson are among the ten top-selling artists ever in the UK.
[normal]  
[normal]Part of the enduring strength of U.S.-UK relations 
[normal]also 
[normal]comes from 
[normal]societal similarities and 
[normal]shared challenges.  
[normal]Economic success, political stability, and rootedness in freedom and liberty have made both the United States and the United Kingdom attractive countries for immigrants.  In 1960, the foreign
[normal]-
[normal]born population of both the U
[normal]nited States
[normal] and the UK was around 
[normal]5 percent.  Today, the number for both countries
[normal] is around 12 percent.  
[normal]The U.S. and UK are joint leaders in higher education.  Most international 
[normal]comparisons
[normal] show that American and British universities dominate the ranks of the world’s 
[normal]top
[normal] twenty universi
[normal]ties.  In science and research, American and British scientists win a disproportionate number of Nobel prizes.  
[normal]T
[normal]he text of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 
[normal]2008 
[normal]Boumediene decision
[normal], 
[normal]regarding a Guantanamo detainee
[normal], is a 
[normal]telling indicator of 
[normal]the 
[normal]depth 
[normal]of 
[normal]U.S.-UK h
[normal]istory, shared culture, and common social challenges
[normal].  The U.S. Supreme Court 
[normal]made
[normal] 
[normal]two dozen
[normal] references to English law
[normal] as precedent-setting in the course of its reasoning.  Relying on the decisions of foreign courts is distinctly outside of American
[normal] legal
[normal] tradition.  
[normal]For the U.S. Supreme Court to cite English law, and for it to 
[normal]do so
[normal] without 
[normal]arousing 
[normal]comment, says much about the U.S.-UK relationship.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sharing the World’s Stage
[normal]U.S. and UK influence on o
[normal]ne another is profound, but 
[normal]the special relationship 
[normal]has 
[normal]also 
[normal]had a great impact 
[normal]on the world stage
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]At the most fundamental level, the U
[normal]nited States
[normal] and the UK share a “maritime outlook” that prevai
[normal]ls over isolationist tendencies.  We believe 
[normal]trade with the world is basic to our pr
[normal]osperity, our national security is tied to events beyond our shores, and the well-being of our countries 
[normal]depends on
[normal] influenc
[normal]ing
[normal] developments in other countries.  The United Kingdom’s military capabilities, development assistance budget, and unparalleled “s
[normal]oft power” make it a uniquely capable ally for the United States.  
[normal]As two of 
[normal]the 
[normal]five permanent members of the UN Security Council, the U
[normal]nited States
[normal] and UK speak with rare international authority.  Their shared memberships in NATO, the OECD, the OSCE, an
[normal]d other organizations provide additional
[normal] venues
[normal] in which
[normal] to cooperate to
[normal] their
[normal] international 
[normal]advantage
[normal].
[normal]  Beyond that, the UK is a member of the world’s most important organization to which the United States does not belong, the European Union.  
[normal]The United States has 
[normal]its own 
[normal]close ties to the EU and does not need the UK to serve as a “bridge” to the organization
[normal].  B
[normal]ut common U.S.-UK attitudes towards world trade, development policy, the value of international sanctions, and other issues, often fin
[normal]d an expression within the EU through UK membership, to the benefit of both the U
[normal]nited 
[normal]S
[normal]tates
[normal] and the EU.
[normal]  
[normal]The United States and the United Kingdom have shared values, a history of global involvement, and a common vision of the world we seek – one of resp
[normal]ect f
[normal]or the rule of law, 
[normal]economic development, environme
[normal]ntal protection, a liberal trading
[normal] system,
[normal] democracy,
[normal] peace, and one which values a plurality of cultures and religions.  
[normal]Together, we 
[normal]act
[normal] internationally
[normal] to promote
[normal] “fundamental human rights, the dig
[normal]nity and worth of people, the equal rights of men and women, and better standards of life in larger freedom.”  Those are not just American 
[normal]and
[normal] British goals
[normal]:
[normal] the words are taken from the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations.  The kind of world we 
[normal]want to live in is much more likely to 
[normal]be 
[normal]achieve
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]when 
[normal]the U
[normal]nited 
[normal]S
[normal]tates
[normal] and the U
[normal]nited 
[normal]K
[normal]ingdom
[normal] work together
[normal].
