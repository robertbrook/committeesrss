[normal]The United Kingdom Accreditation Service 
[normal](UKAS) 
[normal]is the national accreditation body 
[normal]for the UK. UKAS is
[normal] 
[normal]recognised
[normal] by government to assess, against internationally agreed standards, organisations that provide certification, testing, inspection and calibration services. UKAS is independent of 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment b
[normal]ut is appointed as the national accreditation body by the Accreditation Regulations 2009 (SI No 3155/2009)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]operates under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, on behalf of government as a whole.

[normal]U
[normal]KAS 
[normal]assesses and accredits competent 
[normal]person schemes under Part P of the Building Regulations on behalf of the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG). Accreditation by UKAS 
[normal]to the European standard BS EN 45011 
[normal]is a condition of 
[normal]authorisation 
[normal]a
[normal]s a competent person scheme by DCLG.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]BS EN 45011 is the European standard for organisations operating product certification systems. In this sense, UKAS accredits the competent person scheme
[normal] operators
[normal] to carry out the certification of 
[normal]the installation se
[normal]rvices provided by 
[normal]businesses
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]including their ability to 
[normal]self-certify 
[normal]their work as compliant with the Building Regulations
[normal]. BS EN 45011 
[normal]sets down requirements for certification bodies in 
[normal]terms
[normal] of 
[normal]their
[normal] independence, impartiality, technical competence and
[normal] management 
[normal]capability
[normal]. Accreditation by UKAS provides an assurance that th
[normal]e scheme operators
[normal] meet the
[normal]se
[normal] requirements in relation to 
[normal]the activities required of them to operate a competent person scheme. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An important part of the 
[normal]certification process is t
[normal]o assess the technical competence of the contractors that are members of the competent person schemes against th
[normal]e requirements set out in 
[normal]DCLG’s conditions of authorisation and the 
[normal]Minimum Technical Competence requirements
[normal] set out for the installers themselves
[normal]. 
[normal]As part of the accreditation process, UKAS 
[normal]determines
[normal] that this assessment is being carried out. UKAS carries out sample testing of the scheme operators and witnessed assessments to ensure this is the case. In this w
[normal]ay, accreditation ensures that consistent standards of competence are maintained.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]D
[normal]CLG’s conditions of authorisation require scheme operators to take a risk-based approach to the surveillance of their member companies. This is based on factors such as ins
[normal]pection outcomes, significant complaints and major changes in personnel. However, scheme operators must undertake a minimum of one on-site inspection of each member’s work every three years and new members need to be inspected annually for the first two ye
[normal]ars following initial assessment to establish a clean track record. Additional inspections can be carried out at the discretion of the scheme operators. The accreditation process ensures that the correct level of surveillance is carried out by the scheme o
[normal]perators.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]UKAS considers that 
[normal]competition between the different operators of competent person schemes is a positive factor in terms of providing an element of choice for electrical contractors and keeping the cost of 
[normal]certification
[normal] at a reasonable level. 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]UKAS accreditation process is aimed at ensuring the consistency of outcome
[normal], where there are a number of providers,
[normal] and therefore maintaining common standards. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Whilst DCLG maintains an overview of the competent person schemes and has ultimate responsib
[normal]ility for the authorisation of these schemes, the day to day assessment and supervision of the schemes is carried out by UKAS on DCLG’s behalf. The UKAS accreditation process is, of necessity, based on sample testing of the organisations concerned but is n
[normal]onetheless a 
[normal]rigorous
[normal] process
[normal]. UKAS considers that accreditation provides the necessary level of assurance of competence without being unduly intrusive or expensive.
