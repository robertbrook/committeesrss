defaultBS EN 45011 is the European standard for organisations operating product certification systems. In this sense, UKAS accredits the competent person scheme
default operators
default to carry out the certification of 
defaultthe installation se
defaultrvices provided by 
defaultbusinesses
default,
default 
defaultincluding their ability to 
defaultself-certify 
defaulttheir work as compliant with the Building Regulations
default. BS EN 45011 
defaultsets down requirements for certification bodies in 
defaultterms
default of 
defaulttheir
default independence, impartiality, technical competence and
default management 
defaultcapability
default. Accreditation by UKAS provides an assurance that th
defaulte scheme operators
default meet the
defaultse
default requirements in relation to 
defaultthe activities required of them to operate a competent person scheme.

defaultAn important part of the 
defaultcertification process is t
defaulto assess the technical competence of the contractors that are members of the competent person schemes against th
defaulte requirements set out in 
defaultDCLG’s conditions of authorisation and the 
defaultMinimum Technical Competence requirements
default set out for the installers themselves
default. 
defaultAs part of the accreditation process, UKAS 
defaultdetermines
default that this assessment is being carried out. UKAS carries out sample testing of the scheme operators and witnessed assessments to ensure this is the case. In this w
defaultay, accreditation ensures that consistent standards of competence are maintained.

defaultD
defaultCLG’s conditions of authorisation require scheme operators to take a risk-based approach to the surveillance of their member companies. This is based on factors such as ins
defaultpection outcomes, significant complaints and major changes in personnel. However, scheme operators must undertake a minimum of one on-site inspection of each member’s work every three years and new members need to be inspected annually for the first two ye
defaultars following initial assessment to establish a clean track record. Additional inspections can be carried out at the discretion of the scheme operators. The accreditation process ensures that the correct level of surveillance is carried out by the scheme o
defaultperators.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUKAS considers that 
defaultcompetition between the different operators of competent person schemes is a positive factor in terms of providing an element of choice for electrical contractors and keeping the cost of 
defaultcertification
default at a reasonable level. 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultUKAS accreditation process is aimed at ensuring the consistency of outcome
default, where there are a number of providers,
default and therefore maintaining common standards.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst DCLG maintains an overview of the competent person schemes and has ultimate responsib
defaultility for the authorisation of these schemes, the day to day assessment and supervision of the schemes is carried out by UKAS on DCLG’s behalf. The UKAS accreditation process is, of necessity, based on sample testing of the organisations concerned but is n
defaultonetheless a 
defaultrigorous
default process
default. UKAS considers that accreditation provides the necessary level of assurance of competence without being unduly intrusive or expensive.
