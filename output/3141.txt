[[[Written evidence from Arcus Electrics Ltd ]]]I have watched online a couple of times the House of Commons Communities and Local Government hearing on building regulations applying to electrical installations and repairs in dwellings, that was held on 2"d September, and am writing to comment.I have been registered as an electrician running my own business since the beginning of this year after retraining in 2012. Previously I had spent over twenty years working in senior roles for an international corporation in change management and strategy as well as direct product development program management and leadership.I started to write a letter to the four registration scheme representatives but in the end decided to write to you about what I saw. The four were trying to defend an indefensible position in my view. All the talk was about brand, choice, and competition rather than about standards and safety. Two registers of competent people with deceptively similar names does not help anybody. They do not seem to be able to work together.Whilst this brand proliferation has been going onIt appears that registration schemes are looking at the situation only from their own perspective, and I suggest that what is needed in the electrical industry is some bigger picture thinking and a thorough review of:The gas industry with one Gas Safe register, mandated annual certification of rental properties and requirements to update to the latest standards could be a good benchmark.October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
