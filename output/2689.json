"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council&#xa0;1.\n              \nPractice achieved in Brighton &amp; Hove evidences the statement in the \nHSR Impact Assessment \nwhich \nacknowledges\n:\n  \n“In some local authority areas, higher levels of environmental and social outcomes, which may be delivered in the do nothing option, may not be realised in option 2 (adopting the HSR recommendations).” (p5)\n \n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nOur area is one such area, whereby higher levels of environmental and social outcomes will not be realised if our ability to set local sustainability standards is removed. \n&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nEvidence of the high levels of sustainability achieved ain Brighton &amp; Hove through the work of the Local Planning authority is provided in the hyperlinked document on the Brighton &amp; Hove City Council website: \nDelivering good and advanced practice in sustainable development in Brighton &amp; Hove (Brighton &amp; Hove City Council 2013)&#xa0;\n4.\n              \nOn a national level, the HSR proposals on sustainability risk a serious rollback of progress towards sustainable construction and would lock us into a lower build quality for the lifetime of the new homes to be built. Higher local standards are needed to kick start the innovation and adoption process, enabling areas such as ours to stimulate innovation and early adoption, increasing uptake and reducing costs so other areas can follow. Under the proposals in the HSR, this first step of the innovation and adoption process would be lost. \n&#xa0;5.  The HSR Impact Assessment has failed to properly audit the impact of withdrawing the Code for Sustainable Homes (CSH) and withdrawing the ability of some local authorities to seek higher sustainability standards in their area where viable.  &#xa0;\n6.\n              \nThis assessment has not been undertaken in terms of the costs to the public or private sector. Neither has it assessed the sustainability or carbon impacts of the proposed options. In particular it has not assessed impacts from the reduced standards that will result from the proposed changes achieved in those areas that are currently achieving technical standards in advance of even the higher tier of technical standards proposed.&#xa0;\n3 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
