"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;WRITTEN EVIDENCE SUBMITTED BY THE PRIMATE SOCIETY OF GREAT BRITAIN TO THE ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE&#xa0;&#xa0;INQUIRY INTO THE KEEPING OF PRIMATES AS PETS&#xa0;&#xa0;\n14th January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;Summary1.1.\n \nThe \nPrimate Society of Great Britain (PSGB) is a UK learned society (Registered Charity No. 290185\n, \nhttp://www.psgb.org/\n) \naffiliated to the International Primatological Society and the European Federation for Primatology. P\nSGB was founded in 1967 to promote research into all aspects of primate biology, conservation and management\n \nwith the publication of the useful results of such research. The \nSociety is very strong scientifically and holds regular scientific meetings. \nPrima\nte Eye\n is the PSGB journal, and the Society has also recently adopted \nFolia Primatologica\n as another official PSGB publication. It also awards several medals to mark individual contributions to primatology. PSGB has three permanent working parties: the Cap\ntive Care Working Party, the Conservation Working Party, and the Research Working Party.\n1.2.\n \nThe Captive Care Working Party \n(CCWP) \nconsiders all issues that relate to the use, maintenance and breeding of primates in captivity. It \nprovides expert advice to inte\nrested parties within and outside the Society and co-ordinates action on matters relating to the welfare of primates in \nall\n captive settings.\n CCWP also awards grants to support research that benefits primate welfare in captivity, and to assist education pr\nojects about captive primate welfare. \nMembership of the CCWP \nincludes\n \nthose\n with specialist knowledge of,\n or a professional interest in, the care of primates in captivity. Currently, membership comprises both researchers and animal welfare representatives who have experience with a range of primate species (\nXXX\nStrepsirhines\n, New World monkeys, Old Worl\nd monkeys, and apes) in a variety of captive settings. One of the challenges facing the CCWP is to form stronger links between all institutions housing primates, particularly research faci\nlities, zoos and rescue centres.\n1.3.\n \nPSGB feels that this inquiry is tim\nely and that the three areas for focus for the inquiry are vitally important to determining the extent of primate pet ownership, the effectiveness of regulation and the crucial issue of whether primates should be kept as pets at all.\nPSGB is \nunable\n to comment with authority on this issue however RSPCA figures from 2009 \nindicate there are between 2500-7500 primates kept by private individuals in Great Britain\n.\nPSGB submitted a comprehensive review of the Draft Code of Practice on the Welfare of Privately Kept Non-human Prima\ntes as part of the Animal Welfare Policy Team Consultation in April 2010. As we are opposed to the keeping of primates as pets\n,\n as detailed below\n,\n we do not believe that the Code of Practice or existing regulatory framework can adequately ensure the necess\nary conditions exist\n to make pet ownership acceptable. Other organisations, such as the RSPCA, with more experience of the implementation of regulation are better placed to provide evidence in this area.\nThe first part of this is the major area where PSGB can express an authoritative opinion and \nit is the \nmajor \nfocus\n of our submission detailed below. The implementation of a ban would necessarily involve m\nicrochipping and registration of all pet primates. They would also all need to be removed from private ownership and placed in \napproved, licenced facilities where adequate care can be provided\n for the rest of their natural lives or until their quality of l\nife is judged to be sufficiently threatened as to require humane euthanasia\n.\n&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs affiliates\n of the International Primatological Society (\nwww.internationalprimatologicalsociety.org\n) PSGB endorses and supports a common policy on the Private Ownership of Nonhuman Primates \nwhich opposes the keeping of nonhuman primates in captivity by individuals for any non-scientific, non-certified educati\nonal or non-registered/accredited sanctuary purposes, including the possession of nonhuman primates as pets or companion animals as well as engaging in importation, breeding and trading for these purposes.\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nIPS Policy on \nPrivate Ownership of Nonhuman \nPrimates\n states\n (\nhttp://www.internationalprimatologicalsociety.org/PrivateOwnershipOfNonHumanPrimates.cfm\n)\n:\n2.2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“\nWHEREAS 50% of primates are now classified\n as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered in the wild; and\n”\n2.2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“\nWHEREAS primates are recognized as being highly intelligent animals with complex emotional, social and physical needs and capabilities; and\n”\n2.2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“\nWHEREAS young primates in private ownership\n are commonly removed from their mothers at an early age, preventing the opportunity for appropriate social and physical development, and may then become extremely powerful, unpredictable and unmanageable in private settings, often resulting in removal to \nsubstandard facilities; and\n”\n2.2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“\nWHEREAS nonhuman primates can pose a hazard to human health and safety in the form of physical attacks on owners or innocent bystanders that can result in serious injury or even death when not adequately maintained and securel\ny contained; and\n”\n2.2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“\nWHEREAS evidence suggests that many nonhuman primate species are susceptible to many of the pathogenic infections that afflict humans and the transmission of infection can occur in both directions, especially in privately owned primates \nwhich are often in direct proximity with the owners - including children and the elderly; and\n”\n2.2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“\nWHEREAS, individuals who privately acquire primates for non-certified educational, non-scientific or non\n-\nregistered/accredited sanctuary purposes are often unab\nle to provide or sustain adequate care and facilities for these long-lived mammals; and\n”\n2.2.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“\nWHEREAS, the holding of nonhuman primates by individuals and organizations in non-scientific, non-educational or non\n-\nregistered/accredited sanctuary settings is commo\nn in some countries but is not sufficiently regulated to assure adequate care and well-being of nonhuman primates or to assure adequate protection of humans from health and physical risks;\n”\n2.2.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“\nThe International Primatological Society therefore opposes the ho\nlding of nonhuman primates in captivity by individuals for any non-scientific, non-certified educational or non-registered/accredited sanctuary purposes, including the possession of nonhuman primates as pets or companion animals as well as engaging in bree\nding and trading for these purposes.\n”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis section is structured on the above paragraphs (2.2.1 to 2.2.8)\n3.1\n&#xa0; \nConservation status of primates in the wild\nThe survival of a great many primate species is threatened. Indeed the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species identifies that 54% of \naround 400 \nprimate species and subspecies for which information on conservation status is available are threatened with extinc\ntion. While many primates currently held as pets will have been bred in captivity\n,\n continuing demand is likely to fuel \nthe often illegal \ncapture \nand trade \nof individuals from the wild. \nOnly a fraction of live primates extracted from the wild survive for lo\nng enough to become pets. \nThe absence of definitive and rigorously applied tests to demonstrate the origin of individual animals creates loopholes for the continued extraction of animals from increasingly threatened wild populations resulting in further th\nreats to the survival of \ntheir species in the wild.\n \nIn the wild primates \nlive in complex societies and \nplay an important role in maintaining the health and viability of forest and woodland ecosystems, including pollination and seed dispersal, thereby ensur\ning forest sustainability and diversity. Therefore, all trade in wild primates has consequences for both ecological and social group stability and is regulated by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species).\n3.2 \nPrimates are highly inte\nlligent animals\n              \nThe very features that make primates attractive to some people as pets result in them not always coping well with captive conditions. Compared to most other animals primates have very large brains relative to their body size\n, and \nthey are \nalso cognitively advanced “\nwith complex emotional, social and physical needs and capabilities\n”\n.\n Typically, unless these needs and capabilities are met in a species-appropriate way significant stress and even distress may result and consequently the animal(\ns) may manifest a range of serious symptoms including aggressive behaviour (directed to themselves or their keepers), stereotypic behaviour, immune suppression, and social withdrawal\n \n(\nNovak et al, 1994; \nMallapur &amp; Choudhury, 2003\n; Hosey &amp; Skyner, 2007\n)\n. Ev\nen with the application of significant resources and expertise it is difficult to provide adequately for captive primates in this regard. A pet keeper is unlikely to be able to approach acceptable standards let alone achieve Best Practice standards in this\n area.\n A key aspect for provision for primates is their social environment: humans are not appropriate social partners for nonhuman primates. Primates should be kept in species-typical social groupings in structura\nl\nl\ny\n complex environments wherever possible\n to help \nprovide\n all opportunities to display a natural range and frequency of desirable species-typical behaviour\n \n(\nWolfensohn &amp; Honess, 2005\n; Jennings et al., 2009\n)\n.\n In most cases these conditions will be too challenging for a pet keeper to meet (and perhaps for regulating bodies to assess) and generally require specific primatological expertise to implement and evaluate.\n3.3 \nDevelopmental challenges\n              \nCaptive breeding\n and wild capture \npractices\n often involve the forced removal of an infant from its maternal setting at an earlier age than would occur during natural weaning. It is \ninfants or young juveniles that are typically supplied as pets as they exhibit desirable ch\naracteristics of dependency and \nbaby-features. Primates are characterised by having long periods of development during which the norms of behaviour, appropriate social interaction, food safety and safe environmental exploration are moderated by adult group\n-mates, particularly their mother\n \n(\nPrescott et al, 2012\n)\n.\n Removing an infant from its mother early prevents its appropriate behavioural development and may result in imprinting on human keepers and subsequent development of sexual and aggressive behaviour towards their keeper or other humans\n.\n It may be equally d\namaging for an infant to be parented by a conspecific which has experienced an abnormal development\n \n(\nSuomi, 2006\n)\n.\n3.4 \nPrimates as physical threats\n              \nNonhuman primates can pose a hazard to human health and safety in the form of physical attacks that can res\nult in serious injury or even death when the primate is not adequately maintained and securely contained. \nMany primate species may grow to be quite large and powerful and without appropriate containment may pose a significant threat to \nowners or innocent \nbystanders\n. Even many of the smaller species often favoured as pets are capable of inflicting serious bite wounds. Poor husbandry, inadequate social and environmental provision, and inappropriate development (see paragraph 3.3) may increase the likelihood \nof the display of dangerously aggressive behaviour\n \n(\nHoness &amp; Marin, 2006\n)\n.\n3.5 \nPrimates and disease\n              \nDue to their genetic proximity to humans, primates are highly susceptible to a number of human diseases and in some cases (e.g. tuberculosis\n, herpes simple\nx virus\n) are more susceptible than humans. In addition there are diseases which have a lesser impact on primates that are extremely serious, even fatal (e.g. simian herpes B virus) when contracted by humans\n \n(\nWolfensohn &amp; Honess, 2005\n)\n.\n \nIn many cases disease may pass in both directions. Exposure to disease among children or \nolder\n is likely to have greater consequences.\n3.6 \nProvision of adequate care\n              \nAs noted earlier (paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3) primates have very specific care requirements\n. \nResponsible, accredited and well-resourced institutions that maintain captive primates for educational, research or sanctuary purposes may be able to provide adequate care\n, where they meet appropriate sources of guidance on best practice in primate care (\ne\n.g. large peer reviewed scientific literature,\n \nIPS International Guidelines for the Acquisition, Care and Breeding of Nonhuman Primates\n [IPS, 2007]\n,\n \nAZA/EAZA husbandry manuals\n, and \nhttp://marmosetcare.com/\n)\n. \nProper care of primates is expensive and \nrequires careful monitoring\n, particularly given that they are long-lived \n(up to 40 years in some species) \nand require correspondingly enduring \ncommitment\n. \nWithout sufficient \nfinancial \nresource\ns\n or expertise (as established objectively) a pet owner will be \nunable to meet the most basic environmental, social or cognitive needs of t\nhe animal. Indeed it is also \nun\nlikely that appropriate specialist veterinary expertise will be available for the pet keeper to provide for the security of the animal’s health\n \n(\nHoness &amp; Wolfensohn, 2010\n)\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.7 \nRegulation of primate keeping\n              \nPSGB recognises the importance of existing UK laws\n,\n regulations \nand Codes of Practice \nthat apply to the keeping of animals\n,\n such as primates\n,\n in captivity. Educational and scientific use of pr\nimates is subject to regulatory oversight that has considerable public and expert, including PSGB\n,\n support. The difficulties of providing adequately for \nany \nprimate in captivity\n and their very specific requirements mean that\n, in\n our expert opinion\n,\n it is virtually impossible for the private individual to meet the appropriate needs of a pet primate and it is equally difficult to evaluate the adequacy of husbandry and care provision without sufficient expertise. It is unlikely that existing licencing \nand inspecting authorities possess such expertise. Further considerable difficulties exist around the clear demonstration of sourcing the animal from an appropriate and licenced supplier. In many cases chains of ownership are unclear and subject to fraud w\nith wild-caught animals being passed-off as captive bred.\n3.8 \nCaptive breeding of primates\n              \nPrimates may be justifiably bred in captivity for a variety of purposes (e.g.  conservation, education and research) by a variety of regulated organisations and ins\ntitutions. PSGB does not believe that the captive breeding of primates for pet ownership is justified and we oppose it.\n&#xa0;\nThe IPS policy to which PSGB subscribes makes a clear case against the keeping of primates as pets. This written submission \nhas sought to add to the summary points in the IPS policy to provide greater weight to the case against \nkeeping \nprimate\ns\n as pets. A basic inability to provide adequately for their social, cognitive, environmental, veterinary\n,\n and in some cases dietary needs alone \nshould rule them out as legal pets. A paucity of adequate expertise for the existing assessment, licencing, inspection and enforcement of regulations relating to keeping primates as pets simply adds weight to the argu\nment. \n              \nAll our evidence applies to primates that may be kept as trained aids to people with disabilities. \nIn short, the personal benefits to handlers and breeders resulting from the trade in primates as pets are small compared to the costs in terms of anim\nal welfare, human safety and the conservation of intact wildlife habitats.\n Primates do not make good or appropriate pets\n;\n \na case powerfully made in a short video about marmosets \n(see \nhttp:\n//www.youtube.com/watch?v=r89ZWByApLE\n)\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;ReferencesHoness, \nP. and Marin, C.
