"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Serious Hazards of Transfusion Haemovigilance Scheme (BTO0029)1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis paper describes the national strategy for surveillance of adverse events related to blood transfusion and the resulting improvements in patient safety. Blood transfusion is very safe and effective when used appropriately.\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nQuestions about blood safety emerged following the appearance of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and discovery of its related virus (human immunodeficiency virus, HIV) in the 1980s.  Multiply transfused haemophilia patients treated with factor concentrates made from pooled plasma were noted\n in the late 1970s\n to develop hepatitis transmitted from these products. \nThere was also concern that serious and potentially lethal errors (incompatible blood transfusions) were not reported.\n Therefore many countries decided to set up vigilance programmes. \n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe European Union\n published a series of Blood Safety Directives (2002-2005) which were transposed into the UK Blood Safety and Quality Regulations (BSQR) in 2005. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was appointed as the Competent Authority to implement the EU Safety Directives. The BSQR focus on serious adverse reactions and events which must be reported by law to the EU. \nThe MHRA requires reporting of all serious reactions such as transfusion-transmitted infection or haemolysis, but also serious adverse events caused by a process failure in the quality management system in Blood Establishments and hospital transfusion laboratories regardless of whether the component was transfused, but the legislative remit extends only to the point where the transfusion laboratory reponsibility ends. Adverse events involving only clinical staff are not reportable under EU legislation but constitute the largest group of \nSHOT\n reports including avoidable or delayed transfusion, near miss events and mistakes with anti-D immunoglobulin administration to RhD negative women during and after pregnancy.\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHaemovigilance is defined (by the International Haemovigilance Network)  as surveillance procedures covering the whole transfusion chain, from collection of blood and its components to follow-up of recipients, intended to collect and assess info\nrmation on unexpected or undesir\nable effects resulting from the therapeutic use of labile blood products and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. \n  Blood transfusion is a multistep process involving several different professional groups who need to work closely together (nursing staff, laboratory staff, medical staff, porters). The\n \nUK\n national haemovigilance scheme, Serious Hazards of Transfusion (\nSHOT\n) was set up in 1996\n, prior to the introducion of the EU Directives, \n and now has reported annually for 16 years\n (17\nth\n report currently being prepared)\n.\n \nSHOT\n is funded by the 4 UK Blood Services and is affiliated to the Royal College of Pathologists.  Its activities are overseen by a steering group whose membership includes representatives from the Royal Colleges (medical and nursing) and other specialist societies.\n A full list is available on the \nSHOT\n website (\nwww.shotuk.org/home/terms-of-reference\n ).\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSHOT\n collects and analyses information on transfusion reactions and adverse events from all healthcare organisations in the \nUK\n that are involved in blood transfusion.  \nThis includes transfusion of red cells, plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelet concentrates.  \nSHOT\n works collaboratively with other bodies with responsibility for transfusion safety (e.g. the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the National Blood Transfusion Committee\n (set up in 2001)\n and its counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO), the National Patient Safety Agency, and the Department of Health Blood Policy\n \nUnit).\n  Reports required by the BSQR are submitted to the MHRA through their statutory SABRE online reporting system since 2005.  \nSHOT\n’s online reporting system shares a common portal – some events are only MHRA-reportable, others, particularly \nmany \nclinical \nincidents\n may only be \nSHOT\n–reportable and others require reporting to both schemes.  Reporters now enter demographic data once, and \nSHOT\n and the MHRA are working towards a combined system.  The \nSHOT\n Annual reports for 2011 and 2012 include a chapter describing the MHRA reports.  Meetings take place to reconcile the data (e.g.transfusion-related deaths, transfusion-transmitted infections).\n  \n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSHOT\n’s\n \nmission is to improve patient safety in blood transfusion in the following ways: \n7)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReporting to SHOT was initially voluntary but is now required by several professional bodies\n (Clinical Pathology Accreditation, Nursing and Midwifery Council)\n and is mandatory for clinicians in line with the General Medical Council’s  standard for Good Medical Practice\n, and the Francis Report\n.  \n8)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReporting to \nSHOT\n has increased steadily over the 17 years of reporting\n (data for 2013 currently under analysis)\n.\n In \n2012 99.5\n% of all NHS Hospitals, Trusts and Health Boards were registered to report to \nSHOT\n, and 97.8% submitted reports (\ntotal reports for 2012=\n3545)\n.\n9)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReports fall into \nfour\n main categories\n (cumulative number of reports 1996-2012 = 11570)\n:\n10)\n&#xa0; \nOverall, about half of all reported events are a result of mistakes. \nMost of these do not result in serious consequences for the patient.\n Each year the report includes learning points and recommendations for changes in practice.  \nSHOT\n reporting has been instrumental in changing practice both at the Blood \nServic\nes and in hospital\n laboratories and clinical areas\n. \n  \nSHOT\n thus alerts the NHS to transfusion safety issues which can be addressed in order to reduce the risks.\n11)\n&#xa0; \nExamples of risk reduction by \nBlood Services as a result of \nSHOT\n reporting and recommendations are:\n12)\n&#xa0; \nSHOT\n reports are classified according to a \nset of \ndefinitions (\nbased on those published by\n the I\nnternational \nSociety of B\nlo\nod T\nransfusion) and are analysed by members of a working expert group including transfusion specialists, hospital consultants and senior laboratory scientists whose expertise covers the different types of incidents. Analysis yields \ntrends and \nfeatures leading to the overall major recommendations in each annual report (such as weaknesses in patient identification, failure to perform the final bedside checks), specific recommendations in the different incident groups  as indicated above, and learning points for laboratory and clinical staff to improve their practice. The Annual Report is published at an annual symposium held in July where the findings are presented and discussed\n together with relevant transfusion topics\n.\n In addition 8-12 page booklets are produced alternate years summarising the main lessons, ‘Laboratory Lessons’ and ‘Clinical Lessons’.  These are distributed at meetings and teaching sessions\n and are available to download from the website in addition to the Annual Reports, their summaries and other resources\n.\n13)\n&#xa0; \nChanges in \nHospital Practice resulting from \nSHOT\n reporting\n: \n14)\n&#xa0; \nThe demonstration every year that incorrect transfusions\n (e.g. wrong blood group, or missing specific requirements for that patient)\n make up the largest group of adverse events led to several initiatives.\n15)\n&#xa0; \nSummary of data from the \nSHOT\n report for events reported in 2011 and 2012\n&#xa0;\n2011\n2012\nDeaths\n8 (1 from delayed and inadequate transfusion, 3 transfusion-associated circulatory overload,  2 acute transfusion reactions, 1 infant with necrotising enterocolit\ni\ns\n)\n9 (1 transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease\n*\n, 2 haemolytic transfusion reactions, 6 transfusion-associated circulatory overload)\nMajor Morbidity\n117\n134\nThere had been no reports of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease since 2001 and this death prompted a national review of practice with new recommendations and guidance (see Annual Report for 2012 for details at \nwww.shotuk.org\n )\n16)\n&#xa0; \nSHOT\n reporting has alerted the transfusion community that p\neople with sickle cell disease are at particular risk of adverse events, particularly haemolytic transfusion reactions with serious outcome (11/16, 68.8%\n experiencing death or major morbidity\n in the three years\n 2010 to 2012).\n17)\n&#xa0; \nPatients receiving bone marrow transplants have been identified at risk for receiving wrong blood group transfusions leading to recommendations for better communication.\n18)\n&#xa0; \nMistakes occur because at every stage of the transfusion process the professionals involved do not \nalways \nfollow established procedures. This has been highlighted in \nSHOT\n reports and the recommendation made for a checklist to be used.\n  This has not yet been widely adopted but is likely to improve safety of the key steps as has been demonstrated \nby introduction of the WHO checklist \nfor surgery.\n19)&#xa0; \nKey Messages20)\n&#xa0; \nThe risk of transfusion-transmitted infection has diminished with time: \nYear\nTotal reports analysed\nNumber of confirmed TTIs\n%\n of reports\n1996/7\n142\n8\n5.6\n2003\n458\n9\n1.9\n2009\n1279\n3\n0.23\n2011\n1815\n0\n0\n2012\n1645\n3\n0.2\n&#xa0;\n21)\n&#xa0; \nIn the early years of reporting, \noverall \n3\n6\n% of reports were of death or major morbidity\n (1996/7)\n but this has reduced to 8% and an increased number of hospitals\n are\n participating.\n In particular, the total number, deaths and serious outcomes from \nABO-incompatible red cell transfusions \nhas reduced with better transfusion practice. These are classified as ‘Never Events’ by the Department of Health. Major morbidity includes complications such as kidney failure or admission to intensive care\n, or ventilation\n.\n Data from previous  5-year periods are shown in the table.\nTime period\nTotal ABO-incompatible transfusions\nDeaths from \nABO-\nincompatible transfusions\nMajor morbidity from \nABO-\nincompatible transfusions\n1996-2001\n126\n9\n34\n2002-2006\n85\n6\n19\n2007-2011\n52\n3\n16\n2012\n10\n0\n4\n&#xa0;\n22)\n&#xa0; \nDeaths where the transfusion was definitely\n or partly\n responsible numbered 8 in 2011 and 9 in 2012 and the incidence of major morbidity was 117 in 2011 and 134 in 2012.\n This increase has occurred due to better recognition that patients can develop \nlung\n complications related to transfusion, particularly transfusion-related acute lung injury and transfusion-associated circulatory overload. \nSHOT\n reporting has drawn attention to these events, and advised an amend\nment to the BCSH Guidelines on Administration of B\nlood\n \nC\nomponents\n to reduce the risks.\n This addendum was published in 2012.\n23)\n&#xa0; \nErrors continue to put patients at risk, particularly failure to adhere to basic procedures for identification of the correct patient at the time of blood sampling and at the time of transfusion. Errors make up more than half of all events reported to \nSHOT\n.\n  Human errors \nrelating to patient identification \ncan be reduced by bar-code technology\n (recommended by \nSHOT\n in\n 2009\n)\n to link patient identity to blood samples with a confirmation against the blood bag and wristband at the time of transfusion.  These methods have been demonstrated to reduce transfusion errors (evidence published from \nOxford\n) but the uptake by hospitals has been limited by the costs.\n24)&#xa0; \nKey recommendations from SHOT Annual Reports for 2011 and 2012- ‘back to basics’:25)\n&#xa0; \n.\nThe full \nSHOT\n reports can be found at \nwww.shotuk.org/shot-reports/\n together with the shorter summaries\n.\n26)\n&#xa0; \nThe \nSHOT\n haemovigilance scheme is an international field leader\n because it was one of the earliest, has detailed analysis and trending. T\nhe data \nare\n widely used at international as well as national levels.  Many countries have developed haemovigilance schemes, particularly in \nEurope\n, but the International Haemovigilance Network encourages all countries to set this up.  It is difficult to compare data between countries as data collection \nand denominator data are variable\n.  \n27)\n&#xa0; \nSHOT\n collects ‘near miss’ events where no harm came to the patient, but important lessons are learned from these observations. For example, for every wrong transfusion resulting from a wrong blood sample, there are about 100 ‘near miss’ events where the error was recognised\n before any transfusion took place,\n for example because the blood group previously recorded \nfor the patient \nwas different\n to the one associated with the current blood sample\n.\n28)\n&#xa0; \nSHOT\n produces benchmarking data \nannually \nfor all participants\n,\n relating the number of reports to the \nsize of the organisation as defined by the number of \nblood components issued, and grouped geographically.  These show that the range\n of medians\n is 0.69 to 1.21 for the number of reports per 1000 components issued\n in the different sized organisations, with an overall range of 0 to 6.8\n reports\n. European and Canadian data are similar with 0.2 to 7.07 reports per 1000 units transfused or issued to hospitals.  A WHO Global Forum in November 2012 in association with the International Soiety of Blood Transfusion and the International Haemovigilance Network had representation from 46 countries. There is variable development of haemovigilance schemes hindered in many countries by lack of resources but also by a cultural fear of reporting adverse incidents.\nDeclaration of Interests:\nThis report was prepared by Dr. Paula Bolton-Maggs, DM, FRCPath, FRCP,  Medical Director of the Serious Hazards of Transfusion National Haemovigilance Scheme, \nSHOT\n Office, \nManchester\n.  I am employed by NHS Blood and Transplant on behalf of the Blood  Services for \nWales\n, \nScotland\n, \nNorthern Ireland\n and \nEngland\n.\n I have no conflict of interest in the preparation of this report.\nI receive occasional honoraria\n for attending advisory board meetings and consultancy fees\n from commercial companies\n (LFB-France and BPL-UK)\n in \nrelation to my expertise in an inherited blood clotting disorder, Factor XI deficiency.\n \nJanuary 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
