[[[Supplementary written evidence submitted by the Daphne Jackson Trust (WSC0100)]]]Thank you for giving Dr Pia Ostergaard, on behalf of the Daphne Jackson Trust, the opportunity to give oral evidence to the Science and Technology Committee on Wednesday 30th October. We should now like to submit further written evidence that reinforces the importance of drawing on the pool of talented women who have taken a career break and now wish return to research. These individuals, with appropriate support and retraining, such as that offered by the Daphne Jackson Fellowships, can go on to become an integral part of a diverse and talented STEM workforce.We would like to reinforce the following points:Career break rather than maternity break &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;A Fellow graduated from Oxford with a degree in Chemistry and then worked for Kodak for 3 years before returning to Oxford to do a PhD. She got married to an officer in the RAF and soon was expecting their first child. Due to her husbandâ€™s job they were moving every 2-3 years, and with two young children, a job in chemistry was not feasible. When her children went to school, and the family had a 3 year posting to RAF Brize Norton, she started applying for jobs but with no success. In 1998 the family returned to Oxford where she heard about the Daphne Jackson Trust and was awarded a Fellowship. She has been employed by Oxford University since.
