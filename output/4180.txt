[[[Written evidence from ]]]

[[[West Sussex Cycle Forum]]]

[[[ (LTD0003)]]]&#xa0;In the guidance for those submitting evidence - it is advised to begin with a short summary in bullet point form.   I think that our responses to the points you raise are short and to the point, and speak for themselves.   However, here is a short summary in bullet point format.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Question numberQuestion posed by The Transport CommitteeAnswers submitted by the West Sussex Cycle Forum1What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure? &#xa0;&#xa0;What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?There are a number of disadvantages associated with devolved decision-making in West Sussex:&#xa0;Expectations have been raised that local decision-making would direct money more effectively to the needs of cyclists, but as the rest of this response demonstrates, the implementation in West Sussex has largely dashed those expectations.&#xa0;Devolving transport decisions makes it almost impossible to plan and deliver non-local transport infrastructure, even on the scale of inter-urban cycleways between neighbouring towns [see 1].&#xa0; Transport is by its nature a very network-oriented issue, so changes in one location can have big impacts on another location: but localised transport spending doesn't allow this to be taken into account at all [see 2]. Transport-specific planning and design knowledge is lost, as local councils do not have the expertise and experience in transport planning matters [see 3].&#xa0;Examples - [1] A county councillor from Lancing would like to build a cycleway between Lancing and Worthing, to benefit Lancing residents. However most of the cycleway will be within Worthing's boundary, so he has to persuade a Worthing councillor to promote his cycleway, even though it has much less value to Worthing residents. This means that it's unlikely to ever happen; even though there is local community need and desire.&gt; [2] The A27 through Worthing is likely to become significantly more congested when the improvements at Handcross Hill on the A23 are completed, making it much easier to drive to the south coast from Gatwick and further north. If the Arundel bypass were ever to be built, it would lead to significant increases in congestion in Worthing from traffic finding it easier to drive along the A27 to and from the west. The A27 at Southampton is significantly more congested since the M3 Twyford Down cutting opened.&gt; [3] Local officials recently placed a sharp-edged dark-blue sculpture in the middle of National Cycle Network Route 2 cycleway in Lancing. The local officers involved were unaware of the importance of this route, or the number of people on bicycles using it daily to commute to and from work. One officer was even unaware that the cycle route was continuous to Worthing, even though it had been so for some years!&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?I take local to mean exactly that - within a locality such as a town or borough, or a distinct and separate rural area.   The great weakness of the current system is that local government at the County level has been subjected to cutbacks and seemingly constant rationalisations (i.e. redundancies and reorganisations).   This has created discontinuity and a certain amount of corporate paralysis.   There seems to be no overarching coherent policy that requires urgency to deliver it.   For example - there is evidence that S106 money is held up by bureaucracy.   There are no longer budgets allocated to specific means of transport which means that - for example, cycle schemes that might deliver real benefit don't get recognised as part of a core transport policy - more as a fringe and marginalised form of transport; although the talk in public is different.   The CLC process is incapable of dealing with the volume that should go through its hands.   Consequently, those schemes that are easy to understand and quickly decide on - get the vote.&#xa0;Apart from benefitting from some isolated serendipitous schemes, West Sussex County Council has not made any serious attempt to implement its Local Plan Transport Plan 3 (LTP3) and has, similarly, made no attempt to replace it with anything else.&#xa0; This, therefore, poses the question ‘what is the point of all of the effort put in to these plans if the Council has no mechanism to support it or implementing it?’&#xa0;&#xa0;To answer the question - local bodies do not have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes.&#xa0;The optimum delivery body is one that considers and values the economic, health and social benefits of sustainable transport, and incorporates those benefits into an integrated policy with a 'golden thread' running through transport, health, social and economic development policies.   It should consult with, and take 'on the ground' information from, those who know the locality.   Those consulted should be involved in the roll out of schemes.  &#xa0;Local bodies (district and borough councils) are inconsistent in their approach to sustainable transport. Decisions made by the county council in allocating funding to sustainable transport are not backed-up by, and are even contradicted by, decisions of Council Local Committees. The co-ordination of cycle schemes at county council level has been abandoned with the abolition of the West Sussex County Council Cycling Officer and although there is someone doing his best to work with local cycle and sustainable transport groups, the fact is that he has another full time job that takes all his time.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?Have a scheme-by-scheme project led team that is charged with delivering on time and on budget and takes in all economic, health and social benefits of sustainable transport.  Its members are the stakeholders in the geographical area as well as those intimately involved with the various modes of transport being considered.4·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?No knowledge of this.&#xa0;Funding streams for cycling projects are more diverse than ever and are acquired and managed by different bodies. Opportunities have been missed where combining money from different funding streams (such as the Highways Agency, National Park, county and borough councils) could have delivered greater benefits.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;5·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?No knowledge of this.&#xa0;Almost all funding streams for cycling in West Sussex have restrictive criteria and date limitations. (No funding is allocated to cycling from the Highways budget.) Because the funding might otherwise be lost, there are examples of funding being allocated to schemes that are not the top priority locally and which have questionable benefits.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;6·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?It will wipe out any consideration of sustainable transport schemes both big and small.   That is because it is designed to promote jobs supported by road building.  &#xa0;However, the purpose of creating employment is to increase the wealth and well being of those in an area.  The cost / benefit ratio of sustainable transport can bring significant economic benefits if factors, such as quality of life, well-being and basic health are admissible as equals in the discussion. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;7·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?No knowledge of this.&#xa0;Existing funding streams need to be protected as well as finding additional sources of funding. We have one example of a County Local Committee passing a motion to reallocate developer contributions away from sustainable transport.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;8·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?The answer is that they are unclear to most.  But you must be more precise about what is meant by 'clear'.  It's an absolute term and when you factor in the implied 'clear to whom', then it's obvious that it might be 100% clear to some - but unhelpfully opaque to others.  So - please be less ambiguous.   But - of greater importance is whether local decision making is appropriate, relevant and worthwhile.   For example, it could be crystal clear but hopeless, inappropriate, irrelevant and worthless. &#xa0;It is absolutely not clear where accountability sits for the cycling elements of the West Sussex County Council Local Transport Plan 3 (LTP3) - and more specifically for cycling safety.   Is it still a central responsibility of the county council as the Highways Authority, or the County Local Committees, who control the key funding streams; funding streams that could be used to implement cycle schemes and improve cycling safety?&#xa0;&#xa0;Submitted by Geoff Farrell, Chair of the West Sussex Cycle Forum (WSCF).   &#xa0;The WSCF was established to represent and support the views of the various local cycling forums around the county. Whereas local cycle forums act locally and practically, the WSCF is a strategic partner for the local forums and is recognised by West Sussex County Council as a consultee.&#xa0;Its aim - as in its constitution is:
