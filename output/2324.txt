[[[Written evidence submitted by Professor Steve Strand]]]This submission addresses directly each of the five key questions given in the Committee's request for written evidence.1. There is no doubt that White Working Class (WWC) students are the lowest achieving group of young people in England terms of educational achievement at age 16. Figure 1 below plots the age 16 examination results for 2011 for each combination of ethnic group and entitlement to a Free School Meal (FSM).

[[[nd entitlement to FSM: England, 2011]]]Source: Strand (2014a).2. Only 28% of White British students on FSM achieve the threshold of 5 or more GCSEs A*-C including English and maths, compared to 62% of White British pupil not on FSM. No other ethnic-FSM combination has lower attainment than White British students on FSM.3. The above 'headlines' figures need to be considered in some depth to tease out exactly what the pattern of results are in relation to social class, ethnicity and gender. Strand (2014a) has completed a detailed analysis using the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE). This has the benefit that it draws on data on parents' occupations, educational qualifications, whether the family own their own home, the deprivation of the neighbourhood in which the family live as well as whether the student is entitlement to a FSM. These factors are combined to create a robust continuous measure of the family socio-economic status (SES). They key results are presented in Figure 2 below. 

[[[Figure 2: Age 16 points score by ethnic group, gender and SES based on LSYPE dataset.]]]BoysGirlsNotes:  (1). The outcome (total points score) is a measure of achievement based on all examinations completed by the young person at age 16, and is expressed on a scale where 0 is the mean (average) score for all Young People at age 16 and two-third of YP score between -1 and 1.    (2). The SES measure also has a mean (average) of zero and the effects for low SES are estimated at -1SD and of high SES at +1SD. Source: See Strand (2014a) for full details.4. The results confirm that:5. Levels of achievement for boys are generally lower than for girls, and this is just as true for WWC pupils as any other group, with WWC boys having lower achievement (-.50 SD) than WWC girls (-.30 SD), as shown in Figure 2. However it is important to note that 

[[[WWC ]]]

[[[girls are ]]]

[[[the lowest achieving group among girls]]], so the pattern of concern over the low achievement of WWC pupils applies as much to girls as it does to boys.6. Important evidence here is provided by considering pupils progress age 11 to age 16. Figure 3 uses the LSYPE dataset to graph educational achievement at age 11, 14 and 16. We do this for the lowest 20% of pupils in terms of family SES, for the middle group (between 40% and 60%) and for the top 20% in terms of family SES. 7. What is particularly notable here is the pronounced decline in educational achievement among White British students from the lowest SES quintile,  in contrast to most ethnic minority groups.

Mixed heritage and any other ethnic group are excluded for clarity.  Source: Strand (2013).8. What accounts for these changes in educational achievement?  It is inevitably difficult to establish causality from observational data, but Strand (2014a) was able to use the LSYPE to evaluate the impact of a wide range of student, family and neighbourhood variables not just on achievement at age 16 but on educational progress age 11-16. Many factors were significantly associated with progress, but the four main factors were: –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Pupil aspirations to continue in full-time education (FTE) post 16 –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Parents aspirations for the young person to continue in FTE after 16 –&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Academic Self Concept (ASC) (how good students felt they were at school work)–&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Frequency of completing homework (an indicator of effort or motivation)9. It should be noted that the majority of WC students have positive educational aspirations. For example in LSYPE at age 14 approximately  60% of WWC boys, 72% of Black Caribbean WC boys and 75% of WWC girls aspire to continue in FTE after age 16 (Strand, 2014a). However these levels are substantially lower than the averages of all other groups which were uniformly high across the SES spectrum at 90%-98%. The results are shown in Figure 3. Similar patterns were observed for ASC and homework. There is strong evidence that educational aspirations differ markedly by SES and ethnicity, and are associated with the decline in achievement of WWC students. 

[[[Figure 3: Aspirations at age 14 to continue in FTE after age 16]]]10. This does not mean that WWC students are unsupported at home. Strand &amp; Winston (2008) in a study of five inner city Birmingham schools show WWC students report positive general support for their education among their parents (such as help with homework, providing rewards for doing well at school, attending parents' evenings). However at the same time WWC students were more likely than other ethnic groups to report low educational aspirations at home (e.g. People from my family don’t go to college after they leave school; Family members do not think that school is very important for success).11. Overall these results indicate that, despite high socio-economic deprivation, key resilience factors for WC pupils from most minority ethnic groups are high educational aspirations (both pupils &amp; parents), strong academic self concept and high motivation (homework). This may reflect the 'immigrant paradigm' (Kao &amp; Thompson, 2003) whereby immigrants devote themselves more to education than the native population because they lack financial capital and see education as a way out of poverty. The inverse of this is true for White British and Black Caribbean WC students: lower educational aspirations by parents and students, poor ASC and low motivation indicates an increased risk of disengaged or disaffected learners. In the era of full employment there may have been little penalty to disengagement where jobs were plentiful, often through family contacts, without the need for educational qualifications. However there is a high cost to an ‘oppositional culture’ (Willis, 1977) in the new knowledge economy.12. It is important not to over-emphasise an individualistic notion of aspirations and to recognise structural influences from neighbourhood, family and school. It is not enough for young people to aspire, they also need to be able to navigate the paths to their goals (Strand &amp; Winston, 2008). There is an important role for schools, particularly in disadvantaged areas, in supporting students and parents by providing clear information on how a minimum number of GCSEs are required for most college courses, work-based learning settings and 'decent' jobs, greater supervision of homework by teachers to minimise the risk that student disengage as a result of falling behind and feeling overwhelmed by coursework, provision of additional study support, close monitoring of student truancy etc. (e.g. Ross, 2009).13. However it is important that addressing low educational attainment is not just a question of disengagement age 11-16 or an issue just for secondary schools. The low achievement of White British students on FSM has been identified as early as age 4, and these students fall further behind age 4-7 (Strand, 1999), age 7-11 (Strand, 2010, 2014b) as well as age 11-16 (Strand, 2014a). In short equity differences in achievement are just as much a concern for primary schooling as for secondary schooling. 14. It is also important that schools are not seen as the sole agencies of change. Differences between schools, while they undoubtedly play some role, appear unlikely to be the major locus of equity gaps in pupils’ educational progress. Strand (2010) reports an analysis of pupil progress age 7-11 using national data from 534,000 pupils attending over 14,000 primary schools. While the SES and the White British-Black Caribbean gaps widen between age 7 and age 11, these gaps do not appear to be significantly greater in some schools than in others. No schools reliably reversed the usual ‘within school’ pattern of FSM students making less progress than non-FSM students, or Black Caribbean students making less progress than White British students. This has two major implications:i.               Equity gaps are not the result of a small number of 'failing' schools which, if they can somehow be fixed, will remove the overall SES or ethnic achievement gaps. While qualitative research has provided case studies of schools in disadvantaged areas that ‘succeed against the odds’ (e.g. DCSF Extra Mile project, 2008), such schools are by definition exceptions. As Mortimore and Whitty (1997) observe “whilst some schools can succeed against the odds, the possibility of them all doing so, year in and year out, still appears remote given that the long-term patterning of educational inequality has been strikingly consistent throughout the history of public education in most countries” (p9).  Similarly in the US Rothstein (2004) has cogently argued that, exemplary though such schools might be, they do not represent scalable models for America’s poor and minority children. ii.              Neither is a focus on general 'school improvement' sufficient. While the most effective schools do raise the achievement of disadvantaged pupils, non-disadvantaged pupils tend to benefit just as much, so that these school do not eliminate the achievement gap. The correlation between a schools' residual (i.e. difference from the expected value) for FSM pupils correlated 0.97 with the schools' residual for non-FSM pupils. The results are shown in Figure 4. Thus primary schools that added the most value for White British students, girls or those not on FSM also added the most value for Black Caribbean students, boys or pupils on FSM. In short the relative performance of the disadvantaged remains similar even when the absolute performance of such groups has improved (Mortimore &amp; Whitty, 1997; Strand, 2010, 2014b).

These results do not deny the possibility that processes occuring within schools and classrooms may contribute to the poor progress of disadvantaged pupils or some ethnic minority groups, but does imply that such processes would need to be operating consistently across all schools. For example recent research suggests that setting is on the rise within primary schools in England, with a recent nationally representative survey indicating that over one-third of children in Y2 were set in literacy, mathematics or both, and that low SES children were disproportionally represented in bottom sets  (Hallam &amp; Ireson, 2013). Setting has been hypothesised to increase within school gaps for disadvantaged and ethnic minority students (e.g. Wiliam &amp; Bartholomew, 2004; Oakes, 2005). Another possible candidate is the distribution of teachers across classrooms within schools, with research from the US indicating that Black and disadvantaged students were more likely to be matched to novice teachers while more highly qualified teachers were matched to White and more advantaged students (Clotfelter, Ladd &amp; Vigor, 2005). They suggest this reflects both pressure from more affluent parents to secure better resources for their children and the greater power of more experienced teachers to lobby for more easy-to-educate students.

[[[.]]] This is the great hope for the Pupil Premium. This delivers greater funding to schools with high proportions of disadvantaged students in a transparent manner. It also comes with the expectation that  the grant will be used to support FSM eligible pupils, should focus on closing the gap in attainment between them and their peers, and accountability measures such as the publication of the FSM gap in school performance tables ( although it is important that schools are accountable for the progress of their students not for 'raw' attainment outcomes).  17. Since the demise of grammar school system in the late 1960's educational policy in England has, for good reason,  been wary of differentiating educational provision at too early an age for fear of exacerbating social inequality. Certainly sorting students into separate schools at age 11 or age 14 is to be avoided, since the evidence suggests this such differentiation tends to reproduce social inequality rather than eliminate it (e.g. Willis, 1977). Nevertheless the evidence on disengagement of WWC students, particularly age 14-16, reviewed in Section 4 above suggests that providing all students with the same curriculum in KS4 fails to meet the desire of a significant minority for learning that makes a strong connection between the academic and the world of work. It is a matter of some regret that the statutory duty of schools to provide work related learning (WRL) at KS4 was removed in September 2012. The raising of the school leaving age to 17 in September 2012, and to age 18 in September 2015, may move attention to 16-19 years olds, but strong programmes of WRL at KS4 should continue to be a focus for all schools, particularly those serving disadvantaged communities.Clotfelter, C.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0; . The LSYPE is a longitudinal study of over 15,000 young people first interviewed at age 14 in 2004 and currently being interviewed at age 25. The sample have been matched to the National Pupil Database to provide test and examination results at age 11 (2001), age 14 (2004) and age 16 (2006). . Considerable attention has been attracted by a study by Kintrea, St. Clair &amp; Houston (2011) suggesting that aspirations are universally high among students from disadvantaged backgrounds. However their study interviewed students from only three schools in high deprivation areas, and does not actually report data on educational aspirations noting only that "these findings did not vary significantly by any of the social factors we examined" (Kintrea et al, 2011, p27). As Kintrea et al themselves note "given this research set out to focus on people living with deprivation, it is not surprising that significant differentials by family economic status was not found. There was not a wide socioeconomic range among our participants" (p53). The LSYPE data in contrast are drawn from a nationally representative sample of over 15,000 students across over 600 schools. Social class differences in educational aspirations are quite robust and have been reported in other analyses of the LSYPE (e.g. Ross, 2009), with other representative surveys such as the youth component of the British Household Panel Survey (Croll, 2009).
