[[[&#xa0;]]]Accenture welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Health Committee’s call for written evidence. With a global Health practice comprising over 15,000 professionals, we work with 35 Trusts in England, 23 of the 25 Health companies in the Fortune Global 500, and public, private and community health providers in in Brazil, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, US, Canada, Australia and Singapore.

[[[ Right patient, right place, right time across the care continuum]]] 19.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The problem: CUH wanted to reduce the length of stay (LOS) of patients to improve the patient throughput and experience, and reduce cost. This included preventing unnecessary delays to the discharge of patients with on-going care needs. A key challenge to achieving this was insufficient collaboration between the Trust and adult social care providers. 19.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The solution: Accenture worked with CUH on a wide range of measures but the two most relevant for the Committee are the introduction of 

[[[case management]]] and the set-up of a 

[[[single point of access]]] to coordinate all discharge activities across several health and care providers. 19.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The outcome: Implementation of this integrated care model reduced section 5 admissions by 3 days, led to LOS reduction of 1 day in surgery for patients with no on-going care needs and reduced outliers by 40%. Overall the benefit of case management led to reduction of 47,000 bed days over the course of one year, equating to around £5.5m of cost savings. There were also significant improvements in patient experience, as well as in the satisfaction levels of healthcare staff.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Community-based patient navigators supporting chronically ill diabetes patients in the community]]]

[[[ ]]]20.1 The problem: Research in the US found that unmanaged diabetes costs approximately 21% more than managed diabetes, in large part due to the higher levels of inpatient treatment. 20.2 The solution: Accenture worked with the hospital to implement a Patient Navigation Program (PNP). The PNP used non-medical ‘lay’ staff in the community to help clinical staff to ensure chronically ill patients received continuous support outside the hospital setting. Patients were profiled and segmented and personalised interventions developed to target the particular needs of each group.20.3 The Outcome: Patients are more compliant with their care plans after enrolment in the program, contributing to a decrease in no-show/cancellation. Whilst the annual cost to patients for unmanaged diabetes is $14,210, this was reduced to $11,744 after the introduction of the patient navigators.
