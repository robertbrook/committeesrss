defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultAragon Housing Associationdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultAbout the organisationdefaultGUHG comprises of 3 subsidiaries: Aragon Housing Association (Aragon), South Northants Homes (SNH) and Macintyre Housing Association (Macintyre).
defaultThe attached document 
default(Appendix 2
default) sets out further details about GUHG.
default&#xa0;defaultReason for submitting evidencedefaultWe wish to give oral evidence to expand on this submission as the impact of Welfare Reform is complex and the nuances are difficult to convey in 3,000 words. We are also working on producing a report detailing the impact of the reforms six months after the introduction of the under-occupancy charge.  We would hope to present those findings to Select Committee. 
default&#xa0;defaultRecommendationsdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultExecutive sdefaultummary of defaultGUHG rdefaultesponsedefault&#xa0;defaultGUHG 
defaultis working hard to support and encourage 
defaultcustomers into employment and 
defaultwe 
defaultwelcome initiatives to further these aims. GUHG also welcome
defaults
default any schemes for reducing under-
defaultoccupancy. However, 
defaultWelfare Reform
default do
defaultes
default not achieve either of
default these for
default customers in our area. 
defaultHaving examined our extensive data w
defaulte are making this submission to report 
defaulton 
defaultthe impact of Welfare Reform
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe impact of
default Welfare Reform
default is far reaching for 
defaultall housing associations. We have reassessed our risks and revised our business plan.
default The early indications are that rent arrears have gone up. Our customers are struggling 
defaultto meet 
defaultrising costs and are 
defaulthaving to cut
default back o
defaultn fuel and food to make ends meet.
default 
default As a consequence our
default referral
defaults for food parcels ha
defaultve
default doubled.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur 
defaultopportunities to help customers downsize 
defaultare 
defaultlimited by the 
defaultlack of 
defaultsmaller social housing units. There is also a 
defaultshortage
default of 
defaultappropriate 
defaulthousing in the private sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultOvercrowding i
defaults not an issue in our area
default and the
default demand is for smaller housing units. 
defaultSome
default 
defaultvacated 
defaultthree
default bedroom
defaulted
default properties are being 
defaultallocated to
default 
defaulttenants with low needs because
default households with higher needs 
defaultno longer 
defaultqualify for them
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are finding that t
defaulthe grant of 
defaultDiscretionary Housing Payment (
defaultDHP
default)
default by Local A
defaultuthorities is masking the impact of 
defaultWelfare Reform
default. At the momen
defaultt DHP is
default a temporary provision 
defaultand there is a dan
defaultger that any assessment by the Select C
defaultommittee will not 
defaultaccurately reflect 
defaultthe likely future impact.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would be happy to assist the Select Committee and provide a full data report if this is required
default.
default&#xa0;defaultOur ndefaultew and innovdefaultative responses to the changesdefault&#xa0;defaultWe have considered a number of innovative ways of assisting our customers to cope with the 
defaultWelfare Reform
default c
defaulthanges. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur subsidiary South Northants Homes (
defaultSNH
default)
default has
default strengthened support provision, doubling the complement of welfare benefits and generic tenancy support officers. Aragon has also appointed welfare benefits advisers and increased its debt and money advice service
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultSNH has 
defaultbeen involved with the establishment of 
defaulta foodba
defaultnk in Towcester. Aragon 
defaultalso support
defaults
default and donate
defaults
default to a foodbank project.
default The referrals to foodbanks have doubled for both organisations.
default We do not consider foodbanks to be a good alternative as
default donations are 
defaultlimited to non-perishable food. We would like to see a proper study of the effect on health for people who have a prolonged reliance on food banks.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are offering a number of support projects, such as help in getting back into employment, cooking on a budget, confidence courses, computer courses and budgeting courses, all offered on both a
defaultn individual 
defaultand group basis.
default&#xa0;
defaultSNH 
defaultwon a Community Impact Award for its Move-In4ward 
defaultskills pr
defaultoject 
defaultdelivered 
defaultto approximately 40 of its
default most v
defaultulnerable tenants, spread over eight modules.  These looked at
default essential issues such as self esteem, job seeking skills, housing matters, DIY skills, health issues and cooking on a budget.  
default&#xa0;
defaultBoth organisations have funded and developed c
defaultredit unions. We are 
defaultenco

default our customers to sign up to jam jar accounts, to help 
defaultthem

default&#xa0;
defaultWe are 
defaultwork
defaulting
default with local partn
defaulters to set up training 
defaultfor young people leaving care and those who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs).  This training in the installation of kitchens and bathrooms is designed to lead to apprenticeships and work placements. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe 
defaultare considering
default setting up food growing projects to provide fresh fruit and vegetables.
default However the scope of this project is very limited and will not plug the gap were people are unable to afford fresh fruit and vegetables.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur stock 
defaultis 
defaultwell insulated with efficient heating systems and we have
default innovated in the provision of solar PV and
default air and ground source heat pumps
default where practical.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe report these innovative approaches
default with the proviso that we would not want to see these actions being 
defaultused to
default justify the under-occupancy charge because these solutions are not sufficient to help
default all our customers deal with
default the consequences of 
defaultWelfare Reform
default. The work we are doing 
defaultcan only make
default a small 
defaultimpact.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat defaultis the defaultimpact defaultof the defaultchangesdefault defaulton defaultthe defaultbusinessdefault?default&#xa0;defaultSNH has
default 243 customers
default affected by the 
defaultunder-occupancy charge. Aragon
default 
defaulthad 408 
defaultcustomers affected
default.  Currently, this has been reduced to 373 
defaultas some have 
defaulthad
default change of circumstances
default or have moved. 
defaultThose under-occupying are
default mainly 
defaultliving 
defaultin three
default bedroom properties. These properties hav
defaulte now become much harder to let
default because the demand in both areas is 
defaultnow largely 
defaultfor two
default bedroom properties
default;
default we do not have large families in over
defaultcrowded conditions waiting for three
default bedroom properties. 
defaultAragon is working with one family 
defaulti
defaultn overcrowded conditions but they require a 
defaultfive or six
default bedroom property and we are working with the local authority to adapt a suitable property
default for them
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultA recent analysis of the lettings
default in July 2013
default of three
default bedroom properties in the Aragon stock showed that 
defaultall the properties were let to those with low needs
default and in some cases it took more than one bidding cycle to allocate any household to these properties at all.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultSNH 
defaultdoes
default not have 
defaultfamilies 
defaultin their stock who 
defaultare affected
default by the benefit cap. Aragon has
default five
default families affected
default.  Of these three
default families are in the process of claim
defaulting
default DLA/Tax C
defaultredits whic
defaulth will exempt them from the cap if they receive an award.

defaultll rent arrears have decreased

defaultprior to the implementation of Under-O
defaultccupancy 
defaultCharge 
defaultbut 
defaultthe arrears owed by those affected by the bedroom tax have increased by approximately £13,000
default for SNH
default. For Aragon the rise in arrears among 
defaultunder-occupying
default tenants from 31/03/13 to 22/07/13 was £74,852.80.
default  We have issued Notices of Seeking Possession in 
default35
default defaultunder-occupying cases.
default&#xa0;
defaultSNH has
default 
defaultapproximately 60 tenants in arrears 
defaultwho
default have never been in arrears before.  
defaultAragon has seen 72 tenants affected by the under-occupancy charge falling into arrears where they had clear accounts before.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default caseload and referrals to our Welfare Benefits T
defaulteam has increased by 50%
default for SNH
default, all additional cases are due to the d
defaultirect impact of 
defaultWelfare Reform
default.
default Aragon has appointed 
defaulta 
defaultWelfare Reform
default Benefits Adviso
defaultr 
defaultto cope with increased demand.
default The issue of the lack of other benefits advice is also relevant as 
defaultcuts to Legal Aid funding have
default resulted in difficulty in accessing advice. Both organisations have examples of customers who have under
default 
defaultclaimed benefits considerably. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSNH 
defaultis
default carrying out at least 50% more mutual
default exchanges directly because of 
defaultWelfare Reform
default, which for the tenant is the best way to reduce the impact of the 
defaultunder-occupancy charge
default.  However,
default mutual exchanges are very costly for the organisation, costing on average 
defaultof 
default£550 per move.
default&#xa0;
defaultBoth subsidiaries offer 
defaulta moving allowance to people who 
defaultare willing and able to 
defaultdownsize. Without this allowance most of our customers would have been prevented from moving as they had rent arrears. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat is the impact of the changes on our defaultcdefaultustomersdefault?default&#xa0;defaultSNH has
default been 
defaultsupporting five
default 
defaultpeople who have 
defaultbeen 
defaultsubject to 
defaultthe new J
defaultob Seeker’s Allowance 
defaultsanctions, all of w
defaulthom
default had to be referred to the foodbank.  Referrals to the foodbank use
defaultd to be limited to three
default per year
default per 
defaultperson.  This has now been revised to three
default per six months, and will need to be reviewed again due to repeat presentations.
default In August
default 2013
default there 
defaultwere 
default14 referrals
default from Aragon to the foodbank
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe sanctions, which have always been in place, are clearly being implemented with far more vigour and with a different interpretation, and it is our understand
defaulting that those sanctioned in our area have
default increased ten-fold.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe impact on those who ha
defaultve disabilities is extreme.  SNH 
defaulthas
default approximately 60 households who are disabled and affected by the bedro
defaultom tax, many of whom
default live in specifically adapted properties.
default 
defaultIt is practically impossible to transfer these households to smaller properties because of the nature of their disabilities and 
defaultspecific housing need.  As
default such we are trying to find alternatives to keep them in their own homes, such as finding different uses for their ‘spare’ bedrooms, and maximising their incomes, but the real
defaulti
defaultty is that for most of these tenants, they w
defaultil
defaultl have to find the 
defaultadditional money to cover the housing benefit
default shortfall.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur Money A
defaultdvice 
defaultTeam has
default seen an upsurge in both referrals and debt levels, many of whic
defaulth are directly attributable to 
defaultWelfare Reform
default. Th
defaulte financial gains for clients are
default twice as high as 
defaultthey were at this point four years ago.  T
defaulthe amount of referrals has increased by 50% compared to this time last year.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur work on welfare benefits has highlighted that our tenants are under claiming benefits including Housing Benefit. For example Aragon has 
defaulthelped customers
default claim nearly £79,000 in Housing Benefit alone
default over the last year. The total amount of benefit claimed by Aragon’s customers 
defaultwith our assistance
default 
defaultis nearly £250,000
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother consequence for tenants who move into the private sector is that they lose services we provide to tenants as a social landlord. Those tenants will not have access to our training and employment
default initiatives which 
defaulthelp
default towards getting people into work and off benefits.
default&#xa0;defaultWhat defaultimpact defaultdo defaultwdefaulte defaultanticipate over the coming months defaulton us defaultas adefault housing defaultprovider?default&#xa0;defaultT
defaulthe amount owed in 
defaultunder-occupancy charge
default arrears and those who find themselves in arrears for the first time because of the 
defaultunder-occupancy charge
default is likely to increase dramatically once the DHP pot 
defaulti
defaults exhausted which is likely 
defaultto be in the next 
defaulttwo
default months.  SNH 
defaultcurrently has
default 43 tenants on DHP
default.  Th
defaultese are our most vulnerable families and once DHP ends they will be at serious risk of losing their tenancies as there is 
defaultno ‘additional’ income
default to cover the shortfall in HB.  
defaultAragon has 93
default tenants who have received DHP at some point since
default April;
default 52 are currently still in receipt of DHP but most of these awards end in the next two months.
default&#xa0;
defaultSNH 
defaulthas
default approximately 650 people of working age who will need to migrate from DLA to PIP.  This is a task 
defaultfor
default 
defaultwhich most of our tenants will need support.  On average, a
default PIP claim takes approximately five
default hours to complete
default.  I
defaultt can take up to an hour to complete the telephone registration alone, so to support as many of our tenants as possible through this migration process will put a huge strain on resources, and there is a real chance that other tenants, who need support with other benefit issues, will need to wait longer for our help and potentially lose out o
defaultn money they desperately need. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMost of Macintyre
default’s
default 
defaultcustomers 
defaultwho all have learning disabilities (approximately 500 people) 
defaultwill need to migrate 
defaultto PIP
default 
defaultand will
default need support to do this. 
defaultT
defaulthese customers are
default the least a
defaultble to deal with the impact of 
defaultWelfare Reform
default changes as all MHA’s clients have a learning disability.

defaultr. SNH received £13,188,350 in rent last year of which £6, 198,298 was in housing benefit
default.
default 
defaultWe estimate that the majority of our customers who are not deemed as vulnerable will be paid their benefits directly under the new Universal Credit arrangements, which will include the housing element which is for their rent. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe concerns around housing costs being included in Universal Credit payments 
defaultare well documented. Tenants who are subject to sanction will lose all their bene
defaultfits and risk losing their home whereas those being sanctioned currently 
defaultdo not lose Housing Benefit.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat defaultimpact defaultdo defaultwedefault defaultanticipate overdefault the coming months for defaultour customersdefault?default default&#xa0;defaultIn our area the private rented sector is limited and 
defaultinsecure, so the opportunities for people to downsize into this sector are both severely limited and undesirable. 
defaultResearch in this area shows for the area that Aragon operates in (
defaultCentral  B
defaultedfordshire), 
defaultthe average private rent for a two
default bedroom property is £156.13 per week, which is £29.18 per week above the Local Housing Allowance for the majority of the region. This means that should our tenants move to such properties, they face an average 18.6% shortfall, 
defaultdespite
default occupying properties of the correct size. This means both a larger shortfall for tenants and higher Housing Benefit awards; the result is that costs are both higher for tenants and Local Authorities. Therefore, moving to the private rented sector is simply not a viable option in our region.
default  The same is true for those living in South Northants Homes
default’
default area.
default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore, 
defaultas a G
defaultroup 
defaultwe 
defaultdo not have enough smaller units to rehouse all of those affected by the 
defaultunder-occupancy charge
default, so over time, we anticipate that our most vulnerable tenants will no longer have the capacity to maintain their tenancies, leading to evictions, increased levels of personal debt and the resulting pressures on public/private services, such as 
defaultfood banks
default, clothing banks, 
defaultGUHG’s 
defaultand the Council
defaults’
default support teams and statutory services such as social services.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe councils
default’
default DHP budget
defaults will soon be spent, and 
defaultour tenants currently maintaining their tenancies in this way will need to find another option.  There are limited options to move and as such, we anticipate that these families will quickly get into serious debt, both housing and otherwise
default resulting in
default a catastrophic impact on some households. The DHP scheme merely offers temp
defaultorary respite from benefit cuts
default 
defaultand is
default potentially pejorative, conditional, subjective and can become int
defaultrusive.  In one instance our 
defaultlocal authority r
defaultefused
default a DHP claim because the 
defaultapplicant paid 
defaultfor dental insurance
default.  T
defaulthe tenant in question has very bad teeth as a result of a medical condition.  Another DHP was refused for 
defaulta wheelchair user, seeking work, t
defaulthey were relying on 
defaultbroadband in order to do this but it was deemed that broadband was an unnecessary ‘luxury’. The overall effect on our tenants could be that they become demonised and treated less favourably for attempting to improve their quality of life. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe anticipate that it is the most vulnerable groups, such as homeless households and households with a 
defaultdisability who
default will suffer the most.  Disabled households are the most difficult to transfer as the options open to them that are open to other tenants, su
defaultch as returning to work or the occasional
default opportunity to downsize
default are more limited.  They will often 
defaulthave no option but to find
default the shortfall or face eviction. 
defaultT
defaulthe total cost to the pub
defaultl
defaultic purse, sh
defaultould they be evicted, 
defaultis believed to be in the region of £7,000. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThose who have never had to manage their own housing costs will need a significant amount of support to build up the skills required to cope with UC, and if they fail to do so, which we unfortunately believe that some will, they too face the prospect of losing their tenancies
