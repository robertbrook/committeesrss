defaulthis 
defaultevidence 
defaultaddresses the single issue of whether the right to vote is properly to be considered a human right.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe short answer, in my
default view
default, is that it 
defaultis 
defaultnot. 
default&#xa0;
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe prisoner voting debate has been characterised
default by a failure to distinguish 
defaultbetween
default 
defaultthe guarantee to 
defaulthold free elections on the one hand, and 
defaultthe 
defaultm
defaultan
defaultner in which free elections are to be held on the other. The former, namely the requirement 
defaultimposed on a State 
defaultto hold free elections at reasonable intervals, is a fundamental freedom and recognised as a human right. The latter, namely the manner in which an 
defaultelection
default is held and 
defaulta citizen’s ability to 
defaultparticipate in it, is not.
default Universal suf
defaultfrage is the means by which th
defaulte human right requiring the State to hold free elections 
defaultis realised, but it is 
defaultnot 
defaulta human 
defaultright itself.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis distinction 
defaultbetween the right to hold free elections and a citizen’s ability to participate in an election 
defaultis reflected in 
defaultArticle 3 
defaultProtocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights 
default(“the Convention”) 
defaultwhich provides as follows:
default&#xa0;
defaultARTICLE 3
defaultRight to free elections
defaultThe High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at
default 
defaultreasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will
default 
defaultensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the
default 
defaultchoice of the legislature.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe omission to 
defaultarticulate 
defaulta human right guaranteeing an individual’s right to participate in free elections was deliberate.
default At a meeting of the Committee of Experts on Human Rights
default (“the Committee”)
default at the Council of Europe on 3 February 1950, Sir Oscar Dowson (the UK’s representative) explained:
default&#xa0;
default“ … It is probable that suffrage is as wide in the United Kingdom as in any other country; yet even in the United Kingdom it is inaccurate to speak of suffrage as “universal”. In no State is the right to vote enjoyed even by citizens without qualifications. The qualifications required differ from State to State, and it is our view that the variety of circumstances to be considered may justify the imposition of a variety of qualifications, as a condition of the exercise of suffrage ...”

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultE
defaultven if a reference to universal suffrage had been included in Article 3 Protocol 1, the other signatory 
defaultcountries
default were clear that this would not confer on 
defaulta 
defaultcitizen a 
defaulthuman 
defaultrigh
defaultt to vote in every circumstance
default. The response of the other member States was 
defaultsummarised 
default 
defaultin 
defaultthe 
defaultCommittee’
defaults
default 
defaultdraft 
defaulton 15 February 1950 in the following terms:
default&#xa0;
default“The United Kingdom representative stated that his Government was opposed to the insertion of an Article of this kind in the Convention by reason of the practical difficulties which would thereby arise, particularly over the definition of the term “universal suffrage”, the right to vote being, in all countries, subject to restrictions [...]
default&#xa0;
defaultThe other Committee members, however, were of the opinion that the term “universal suffrage” had a sufficiently clear and precise meaning for the European countries and did not exclude the usual restriction on the right to vote. The members felt, moreover, that even if universal suffrage and secret ballot was not an absolute guarantee of democracy, it nevertheless constituted an important guarantee which merited protection by the Convention.”
default 
default&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTwo significant points emerge from 
defaulta consideration of 
defaultthis passage. First, as already noted, signatory 
defaultcountries 
defaultdid not consider that the notion of universal suffrage excluded any restriction on the right to vote. Secondly, the significance of the reference to universal suffrage is not the articulation of a human right to vote, but rather the recognition of the means 
defaultor mechanism 
defaultby which 
defaulta 
defaultfree election
default is 
defaultsecured.  
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis understanding was re-iterated in 1966 in Article 25 of 
defaultthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
defaultThis 
defaultprovide
defaultd
default that
default:
default“Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions:
default(a) To take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives;
default(b) To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors;
default(
defaultc) To have access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country.”
default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThirty years later, this understanding remained unchanged. In 1996, when considering the issue of universal suffrage, the United Nations Office of the Commission for Human Rights made clear in a General Comment that:
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultState reports should describe the rules governing the right to vote, and the application of those rules in the period covered by the report. State reports should also describe factors which impede citizens from exercising the right to vote and the positive measures which have been adopted to overcome these factors.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn their reports, States parties should indicate and explain the legislative provisions which would deprive citizens of their right to vote. The grounds for such deprivation should be objective and reasonable. If conviction for an offence is a basis for suspending the right to vote, the period of such suspension should be proportionate to the offence and the sentence. Persons who are deprived of liberty but who have not been convicted should not be excluded from exercising the right to vote.”
default&#xa0;
default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultI
defaultt is interesting to note that the United Nations Office con
defaultsidered 
defaultthat the loss of a convicted prisoner’s ability to vote 
defaultwas
default not incompatible with the right of universal suffrage or the holding of free elections 
defaultto secure a 
defaultdemocratic
defaultally elected government. 
default&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis understanding is consistent with an 
defaultapproach which safeguards the holding of free elections as a fundamental freedom 
defaultin 
defaultmodern democratic society but stops short of recognising a human right which guarantees to every citizen the ability to participate in this process. 
default&#xa0;
default12.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA restriction on a convicted prisoner’s ability to participate
default in the democratic process is 
defaultboth 
defaultreasonable and objectively 
defaultjustifiable.
default 
default&#xa0;
default13.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhere a person
default’s failure to 
defaultcomply with the rules of modern civilized society 
defaultis sufficiently serious to justify the imposition of a custodial sentence, he demonstrates a rejection of the societal norms by which his fellow citizens have chosen to live. 
defaultW
defaultithdrawal from participation in civil society is an important 
defaultfeature of a custodial sentence, 
defaultand it 
defaultis 
defaultinconsistent with 
defaulta convicted
default prisoner’s 
defaultrejection of these societal norms to permit him to participate in civil society pending his rehabilitation in due course
default.
default The period of exclusion is proportionate, the length of sentence having been determined in accordance with rationally defensible criteria.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIf a 
defaultperson or a 
defaultgroup of people were to be disenfranchised on grounds which 
defaultwe
defaultre arbitrary or capricious, 
defaultit would infringe a human right but not 
defaulta right to vote. 
defaultT
defaulthe infringement would engage a person’s right to be treated equally and not subjected to discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.
default In consequence, a signatory country would infringe its positive obligation under Article 3 Protocol 1 
default“
defaultto hold free elections 
default… 
defaultunder conditions which ensured the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of legislature
default”
default.
default 
defaultBut this is not the same as saying that Article 3 Protocol 1 establishes a discrete human right for an individual to vote which is free-standing. 
default&#xa0;
default15.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is much discussion amongst legal theorists as to how human rights come to be recognised and their substance determined. Theories based on 
defaultJohn
default Locke’s social contract 
defaultand/or 
defaultthe existence of natural law rights have given way in 
defaultmodern 
defaulttimes to a positivist approach, by which human rights are recognised in circumstances where a broad section of society acknowledges this to be the case. 
default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0; 
defaultApplying the
default 
defaultpositivist and 
defaultself-sustaining approach to the recognition of legal norms,  
defaultI believe 
defaultit is clear that the 
defaultright 
defaultto free elections which guarantee the democratic process is protected as a fundament
defaultal freedom whereas 
defaultan individual’s ability to participate in the process is not.
