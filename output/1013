[normal]T
[normal]his 
[normal]evidence 
[normal]addresses the single issue of whether the right to vote is properly to be considered a human right.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The short answer, in my
[normal] view
[normal], is that it 
[normal]is 
[normal]not. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The prisoner voting debate has been characterised
[normal] by a failure to distinguish 
[normal]between
[normal] 
[normal]the guarantee to 
[normal]hold free elections on the one hand, and 
[normal]the 
[normal]m
[normal]an
[normal]ner in which free elections are to be held on the other. The former, namely the requirement 
[normal]imposed on a State 
[normal]to hold free elections at reasonable intervals, is a fundamental freedom and recognised as a human right. The latter, namely the manner in which an 
[normal]election
[normal] is held and 
[normal]a citizen’s ability to 
[normal]participate in it, is not.
[normal] Universal suf
[normal]frage is the means by which th
[normal]e human right requiring the State to hold free elections 
[normal]is realised, but it is 
[normal]not 
[normal]a human 
[normal]right itself.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This distinction 
[normal]between the right to hold free elections and a citizen’s ability to participate in an election 
[normal]is reflected in 
[normal]Article 3 
[normal]Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights 
[normal](“the Convention”) 
[normal]which provides as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ARTICLE 3
[normal]Right to free elections
[normal]The High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at
[normal] 
[normal]reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will
[normal] 
[normal]ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the
[normal] 
[normal]choice of the legislature.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The omission to 
[normal]articulate 
[normal]a human right guaranteeing an individual’s right to participate in free elections was deliberate.
[normal] At a meeting of the Committee of Experts on Human Rights
[normal] (“the Committee”)
[normal] at the Council of Europe on 3 February 1950, Sir Oscar Dowson (the UK’s representative) explained:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“ … It is probable that suffrage is as wide in the United Kingdom as in any other country; yet even in the United Kingdom it is inaccurate to speak of suffrage as “universal”. In no State is the right to vote enjoyed even by citizens without qualifications. The qualifications required differ from State to State, and it is our view that the variety of circumstances to be considered may justify the imposition of a variety of qualifications, as a condition of the exercise of suffrage ...”
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]E
[normal]ven if a reference to universal suffrage had been included in Article 3 Protocol 1, the other signatory 
[normal]countries
[normal] were clear that this would not confer on 
[normal]a 
[normal]citizen a 
[normal]human 
[normal]righ
[normal]t to vote in every circumstance
[normal]. The response of the other member States was 
[normal]summarised 
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]the 
[normal]Committee’
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]draft 
[normal]on 15 February 1950 in the following terms:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“The United Kingdom representative stated that his Government was opposed to the insertion of an Article of this kind in the Convention by reason of the practical difficulties which would thereby arise, particularly over the definition of the term “universal suffrage”, the right to vote being, in all countries, subject to restrictions [...]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The other Committee members, however, were of the opinion that the term “universal suffrage” had a sufficiently clear and precise meaning for the European countries and did not exclude the usual restriction on the right to vote. The members felt, moreover, that even if universal suffrage and secret ballot was not an absolute guarantee of democracy, it nevertheless constituted an important guarantee which merited protection by the Convention.”
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Two significant points emerge from 
[normal]a consideration of 
[normal]this passage. First, as already noted, signatory 
[normal]countries 
[normal]did not consider that the notion of universal suffrage excluded any restriction on the right to vote. Secondly, the significance of the reference to universal suffrage is not the articulation of a human right to vote, but rather the recognition of the means 
[normal]or mechanism 
[normal]by which 
[normal]a 
[normal]free election
[normal] is 
[normal]secured.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This understanding was re-iterated in 1966 in Article 25 of 
[normal]the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
[normal]This 
[normal]provide
[normal]d
[normal] that
[normal]:
[normal]“Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions:
[normal](a) To take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives;
[normal](b) To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors;
[normal](
[normal]c) To have access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Thirty years later, this understanding remained unchanged. In 1996, when considering the issue of universal suffrage, the United Nations Office of the Commission for Human Rights made clear in a General Comment that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]State reports should describe the rules governing the right to vote, and the application of those rules in the period covered by the report. State reports should also describe factors which impede citizens from exercising the right to vote and the positive measures which have been adopted to overcome these factors.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In their reports, States parties should indicate and explain the legislative provisions which would deprive citizens of their right to vote. The grounds for such deprivation should be objective and reasonable. If conviction for an offence is a basis for suspending the right to vote, the period of such suspension should be proportionate to the offence and the sentence. Persons who are deprived of liberty but who have not been convicted should not be excluded from exercising the right to vote.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]t is interesting to note that the United Nations Office con
[normal]sidered 
[normal]that the loss of a convicted prisoner’s ability to vote 
[normal]was
[normal] not incompatible with the right of universal suffrage or the holding of free elections 
[normal]to secure a 
[normal]democratic
[normal]ally elected government. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]This understanding is consistent with an 
[normal]approach which safeguards the holding of free elections as a fundamental freedom 
[normal]in 
[normal]modern democratic society but stops short of recognising a human right which guarantees to every citizen the ability to participate in this process. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]A restriction on a convicted prisoner’s ability to participate
[normal] in the democratic process is 
[normal]both 
[normal]reasonable and objectively 
[normal]justifiable.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Where a person
[normal]’s failure to 
[normal]comply with the rules of modern civilized society 
[normal]is sufficiently serious to justify the imposition of a custodial sentence, he demonstrates a rejection of the societal norms by which his fellow citizens have chosen to live. 
[normal]W
[normal]ithdrawal from participation in civil society is an important 
[normal]feature of a custodial sentence, 
[normal]and it 
[normal]is 
[normal]inconsistent with 
[normal]a convicted
[normal] prisoner’s 
[normal]rejection of these societal norms to permit him to participate in civil society pending his rehabilitation in due course
[normal].
[normal] The period of exclusion is proportionate, the length of sentence having been determined in accordance with rationally defensible criteria.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]If a 
[normal]person or a 
[normal]group of people were to be disenfranchised on grounds which 
[normal]we
[normal]re arbitrary or capricious, 
[normal]it would infringe a human right but not 
[normal]a right to vote. 
[normal]T
[normal]he infringement would engage a person’s right to be treated equally and not subjected to discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.
[normal] In consequence, a signatory country would infringe its positive obligation under Article 3 Protocol 1 
[normal]“
[normal]to hold free elections 
[normal]… 
[normal]under conditions which ensured the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of legislature
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]But this is not the same as saying that Article 3 Protocol 1 establishes a discrete human right for an individual to vote which is free-standing. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]There is much discussion amongst legal theorists as to how human rights come to be recognised and their substance determined. Theories based on 
[normal]John
[normal] Locke’s social contract 
[normal]and/or 
[normal]the existence of natural law rights have given way in 
[normal]modern 
[normal]times to a positivist approach, by which human rights are recognised in circumstances where a broad section of society acknowledges this to be the case. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Applying the
[normal] 
[normal]positivist and 
[normal]self-sustaining approach to the recognition of legal norms,  
[normal]I believe 
[normal]it is clear that the 
[normal]right 
[normal]to free elections which guarantee the democratic process is protected as a fundament
[normal]al freedom whereas 
[normal]an individual’s ability to participate in the process is not.
