[normal]Written evidence submitted by the [bold]Rt[bold] Hon. Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury[bold]President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (CRJ 17)[bold]It was a pleasure to meet you, and some members of your Committee recently, when you visited the Supreme Court, It was instructive as well as enjoyable. 
[normal]I undertook to consider if there were any points it would be appropriate for us to 
[normal]make in relation to the questions you are asking in the inquiry. Decisions as to whether 
[normal]we should have a written constitution, and what it should cover, are ultimately political in 
[normal]nature, and I offer no comment on that issue.
[normal]Lady Hale, the Deputy President of the Court, and I however feel that there is 
[normal]one issue we would wish to draw to your attention. That is whether, in the event of 
[normal]there being a written constitution for the United Kingdom, a separate Constitutional 
[normal]Court would be required.
[normal]Whilst it is the practice in many civil law countries to have separate Supreme 
[normal]Courts and Constitutional Courts (and sometimes also separate Supreme Administrative 
[normal]Courts), that is not the pattern in common-law 'Countries. Rather, the practice is for 
[normal]constitutional issues to be considered by the Supreme Court. That would certainly be the 
[normal]model we would prefer. It works perfectly well in countries whose judicial systems are 
[normal]very similar to ours, such as Canada. Indeed, we already perform a constitutional role, 
[normal]both in the Supreme Court (albeit to a limited extent) and the Judicial Committee of the 
[normal]Privy Council. At least at the moment it is difficult to estimate what effect it might have 
[normal]on our workload (and hence whether or not there would be a need for more Justices).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The other issue which needs to be looked at very carefully is whether it should be possible for GovernmentÂ  or Parliament to make references to the Supreme Court as to the constitutionality of proposed legislation, either before it has been introduced to Parliament or after it has been passed by Parliament, but not yet come into force.
