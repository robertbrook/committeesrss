defaultWritten evidence submitted by the defaultRtdefault Hon. Lord Neuberger of AbbotsburydefaultPresident of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (CRJ 17)defaultIt was a pleasure to meet you, and some members of your Committee recently, when you visited the Supreme Court, It was instructive as well as enjoyable. 
defaultI undertook to consider if there were any points it would be appropriate for us to 
defaultmake in relation to the questions you are asking in the inquiry. Decisions as to whether 
defaultwe should have a written constitution, and what it should cover, are ultimately political in 
defaultnature, and I offer no comment on that issue.
defaultLady Hale, the Deputy President of the Court, and I however feel that there is 
defaultone issue we would wish to draw to your attention. That is whether, in the event of 
defaultthere being a written constitution for the United Kingdom, a separate Constitutional 
defaultCourt would be required.
defaultWhilst it is the practice in many civil law countries to have separate Supreme 
defaultCourts and Constitutional Courts (and sometimes also separate Supreme Administrative 
defaultCourts), that is not the pattern in common-law 'Countries. Rather, the practice is for 
defaultconstitutional issues to be considered by the Supreme Court. That would certainly be the 
defaultmodel we would prefer. It works perfectly well in countries whose judicial systems are 
defaultvery similar to ours, such as Canada. Indeed, we already perform a constitutional role, 
defaultboth in the Supreme Court (albeit to a limited extent) and the Judicial Committee of the 
defaultPrivy Council. At least at the moment it is difficult to estimate what effect it might have 
defaulton our workload (and hence whether or not there would be a need for more Justices).

defaultThe other issue which needs to be looked at very carefully is whether it should be possible for GovernmentÂ  or Parliament to make references to the Supreme Court as to the constitutionality of proposed legislation, either before it has been introduced to Parliament or after it has been passed by Parliament, but not yet come into force.
