default, around the world, one in every 28 people is a viewer, listener or reader of BBC global news.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe increase was primarily driven by a growth of 8m in digital audiences and 13m uplift in World Service TV audi

default including most re

defaultcessation of Arabic short wave across the Middle East (except to Sudan), and the reduction of Arabic and English medium wave hours to the Middle East
default, but audiences have increased despite this, thanks to the quality of its journalism, and decisi

defaultTrust and defaultqdefaultuality measurementsdefault&#xa0;
defaultA new assessment of the global BBC brand shows that 
defaultthe BBC is ahead of all 
defaultcompetitors on all attributes globally, and most closely associated with trust, high quality
default defaultand being unbiased and objective. 
default Where the BBC was less strong – on engagement – efforts have been made to increase regular usage and loyalty amongst the global 
defaultaudience.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ‘Brand Tracker’ was
default established this year to monitor the international brand position of Global News. 
default 
defaultResearch 
defaultwas
default conducted in ten markets, and 
defaultr
defaultesults so far show that the BBC and CNN are clear leaders with the BBC slightly ahead, with bo

default&#xa0;
defaultIn terms of brand attributes, the BBC is ahead of all competitors on all attributes globally, and most closely associated with trust, high quality
default defaultand being unbiased and objective. There are also indications that the BBC 
defaultgains greater social currency and impact
default defaultfrom its coverage than key competitors. However, 
defaultthe tracker showed that

defaultEditorial highlightsdefault&#xa0;
defaultThis year saw 
defaultall editorial elements of 
defaultGlobal News 
default- World Service, World News and bbc.com/news 
default- 
defaultbecome more 
defaultunited than ever before when they came 
defaulttogether
default under one roof in New Broadcasting House. This launched the concept of ‘The World’s Newsroom’, enabling editorial collaboration across the news group, both within Global News and between Global News and UK News.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWS Languages, BBC Monitoring and
default Newsgathering worked closely together to ensure that audiences were able to access the latest information and analysis. 
defaultSome of the highlights included:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5)default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTV and defaultdigitaldefault developmentsdefault&#xa0;defaultThe challenges in reaching global audiences are intensifying. Global state funded and 
defaultcommercial players are investing (
defaultthe BBC
default estimate
defaults
default CCTV’s funding has increased by $2bn per annum, and competitors including CNN and New York Times have a growing multi-lingual portfolio). At a local and regional level, news provision is 
defaultrapidly increasin
defaultg; Afghanistan, for example, now has 80 terrestrial TV stations and over 175 radio stations. Digital developments are accelerating this change. Short
default 
defaultwave listening continues to decline, with some of 
defaultBBC WS’s
default largest audiences in Nigeria and Burma
default facing p
defaultressure. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFor the time being, radio is still 
defaultthe W
defaultorld 
defaultS
defaultervice
default’s
default largest platform and the most cost-effective form of distribution, but as short
default 
defaultwave becomes less relevant to most audiences, 
defaultthe BBC must offer
default a greater multiplatform presence.  
defaultInvestment
default in new TV programming
default and digital output is a key part of 
defaultWorld Service
default’s
default strategy. Four new language TV bulletins were launched this year, and are now on air:
default&#xa0;
defaultFocus on Africa: defaultLaunched on both BBC W
defaultorld News and on 11 partner TV s
defaulttations in 
defaulteight
default countries. This programme is an extension of 
defaultBBC Africa’s
default strong radio brand into television and represents 
defaulta 
defaultunique partnership with 
defaultBBC World News. 
defaultReporting expertise is provided by existing BBC Africa reporters in Africa, complimented by the poo
defaultl of N
defaultewsgathering staff on the 
defaultcontinent. This 
defaultwas 
defaultthe first stage in Global News’ investment in new content and programming aimed at reaching different audiences around the world who are changing the way they consume their news. 
default&#xa0;defaultDiira Ya Dunia: defaultLaunched in 
defaultAugust, a 30 minute bulletin aimed at Swahili speaking audiences in East and Central Africa, which airs in Tanzania and Kenya on partner TV stations.
default 
default A
default number of
default new partners in DRC and Rwanda 
defaulthave been added 
defaultenabling BBC WS to expand its reach in Africa.
default&#xa0;
defaultGlobal India: defaultA weekly 30-minute magazine-style show from the Hindi service launched in November on five Hindi news channels on the ETV network in India, at prime time. Each programme gets three playouts on all five channels.
default&#xa0;defaultSairbeen (Panorama): defaultA th
defaultrice weekly one-hour TV programme from the Urdu service of regional and global news for audiences in Pakistan launched in February 2013. The programme was increased to five times a week in the run up to Pakistani elections.
default&#xa0;defaultAlthough audience performance d
defaultata
default is not yet available
default, several of 
defaultthe
default TV partners have signed-up to the programmes for another year on the same or improved commercial terms. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFeedback from Star TV on 
defaultDiira Ya Dunia
default has been especially positive, with the CEO keen to renew the contract. In addition, in Kenya reaction on social media to editions of 
defaultFocus On Africa
default and 
defaultDiira Ya Dunia

defaultand very positive.

defaultWorld Service Digitaldefault:defaultThis year, the last seven
default 
defaultlanguage 
defaultwebsites 
defaultwere
default updated in accordance with the new and improved visual and presentation style, in line with the ‘feel and look’ of the rest of the BBC sites. 11 Nokia Apps, 5 iOS Apps, and 4 Andr
defaultoid apps have now been released
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultSeveral World Service websites have now been converted to responsive design including Indonesia, Hausa, Arabic, Vietnamese, Turkish¸ Russian, Hindi, Afrique, Mundo, Brasil and Persian with the conversion of many more languages in progress. Responsive desig
defaultn is a technology that optimises the mobile browser according to the device used – adjusting the layout to the screen size and connectivity. It is especially helpful for the language services, given the diverse markets they serve and the huge array of diff
defaulterent phones and technical standards in those markets. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs mentioned in the 
defaultAudience Figures
default section, these developments have contributed to a 16% increase in World Service digital audience globally.  
default&#xa0;default6)default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMedia freedom defaultupdatedefault&#xa0;defaultMedia freedom issues continue 
defaultto affect the BBC’s ability to reach its audiences.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultMany of these issues were 
defaultdescribed in detail
default in BBC World Service’s written evidence submitted to the FAC’
defaults Human Rights inquiry.  This is a
default brief summary of 
defaultthe 
defaultissues 
defaultBBC WS 
defaulthas faced 
defaultthis year
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultJournalistsdefault’default sdefaultafety:defaultThe BBC has been extremely concerned about the safety of its journalists in several parts of the world. Syria has continued to be a dangerous place to report and violence and pressures on media in Egypt have made it a difficult place t
defaulto work as a journalist. BBC reporter 
defaultMohammed Moalimu, 
defaultcame close to death in Somalia when in July an al-Shabab suicide bomber detonated his explosives just as Moalimu was driving past.
default&#xa0;
default He was wounded by shrapnel in his shoulder.
default&#xa0;
defaultBut it is not just in c
defaultonflict zones that journalists’ safety is being threatened. A BBC Tamil reporter, Ponnaiah Manikavasagam, was questioned for hours by anti-terrorist police in Sri Lanka over his phone conversations with two Tamil prisoners. He was not allowed a lawyer duri
defaultng the interview. BBC WS raised its concern and expressed confidence that all his activities were carried out in pursuit of normal journalistic duties. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn Turkey, during Gezi
default Park protests, Turkish authorities launched a campaign of intimidation against BBC Turkish reporter, Selin Girit. She had been deployed to Istanbul to cover the protests both for Turkish and English outlets. The mayor of Ankara launched a campaign against
default Selin on Twitter, resulting in a large number of threatening messages being sent to her. In a statement, the BBC called on the Turkish 
defaultauthorities not to intimidate its reporter and to use the established procedures if they have any complaints about BBC o
defaultutput. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn Iran, security authorities have continued harassing BBC Persian staff and their families. In the weeks leading to the Iranian presidential election in June, the incidents of harassment increased and the media campaign against BBC Persian staff
default intensified. Although after the election the harassment stopped for a while, in recent weeks a new wave of intimidation of families has started again. Families of several members of staff have been threatened to stop their relatives working for the BBC. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo highlight the importance of journalists’ safety and the issue of impunity, the BBC is organising a conference next year. It is a follow-up to the conference it co-hosted last October. The conference will bring together senior journalists, NGOs and 
defaultrepresentatives from UN’s relevant bodies and governments
default.
default&#xa0;
default It will examine what international legal bodies could do to prosecute those who are responsible for attacking and intimidating journalists.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;defaultJamming in China:defaultThe jamming of BBC English short wa
defaultve services by China has occurred since February this year and also affects reception of the service in many other Asian countries.  
defaultAccess to the BBC Chinese (Mandarin) website has been completely blocked since its launch in 1999.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC strongly cond
defaultemns
default this action, but
default despite 
defaultrepresentations made to the Chinese Ambassador, the regulator, and the Director Global News raising the issue in meetings duri
defaultng his recent visit to China, the BBC
default has not received a response
default from the Chinese authorities
default.
default&#xa0;defaultBroadcasts suspended in Sri Lanka:defaultBBC WS suspended its broadcasts on SLBC (the Sri Lankan Broadcasting Corporation) following continued interruption and interference of BBC Tamil programming.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultDespite requests for discussion about any complaints that SLBC
default might have had about any specific output, the issue has not been resolved.  The BBC took similar action in 2009 when its services were also disrupted.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAudiences in Sri Lanka can continue to listen to th
defaulte BBC on short wave and via 
defaultonline services
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultTV pardefaulttnership suspended in defaultTurkey:defaultFollowing the start of protests in Turkey in June the Turkish service took the decision to suspend its TV partnership with NTV in Turkey, after NTV interfered with its broadcasting. 
defaultBBC Turkish subsequently relaunched its digi
defaulttal offer with a greater emphasis on mobile, video and social news, and has seen its traffic soar more than 350% in one year alone with nearly 90% of the audience coming from within Turkey.
defaultProgress in defaultBurma:defaultThere were uplifting developments in Burma
default/Myanmar
default defaultwhere the government has 
defaultstrictly
default controlled  the media over a number of years. 
defaultFor the past nine months BBC Media Action has been helping the state broadcaster - MRTV - to achieve its declared aim of evolving into a public service broadcaster by 
defaultJanuary 2015. As a result of this support MRTV now has its first prime-time politics programme to feature interviews with members of all the parties represented in Parliament, a new radio current affairs programmes featuring differing points of view and an
default emerging newsgathering structure that is more independent than anything the country has known in the past few decades .
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition a youth programme is broadcast on the BBC's Burmese Service 
defaultthat informs audiences about governance issues and encourages 
defaultdiscussion and participation and developing other projects to improve livelihoods, health and resilience to natural disasters. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere have
default also
default been
default a number of distribution break
defaultthroughs with BBC TV channels including BBC World News now available on the 
defaultSkyNet 
defaultTV platform in Burma
default,
default a 
defaultrebroadcasting deal 
defaultwith 
defaultPadamyar FM
default and another one with key FM station 
defaultShwe
default which covers 98% of the country in the pipeline.  In addition, t
defaulthe
default Burmese service became the first international broadcaster on the mobile platfor
defaultm in Burma through the launch of daily audio bulletins, as well as SMS bulletins.

defaultTransfer to the licence feedefault&#xa0;defaultBBC WS is now looki
defaultng ahead to more stable funding and the benefits of greater integration with BBC News, as a result of the transfer to the licence fee on 1 April 2014. It will join BBC Monitoring which has been funded by the licence fee since 1 April 2013.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 25 June 2013
default the BBC Trust published its draft Operating Licence for the World Service, 
defaultsetting out its strategy for World Service in the licence fee, 
defaultfor public consultation. Further context was provided in the accompanying Position Paper “
defaultBBC World Service – A licen
defaultce fee funded service
default”.
default The Trust is currently assessing the feedback received during the consultation and will publish its responses in due course. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe draft Operating Licence defines the Objectives, Priorities and Targets (as agreed with the Foreign 
defaultSecretary), scope of services, funding and performance measurement of the World Service under the licence fee. Any significant change to the Licence will require the approval of the BBC Trust.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Policy Position paper makes it clear that the World Servic
defaulte 
defaultwill 
defaultbe an integral part of the BBC News operation, which provides independent and impartial news and analysis to UK and global audiences. Most importantly, the paper states that the Trust will ensure that the distinctive service offered by the World Ser
defaultvice is protected, and enhanced. The impact of the World Service will not be diminished as a result of an administrative change in funding. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Trust also announced its plan to increase funding for World Service to £245m in 2014/15 (in the 2013/14 financ
defaultial year the total grant from the UK Government for World Service is £238.5m). Under the terms of the Operating Licence, any planned or actual change in the licence fee-funded content and distribution budget of more than 
default10% in real value will be regarded 
defaultas a significant change and require approval from the BBC Trust. The Trust also proposed that in addition to its licence fee budget, World Service should seek non-licence fee sources of funding (including commercial funding) where appropriate and within re
defaultgulatory requirements.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 8 October 2013 the Director-General of the BBC shared his ambition for the BBC. Reflecting the importance and value of the World Service, the announcements included an ambition to double the BBC’s global audience by 2022 from 250
default million users a week to 500 million.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWithin the BBC Executive, the ‘1414 Programme’ has been created to ensure that all aspects of the transition of the World Service to licence fee funding are addressed. The programme is considering ways of integrating the World Service to ensure maximum val
defaultue for licence fee payers and putting a future strategy in place which offers the best possible service to global audiences. The programme is also considering appropriate accountability and regulatory regimes, working with Government where necessary. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThi
defaults programme is progressing to schedule. James Harding, Director News and Current Affairs, assumed the role of Executive Sponsor from September 2013.
