default2. Although the draft bill involves some matters of substance about prisoner voting rights about which there is reasonable room for disagreement, these are far less significant than the implications of the current stand-off between the House of Commons and the European Court of Human Rights for the future of democracy in the UK. Whatever the merits, the House of Commons already has made its views about prisoner voting known by an overwhelming majority supported by leading opinion in each of the two main political parties. The only real issue now at stake is whether Parliament is prepared to bend to the dictates of the Strasbourg court.
default&#xa0;
default3. If Parliament gives way, this may have fundamental and damaging consequences for our democracy.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the constitutional field, decisions on narrow matters of substance may have far-reaching consequences. One need only to look to the experience of the United States. It was by its decision on a case so minor and so obscure that even scholars struggle to remember what it was about that the US Supreme Court staked its claim to review and to declare invalid legislation enacted by the Congress. That

default&#xa0;
defaultabout the validity of a presidential appointment of a Justice of the Peace
default&#xa0;
defaulthad huge and arguably disastrous results a half century later. In 1857, the US Supreme Court used the authority it had acquired to gave a verdict in a case on slavery (
defaultDred Scot v Sandford
default) which made civil 
defaultwar virtually inevitable. It declared that the elected US legislature had no authority to ban slavery anywhere in the country.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf the UK Parliament cedes to the Strasbourg court the right to overturn its legislation without the possibility of any recourse, it opens itself to the likelihood that sooner or later Strasbourg will use that very right to challenge our country's elected representatives on fundamentally important issues. The necessarily vague wording of the European Convention on Human Rights gives the body empowered to have a final say over their meaning almost unlimited powers.
default&#xa0;
default4. At the heart of the matter under consideration is a double issue of the basic architecture of our democracy. One part of the issue is the relationship in a democracy between senior judges and legislators - that is, the relationship at a national level between senior UK judges and Parliament. This is thorny enough. But there is a second part: the relationship between Parliament and a court which deals with cases brought by individuals in nearly 50 different countries.
default&#xa0;
default5. At the national level, we have been witnessing years of growing judicial assertiveness culminating in controversial statements by several senior judges which call into question the fundamental constitutional doctrine of Parliamentary Sovereignty. Certain judges envisage hypothetical circumstances in which the UK judiciary might challenge Parliament.
default&#xa0;
defaultThankfully, these statements appear to have little or no immediate relevance.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn practice, the judiciary accepts the provision of the Human Rights Act of 1998 which permits Parliament to disregard a judicial "declaration of incompatibility". In other words, if the UK Supreme Court rules that a UK law conflicts with their interpretation of the 
default&#xa0;
defaultEuropean Convention rights incorporated into our law by the Human Rights Act, Parliament may override the judges and retain the law in question notwithstanding the judges' views. In practice, Parliament is most unlikely to use this power of override but the existence of such a power of last resort is essential if the elected legislature is to retain its legitimate role as the lawmaker elected by the voters.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is significant that the Canadian legislature retains a similar power to override judicial decisions. In the United States system, the democratic recourse against the Supreme Court takes a different form: namely, the possibility of amending the US Constitution, of increasing the number of judges to allow the appointment of extra judges more amenable to the political views of the President, and the power of the Senate to refuse to accept presidential nominees for federal court judgeships.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThus, there are existing constitutional mechanisms in the UK and elsewhere to ensure the coexistence of two fundamentals of a constitutional democracy: respect for the rule of law and respect for the ultimate power of the elected legislature to make and change laws.
default&#xa0;
default6. It is at the international level that a new and untested judicial system has developed. Because of the novelty of the system, too little thought has been given to whether the checks and balances between legislature and judiciary which are in place in democracies at the national level are replicable for international courts such as the European Court of Human Rights. (The work of the Court of Justice of the European Union at Luxembourg also raises serious questions but arguably in a 
defaultsomewhat more
default restricted field.)
default&#xa0;
defaultPut simply, Parliament may disregard the judgement of the UK Supreme Court that a UK law or administrative decision is incompatible with its interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, any person who has won a case involving such rights in the British courts may also take the same case to the Strasbourg court. If the Strasbourg court reaches the same view as the UK Supreme Court, Parliament appears to have no similar right of override.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultNegotiation of such a right must now be the British objective. For it is only by doing this that the UK will be able to accept the jurisdiction of the Strasbourg court and still retain its status as a national democracy. For democracy requires acceptance of the ability of the elected legislature to make and unmake laws.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis point is so central that it needs to be developed. The four next numbered paragraphs will deal with
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7. It is commonly but wrongly presumed that assertiveness by the UK legislature in its refusal to comply with the Strasbourg judges over the current British ban on prisoner voting must weaken the European Court of Human Rights. The opposite may be argued (and, indeed, seemed to be accepted by one of its judges in a meeting with the 
defaultlead 
defaultauthor).
default&#xa0;
defaultIf the European Court of Human Rights is to develop as a legitimate international institution, it must sooner or later resolve the underlying issue of its consistency with democratic norms. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe is possibly a useful forum (though that optimistic view is not shared by all at the Council of Europe itself). However, it is not a substitute for, or an equivalent of a directly elected national legislature.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn reality, democracy and democratic accountability exist only at a national level. Therefore, an international institution such as a court will be effective and permanently acceptable only if it takes care to avoid undermining democratically-elected national legislatures.
default&#xa0;
defaultA system under which national legislatures retain a power of last resort to override decisions of the European Court of Human Rights will thus strengthen it.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is frequently argued that a refusal by Westminster to obey the Strasbourg ruling on prisoner voting will encourage countries such as Russia to disregard its rulings too. This is dubious and artificial pleading. Many counties already disregard Strasbourg rulings regularly. If the UK legislature overrides Strasbourg on an exceptional but principled basis while routinely complying, this will give a good example.
default&#xa0;
default8. Some have suggested that the best way to avoid clashes between the UK and the Strasbourg court is to negotiate with the Council of Europe, the parent body of the court, to provide the UK with a greater "margin of appreciation". This means that final authority will be left with Strasbourg but that Strasbourg will provide informal assurances that it will treat 
defaultBritish political concerns and the verdicts of the UK Supreme Court seriously. This approach was the basis of the Brighton Declaration of April 2012.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe approach does not address the fundamental question of where final authority over the interpretation of European Convention rights lies. The Strasbourg judges may treat the UK with respect but, while they retain final jurisdiction, this cannot be guaranteed. Even if the Strasbourg judges act warily while their authority remains under attack, there can be no certainty that they will do so in coming decades. The basic structure of political authority cannot safely be decided on the basis of restraint and goodwill alone. If the UK Parliament is to retain the power of the final say, it must do so by right.
default&#xa0;
default9. With regard to the doctrine of Parliamentary Sovereignty, it has been argued (for example by the Deputy Registrar of the Strasbourg court and by prominent scholars at University College, London) that unquestioning and permanent obedience to Strasbourg is consistent with Parliamentary Sovereignty since it was the House of Commons itself which agreed in 1994 to accept Protocol 11 of the European Convention ceding jurisdiction to Strasbourg. According to this view, the doctrine of Parliamentary Sovereignty is sufficiently protected by the ability of the UK to renounce the European Convention treaty.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is bogus pleading.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFirst, the process whereby the House of Commons accepted the essential Protocol was hardly adequate in view of the huge stakes involved. The matter was not even debated. It was accepted on the nod according to the routine procedures whereby obscure treaties are placed before Parliament and accepted without discussion.
default&#xa0;
defaultSecond, even if it is assumed that the Parliament of 1994 accepted Protocol 11, it was not in a position to commit future Parliaments. The overwhelming House of Commons vote on 10 February 2011 on the prisoner franchise made it evident that the post 2010 House of Commons is not content automatically to adhere to Strasbourg rulings.
default&#xa0;
defaultThird, the argument that the UK Parliament freely accepts Strasbourg dominance is inconsistent with the warnings - often by the same advocates - that any attempt by the UK to renounce the jurisdiction of Strasbourg would lead to "catastrophic" results for the UK. These include not only the status of an international pariah but the need to leave the Council of Europe and the European Union.
default&#xa0;
default10. At a practical level, we are seeing something of a phoney war of nerves against the House of Commons. Apart from the threats that have been mentioned, prisoner franchise lobbyists warn of the prospect of fines in the event of the UK's maintaining the legal status quo.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is considerable room for doubt about this. Even if Strasbourg were to impose a series of fines, that would be a small price to pay for maintaining the "final say" of the Westminster Parliament or, in other words, to maintain our democracy.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn fact, there is strong evidence - some of it from senior level private talks - that Strasbourg will wish to negotiate with the UK rather than to threaten it following a confirmation by Parliament of a blanket ban on prisoner voting. After Parliament persists in its view that it does not wish to comply with Strasbourg's final ruling on prisoner voting, the next stage will be a series of talks involving the UK Government and the Committee of Ministers of the 
defaultCouncil of Europe. This is a body consisting of representatives from all member governments.
default&#xa0;
defaultSuch negotiations with the Committee of Ministers will provide a good opportunity to re-examine the relationship between the European Court of Human Rights and member states. The deal which, it may be hoped, may emerge will be to the advantage of the Strasbourg judges and also to the benefit of member states. For Britain and other member states, the desired reform will be the right of legislative override of court decisions. The national procedures required for such an override will be sufficiently arduous to ensure that it is used only in exceptional circumstances and that it will concern verdicts bearing on general matters of policy ("judicial lawmaking"). For the Council of Europe, the potential benefit will be the tightening of procedures to ensure that all member states implement all normal judgements - that is, decisions not subject to legislative override.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe further benefit of talks with this agenda is that such a deal will meet fundamental UK public and parliamentary objections to aspects of the current system without requiring the UK to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the Strasbourg Court.
default&#xa0;
defaultWere such talks to prove counter-productive and were the UK then to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the Strasbourg court, it is claimed by UK supporters of the court that this action would lead to the expulsion of the UK from the Council of Europe and from the European Union. The 
defaultlead 
defaultauthor examined this argument in detail during the preparation of his study for Policy Exchange titled 
defaultBringing Right Back Home
default. The research included high-level interviews in the UK and in Strasbourg. The subject arose again in the margins of the work of the Commission on a Bill of Rights. For reasons outlined in 
defaultBringing Rights Back Home
default, the "catastrophic consequences" argument was found to be flawed and redolent of scare tactics.
default&#xa0;
default11. Experience of the work of the Commission on a Bill of Rights brought home forcefully the persistence of a number of pressure groups and lawyers associated with them. Repetition of standards arguments tends to substitute for dispassionate examination of them and of evidenced-based research. This memorandum will not address many of these arguments. It will conclude in numbered paragraphs 12 and 13 with two points about the substance of the prisoner voting debate and will restate the conclusion in paragraph 14.
default&#xa0;
default12. It has been argued that a legislature elected by a pool of electors from which prisoners are excluded cannot reasonably be expected to decide fairly on the issue of admission of prisoners to the franchise. Where an excluded group is large, this argument has force. For example, when women did not possess the franchise, the decision about granting it was made by a legislature selected by only half of the population. In the case of prisoner voting in the United States, the number of prisoners is so considerable and the number of blacks is so disproportionate among the prison population that the Congress elected by the existing electorate may be considered to have a bias on the subject. However, the size of the prison population in the UK is far too small to make this a significant factor in its decision on the prisoner franchise.
default&#xa0;
default13. The crucial principle of 
defaultfree and democratic elections
default&#xa0;
defaultis embodied in the European Convention on Human Rights and in other international conventions. However, there is a considerable range of electoral rules in advanced democracies. One size fits all countries is an unjustified, unnecessary and counter-productive approach. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultInternational bodies have potentially great value as forums for the detailed exchange of experiences and ideas about aspects of electoral law and administration. But it is inappropriate for them to seek to micro-manage the electoral procedures of sovereign states. The judgement that a blanket ban on prisoner voting is inconsistent with Protocol 1 of the European Convention is a clear example of attempted micro-management and judicial over-reach. Some senior officials within the Strasbourg bureaucracy acknowledge their underlying desire to create greater uniformity among the practices of European states.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn general
default, international organisations
default&#xa0;
defaulthave too 
defaultlittle regard for and knowledge of the particular circumstances and cultures of individual countries. It is tempting for international bureaucracies to seek to attach their names to codes and standards simply as a means to advertise themselves and to consolidate their operational budgets. Moreover, such bureaucracies tend to have symbiotic relationships with lobby groups which also aim to increase their roles and funding. International courts share these characteristics.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe case for regulation of the details of electoral arrangements in sovereign countries by international bureaucrats and international judges is weak. It is significant that the Inter-American Court of Human Rights claims no jurisdiction over electoral rules within its member countries. In the case of the franchise in UK elections, the marginal limitations on the universal franchise which have been accepted practice in the UK were specifically protected at the time the European Convention was drawn up.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0;
defaultMention of these subsidiary points in paragraphs 13 and 14 should not be a distraction from from core argument of this memorandum. In conclusion, the issue at stake is that of jurisdiction and that the House of Commons would be ill-advised to cede such jurisdiction. The decision on whether or not prisoners should be given the franchise is one for members of the legislature and, primarily, for those elected by the people to decide according to their judgement and conscience. Implied threats should be disregarded.
