[normal]Written evidence from Daphne Havercroft (GMC0014)[bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]My name is Mrs Daphne Havercroft. I am a member of the public. During the period 2007 to 2010, when fundraising for a NHS Trust Hospital Cancer Unit, I became the recipient of unsolicited public interest disclosures from an associate medical director working for the Trust.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The matters which caused concern to this doctor and some of his colleagues related to standards of patient safety at a neighbouring NHS Trust. This Trust commissioned an Inquiry into them after they were exposed by the media in 2009. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following publication of the Inquiry a number of doctors were referred to the GMC by several doctors. I also made some referrals. None of the complaints resulted in Fitness to Practise Hearings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My perception is that there is a considerable lack of professional and public confidence in the GMC as an effective regulator of doctors. One of the main reasons is that the GMC is perceived as failing to treat whistleblowers seriously. The purpose of this written evidence is to provide an overview of the GMC's handling of my complaints in order to illustrate why many believe that the GMC still has much work to do before it becomes trusted as a regulator. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.[bold] The GMC initially declined to investigate my complaints on the grounds that matters had already been investigated by the locally commissioned Inquiry. I provided evidence to prove that this was not correct. For example the Inquiry did not investigate the reasons for failings of clinical governance by medical directors and other senior clinicians. I formed the opinion the GMC expended more effort finding reasons not to investigate the complaints than impartially and objectively reviewing the information provided before making a decision. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold] I provided documentary evidence to the GMC that the doctor who had disclosed patient safety concerns to me stated that he and his colleagues were “scared” and “frightened” to raise concerns through proper channels. The GMC appeared disinterested. As far as I am aware it did nothing to investigate why the doctors were scared and why an associate medical director resorted to whistleblowing to me instead of insisting that his medical director took the concerns seriously. I have seen no evidence that the GMC is leading the way to promote a culture where doctors are empowered to raise concerns about patient safety without fear of retribution from their medical directors. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold] Many of the responsible officers who perform revalidation of hospital doctors are medical directors, yet I have observed that when they suppress whistleblowers and put patients at risk of unsafe care, they do so with impunity, free of proper scrutiny and regulation by the GMC. I believe doctors at this level are untouchable. The GMC seems too intimidated by them and their lawyers to regulate them. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold] My experience of the GMC's complaints process is that it lacks openness and transparency. These are some examples:

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.[bold] At the Committee's 2012 Accountability Hearing Professor Sir Peter Rubin said that the GMC is the most transparent regulator in the world. He said that where a doctor's practice is impaired the information is on the GMC website. 
[normal]This is not entirely correct. The GMC's website shows only information about doctors whose cases have been reviewed by an Interim Orders Panel or a Fitness to Practise Panel. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.[bold] 
[normal]When a doctor's practice is impaired leading to them undertaking “remedial” action, my experience is that the GMC conceals this information from patients and the public. In the case of two doctors about whom I and others complained, one was the subject of serious allegations relating to a particular aspect of their work going back to at least 2004. Their employer finally stopped them from undertaking this work in 2010. This information only emerged in a response from Foundation Trust regulator Monitor to a Freedom of Information Request. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.[bold] Another doctor who was the subject of similar allegations going back to at least 2004 undertook “remedial” action, whatever that means.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. [bold]Last year the Committee told the GMC that it believed the arrangements for informing patients of circumstances where a doctor has been required to undertake remediation measures are not sufficiently clear. It recommended that the GMC clarified the procedures as a matter of urgency.
[normal]9.[bold] My experience is that the GMC has no arrangements for informing patients when a doctor has been required to undertake remediation. It has refused to make public the answer to a question raised by the Department of Health in 2010 as to whether the doctors about whom I and others 
[normal]made complaints have been reviewed by the National Clinical Assessment Service (NCAS) as part of remedial activity.
[normal]10.[bold] The GMC regards it as an infringement of the doctors' privacy to answer the question. The identity of the doctors is already in the public domain, in the Inquiry Report commissioned by their employer. The GMC seems not to appreciate that if the doctors had been reviewed by NCAS, it would provide some reassurance to patients and the public that they were being properly regulated.
[normal]11.[bold] By concealing this information from patients and the public the GMC has left a cloud of uncertainty over the professional competence and commitment to patient safety of the doctors and the extent to which they are being properly revalidated and regulated.
[normal]12.[bold] When it closes complaints the GMC resorts to the usual regulator speak 
[normal]“I appreciate that you are likely to be disappointed........”
[normal] Disappointment can only occur when an expectation is not met. From the outset I had little expectation that the complaints I and others made to the GMC would ever proceed to Interim Order Panel or Fitness to Practise Hearings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.[bold] The GMC's inability to proceed with hearings against doctors implicated in the serious failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust illustrates its serious shortcomings as a regulator of doctors. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14. [bold]The GMC's public statement on the matter says that: 
[normal]‘The decisions reached in these cases were about the lack of evidence against these doctors and the quality of evidence must always be the foundation of any cases we take forward.”
[normal] 
[normal]I question whether the GMC explored whether the Police could have assisted it in obtaining evidence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.[bold] The GMC notes: 
[normal]“there is a separate and wider issue with the current legal arrangements under which we operate, and we are currently working with the Department of Health to see what more can be done to increase appropriate accountability when things go wrong. In particular we have been exploring a number of changes to our powers to make our fitness to practise procedures more effective. We want to be able to hold doctors to account where they have harmed patients or put them at risk, even if they have subsequently shown insight and can claim they are no longer a risk to patients.” 
[normal]Unless the GMC is able to do this I do not believe it will ever be trusted as a regulator of doctors. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I thank the Committee for the opportunity to provide written evidence to inform its 2013 Accountability Review with the GMC and hope that it assists in identifying some of the main issues which are important to patients, the public and many doctors.
