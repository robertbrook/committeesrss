defaultndustries and Governmen
defaultt to engage in a joined up way 
defaultto boosting the growth and
default competitiveness of the creative industries.
default T
defaulthe

defaulthas identified talent and skills as one of the key areas where
default there are barriers to growth facing the sector
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.4 Creative Skillset has had a long and positive partnership with the BBC which involves t
defaulthe corporation at different levels: governance, research and consultation on training solutions, training funds, qualifications, accreditation of courses, industry clusters across the UK. A summary of the main areas of this partnership is outlined in Appen
defaultdix 2, with some recent examples of our joined work. The BBC contributes financially to the core bu
defaultdget of Creative Skillset, and 
defaultto the TV Freelance Training Fund. It also invests directly 
defaultin
default the workforce engaged by the corporation through the BBC Academ
defaulty, its training division, and co-invests by offering Apprenticeships. Both Creative Skillset and the BBC are part of the Creative Industries Council and BBC Academy is part of the CIC Skills group, as well as its sub-groups. 
default&#xa0;
default1.5 Creative Skillset’s partn
defaultership with the BBC is formally described in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which was signed in June 2007, f
defaultollowing the new terms of the BBC Charter and Framework Agreement. 
defaultThe BBC/Creative Skillset MoU has had a positive impact in driving forward t
defaulthe partnership and Creative Skillset recognises the excellent work and efforts by the current director of BBC Academy (established in 2009) to fulfil the BBC obligations 
defaultand to develop the partnership
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCharter and Framework Agreement
default2.1 In the process of the 2007 Charter Renewal, DCMS had a wide and open consultation with the industry; one 
defaultclear message that e
defaultmerged was the
default fact that t
defaulthe ability to produce high quality, innovative UK-originated content relies heavily on the ability of the people working in the UK creative media industries to have the talent, skills and capacity to deliver it. 
defaultThis meant that 
defaultin order for the
default BBC
default to fulf
defaultil its
default commitment to quality
default content that delivers
default the best service to its audiences 
defaultit needed to make a commitment to supporting the skills 
defaultand talent development of
default its people and of
default the wider industry, especially as
default the BBC was 
defaultnow 
defaultincreasing its 
defaultcommis
defaultsioning of content 
defaultoutput 
defaultthrough
default third parties
default. 
defaultThe 
defaultDCMS 2005 Green Paper on the Review of the BBC’s Royal Charter concluded that the BBC “plays a crucial role in training the industry and developing new technology and those
default functions should be sustained”
default; and continued (paragraph 7.3, page 83):
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultThe BBC should continue to provide training on a significant scale. Its training function
default 
defaultshould not be seen only as a by-product of its role as a large employer. In preparing and
default 
defaultmaintaining a highly-skilled med
defaultia workforce, the BBC’s training programmes make a
default 
defaultsignificant contribution to its public purpose of stimulating creativity. We also welcome the
default 
defaultcontribution the BBC makes to the development of training across the industry more widely –
default 
defaultin particular throu
defaultgh Skillset, the sector skills council
default for the audiovisual industries
default.”
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Green paper also quotes from the
default Neil Report on h
defaultow to strengthen BBC Journalism
default: 
default“as the largest employer of journalists in the UK, the BBC has an obligation to take the lead 
defaultin strengthening training in craft skills and promoting debate about journalistic standards and ethics in broadcasting”.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default2
default From the BBC’s current Public Purposes listed in its Char
defaultter the following three are most
default relevant to this Agenda:
default(a) sustainingdefault citizenship and civil society -  default(incl.default 
default“
defaultthe need to promote media literacy”default)
default(defaultb)promoting education and learning;default(c)stimulating creativity and cultural excellence;default(d)representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities;default&#xa0;

default The BBC Framework Agreement
default 
default (with new additions to reflect BBC’s wider industry role) 
defaultstipulates: 
default default“default84. Trainingdefault(1) The Executive Board must make arrangements for the training and retraining of BBC staff engaged in connection with providing any of the
default UK Public Services or making programmes for inclusion in any of those services.
default(2) The training and retraining provided under the arrangements must make an effective contribution to—
default(a) the promotion of the BBC’s Public Purposes, and in particular that 
defaultof stimulating creativity and cultural excellence;
default(b) the preparation and maintenance of a highly-skilled media workforce across the audiovisual industry; and
default(c) competitiveness and productivity in that industry.
default(3) The Executive Board shall use its bes
defaultt endeavours to work in partnership with others in the audiovisual industry in the planning and provision of training and retraining across that industry
default.
default”
default&#xa0;default2.
default4
default The Agreement
default also makes arrangements for reporting on th
defaultese activities to the BBC
default Trust:
default“85. General provisions about arrangements made under clauses 83 default[Equal Opportunities]
default and 84 default[Training]
default(1) The Executive Board must—
default(a) take appropriate steps to make those affected by arrangements made under clauses 83 and 84 aware of them;
default(b) review 
defaultthose arrangements; and
default(c) (at least once each year) make a report to the Trust on the current operation and effectiveness of the arrangements.
default(2) After the Trust has received such a report from the Executive Board, it must publish its observations on 
defaultthe current operation and effectiveness of the arrangements.”
default&#xa0;
default2.5 
defaultThe Executive Board reports to 
defaultthe Trust annually
default on the provisions of
default all
default the above 
defaultsections
default.
default 
defaultThe Trust then presents a commentary that sets out the Trust's observations on the 
defaultExecutive's arrangements over
default the BBC's financial year. Our observation on the BBC report to the Trust is that it does not link to analysis of the level of skill gaps, shortages and needs that the BBC has for its own staff and freelancers – or for the need
defaults
default of the broader industry, although there is good work delivered.

default 
defaultThe BBC Putting Quality First Strategy Review
default 
default(2010) 
defaultma
defaultde
default a very clear connection between obligations to training and its public purposes: 
default&#xa0;
default“Working for the BBC from now on will mean constant new opportunities but also constant change. The BBC can and must offer everyone who works for it the best tr
defaultaining and career development in world broadcasting, and an unrivalled creative space in which to do their best work. At a time when others in the industry are being forced to curtail their investment in training, the BBC should maintain its financial comm
defaultitment here at £45m per year and share the fruits of that investment with the wider industry: training staff who may go on to work elsewhere, and providing face-to-face training direct to freelancers and industry organisations. Working with the rest of the
default industry to provide training is a key partnership role for the BBC, and part of its mission to act as a catalyst within public space.”
default&#xa0;
default2.7 BBC continued to recognise the 
defaultc
defaultonnection with its public obligations in their 2010 and 2011 reporting on Training
default to the BBC Trust
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthey focused BBC Academy
default (set up in 2009)
default on delivering skills in five key areas that “underpin the BBC’s strategic agenda, which in turn support the BBC’ Public Purposes”: Standards; Creativity; Digital; Multi-skilling; Leadership. More
default importantly, the BBC recognises that “we can no longer treat these priorities in isolation”. They recognise that meeting the BBC’s Network Production targets (for the Nations and Out-of-London too), depends on developing a sustainable creative sector to 
default“
defaultproduce highly trained talent pools around the UK”. 
defaultThis is not just about investment in production but also in the human capital that will develop and create content of the highest quality in these areas. It is about investing 
defaultmore i
defaultn the workforce and sk
defaultills base of the UK Nations and English r
defaultegions and building sustainable 
defaultcompanies.
default As the BBC puts it: “this means that achieving Network Production targets is reliant on our ability to help train the wider broadcasting sector across the whole of the UK”.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.8 D
defaultiversity in the industry is an area that the BBC acknowledges the need to act in partnership with the rest of the industry. Director of Television Danny Cohen’s article in Broadcast and the discussion from the industry panels during the 
defaultrecent 
defaultDiv
defaultersify event at BAFTA on 21
defaultst
default November
default 2013
default point to a realisation that more should be done and training can play a key role.
default 
defaultThe BBC also has obligations in
default the Framework Agreement at section 
default83
default on promoting Equal Opportunities. 
default&#xa0;
default2.9 
defaultTraining is also referenced in the 
defaultthree reports
default since 2007 
defaulton the economic impact of the BBC (by Deloitte in 2010 and by the BBC in 2011 and 2013)
default; Deloitte’s report in particular calculated the additional value of the BBC’s training contribution: “the ec
defaultonomic impact of the BBC in 2008/09 estimated that the value of BBC training offered to other media organisations benefitted the creative industries by £59m each year through improved productivity
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.10
default The new Director General of the BBC recently descr
defaultibed his vision and strategy for the corporation. We were very pleased to hear his commitments and assertions on training and skills development, and in particular we are delighted to hear about the BBC’s commitment to increase its intake of Apprentices. W
defaulte hope that the evidence that we submit will be helpful to the BBC in framing their thinking going forward
default about all parts of the agenda and skills and training needed to support strategic needs
default. The work that they do in the area of training and skills is 
defaultexemplary and one of their most significant contributions to the UK creative industries as a public service broadcaster.

default issues 
defaultin the wider industries
default2.1

default The C
defaultreative Industries Council
default has recognised that the talent and skills of the people working in the UK Creative Industries is integral to the success and competitiveness of the sector. This Committee has also heard

defaultCr
defaulteative Skillset 
defaulthas an over-arching r
defaultesearch 
defaultprogramme
default which involves census and workforce surveys, and employer panels whose contributions are
default regularly 
defaultsurveyed and analysed to conclude on current and future
default skills gaps, needs and issues. 
defaultAccess to 
defaulttraining is harder for freelancers and the creative media sector has a
default high proportion of freelancing, 
defaultwhich is more
default prevalent in those areas most closely involved in the production process. In particular in TV,
default for example, there are a lot of SMEs in the 
defaulti
defaultndependent production
default 
defaultwhich
default employs the most people followed by 
defaultterrestrial TV
default 
defaultand 
defaultcable and satellite
default. 
defaultThe SMEs are the ones that need
default more support and mentoring in developing their business and their staff - o
defaultnly 33% of TV employers have a learning and 
defaultdevelopment plan in place
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.13
default 
defaultDiversity remains a priority for the creative media industries since content needs to reflect the more disaggregated and global marketplace. However, with just 5.4% from a BAME background, 36% women and 1% disabled the ind
defaultustries are well below the national employment averages. 
default&#xa0;
default2.14 
defaultLinked to diversity, fair access to the creative industries is also key
default with around two fifths of the workforce being forced to work unpaid in order to get into the industry and many securing recruitment through informal channels. For example, 
defaultaround two fifths (38%) of the TV workforce have undertaken unpaid work within the 
defaultCreative Media Industries (excluding an occasional charitable contribution).
default&#xa0;
default2.15 Across the creative media, employers have identified the following areas as important for the future of the industry:
default&#xa0;
default2.15 These skills issues and shortages have an impact on
default the industries’ competitiveness. The recent extension of tax reliefs from Film to high-end TV, animation, games and VFX
default (which the BBC is benefiting from)
default has come with the realisation that the opening of such opportunities for inward investment needs to 
defaultcoincide with co-investment in skills and talent development. The HM Treasury Consultation on the tax reliefs asked the industry also to consider “
defaulthow the benefits from the tax reliefs can be utilised to invest in UK skills and talent development
default”; this wa
defaults because 
default“
defaultt
defaulthe Government believes that investment in UK skills and talent development is a critical eleme
defaultnt to sustaining UK production.” In our submission to the HM Treasury consultation we provided evidence of 
defaultsignificant concerns that, 
default“
defaultin specific areas of 
defaultthese sectors,
default the size and strength of the existing skills and talent base is insufficient to cope with the significant amount of additional production activity which is likely to be incentivised by the tax reliefs. Alongside that, th
defaultere is a risk that there would not be a sufficient supply of skilled people to service the additional activity, thereby leading to productions migrating elsewhere and undermining the core drivers of the tax reliefs
default”
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.16 The Government recognised these
default concerns and made provisions in the current Budget for additional support for skills for these sectors, on the basis that it is matched by the industry. T
defaulthis call for industry match
default is part of a wider call for the industries to consider seriously their sk
defaultills challenges and co-invest

default 
defaultIn the light of the needs of the industry, w
defaulte would like the Committee to note that
default BBC investment in training has been declining: after an increase following the new Agreement from £43m in 2007/08 to £44.5m in 2008/09, the trend has been downward from then on; as a result of Delivering Quality First (DQF) a 35% cut was imposed to the ac
defaulttivities of the Academy
default  over three year
defaults – even though there is an intrinsic link
default between delivering quality programmes for the listener/viewer and investing in the training and development of the people that made it
default; their current core BBC funding is th
defaultat of £17.3m for 2013/2014.
default The BBC report on Training to the BBC Trust (2012/13) in July of this year reported
default 
default:
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultFollowing last year’s report, the key challenge set by the BBC Trust was for the Academy to continue to
default 
defaultsupport the BBC as it implements 
defaultits DQF proposals; at the same time as delivering our own 35%
default 
defaultefficiency savings. We were encouraged to meet our commercial targets, despite the tough economic
default 
defaultclimate, and tasked with continuing to deliver an impressive range of training both for BBC staf
defaultf and for
default 
defaultthose in the wider industry.
default&#xa0;
default2012/13 has seen us meet these challenges at the same time as delivering our budget cuts and absorbing a
default 
default45% reduction in London based training accommodation due to the closure of White City. This has
default 
defaultrequired us to 
defaultdeliver transformational levels of productivity improvements and innovation. It has also seen
default 
defaultthe cessation or suspension of highly regarded trainee programmes such as the 
defaultWriters’ Academydefault, the
default 
defaultDesign Trainee Schemedefault and the 
defaultSeries Producer Schemedefault. We have 
defaultalso reduced the BBC’s annual grant to
default 
defaultCreative Skillset by 25% and no longer pay an annual grant of £450k to the National Film and Television
default 
defaultSchool.
default”
default&#xa0;
default2.19 We would like to draw the Committee’s attention that 
defaultthe highly valued 
defaulttraining schemes that ended
default,
default as described in paragraph 2.18
default,
default are in areas of skill needs identified by the industry in paragraph 2.17
default; the
default training schemes
default 
defaultwere
default reskilling 
defaultprofessionals who are already part of the industry’s workforce
default 
defaultand 
defaultthe gaps create
defaultd
default will not be solved with new
default Apprentices
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.20
default 
defaultOn one level this
default has been the
default result of
default a decision on how to spend
default limited resources (License Fee settlement) and efficiency 
defaultsavings for the BBC; however,
default the BBC Academy 
defaultsits within BBC’s HR department, and
default 
defaultt
defaulthe 35%
default cut received, we understand, 
defaultwas one of the higher cuts
default made across the
default HR department
default.
default 
defaultWe note the BBC Trust
default’s
default observation to this report: “We will be looking to ensure that the reduction in the number of courses and trainee programmes will not impact on 
defaultthe range or quality of training on offer in the longer term, nor on the development of the next generation of talent.”
default It is already evident that t
defaulthis cut impacts on frontline training investment not just to the BBC staff, but also to the freelancers 
defaultthat BBC Academy trains and the third-party investment that it delivers the BBC’s obligations on training to the wider industry
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.21
default 
defaultWe are of the view
default that this cut and continued reduced investment will jeopardise the ability of the BBC to fulfil its co
defaultmmitment to its audience, its staff and the wider industry. As we mentioned above, high quality content production is supported by high quality trained and skilled professionals and talent
default. H
defaultowever, the BBC continues to include
default its contribution to training
default as
default ‘overhead costs’
default,
default as part of the HR budget line
default, rather than costs directly linked with
default the fulfilment of its public purposes 
defaultand the
default production 
defaultof its content 
defaultoutput.
default 
defaultWe would like the Committee to consider whether this is indeed the best way to cost

default2.24
default

default Public Purposes on 
defaultp
defaultromoting

defaultThe BBC

default only
default be produced by people who are

defaultBBC

defaulthe 
defaultBBC 
defaultalso
default 
defaultset
defaults
default an example 
default(and a trend) 
defaultfor all Public Service Broadcasters and content developers to follow. 
defaultWe will expect that the BBC in its future form will continue to be the model of a creative employer that invests in and supports the people it engages (employee
defaults, freelancers, talent and craft professionals, managers and executives) as well as the people of the sector that it serves.
default&#xa0;
default3
default.5 
defaultThere are still areas where the industry suffers from skills gaps and
default there are
default issues of fair access and mobility in these in
defaultdustries for people from diverse backgrounds. 
defaultAs
default the single biggest employer in the creative media and in receipt of the License Fee, the BBC has a role to play in addressing talent development and key skills 
defaultissues for the creative economy and also
default be 
defaultaccountable for its contribution.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3
default.
default6
default As above, we answer this on 
defaultspecific public pur
defaultposes: we think that the BBC has made
default a 
defaultbig and 
defaultpositive impac
defaultt and 
defaultcontribution to these purposes
default.
default 
defaultHowever, as 
defaultseen from the evidence 
defaultof
default the BBC’s reporting on its tr
defaultaining obligations, the reduction
default of investment
default in training
default has seen its training budget almost halved in the last three years; this
default will need to be addressed by 
defaultthe co
defaultrporation and the BBC Trust, as it affects frontline delivery of key industry skill needs and could impact on the ability to produce quality content. 
defaultIn our view, the BBC does not calibrate investment towards the analysi
defaults of need.
default&#xa0;
default3.7 We would expect that the BBC Trust will fulfill its obligation on monitoring BBC Training output to consider the industry-wide impact, as it is stated in the Framework Agreement. We would like to remind the Trust that they should consult in
defaultdustry
default-wide
default stakeholders beyond the BBC staff on the BBC Governance decisions on Training, as they are also ones to be affected.
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default 
defaultThe industry will welcome 
defaultconsistency of how 
defaultthe BBC
default’s

defaultvision will be supported by its resource and inv

default9
default We 
defaultwould like to add one

defaultPublic Purpose 
defaultfor the next phase in the life of the BBC
default: 
defaultthe development of talent and skills fo
defaultr the creative media industries. As a distinct Public Purpose, it will have

defaultA
defaults we mentioned before, 
defaultwe would like
default to point the importance for the BBC to maintain investment and interest in the industry-wide training, as a responsibl
defaulte producer and commissioner. The BBC
default uses
default freelancers
default and 
defaultits output includes programmes made by the independent sector, therefore it 
defaultcan
default benefit from the industry-wide skills and tale
defaultnt pool, as well as promote high-quality standards of output.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.10
default 
defaultWe believe that the whole industry should 
defaultinvest in innovation and innovative new technologies. There is a strong business case for that, as the industries themselves are fast changing due to developing technologies. Innova
defaulttion also comes with the need for
default new skillsets, therefore investment in te
defaultchnology should also consider investment in industry-wide training and n
defaultew pathways. In our opinion the BBC should
default play their part in this.

defaultOverviewdefault default&#xa0;
defaultWithin the Creative Skillset’s governance structure, the BBC is represented on our Board, our National Boards in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
default and many of our relevant sector skills councils (see also above)
default&#xa0;
defaultAnne Morrison (Director of BBC Academy) chairs our 
defaultDigital Content and TV Strategy Group
default, chairs our advisory group for Hiive, a Creative Skillset new online platform for p
defaultrofessional devel
defaultopment, and
default sits in the Creative Industries Council Skills Group; the new Director General of the BBC, Lord Tony Hall, is also one of our Patrons.
default&#xa0;
defaultOther BBC staff are involved in other panels and task-and-finish groups which are for qualification and curr
defaulticulum development (i.e. development of Apprenticeship Frameworks, development of Vocational Qualifications and Standards), geographical cluster groups (i.e. Bristol Anchor, MediaCityUK) and Training Provision related groups (i.e. the accreditation of HE c
defaultourses, apprenticeship providers and short courses groups). The BBC also actively contributes to our
default research portfolio and
default participates in our intelligence gathering about the skills needs of the industry. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWithin our partnership work, the BBC contribute
defaults financially to the core budget of Creative Skillset, a
defaultnd 
defaultto the TV Freelance Training Fund. It also co-invests directly through providing Apprenticeships, work experience, trainee positions and internships, and short training events for Freelancers, like
default 
defaultFastTrain
default.
default The BBC also contributes directly to training institutions like the National Film and Television School.
