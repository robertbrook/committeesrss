defaultI am long standing member of the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance and as such I have supported them in their efforts in preserving the green lanes and protecting them from damage and nuisance inflicted by 4x4s and motorbikes.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn recent years with the heavy rainfall the lanes get damaged by this so called recreational activity very severely.
default&#xa0;
defaultI wish to register my support for the following proposals
default&#xa0;
default1. All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic, and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways, and
default&#xa0;
default2. When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI would be grateful if you would kindly make my views known to the Parliamentary committee scrutinising the Deregulation Bill.
