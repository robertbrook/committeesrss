[[[Written evidence submitted by the University of Cambridge (WSC034)]]]Section 1: Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?&#xa0;There are many scholarly articles which address the issue of retention of women in scientific Academia,, and further details can be found in these references. &#xa0;A summary of the most commonly cited reasons include:

[[[&#xa0;]]]Section 2: When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors? &#xa0;Vitae, the national career development organisation for researchers, have published a series of reports on ‘What do Researchers do?’  based on LDLHE (Longitudinal Destinations of Leavers in Higher Education) cohorts, as well as labour market information for doctoral researchers, but a longer follow on for LDLHE  (&gt;3 years post PhD), larger cohorts and additional case studies would be useful.Systematic recording and monitoring of career destinations (particularly of PhD students and postdoctoral researchers) is being implemented by some departments in Cambridge as part of Athena SWAN submissions. This could be co-ordinated at a national level to permit more in-depth statistical analyses and identification of trends.The investment in women’s training may be lost if routes are not found to enable them to re-enter the workforce after career breaks. Many take jobs which do not use their skills because this is all they can find.The University is currently investigating the use of exit interviews/surveys to capture important information on reasons for leaving as well as destination data, particularly for research staff.

[[[&#xa0;]]]Section 3: What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?

[[[&#xa0;]]]Universities must recognise that different actions may be needed to address the specific issues identified at different career stages.  Many of the challenges highlighted in Section 1 of this document are addressed within universities under 5 main themes below. Examples of initiatives underway at the University of Cambridge are reported.&#xa0;Family considerations, particularly caring for young children, can often coincide with a critical stage for academic career development and is a key challenge for women as primary carers.  A lack of flexible working provision, long hours culture and difficulty in achieving a balance between home/family and working lives can lead to many women leaving academic altogether.  The University of Cambridge has introduced a number of measures to support staff, particularly women, including:&#xa0;Institutions must ensure that women receive equal and respectful treatment in the workplace, particularly in disciplines where there is a majority of men and/or a culture that disadvantages women.The University of Cambridge is implementing a number of measures to reflect an inclusive and gender aware culture, including:&#xa0;The provision of visible role models and development opportunities for women can help promote careers in academia.The University of Cambridge has adopted a number of measures to enable the personal and professional development of women staff, including:&#xa0;In order to achieve gender equality to is important to engage both men and women in the agenda, so that challenges are not seen as women’s issues and can be addressed by both sexes.The University of Cambridge delivers annually a wide ranging series of engagement workshops and seminars around relevant topics; for example the myth of meritocracy and unconscious bias, targeted at different groups of staff as well as mixed audiencesIt is vital that institutions and individuals address sectoral and professional responsibilities in promoting science beyond their local environment.The University of Cambridge contributes to this important aspect of promoting women in the sciences in a number of ways, including:Section 4: What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?&#xa0;
