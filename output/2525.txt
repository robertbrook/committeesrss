[[[&#xa0;]]]As a campaigning organisation of blind and partially sighted people, we fight for the rights of people with sight loss in each of the UK’s countries. Our priorities are to:&#xa0;&#xa0;We also provide expert knowledge to business and the public sector through consultancy on improving the accessibility of the built environment, technology, products and services.&#xa0;&#xa0;We are pleased to have the opportunity to provide a submission to the work and pensions select committee in response to the call for evidence for the inquiry into support for housing costs in the reformed welfare system. Our submission will focus on the implications of the new social sector size criteria introduced by the Government in April 2013 (also referred to as “the Bedroom tax” or “Spare room subsidy”).&#xa0;On 27 February 2013, Wayne David MP raised the issue of the social sector size criteria on behalf of his constituents during Prime Minister’s questions:&#xa0;

[[[“Mr and Mrs Goodwin live in the Caerphilly borough. They are both registered blind, and rely heavily ]]]

[[[on their guide dogs, family and neighbours. Life is not easy for them, but from 1 April it will become even more difficult, because they will have to pay the Government’s bedroom tax on the home in which they have lived for 26 years. What justification can]]]

[[[ there be for that?”]]]

[[[Wayne David MP, 27 February 2013]]]&#xa0;Mr and Mrs Goodwin are not alone in facing significant increased difficulties inhibiting their independence as a result of the new size criteria; many blind and partially sighted people have contacted RNIB with deep concerns about the impact of the change, worried that they will be forced into debt or to move to an unfamiliar area where they end up isolated in their home. &#xa0;The Government have accepted that 63 per cent of those affected by the new social sector size criteria will be disabled; roughly 420,000 people. Blind and partially sighted people make up approximately 4% of all disabled people in the UK, so the number of blind and partially sighted people affected can be estimated at 17,000.&#xa0;Rehabilitation training for a person with sight loss is designed to enable that person to live independently in their home and surrounding area and to travel safely to and from work. Being forced to move from that home can create the absurd situation where a person loses their sight, is provided with rehabilitation support, is forced to move property and area and subsequently requires all that training to be delivered again. It is an illogical waste of the financial and personal investment both by the individual and their local authority. &#xa0;Furthermore it could cause unnecessary considerable stress and may mean some blind and partially sighted people are either unable to continue with their current jobs or will need to claim additional funding through Access to Work for taxi fares until they receive mobility training in their new area.&#xa0;Nearly two thirds of people say that because of their sight loss they need help to get out of the house, a figure that will only increase with financially enforced relocations as a result of the new size criteria. This in turn will place further strain on already overstretched social services.&#xa0;

[[[Siobhan, 29]]]&#xa0;The new social sector size criteria risks pushing blind and partially sighted people over the tipping point to a position of serious mental, financial and physical hardship. &#xa0;We also urge the Work and Pensions Select Committee to take into account that blind and partially sighted people may rely on adaptations made to their house or an extra room to store bulky assistive technologies in considering their recommendations for the future of this Government policy. &#xa0;The recent case in Westminster of blind housing association tenant Surinder Lall demonstrates the importance of the spare room for people with sight loss. Assistive technology is vital in maintaining independence both out and about and in the home. However, much of this equipment can be bulky and take up a significant amount of space, necessitating the use of another room for storage. It is unfair for anyone to be penalised for needing more space due to their disability, and we are pleased that the courts recognised this in Mr Lall’s case.&#xa0;Although we believe this policy is an unreasonable burden to place on a blind or partially sighted individual for the reasons outlined above, there is the added factor of the financial implications. &#xa0;It has been estimated from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) impact assessment that disabled people will lose an average of £728 per year on housing benefit. At a time when people with sight loss are twice as likely to live in households with an income of less than £300 a week compared to those with no impairment and two in five people living with sight loss are having difficulty making ends meet (McManus and Lord, 2012) this further financial burden will have an amplified and significant impact. An increased two year discretionary housing payment budget, which the Government are relying on to offset the impact on disabled people, will not provide a long term solution to the impact of this reform, and we know already that it is not covering all those who apply on the basis of their disability.&#xa0;We would like to see the Government take immediate and urgent steps to ensure that people with severe sight loss are made exempt from the new restrictions to reflect their mobility needs. This needs to happen urgently; the Government's proposed review date of March 2015 is too far away for many blind and partially sighted people already going through this process.&#xa0;27 September 2013&#xa0;
