defaultSTEM and gender experts Jan Peters and Sean McWhinnie consider the successes of past measures to improve the retention and advancement of women in academic STEM roles. 
defaultConsideration is given to the impact of past measures, tendencies to reinvent the wheel
default and the UK
default’s
default strategic approach and positioning. 
defaultKey points covered are:
