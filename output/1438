default (Rural Community Council of Essex) is an 
defaultindependent charity
default helping people and communities throughout rural Essex create a sustainable future. We have been working with local community groups, Parish Councils, Village Halls and Community Buildings across Essex 
defaultto address some of the issues they face, 
defaultsince being e
defaultstablished in 1929.
default 
defaultRCCE is an influential voice for rural communities at local and national level. We enjoy strong working relationships with Essex County Council, local District and Borough Councils, and
default DEFRA. 
default As one of England's 38 county Rural Commu
defaultnity Councils, we are a member of ACRE (Action with Communities in Rural England). Together we aim to meet the needs of 11,000 rural communities nationwide.

default1.1 
defaultEssex County Council (ECC) uses Accession mapping software, which uses the latest census data to map access by public transport to key services for both rural and urban areas. ECC holds 
defaultmeetings with commercial operators, key stakeholders and the voluntary sector to identify demand and improve services. Area reviews have been carried out to give a more detailed assessment of needs.  The needs identified for each rural area vary and the re
defaultsulting outcomes reflect this.  For example, weekly Braintree shopper bus services improved access to local market towns.  In the Dengie Peninsula

default 
default[
default*
defaultThe 
defaultDengie Peninsula is a particularly remote and isolated area of rural Essex, 
defaultbounded
default by 
defaultthe sea to the east and the Blackwater and Crouch rivers to the north and south.  The low population density and isolated nature of the area make provision of convention
defaultal bus services difficult, having lost most of its commercial operations since 1985 and the county council increasingly having had to contract services. 
default**
defaultA DRT scheme is a taxi-bus service which operates a core 
defaultroute but can be booked in advance to pick 
defaultup from a passenger’s house from outlying areas. Services can be timetabled or fully flexible within an operating period.
default]
default1.2 
defaultECC have contracted RCCE in the past to conduct 
defaultindependent
default area reviews which included extensive bus passenger surveys. RCCE collated, analysed the results and presented them to ECC, however these contracts have stopped since the council cutbacks.
default2.1 
defaultEssex County Council say w
defaulthen looking at requests for additional services and making decisions over 
defaultreplacing withdrawn c
defaultommercial services, each case is
default considered on its merit and the particular situation of specific service users/groups are considered in reaching decisions on service provision along with costs. 
default 
defaultIn a more general way ECC uses ‘Accessi
defaulton’ accessibility mapping software to identify the ability of people in different groups (employed, elderly registered disabled 
defaultetc.) to access key services ( shopping, e
defaultmployment health and education). They
default use this formation to help shape service decisio
defaultns.
default Again, the independent area surveys conducted by RCCE under contract fed into this process until 2011.
default3.1 
defaultWith regards to
default buses, by their nature isolated rural areas have small populations whose travel needs are not easily aggregated into a financially sustainable commercial bus network. Contracted bus services can easily become unsusta
defaulti
defaultnable 
defaultdue to demographic shifts or rising costs. 
default In addition, i
defaultt is 
defaultmore difficult to manoeuvre
default large buses
default around narrow lanes where potential additional passengers may be (who are unable to get to the main route)
default. 
defaultEven DRT is made less sustainable due 
defaultto the high levels
default of dead mileage and escalating
default fares impacting on demand. Therefore public transport in these areas will always require public funding support in on
defaulte sense or another. Within this
default, kick-starting DRT services ( and thus removing some or a
defaultll of the entry cost barrier to service provision)  is possibly a better approach than long term service purchasing, if sufficient attention is paid to the marketing and organisational structure of the services. Either CT or taxi services can in theory mak
defaulte use of this approach, but in either case an excellent understanding of the potential market and its needs is necessary.
default Flexibility is a key factor, and the ability to call in additional vehicles (as the Essex DRT scheme is run by a taxi company) has pro
defaultved invaluable.
default3.2 
defaultFor rail it is arguable that many of the same arguments apply. There are not enough passengers to make improved rail services economically viable and if they are considered socially necessary, then public funding will be required to keep them going. As the
defaultre is no real equivalent to the DRT 
defaultapproach, 
defaultlong term financial subsidy (
defaulteither directly by service or cros
defaults subsidy through franchising) 
defaultis unavoidable. In its absence,
default Bee
defaultching style cuts are unavoidable. 
default3.3 
defaultConnectivity 
defaultis an important factor, 
defaulte
defaultnsuring services are useful in their timings 
defaultand
default connecting to other bus/rail services
default will attract more users, making services more viable
default. 
defaultThe DRT 5 provides a rail header service, connects with a main route bus service and the other DRT service DaRT 
default99
default.
default 
default3.4 
defaultReliability 
defaultis a key area of concern. S
defaultome operators 
defaultrun
default an unreliable service, either not investing in their vehicles so
default that buses
default regularly breakdown, or not enough staff to cover for absences, 
defaultleaving passengers stranded, and 
defaultleading to potential
default bus passengers using other means of transport (
defaultsuch as a 
defaultcar
default if they have access to one
default, 
defaultwhich can be 
defaultmore costly 
defaultwhen taking
default petrol
default and parking into consideration
default), lifts, taxis
default, walking
default or not making journeys
default at all
default. Other knock on effects are missed ap
defaultpointments eg. medical, costing the NHS. There is little recourse for complaint with commercial
defaultly run
default services. Individual complaints to bus companies hold little sway, the county council has no jurisdiction over 
defaulta commercial
default service, 
defaultand 
defaultpeople are often 
defaultunaware of where else to go to complain.

defaultubsidy is needed to get services

default.
default&#xa0;
default Another 
defaultkey
default issue is competition, while good in the sense of driving forward savings, no sensible operator will risk starting a rural route, where once he/she has developed the trade, 
defaultany competitor
default can just start up alongside, thus diluting the r
defaultoute back to a non-profitable operation
default. 
default Rural PTEs 
defaultcan help 
defaultin this regard, where some control of route licensing is practised.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThis will reduce the need for subsidy in many cases, as operators would then be able to risk running new services to 
defaultr
defaultural co
defaultmmunities, knowing they could one day reap the rewards of the initial investment made.

defaultttended, and invite some influential people to speak and take questions, including 
defaultGiles Fearnley, M

default of First's UK Bus Division
default and Stephen Morris, Deputy Chief Executive of Bus Users UK.
default3.6.2 
defaultThe DRT scheme in Essex has overcome some of t
defaulthe challenges discussed above. Initially the service (DaRT 99) was established in May 2011 to improve access to two h
defaultospitals from the Dengie area. 
defaultThe service offers a fixed link
default 
defaultbetween Maldon, neighbouring Heybridge and Chelmsford
default 
defaulthospital, with a 
defaultdemand responsive service to outlying
default 
defaultvillages in the Dengie Peninsula. It runs between 0600 and
default 
default2100 Monday to Friday. Fares are set above the comparable
default 
defaultbus journey, reflecting the additional convenience and
default 
defaultcomfort of the service and to avoid underminin
defaultg the
default 
defaultcommercial indirect links (involving one or more changes).
default 
defaultConcessionary bus passes are accepted.
default 
defaultThe service received one-off £65,000 ‘kick start’ funding from
default the 
defaultLAA Partnership
default via RCCE
default, following a competitive tender exercise
default 
defaultcarried out by RCCE
default. It has seen increasing passenger use and viability over the
default 
defaultperiod
default and f
defaultrom May 2013, the service 
defaultwent
default fully commercial.
default 
default 
default3.6.3 
defaultThe success of the 
defaultD
default99 
defaultand the expiry of service contracts 
defaultled to the development of another DRT service in the area, 
defaultthe D5,
default which serves the most isolated parishes in the Dengie. 
defaultIt replaced a
default 
defaultconventional bus service which gave 4 off-peak return
default 
defaultjourneys on Monday - Friday and two return journeys on a
default 
defaultSaturday to the local town. DaRT 5 is a fully flexible service,
default 
defaultavailable f
defaultrom 0600 to 2000 Monday - Saturday. All journeys
default 
defaultmust be pre-booked at least one hour before travelling and
default 
defaultpassengers must be prepared to change, as the service feeds
default 
defaultinto other bus and rail services.
default 
defaultThe service was introduced following extensive consult
defaultation,
default 
defaultwhich highlighted a desire for greater choice of times and
default 
defaultdestinations.
default 
defaultThe service was expanded in October 2012 to meet demand
default 
defaultfrom a neighbouring community.
default 
default3.6.4 
defaultPassenger numbers have grown significantly. The 
defaultprevious D5 service
default 
defaultcarried an ave
defaultrage of 5 passengers per weekday and 1.5 on a
default 
defaultSaturday.
default  In July the average number of passengers per day 
defaultwas 59, and the
default cost per passenger is now down to 
defaultaround 
default£3.13p
default. 
default91% of passengers are concessionary travel pass holders. Users are deciding to make m
defaultore use of the service and are
default 
defaultintroducing new customers. For example, a single journey
default 
defaultfrom a Residential Park to the Conservative Club started off
default 
defaultas one person travelling once per week; now there are 4 or 5
default 
defaulttravelling daily. A few of the new users 
defaultpreviously used taxis.
default Some
default commuters use the service from the villages to the
default 
defaultlocal station.
default 
defaultFeedback has been very positive, with specific praise for the
default 
defaultregular driver.
default 
default3.6.5 
defaultThe service allows individuals who were previously isolated
default 
defaultto go out and be 
defaultpart of the community. There are a number
default 
defaultof older people who were unable to walk up the hill to the
default 
defaultnearest bus stop and were therefore unable to access public
default 
defaulttransport. The wide net of the DRT service has removed
default 
defaultthis problem and they are now regular tr
defaultavellers, using the
default 
defaultservice to access shops, medical
default 
defaultfacilities, clubs and social
default 
defaultevents.
default 
defaultOne lady is currently in the situation where she is unable
default 
defaultto drive or walk any distance. The door to door nature of
default 
defaultthe service has been invaluable to her. Anothe
defaultr elderly lady
default 
defaultsaid that previously her family and friends had to do all her
default 
defaultshopping for her; now she can do her own shopping. She said
default 
defaulti
defaultt has “opened up my life again” and has enabled her to choose her own food, improving her diet and consequently her he
defaultalth.
default3.6.6 
defaultConventional buses are often seen as a meeting place by
default 
defaultolder users. One concern of introducing DRT was that there
default 
defaultwouldn’t be the same opportunity to socialise. A pattern of
default 
defaultgroup booking is emerging from elderly people and people are
default 
defaultusing it
default to go out socially.
default3.6.7 
defaultA recent Age UK report highlights the importance of bus
default 
defaulttravel to not only accessing services but to contributing to
default 
defaultthe quality of life for older people
default (
defaulthttp://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/16946/
default)
default. The service may extend
default 
defaultthe time individu
defaultals can live independently, reducing health
default 
defaultand social care costs. This saving is difficult to monetise,
default 
defaultbut the cost of delaying progression to more costly care has
default 
defaultbeen valued at £181 per week (£9,412 per year). The cost
default 
defaultof an individual moving to a care
default home is valued at £27,000
default 
defaultper year. Therefore, If only three people are prevented from
default 
defaultmoving into a care home, then this service will reduce the
default 
defaultoverall cost to the public purse.
default3.7 defaultThe DArT works in the Dengie Peninsula because:default3.8 
defaultThe DaRT has been nominated and shortlis
defaultted for two N
defaultational 
defaultTransport A
defaultwards.
default4.1 
defaultCurrently Essex County Council supports 12 community transport schemes across Essex; most are run as independent charitable organisations, although one is run by a district council and one is currently run in house by Essex County Council.  
default4.2 Community 
defaultTransport schemes provide transport for individuals who cannot access conventional services, whether due to restricted mobility or living in isolated areas not serviced by public transport. The quality of service provided is high, being personalised, flexi
defaultble and reliable. As a result, CT has a very high user satisfaction rating. The annual cost to the council is £1.3 million. 
default4.3 
defaultEssex County Council
default current strategy sees Community Transport as providing a safety net for those unable to access local bus s
defaultervices and thus filling in areas where conventional local bus service provision is not practicable. 
default4.4 Most CT schemes provide a range of services. These include:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDial-a-ride services – demand responsive individual journeys usually carried out by access
defaultible minibuses and often by professional drivers.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSocial Car services – volunteers using their own cars to provide journeys, only receiving expenses in return.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultVehicle Brokerage – working with a range of different organisations to make their vehicles avail
defaultable for group hire during ‘down’ periods
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommunity Buses
default - 
defaultRegistered local bus services, using larger vehicles and in the main paid drivers run under a S
defaultection 
default22 permit, often with a semi DRT element.
default4.5 
defaultT
defaulthe model employed is heavily dependent on the 
defaultuse of volunteers, both to driver and to perform ‘back office’ functions. As schemes grow, an increasing degree of 
defaultprofessionali
defaults
defaultation
default is required to manage the additional complexities of operation and ensure reliability. However, there are limits to how f
defaultar such a business model can grow due to their reliance on voluntary support.  All the schemes struggle to recruit new volunteers; often due to exacting behavioural standards required to allow a person to transport vulnerable people.  
default4.6 Currently Commun
defaultity Transport schemes receive a grant made under Service Level Agreement with ECC and in some cases with district councils
default, which 
defaultset targets for passenger numbers, performance and value for money. 
default4.7 
defaultThe number of passengers travelling using Community T
defaultransport in some districts/boroughs has declined; this is thought to be in part due to the impact of the provision of free transport on local 
defaultbus services. Older passengers, who make up the majority of community transport users, can travel on local buses f
defaultor free.  Though the cost of using community transport is subsidised, charges are 
defaultm
defaultade and passengers would like to be able to use their concessionary pass and travel for free.  Section 22 licences and registered bus services have allowed some of the sc
defaulthemes to introduce travel which is free to the users, being reimbursed by the concessionary fare scheme.
default4.8 
defaultCoverage by CT schemes is patchy – not all areas in need have a service. As schemes are independent there is no consistency in how they run and ope
defaultrate, although some flexibility is useful to account for local needs, a more consistent approach would 
defaulthelp users to better understand and access the services on offer. The fact that some schemes have Section 22 licences and allow passengers to use bus
default pas
defaultses while others don’t make 
defaultit confusing.  Consistent regulation would be 
defaultextremely 
defaultbeneficial
default.
default5.1 
defaultGiven the low number of individuals living in isolated communities providing services commercially is not an option and therefore will always be reliant on the local authority providing financial support for services.  This is not a 
defaultstatutory
default requirement a
defaultnd given the current economic pressures is becoming more challenging.
default5.2 
defaultTaxis are cost prohibitive for many people in isolated areas, plus there may be limited supply in some areas. Nor can concessionary passes be used in taxis. DRT can work very effecti
defaultvely in some areas
default where it is appropriate.
