[[[ (BRC 40)]]]&#xa0;Enclosed is my response to the Committee’s request for information supporting the oral evidence carried out on the 2nd September 2013.&#xa0;Although a majority of members of the public are aware of the competence persons scheme the minority that are not have it enforced when work is carried out such as extensions or if the property is put up for sale so eventually all properties/members of the public will be covered by this scheme.&#xa0;When electrical work is being carried out by a registered contractor the competent person’s scheme is also being enforced and explained to the member of the public which was not being done prior to the Part P Regulation. The works carried out by these registered contractors are ensuring the electrical standards in dwellings are to the correct standard and have therefore increased the electrical safety.&#xa0;The extent of the qualifications the Engineers have carrying out the work again is assessed by the bodies responsible for accrediting the competent person therefore have the same level of skills at the minimum, however the industry does need to support the governing bodies policing the scheme by promoting Part P awareness amongst consumers and specifiers which will enforce the quality of contractors being used by the members of the public.&#xa0;The electrical works carried out by the approved contractors are reviewed to ensure they meet the requirements of the Regulations, although it could be debated if these assessments need to be more in depth and more frequent all the approved contractors certify the works and therefore visibility is available on all works carried out between assessments ensuring full accountability while being assessed.&#xa0;The adequacy of the review and supervision along with the effect of competition between the accreditation bodies is a large factor in the success of the competent person’s scheme. &#xa0;It is important that the governing bodies responsible for the certification of the approved contractors have outstanding integrity and quality awareness, to assist with the awareness of the Part P Regulation it would be more beneficial for the organisations to be well established and renowned within the Industry ensuring Brand awareness to not only members of the public but specifiers and contractors.&#xa0;A single register of electricians should exist making it easier and clearer for consumers and specifiers to understand the requirements and identify an approved contractor. This should assist in the real challenge of eliminating the likes of rogue traders and DIYers, if a single approved electrician register can be produced and promoted this will make it easier for the general public to identify and engage.&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013
