[normal]Thank you for your letter of 6
[normal]th
[normal] December 2013. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My Police and Crime Plan, which is available on the OPCC website (www-wiltshire.pcc.gov.uk) speaks of priorities, objectives and key initiatives.  I have been consistently reluctant to set targets given the inherent problems they entail.  The target for th
[normal]e number of offenders brought to justice is a prime example.  In order to 
[normal]chase
[normal] the target police officers effectively abandoned their discretion in relation to low-level offences.  A generation of younger people was disproportionally criminalised and the 
[normal]criminal justice system creaked under the weight of inappropriate cases.  Similarly, a rigid target to answer non-emergency calls within 30 seconds led inevitably 
[normal]to 
[normal]over stretched call takers dumping calls on inappropriate extensions where the wrong perso
[normal]n answered or no-one answered the calls at all.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There does however have to be some method by which I can judge, and the public at election time can judge, whether we are going in the right direction.  I have therefore set what I term thresholds.  These ar
[normal]e the levels across a range of indicators whe
[normal]re
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal] would expect performance to sit.  They are intended to encourage management and 
[normal]the workforce alike to concentrate on
[normal] the right areas and to 
[normal]do 
[normal]so diligently.  Both I, and the performance team that advises 
[normal]me, are alert to the possibility of counter
[normal]-
[normal]productive performance monitoring.  Along with the Chief Constable, I believe that we are achieving the right balance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As regards the integrity of recorded crime figures, I and my staff have full access to the c
[normal]rime registrar.  We watch crime trends carefully and 
[normal]always consider the possibility
[normal] that a recording practice has varied if we see significant change.  
[normal]I am setting up an independent panel of volunteers to dip sample cases where a re
[normal]solution outside the c
[normal]riminal justice system has been recorded. It may be possible to extend this to a more general check and test of recording policy. However this can only be an additional safeguard and public reassurance
[normal]. We do, in my view, need a robust inspection framework
[normal]. A portion of my budget is spent on audit and inspection, as you will be aware. Whilst I would not be willing to pay more, I believe the auditing of crime 
[normal]recording practice
[normal] should be a core function of HMIC
[normal]. Their resources should be directed far more cl
[normal]osely on this area, unglamorous though it may be. In years past I recall regular national audits for crime recording. Problems that are surfacing in different parts of the country may have been avoided had this regime not been discontinued.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope this is
[normal] of use to you and your members
