"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Aragon Housing Association&#xa0;&#xa0;About the organisationGUHG comprises of 3 subsidiaries: Aragon Housing Association (Aragon), South Northants Homes (SNH) and Macintyre Housing Association (Macintyre).\nThe attached document \n(Appendix 2\n) sets out further details about GUHG.\n&#xa0;Reason for submitting evidenceWe wish to give oral evidence to expand on this submission as the impact of Welfare Reform is complex and the nuances are difficult to convey in 3,000 words. We are also working on producing a report detailing the impact of the reforms six months after the introduction of the under-occupancy charge.  We would hope to present those findings to Select Committee. \n&#xa0;Recommendations&#xa0;&#xa0;Executive summary of GUHG response&#xa0;GUHG \nis working hard to support and encourage \ncustomers into employment and \nwe \nwelcome initiatives to further these aims. GUHG also welcome\ns\n any schemes for reducing under-\noccupancy. However, \nWelfare Reform\n do\nes\n not achieve either of\n these for\n customers in our area. \nHaving examined our extensive data w\ne are making this submission to report \non \nthe impact of Welfare Reform\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe impact of\n Welfare Reform\n is far reaching for \nall housing associations. We have reassessed our risks and revised our business plan.\n The early indications are that rent arrears have gone up. Our customers are struggling \nto meet \nrising costs and are \nhaving to cut\n back o\nn fuel and food to make ends meet.\n \n As a consequence our\n referral\ns for food parcels ha\nve\n doubled.\n&#xa0;\nOur \nopportunities to help customers downsize \nare \nlimited by the \nlack of \nsmaller social housing units. There is also a \nshortage\n of \nappropriate \nhousing in the private sector.\n&#xa0;\nOvercrowding i\ns not an issue in our area\n and the\n demand is for smaller housing units. \nSome\n \nvacated \nthree\n bedroom\ned\n properties are being \nallocated to\n \ntenants with low needs because\n households with higher needs \nno longer \nqualify for them\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nWe are finding that t\nhe grant of \nDiscretionary Housing Payment (\nDHP\n)\n by Local A\nuthorities is masking the impact of \nWelfare Reform\n. At the momen\nt DHP is\n a temporary provision \nand there is a dan\nger that any assessment by the Select C\nommittee will not \naccurately reflect \nthe likely future impact.\n&#xa0;\nWe would be happy to assist the Select Committee and provide a full data report if this is required\n.\n&#xa0;Our new and innovative responses to the changes&#xa0;We have considered a number of innovative ways of assisting our customers to cope with the \nWelfare Reform\n c\nhanges. \n&#xa0;\nOur subsidiary South Northants Homes (\nSNH\n)\n has\n strengthened support provision, doubling the complement of welfare benefits and generic tenancy support officers. Aragon has also appointed welfare benefits advisers and increased its debt and money advice service\n.\n&#xa0;\nSNH has \nbeen involved with the establishment of \na foodba\nnk in Towcester. Aragon \nalso support\ns\n and donate\ns\n to a foodbank project.\n The referrals to foodbanks have doubled for both organisations.\n We do not consider foodbanks to be a good alternative as\n donations are \nlimited to non-perishable food. We would like to see a proper study of the effect on health for people who have a prolonged reliance on food banks.\n&#xa0;\nWe are offering a number of support projects, such as help in getting back into employment, cooking on a budget, confidence courses, computer courses and budgeting courses, all offered on both a\nn individual \nand group basis.\n&#xa0;\nSNH \nwon a Community Impact Award for its Move-In4ward \nskills pr\noject \ndelivered \nto approximately 40 of its\n most v\nulnerable tenants, spread over eight modules.  These looked at\n essential issues such as self esteem, job seeking skills, housing matters, DIY skills, health issues and cooking on a budget.  \n&#xa0;\nBoth organisations have funded and developed c\nredit unions. We are \nenco\nuraging\n our customers to sign up to jam jar accounts, to help \nthem\n manage their money \nbetter, particularly \nonce \nU\nniversal Credit \n(UC) \nis introduced.\n&#xa0;\nWe have become \na \nU\nK\n O\nnline training centre to help our te\nnants to become digitally aware and prepare them to make UC applications \ndigitally and apply for job electronically.\n&#xa0;\nWe are \nwork\ning\n with local partn\ners to set up training \nfor young people leaving care and those who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs).  This training in the installation of kitchens and bathrooms is designed to lead to apprenticeships and work placements. \n&#xa0;\nWe \nare considering\n setting up food growing projects to provide fresh fruit and vegetables.\n However the scope of this project is very limited and will not plug the gap were people are unable to afford fresh fruit and vegetables.\n&#xa0;\nOur stock \nis \nwell insulated with efficient heating systems and we have\n innovated in the provision of solar PV and\n air and ground source heat pumps\n where practical.\n&#xa0;\nWe report these innovative approaches\n with the proviso that we would not want to see these actions being \nused to\n justify the under-occupancy charge because these solutions are not sufficient to help\n all our customers deal with\n the consequences of \nWelfare Reform\n. The work we are doing \ncan only make\n a small \nimpact.\n&#xa0;\nWhat is the impact of the changes on the business?&#xa0;SNH has\n 243 customers\n affected by the \nunder-occupancy charge. Aragon\n \nhad 408 \ncustomers affected\n.  Currently, this has been reduced to 373 \nas some have \nhad\n change of circumstances\n or have moved. \nThose under-occupying are\n mainly \nliving \nin three\n bedroom properties. These properties hav\ne now become much harder to let\n because the demand in both areas is \nnow largely \nfor two\n bedroom properties\n;\n we do not have large families in over\ncrowded conditions waiting for three\n bedroom properties. \nAragon is working with one family \ni\nn overcrowded conditions but they require a \nfive or six\n bedroom property and we are working with the local authority to adapt a suitable property\n for them\n.\n&#xa0;\nA recent analysis of the lettings\n in July 2013\n of three\n bedroom properties in the Aragon stock showed that \nall the properties were let to those with low needs\n and in some cases it took more than one bidding cycle to allocate any household to these properties at all.\n \n&#xa0;\nSNH \ndoes\n not have \nfamilies \nin their stock who \nare affected\n by the benefit cap. Aragon has\n five\n families affected\n.  Of these three\n families are in the process of claim\ning\n DLA/Tax C\nredits whic\nh will exempt them from the cap if they receive an award.\n&#xa0;\nO\nur overa\nll rent arrears have decreased \ndue to increased resource\n provided \nprior to the implementation of Under-O\nccupancy \nCharge \nbut \nthe arrears owed by those affected by the bedroom tax have increased by approximately £13,000\n for SNH\n. For Aragon the rise in arrears among \nunder-occupying\n tenants from 31/03/13 to 22/07/13 was £74,852.80.\n  We have issued Notices of Seeking Possession in \n35\n under-occupying cases.\n&#xa0;\nSNH has\n \napproximately 60 tenants in arrears \nwho\n have never been in arrears before.  \nAragon has seen 72 tenants affected by the under-occupancy charge falling into arrears where they had clear accounts before.\n&#xa0;\nThe\n caseload and referrals to our Welfare Benefits T\neam has increased by 50%\n for SNH\n, all additional cases are due to the d\nirect impact of \nWelfare Reform\n.\n Aragon has appointed \na \nWelfare Reform\n Benefits Adviso\nr \nto cope with increased demand.\n The issue of the lack of other benefits advice is also relevant as \ncuts to Legal Aid funding have\n resulted in difficulty in accessing advice. Both organisations have examples of customers who have under\n \nclaimed benefits considerably. \n&#xa0;\nSNH \nis\n carrying out at least 50% more mutual\n exchanges directly because of \nWelfare Reform\n, which for the tenant is the best way to reduce the impact of the \nunder-occupancy charge\n.  However,\n mutual exchanges are very costly for the organisation, costing on average \nof \n£550 per move.\n&#xa0;\nBoth subsidiaries offer \na moving allowance to people who \nare willing and able to \ndownsize. Without this allowance most of our customers would have been prevented from moving as they had rent arrears. \n&#xa0;\nWhat is the impact of the changes on our customers?&#xa0;SNH has\n been \nsupporting five\n \npeople who have \nbeen \nsubject to \nthe new J\nob Seeker’s Allowance \nsanctions, all of w\nhom\n had to be referred to the foodbank.  Referrals to the foodbank use\nd to be limited to three\n per year\n per \nperson.  This has now been revised to three\n per six months, and will need to be reviewed again due to repeat presentations.\n In August\n 2013\n there \nwere \n14 referrals\n from Aragon to the foodbank\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe sanctions, which have always been in place, are clearly being implemented with far more vigour and with a different interpretation, and it is our understand\ning that those sanctioned in our area have\n increased ten-fold.\n&#xa0;\nThe impact on those who ha\nve disabilities is extreme.  SNH \nhas\n approximately 60 households who are disabled and affected by the bedro\nom tax, many of whom\n live in specifically adapted properties.\n \nIt is practically impossible to transfer these households to smaller properties because of the nature of their disabilities and \nspecific housing need.  As\n such we are trying to find alternatives to keep them in their own homes, such as finding different uses for their ‘spare’ bedrooms, and maximising their incomes, but the real\ni\nty is that for most of these tenants, they w\nil\nl have to find the \nadditional money to cover the housing benefit\n shortfall.\n&#xa0;\nOur Money A\ndvice \nTeam has\n seen an upsurge in both referrals and debt levels, many of whic\nh are directly attributable to \nWelfare Reform\n. Th\ne financial gains for clients are\n twice as high as \nthey were at this point four years ago.  T\nhe amount of referrals has increased by 50% compared to this time last year.\n&#xa0;\nOur work on welfare benefits has highlighted that our tenants are under claiming benefits including Housing Benefit. For example Aragon has \nhelped customers\n claim nearly £79,000 in Housing Benefit alone\n over the last year. The total amount of benefit claimed by Aragon’s customers \nwith our assistance\n \nis nearly £250,000\n.\n&#xa0;\nAnother consequence for tenants who move into the private sector is that they lose services we provide to tenants as a social landlord. Those tenants will not have access to our training and employment\n initiatives which \nhelp\n towards getting people into work and off benefits.\n&#xa0;What impact do we anticipate over the coming months on us as a housing provider?&#xa0;T\nhe amount owed in \nunder-occupancy charge\n arrears and those who find themselves in arrears for the first time because of the \nunder-occupancy charge\n is likely to increase dramatically once the DHP pot \ni\ns exhausted which is likely \nto be in the next \ntwo\n months.  SNH \ncurrently has\n 43 tenants on DHP\n.  Th\nese are our most vulnerable families and once DHP ends they will be at serious risk of losing their tenancies as there is \nno ‘additional’ income\n to cover the shortfall in HB.  \nAragon has 93\n tenants who have received DHP at some point since\n April;\n 52 are currently still in receipt of DHP but most of these awards end in the next two months.\n&#xa0;\nSNH \nhas\n approximately 650 people of working age who will need to migrate from DLA to PIP.  This is a task \nfor\n \nwhich most of our tenants will need support.  On average, a\n PIP claim takes approximately five\n hours to complete\n.  I\nt can take up to an hour to complete the telephone registration alone, so to support as many of our tenants as possible through this migration process will put a huge strain on resources, and there is a real chance that other tenants, who need support with other benefit issues, will need to wait longer for our help and potentially lose out o\nn money they desperately need. \n&#xa0;\nMost of Macintyre\n’s\n \ncustomers \nwho all have learning disabilities (approximately 500 people) \nwill need to migrate \nto PIP\n \nand will\n need support to do this. \nT\nhese customers are\n the least a\nble to deal with the impact of \nWelfare Reform\n changes as all MHA’s clients have a learning disability.\n&#xa0;\nUniversal Credit (UC)&#xa0;Aragon received £32,869 602 last year\n \nof total rent of which \n£8,583,162\n was \nin\n \nHo\nu\ns\ni\nn\ng\n \nB\nen\ne\nf\nit\n \np\na\ny\nmen\nts \nf\no\nr\n \nw\no\nrk\ni\nn\ng\n-\na\ng\ne\n \nclai\nma\nn\nts, \nd\ni\nr\ne\nct\n \nf\nr\no\nm\n \nCentral \nBedfordshire\n \nCo\nu\nn\ncil \nv\nia\n \na\n \nbu\nlk\n \ntra\nn\ns\nf\ne\nr. SNH received £13,188,350 in rent last year of which £6, 198,298 was in housing benefit\n.\n \nWe estimate that the majority of our customers who are not deemed as vulnerable will be paid their benefits directly under the new Universal Credit arrangements, which will include the housing element which is for their rent. \n&#xa0;\nThe concerns around housing costs being included in Universal Credit payments \nare well documented. Tenants who are subject to sanction will lose all their bene\nfits and risk losing their home whereas those being sanctioned currently \ndo not lose Housing Benefit.\n&#xa0;\nWhat impact do we anticipate over the coming months for our customers? &#xa0;In our area the private rented sector is limited and \ninsecure, so the opportunities for people to downsize into this sector are both severely limited and undesirable. \nResearch in this area shows for the area that Aragon operates in (\nCentral  B\nedfordshire), \nthe average private rent for a two\n bedroom property is £156.13 per week, which is £29.18 per week above the Local Housing Allowance for the majority of the region. This means that should our tenants move to such properties, they face an average 18.6% shortfall, \ndespite\n occupying properties of the correct size. This means both a larger shortfall for tenants and higher Housing Benefit awards; the result is that costs are both higher for tenants and Local Authorities. Therefore, moving to the private rented sector is simply not a viable option in our region.\n  The same is true for those living in South Northants Homes\n’\n area.\n&#xa0;\nFurthermore, \nas a G\nroup \nwe \ndo not have enough smaller units to rehouse all of those affected by the \nunder-occupancy charge\n, so over time, we anticipate that our most vulnerable tenants will no longer have the capacity to maintain their tenancies, leading to evictions, increased levels of personal debt and the resulting pressures on public/private services, such as \nfood banks\n, clothing banks, \nGUHG’s \nand the Council\ns’\n support teams and statutory services such as social services.\n&#xa0;\nThe councils\n’\n DHP budget\ns will soon be spent, and \nour tenants currently maintaining their tenancies in this way will need to find another option.  There are limited options to move and as such, we anticipate that these families will quickly get into serious debt, both housing and otherwise\n resulting in\n a catastrophic impact on some households. The DHP scheme merely offers temp\norary respite from benefit cuts\n \nand is\n potentially pejorative, conditional, subjective and can become int\nrusive.  In one instance our \nlocal authority r\nefused\n a DHP claim because the \napplicant paid \nfor dental insurance\n.  T\nhe tenant in question has very bad teeth as a result of a medical condition.  Another DHP was refused for \na wheelchair user, seeking work, t\nhey were relying on \nbroadband in order to do this but it was deemed that broadband was an unnecessary ‘luxury’. The overall effect on our tenants could be that they become demonised and treated less favourably for attempting to improve their quality of life. \n&#xa0;\nWe anticipate that it is the most vulnerable groups, such as homeless households and households with a \ndisability who\n will suffer the most.  Disabled households are the most difficult to transfer as the options open to them that are open to other tenants, su\nch as returning to work or the occasional\n opportunity to downsize\n are more limited.  They will often \nhave no option but to find\n the shortfall or face eviction. \nT\nhe total cost to the pub\nl\nic purse, sh\nould they be evicted, \nis believed to be in the region of £7,000. \n&#xa0;\nThose who have never had to manage their own housing costs will need a significant amount of support to build up the skills required to cope with UC, and if they fail to do so, which we unfortunately believe that some will, they too face the prospect of losing their tenancies\n&#xa0;\nConclusion&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n17 September 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
