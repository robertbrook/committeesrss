&#xa0;Written evidence from Ian Price (WRT 042)&#xa0;Sir for many years I have been involved in Motorsport and I am an RAC MSA Technical Official so I do understand Tyres.&#xa0;Three Saturdays past I was driving near Tottington at 17-30 ish when we had a short sharp rain and hail shower. &#xa0;The road became covered in ice (hail) and I slowed my 3 month old car to around 15 mph.&#xa0;On a very slight curve the car lost all traction and started to slide / spin , this with a driver who has bee involved with events such as The Monte Carlo and 1000 Lakes Rally's. Snow and ice driving is not an issue to me , but even I could not stop it. Luckily no collision of any kind happened.&#xa0;What it did however was to lead me to investigate the O.E.M. tyres fitted to the car and others.&#xa0;In the main manufacturers ( car and tyre) seem to focus on mpg,noise,and good wear miles. Non of which gives good grip !&#xa0;Indeed the tyres fitted to my car and almost all the others I looked at were described by the tyre makers as 'SUMMER' tyres ! With many suggesting for 'Winter' you should fit 'Winter' or 'All Weather / Season' tyres as the 'Summer' tyres performance falls off so sharply to a dangerous extent ( as I had found) in 'Winter' weather !&#xa0;There are many many graphs and tests that clearly demonstrate this on the internet. However in many European countries it is not an issue because 'Winter ' tyres are a legal requirement so the issue never arises. &#xa0;Here we neither have that legislation or a real understanding of seasonal tyre construction, hence the very real danger all road users are in from these totally inappropriate / dangerous tyres !&#xa0;I wonder how many people will die this winter in accidents that would not have happened had the car been fitted with the correct tyre ?&#xa0;How do car manufacturers ( who all recognize the need for 'Winter' tyres and try to sell them at around Â£1000 a set !) get away with selling cars on tyres that are in reality only 'safe' and 'fit for purpose' in the spring/summer/autumn months and in 'Winter' are as much use as a handbrake on a canoe ! &#xa0;Should they not fit 'All Weather' tyres that are safe 365 days of the year ,whatever the weather !&#xa0;I do hope you will see and understand the need for strong urgent action to challenge this extremely serious safety issue.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
