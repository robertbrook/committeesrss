[[[Overview]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In our view, the development of the proposals for the taxation of Salaried Members of UK LLPs has been most unsatisfactory and represents a significant departure from HM Treasury’s approach to the making of tax policy as set out in “Tax Policy making: a new approach” (June 2010).

[[[The consultation process]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Law Society believes that stages 1 and 2 of the consultation process have not been as in depth as necessary. Given the Government's agenda to reduce the deficit, which has been coupled with some tax increases, the Law Society appreciates that there is pressure on the Government to move swiftly when there are opportunities to raise additional tax revenues.  However, the Society also reiterates the importance of a thorough and transparent consultation process.  &#xa0;

[[[onsultations]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Comments were made at the time that there were other degrouping charges which it would have been convenient to address at the same time. However, the decision appears to have been taken within HMRC/HMT that the scope of the consultation should not be extended. The Law Society believes that this would have been a good opportunity for HMRC/ HMT to capitalise on the good work that had been done in the consultation process.&#xa0;&#xa0;
