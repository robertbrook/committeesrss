[[[Submission from the London Assembly]]]

[[[ (FDC12)]]]&#xa0;The London Assembly comprises 25 politicians who are elected to hold the Mayor of London to account and investigate issues of importance to Londoners.  London Assembly Members are elected at the same time as the Mayor. Eleven represent the whole capital and 14 are elected by constituencies.  The London Assembly carries out investigations into issues through cross-party committees, which often look at long-term issues facing London.  It also holds the Mayor to account through monthly Mayor’s Question Time meetings. &#xa0;The London Assembly welcomes the CLG Committee’s inquiry into fiscal devolution to cities and city regions. This follows the work undertaken by the London Finance Commission (LFC) and the publication of its final report, Raising the Capital, on 15 May 2013.&#xa0;That report examined the potential for greater devolution of both taxation and the control of resources in London and developed options to improve the city’s tax and spending arrangements. It recommended that London government should retain business rates and take full control over council tax and stamp duty land tax. It also proposed that the yields from such taxes should be offset by a corresponding reduction in grant to ensure any changes be fiscally neutral for the Exchequer. The intention is that with such additional powers, the city can fund infrastructure both to cater for the expansion already forecast for its population and economy, and to promote additional economic growth. The report also called for a relaxation of restrictions on borrowing for capital investment within prudential rules.  &#xa0;The London Assembly is unanimous in its support of the principles and detailed recommendations put forward by the London Finance Commission. John Biggs, AM, represented the Assembly on the LFC and we have also had extensive discussions on the proposals with Professor Tony Travers, who chaired the Commission, when he appeared in front of the London Assembly on 5 June 2013. &#xa0;Were the London Finance Commission recommendations to be implemented, it would give the London Mayor enhanced powers over taxation and borrowing. The Assembly is firmly of the view that this would need to be balanced by enhanced local accountability. The LFC report recognises this: “If the Mayor assumed substantial additional taxation responsibilities it would be necessary to review the Assembly’s powers with a view to enhancing them.” This was reinforced by Professor Travers who told the Assembly that “the Assembly’s powers need to be strengthened pro rata”.  &#xa0;The Assembly would seek additional responsibilities in respect of both taxation and borrowing. It has set up a Financial Devolution Working Group to develop more detailed proposals for Assembly powers with respect to council tax, stamp duty land tax, business rates, other taxes, Tax Increment Financing schemes and the Mayor’s infrastructure plan. The Assembly would certainly seek the ability to amend any new tax proposals by the Mayor in the same way that it currently amends the Mayor’s budget.&#xa0;The Assembly supports the application of the principles developed by the London Finance Commission to other English cities. However, it is not for the Greater London Authority or the London Assembly to define the precise geographical and accountability arrangements that would be appropriate for such devolution. That is an issue for the people and representatives of each locality to decide. &#xa0;

[[[Conclusion]]]&#xa0;The Assembly would urge the Committee to give detailed consideration to the need for proper governance and local accountability in the event of fiscal devolution to English cities. In London, if the recommendations of the LFC were implemented, the Mayor would see a substantial increase in tax raising and borrowing powers. Such an expansion of the executive’s role and function should be effectively balanced by strengthened accountability via the London Assembly. &#xa0;January 20141&#xa0; http://www.london.gov.uk/moderngov/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=179&amp;MId=4845&#xa0;
