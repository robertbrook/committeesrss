default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultLimited liability partnerships (LLPs) were introduced a
defaults a 
defaultlegal entity 
defaultin 2000.  The intention was to provide a commercial entity that had some limited liability protection for its members but with the taxati
defaulton attributes of partnerships.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultPartnership taxation treatment is fundamental to LLPs.  If LLPs we
defaultre taxed as companies the LLP structure would serve 
defaultlimited
default purpose and 
defaultmany 
defaultprofessional firms would operate as limited companies or as traditional partnerships under the 1890 
defaultA
defaultct.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultThe 
defaultoriginal 
defaultdrafting of the tax legislation of LLPs (now 
defaults
default863 ITTOIA 2005) was not consulted upon at the time.  This lack of consultation led to defective legislation that the Government is now trying to correct (and 
defaultagain, 
defaultin our view
default,
default with insufficient consultation)
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultWe understand that the original intenti
defaulton was for LLPs to be taxed as if partnerships, and therefore a member
default’
defaults tax status would be the same as that 
defaultwithin 
defaultan 1890 
defaultA
defaultct partnership.
default  This intention was confirmed by HMRC at paragraph 2.8 in the 20 May 2013 Consultation Document.
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default              
default‘
defaultSalaried pa
defaultrtners
default’
default of an 1890 
defaultA
defaultct partnership are employees with the title 
default‘
defaultpartner
default’
default but who are not partners.  The LLP 
defaultA
defaultct allows for members of an LLP to also be employees.  The tax legislation (through erroneous drafting in our view) conferred self-employed tax st
defaultatus as if true partners on employe
defaulte
default members.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default              
defaultMembers of our tax committee, and other practitioners, highlighted this anomaly to HMRC at the time and explained that we anticipated that the defects in this legislation
default would be
default exploited.  It is frustra
defaultting that appropriate debate did not take place over a decade ago, 
defaulttha
defaultt our predictions 
defaulthave 
defaultcome true
default (indeed beyond even our expectations)
default, and that in belatedly seeking to take corrective action our advice is 
defaultagain 
defaultnot being fully absorbed
default by Government
default.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultWe acknowledge that the consultation document published by HMRC on 20 May was the start of what we anticipated being an appropriate consultation process.  We also acknowledge that HMRC were engaged and 
defaultinvolving in this process
default over summer 2013
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultFeedback was provided in the consultation process by professional bodies, including ourselves, and some firms potentially affected by the then proposed changes.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultWe know of many firms who did not respond
default to the consultation process because they saw that the proposals would have no
default,
default 
defaultor at
default most little
default,
default impact upon them.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultOur response was that the proposals were an inappropriate re
defaultaction
default to the problem identified and we recommended that a simple change t
defaulto 
defaultS
defaultection 863 ITTOIA 2005 was all that was needed to bring the position to that which we had understood was always intended and to ensure that 
defaultrelevant
default partnership tax case law could be used to determine appropriate outcomes.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultOn 10 December, some four months after the initial consultation process
default, the
default Government published amended proposals within draft clauses for 
defaultF
defaultinance Bill 2014 together with draft HMRC guidance thereon.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultThe proposals are si
defaultgnificantly different to those outlined in the 20 
defaultM
defaultay 
default2013 
defaultconsultation document and thus, in our view, should be subject to fresh consultation.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultUnfortunately the HMRC 
default‘
defaulttechnical notes and guidance
default’
default of 10 December make it clear that we have been prese
defaultnted a fait accompli.  "The Government would not expect to make significant changes to the published legislation, although 
defaultcomments on 
defaulttechnical details would be welcome."
default  
default(Page 3 of HMRC’s Technical Note and Guidance 10 December 2013.)
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultThe 
defaultimpression being strongly given is that there is no intention on the part of Government to debate the principles behind the fresh proposals.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default5
default              
defaultThe revised proposals will not catch some employee members who the Government clearly wished to tax as 
defaultemployees within their original proposals.  Under the new proposals it is quite possible the low paid workers referred to in paragraph 2.9 of the 20 May consultation document will under the new proposals be able to remain self-employed
default if their arrangement
defaults are set up so to do
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default6
default              
defaultIn contrast there were 
defaultindividuals 
defaultnot intended to be affected by the original proposals, who now may well be
default.  F
defaultor example
default,
default "junior partners (who) are substantially rewarded by a fixed profit share" where paragraph 2.13 of the 
default20 
defaultM
defaultay consultation document suggested it would be appropriate
default for them
default to remain as self-employed
default, but who are now potentially to be caught
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default7
default              
defaultMany professional firms with junior members now find that the tax position of those members may well change o
defaultn 6 April 2014 and they have no opportunity to enter into any meaningful debate about the proposals.
default&#xa0;
default4.8
default              
defaultThe same is true of firms where members share profits primarily by a 
defaultpercentage
default of 
defaultthe
default profits
default of a division of the firm
default.  Under the 20 May 2013 doc
defaultument proposals our understanding is that this would be a variable profit share and the individuals would not be classed as salaried members.  The draft Finance Bill clauses completely change the outcome in this regard as a share of a divisions profits is 
defaultto be classed as ‘disguised salary’ (although clearly variable the problem is that it does not directly vary with the firm’s overall profits, only the divisions).
default&#xa0;
default4.
default9
default              
defaultThe timescale of implementation by 6 April 2014 is now so short that those firms who fin
defaultd themselves affected
default,
default and previously assumed they would 
defaultnot
default,
default find that they have no time to debate
default the position.
default  Some quite fundamental principles have changed as we have explained above.
default 
default 
defaultThe focus of potentially affected firms
default is on attempting to minimise the 
defaultimpact of 
defaultwhat they believe to be inappropriate change to tax legislation.
default  With our self-assessment regime they will face interest and penalties for failing to operate PAYE if appropriate on members’ income from 6 April 2
default014
default, even though the legislation will not receive Royal Assent until summer 2014 and may change through parliamentary process in the meantime
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.10
default              
defaultFor some individual members the proposed legislation even has an impact upon the tax due from them on 31 Ja
defaultnuary 2014.  If they otherwise expect their tax liability for 2013/14 to be lower than for 2012/13 then they are able to make a ‘payment reduction claim’ to reduce their 2013/14 interim payments on account (with the first instalment due on 31 January 2014)
default.  However, if they are treated as ceasing self
default-
defaultemployment on 5 April 2014 on 
defaultbecoming
default a salaried member on 6 April 2014 (see 4.
default12 
defaultb
defaultelow) they might have a higher 2013/14 tax liability as a result, and would then be liable to interest on what then proves t
defaulto be an underpaid first instalment of tax 
defaultdue 
defaulton 31
default&#xa0;
defaultJanuary 2014.
default&#xa0;
default4.11
default              
defaultWhere an individual has sufficient capital in the firm on 6 April 2014 they will be able to continue to be treated as self-employed.  Currently the draft legislation insists that any c
defaultapital commitment made to the firm only counts to the extent it is paid in to the firm by the relevant date.  Banks are already warning that they face administrative difficulty in processing demand 
defaultfrom individual members 
defaultfor additional loans 
defaultto subscribe 
defaultcapital 
defaultby Friday 4 April 2014 (the last working day before 6 April).  Is it right that a bank’s ability to process applications should determine an individual’s tax status?  (We have suggested to HMRC that a ‘window of opportunity’ be given for the commit
defaultted capital to be paid in.)
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default2
default              
defaultThe draft Finance Bill clauses clearly treat salaried members as employees for tax purposes from 6 April 2014.  The HMRC guidance 
defaultdoes not explain whether self
default-
defaultemployment status is deemed to cease on 5 April 2014 or on 6 A
defaultpril 2014.
default  In tax terms this is not a difference of a day but of a whole year.  Does one cease in 2013/14 or in 2014/15?
default&#xa0;
default4.

default              
defaultIn drafting the proposed new legislation HMRC 
defaultf
defaulta
defaultc
defaulted a choice of adopting our recommendation (to bring existing partnership case 
defaultlaw into play
default with a minor redrafting of existing Clause 863
default)
default or drafting fresh legislation with a series of tests.  They have chosen the latter.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default1
default4
default              
defaultA potential advantage of tests within legislation is that taxpayers can interpret their own position 
defaultwith some certainty.
default  However, to do so the tests need to be clear and appropriate.  There has not been an opportunity to debate whether they are.
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default5
default              
defaultHMRC 
defaulthave
default kindly indicated that they welcome comment on their draft guidance such that it might be cl
defaultarified and expanded where necessary.  We welcome this engagement and have already been liaising directly with HMRC on this.
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default6
default              
defaultHowever, this again highlights that all is being done in a rush.  Firms have to fully absorb 
defaultboth the draft legislation and t
defaulthe draft guidance
default well in advance of 6 April 2014 so that may they may understand their position at that date and act accordingly.
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default7
default              
defaultOur liaison with HMRC has indicated that they hope to publish updated guidance in 
defaultmid or 
defaultlate February, which will only
default be six weeks
default or so
default in advance of the i
defaultmplementation
default date.
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default8
default              
defaultGiven the uncertainty firms face
default,
default one would expect that they would be able to obtain detailed guidance in respect of their own circumstances from the otherwise laudable HMRC non-statutory cle
defaultarance team.  Unfortunately the non-statutory clearance team are only able to respond to clients’ requests once the new rules have 
defaultRoyal
default 
defaultA
defaults
defaults
defaultent, which is likely to be three months after the date on which firms 
defaultneed
default to have commenced complying with the prop
defaultosals.
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default9
default              
defaultWe have the unsatisfactory position of firms being in limbo in determining their position and considering any action in the light of proposed legislation that might change.  For example, HMRC have verbally indicated that they agree that 
defaultS
defaultectio
defaultn 863B (
default6
default) does not define the correct period to measure "disguised salary" 
defaultfor the capital measure test in Condition C 
defaultand that the clause will need correcting.  This is a key definition of one of the tests that firms need to measure by 6 April 2014.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultWe agree that the existing legislation is defective and needs amendment
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultWe do not believe that the current proposals are the appropriate corrective action
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultWe do not believe that there has been adequate consultation on the propos
defaultals contained within the draft legislation
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default              
defaultWe recommend that a further consultation process should be undertaken with 
defaulta
default delay 
defaulti
defaultn the introduction of legislation by a year so that there is time to get it right.
