taken by PASCFurther action?RAG ratingThe size of departmental committees should not normally be more than 11.\nCurrent membership: 11\nNothing necessary.\nGreenEncourage committees to make use of the support of the Scrutiny Unit and to discuss with the National Audit Office how its programme of work might help support the work of the committee.\nRecent programme of NAO \nsecondees\n from NAO for programme of work on statistics and for procurement inquiry.  Regular liaison at staff level with NAO about PASC future programme.\nSupport routinely sought from Scrutiny Unit, \neg\n for annual \nfinancial scrutiny of the Cabinet Office and for scrutiny of main estimates. Legal advice on general matters (charity law, for example) sought from the Scrutiny Unit legal specialists when necessary.\nContinue as currently.\nGreenAs a model of ‘best practice’, we recommend that committees:\na) have a candid discussion amongst themselves about how they see their purpose, and what they wish to achieve \nover the length of the Parliament;\nCommittee will be holding an away day on 3 December.\nCould be discussed by Committee at its away day.\nGreenb) identify what are the most important functions of their department’s responsibilities and design a programme of scrutiny to assess whether the department’s objectives have been fulfilled;\nNot done formally.\nCould be discussed by Committee at its away day.\nGreenc) clearly record their conclusions and remind themselves of them when considering proposals for inquiry and programme planning;\nConclusions clearly recorded in bold in reports; clerks and inquiry managers ensure previous conclusions are considered. In notes for \ndiscussion on future inquiries, staff will make sure previous relevant committee conclusions are clearly identified.\nTo continue to look back at previous conclusions when drawing up future programme and \nconducting inquiries.\nAmberd) review this at least annually, with an “away day” or at least a longer, less formal discussion than is possible at a regular deliberative meeting;\nCommittee has agreed to an away day.\nHold away day.\nGreene) canvass opinion among the key players in their subject area about their performance.\nAt their meeting on 16 October the Committee agreed to seek feedback from witnesses and journalists to inform their away \nday on 3 December.\n&#xa0;\nAmberWe commend to other committees the practice of publishing strategic objectives, and of consulting their department and other stakeholders on them.\nObjectives published for each inquiry, but overall objectives for PASC’s work not published.\n&#xa0;\nCommittee to develop strategic objectives at away day.\nAmberWe recommend that, before they launch an inquiry, committees agree a comprehensive minute setting out what they hope to achieve, and the likelihood of success.\nObjectives agreed and published for each inquiry. \nCommittee to discuss the merits of having a more comprehensive minute.\nAmberWe recommend that in future inquiries, as \na matter of routine, committees include consideration of the financial aspects and implications of the policies being examined.\nPASC already does this, and \nhas identified more that it will do in future.\nContinue to do so, \nseeking specialist financial input if necessary from Scrutiny Unit.\nGreenWe encourage committees to hold evidence sessions at least annually with ministers and departmental accounting officers, and include within these sessions consideration of how departments evaluate and take decisions on spending, and how they assess the effectiveness of the spending they undertake.\nPASC already does this. Staff use the advice of the Scrutiny Unit when preparing for these sessions.\nContinue as currently.\nGreenWe encourage committees to review departments’ Mid-Year Reports when published, using them to identify relevant issues and questions relating to finance and performance\nThis will be the first year that the Cabinet Office has published a Mid-Year Report.\nTo keep under review.\nGreenWe recommend that committees experiment with different approaches, such as appointing a \nrapporteur\n to lead on a particular inquiry, or choosing “lead questioners” for an evidence session.\nThis happens informally, based on the level of interest of individual members. Committee considered its questioning techniques at training session on effective questioning on 20 June 2013.\nCommittee to discuss if they wish to have formally-agreed \nrapporteurs\n or lead questioners.\nAmberWe recommend that committees make every effort to broaden their range of witnesses, and to take into account the principles of diversity and inclusion in planning their inquiries and committee programme.\nCommittee staff are conscious of diversity issues when drawing up witness plans. Staff recently audited proportion of male / female PASC witnesses: only one in six witnesses were female (17%). \nStaff will continue to monitor and search for viable alternative witnesses where possible.\nAmberCommittees should bear in mind the option of commissioning research when planning their long-term strategies, and, if necessary, the House authorities should increase the money available for this \npurpose.\nCommissioning research is considered. For example, PASC commissioned polling from \nYouGov\n in connection with its work on public engagement in policy making \nand on national strategy.\nContinue as currently.\nGreenWe encourage committees to keep their reports short and accessible, and to avoid too many recommendations.\nMost recent reports  as follows(“\nrecs\n” includes conclusions as well as recommendations):\nTruth to Power: 179 \nparas\n, 50 \nrecs\nMigration statistics: 76 \nparas\n, 16 \nrecs\nProcurement: 122 \nparas\n, 24 \nrecs\nEngaging the Public in National Strategy: 8 \nparas\n, 3 recs.\nThe Role of the Charity Commission and public benefit: 165 paras,13  recs.\nPublic Engagement in Policy-Making: 64 \nparas\n; 12 recs.\nCommunicating Statistics: 44 \nparas\n; 10 recs.\nPublic Trust in Government Statistics: 73 \nparas\n; 12 recs.\nMembers to be conscious of this issue when discussing draft reports.\nAmberA clear indication of which recommendations are most important will help the committee achieve impact and make follow-up easier. We recommend that the usual template for committee reports be changed to distinguish clearly the recommendations targeted at the Government. We suggest that conclusions should be in bold, with recommendations in bold italics, and that it should be clearly stated to whom the recommendation is addressed.\nPASC reports do format conclusions in bold and recommendations in bold italics with the target of the recommendation clearly stated.\nPASC reports do not stipulate which recommendations are the most important to PASC.\nCommittee to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of identifying in Committee reports which recommendations are the most important.\nAmberWe recommend that each committee should appoint a member of staff, or an adviser, or an outside body, who will monitor follow-up to recommendations in respect of each report. The committee should report to the House at least once in each parliamentary Session upon how many of its recommendations the Government has acted, and what follow-up is proposed on outstanding recommendations.\nStaff keep track on an informal basis.\nStaff to bring follow up issues to the Committee’s attention.\nAmberWe recommend that the introductory briefings offered to new committee \nmembers be given more formality, and include a meeting with the chair or another experienced committee member.\nThese briefings are now being offered and work has \ncommenced in this area.\nContinue as \ncurrently.\nGreenWe recommend that committees consider the benefits of using professional trainers to help them refresh and develop their questioning skills.\nTraining session held with John \nSturrock\n QC on 20 June 2013 on questioning skills; staff currently investigating whether budget available for a follow-up session. \nDone.\nGreenWe recommend that chairs discuss with their committee how they see their role, and seek their endorsement for it.\nCurrently not done.\nCommittee to discuss; perhaps at away day?\nAmber12 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
