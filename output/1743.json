"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from the Devon Senior Voice Transport Group (TIC 078)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAll communities, whether urban \nor rural, should have access to regular public transport.  Local government authorities providing financial support for services which are deemed socially necessary, may only be achieved successfully through:-\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRegular assessment (suggest by annual review) \nof available finance required for supporting non commercially viable services, growth and decline of communities and vehicle availability.  This list is not exhaustive\n.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDialogue and negotiation with transport providers, local community organisations, emplo\nyers, schools and local health services\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe specific needs of different groups of disabled passengers are now recognised in law.  Bus and train accessibility is increasingly becoming a reality.  Isolated communities are often served by narrow lanes and together with passenger numbers more sui\ntable sized vehicles may be required.  For example a 15 \nseater\n bus compliant with the latest DDA regulations.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.\n              \nWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities?  How can thes\ne challenges be overcome?\nSome of the challenges confronting the provision of public transport in these areas are:-\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinance – the availability of support funding\n.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocation – narrow roads may require special type of vehicle\n.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNumber of passengers – the \nsmaller the number of passengers\n, \nthe higher the cost of providing a service and this particularly applies to buses\n.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAvailability of smaller local transport firms willing to accept this type of contract\n.\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTravel patterns of a limited number of passengers\n.\n \nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTrains also need to stop at all stations to provide transport to work and back. A lot do this in one direction but not to work places in the opposite direction. Example.\n  Ivybridge to Plymouth 7.26 arriving 7.40, 7.58 arriving 8.11 in the opposite direction Ivybridge to Exeter first train 8.25 arriving 9.18, not nearly early enoughThese challenges may be overcome through\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe regular assessment to provide match funding, where commercially services are not viable, together with the need to explore all possi\nble funding streams\n.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInnovative solutions which could include many forms of community transport, taxis and the possibility of the general public using specified school buses where there is space.  The relaxation of start times on senior and disabled bus pa\nss regulations may also be needed\n.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecognising the differing needs of passengers in isolated areas and rationalising these wherever feasible\n.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThrough dialogue and negotiation with organisations \neg\n the local NHS, employer organisations, education department\ns, bus, train, community transport groups and taxi companies to seek and determine possible solutions\n.\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhenever there is an opportunity to promote the use of public transport over the car - \nexploit it.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCommunity transport is of ever increasing importance to isolated communities as it is often used to fill gaps in the public transport network.  It can tak\ne many forms with funding ranging from local volunteer fund raising to financial support from local transport authorities.  Community transport is effective by using:-\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nVehicles which are suited to the route(s) needed and the\n groups of passengers using the \nservices and may be also be more affordable where local fund raising provides the vehicle\n.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere can be a greater degree of flexibility for services arranged at local level\n.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsideration should be given to raising the age of volunteer drivers from 70 to 75, subject to health and driver ability tests.&#xa0;\nTaxis and other demand responsive services\n are expensive to use by those living in isolated communities.  Often these people are those whose circumstances have changed with the passage of time and they are no longer able to drive or have the use of a car.  All groups of passengers in these circums\ntances can have widely diverse needs which make resolving the challenges more demanding.  Many living in isolated communities do so in the knowledge that public transport is likely to be limited.\nCar schemes (often used for medical appointments) and innova\ntive use of taxis are two approaches which can contribute to the easing of travel costs.\nOlder people may find the need to move to urban areas to ease the cost of travel.  Young people of working age may also need to more away from rural areas for similar \nreasons.  This has a social impact on the sustainability of villages and hamlets in remote areas.\n&#xa0;\nThe main ch\nallenges are:-\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncreasingly limited availability of supporting public funding\n.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLow passenger numbers\n.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPossible requirement for specialist vehicles\n.\n&#xa0;\n              \nThese services could be made more affordable by:-\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFlexible thinking by local transport authorities where \nit is a\ncceptable to “think outside the \nbox”\n.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInnovation and a willingness to experiment\n.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFind partners, consult and negotiate\n.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSeek best practice and share successful solutions\n.\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPublicise passenger numbers (not percentages) to highlight cost effective \nvisibility\n.\nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSubject to finance availability, improve the travel experience quality for users of public transport by extending to use of “Real Time Information” for buses and “Customer Information System” for rail.  These measures together with the wider av\nailability of shelters, seating and time tables at all stops, may also go some way to persuading car users to change their travel habits\n.\n&#xa0;Conclusion   Local knowledge, together with research amongst Senior Voice Devon members and local Councillors and O\nfficers, has enabled us to answer the questions often in a positive light.  We are fortunate in having a County Council where both Councillors and Officers take a detailed interest in all forms of public transport.  We have noted they are willing to “look \noutside the box” and to experiment.  They work closely with bus companies, both large and small, and have taken the lead in encouraging and being directly involved in all the Devon rail branch lines becoming \nmembers of the Community Rail Partnership.  Whil\nst there will always be room for improvement and some necessary adjustment of bus routes and timetabling, we note that since April 2012 only one bus service in Devon has been withdrawn entirely.\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
