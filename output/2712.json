"&#xa0;\nCabinet Office – Written evidence&#xa0;DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEEDRAFT DEREGULATION BILL&#xa0;Introduction &#xa0;1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis Memorandum has been prepared for the Joint Committee which is scrutinising the Deregulation Bill in draft form (‘the Bill’) and for the consideration of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. \n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe memorandum identifies the provisions of the Bill which confer powers to make delegated legislation. It explains in each case why the power has been taken and the nature of, and reason for, the procedure selected. \n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince the Bill deals with diverse subject areas, and covers changes from a number of departments, each measure is addressed individually. Most powers are specific to individual clauses but the Bill also includes some general powers. The material for the Memorandum was prepared by the relevant departments and drawn together by the Cabinet Office.\nBackground &#xa0;4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Deregulation Bill is a cross-Government Cabinet Office-led Bill. It forms part of the government’s commitment to reduce the overall burden of regulation and to cut ‘red tape’ during this Parliament. The implementation of that programme includes measures given effect by administrative changes and secondary legislation. The Bill is one of a number \nof\n government bills that is taking forward reforms where their implementation requires primary legislation. Its purpose is to change various pieces of legislation in \norder\n to reduce or remove unnecessary legislative burdens on businesses, civil society, the taxpayer and individuals; and, additionally, to repeal some redundant legislation. \n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Bill includes measures relating to general and specific areas of business, companies and insolvency, the use of land, housing, transport, communications, the environment, education and training, entertainment, public authorities and the administration of justice. It also provides for a duty on those exercising specified regulatory functions to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth. It repeals some legislation that is no longer of any practical use, and provides ministers with a power to make similar repeals in the future via secondary legislation. \nProvisions which confer delegated powers 6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nprovisions\n in the Bill which confer these powers are identified below. The purpose of the delegated powers taken, and an explanation as to why the matter is to be left to delegated legislation and why the relevant department has chosen a particular procedure, are then set out in relation to each relevant clause.  \n&#xa0;\nTerritorial coverage 7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAny amendment of existing legislation has the same extent as the original legislation except where specified by clause 63(2) and (3). Clause 63(2) and (3) specify certain paragraphs in \nSchedule 16, which repeal\n legislation which is no longer of practical use. \n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy virtue of clause 63(5), the new powers granted to a Minister of the Crown by clauses 49 (power to amend legislation to describe actual commencement dates), 51\n-57\n (power to \ndisapply\n legislation which is no longer of practical use) \nand 58-61\n (provisions concerning the promotion of economic growth) form part of the law of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The provisions concerning consequential changes, commencement and short title set out in clauses 62, 64 and 65 also so apply, by virtue of the same clause. \nDevolution\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExcept where the contrary is expressly stated, the powers conferred by the Bill are not exercisable in a devolved area. \nClause 1: Health and safety at work: general duty of self-employed persons&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPower conferred on:\n              \n              \nThe Secretary of State \n&#xa0;\nPower exercisable by:\n              \n              \nRegulations made by statutory i\nnstrument \n&#xa0;\nParliamentary procedure:\n              \n Negative Resolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\n10.\n&#xa0; \nThis clause provides the Secretary of State with a new regulation-making power under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974\n.\n11.\n&#xa0; \nSection 3(2) of the 1974 Act imposes a general duty on all self-employed persons to conduct their undertaking in such a way to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that they themselves and persons other than their employees who may be affected by it are not exposed to risks to their health and safety. \n12.\n&#xa0; \nClause 1 limits the scope of section 3(2) so that only those self-employed who conduct a “relevant undertaking” will continue to hold a duty under this provision.\n13.\n&#xa0; \nThis \nnew regulation-making \npower is exercisable in relation to England and Wales and Scotland. \n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the \nprovision\n&#xa0;\n14.\n&#xa0; \nClause 1(3) defines “relevant undertaking” as an undertaking of a prescribed description, or any other undertaking that could expose other persons to risks to their health and safety. \n15.\n&#xa0; \n“Prescribed” has a specific meaning within the 1974 Act, defined in section 53(1) as prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State. Clause 1(3) therefore enables the Secretary of State to make regulations for the purpose of bringing the\n self-employed within the scope of the section 3(2) duty. \nUnless a relevant undertaking has been prescribed, a self-employed person will only owe a duty to themselves if their undertaking poses a risk of harm to others.\n16.\n&#xa0; \nThe regulation-making power in clause 1(3) affords the Secretary of State a degree of flexibility because a number of different \ndescriptions  of\n an  undertaking could be given in the regulations. For example, a “prescribed description” could be by reference to the activities that the undertaking engages in (e.g. construction\n) ,\n the hazardous substances it uses, or a combination of these things. \n17.\n&#xa0; \nThe Secretary of State can exercise this power at his or her own discretion, or \non  a\n recommendation from the Health and Safety Executive who, by virtue of section 11(3) of the 1974 Act, may submit to the Secretary of State such proposals as it considers appropriate for the making of regulations. \n18.\n&#xa0; \nKey stakeholders will be consulted and their responses taken into account prior to a relevant undertaking being prescribed.\n&#xa0;\nJustification \nof \n the\n delegation\n&#xa0;\n19.\n&#xa0; \nThe department considers it necessary for the Secretary of State to be given a separate regulation-making power to prescribe a relevant undertaking because \nit  will\n give the assurance that those self-employed persons working in high hazard industries or engaging in  high hazard activities (who would be expected to pose the highest risks of harm to others, as well as themselves) will not be exempt from the general duty under section 3(2) of the 1974 Act. This approach will make it clear and unambiguous to those working in high risk industries that they will not be exempt from section 3(2), and that they will still have a duty to conduct their undertaking in such a way as to ensure that they and others are not exposed to risks to their health and safety. \n&#xa0;\n20.\n&#xa0; \nIt is appropriate for relevant undertakings to be prescribed through secondary legislation because it is anticipated that the kind of undertaking that needs to be prescribed may be subject to change and require regular updating to reflect fluctuating or emerging risks associated with a variety of different workplace activities or sectors. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of Parliamentary scrutiny\n&#xa0;\n21.\n&#xa0; \nRegulations made under the power conferred by clause 1(3) will be subject to the negative resolution procedure.  Section 82(3)\n of the 1974 Act \nprovides that any power to make regulations conferred by Part 1 of the Act \n( which\n includes section 3) shall be exercisable by statutory instrument and subject to annulment (subject to an exce\nption set out in section 82(4), \nwhich is not relevant here). \n&#xa0;\n22.\n&#xa0; \nStatutory instruments made under this clause will not make amendments to primary legislation, therefore the additional procedural hurdles and increased occupation of Parliamentary time associated with the affirmative procedure is not considered appropriate. However\n,\n these regulations will effectively bring individuals within the scope of the primary legislation. Accordingly, the department considers the negative resolution procedure provides the appropriate level of scrutiny for detailed and technical provisions regarding health and safety at work.\n&#xa0;\nClause 3 and Schedule 1: English apprenticeships: simplification – inserts sections  A1 to A7 into the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009&#xa0;\nSection A1 (2) and A1 (4) and (5): Approved English apprenticeship\n&#xa0;\nPower conferred on:\n              \n              \nThe Secretary of State \n&#xa0;\nPower exercisable by:\n              \n              \nRegulations made by statutory i\nnstrument \n&#xa0;\nParliamentary procedure:\n              \n Negative Resolution\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\n23.\n&#xa0; \nSection \nA1(\n2) sets out the meaning of an approved English apprenticeship for the purposes of the new Chapter A1 of the \nApprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 (“the 2009 Act”). \nIt is an arrangement which either takes place under an approved English apprenticeship agreement or is an alternative English apprenticeship and, in either case, satisfies any conditions specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State.  Section \nA1(\n4) confers a power on the Secretary of State to describe the kind of arrangements which are alternative English apprenticeships for the purposes of the new Chapter. \n&#xa0;\n24.\n&#xa0; \nThe background is that Schedule\n 1 inserts a new Chapter A1 in Part 1 of \nthe 2009 Act. \nChapter 1 currently provides a regime for both English apprenticeships and Welsh apprenticeships. The new Chapter \nA\n1 relates only to English apprenticeships. The existing Chapter 1 will continue to apply to Welsh apprenticeships.\n&#xa0;\n25.\n&#xa0; \nThe new provisions follow a review of apprenticeships by Doug Richard in 2012. He recommended that the government improve the quality of apprenticeships and introduce more employer focus. Chapter A1 simplifies the existing system. It introduces new concepts of approved English apprenticeships and approved apprenticeship standards.\n&#xa0;\n26.\n&#xa0; \nThe Secretary of State has power to make regulations requiring the apprenticeship and the apprenticeship agreement to satisfy specified conditions. The Secretary of State also has the power to issue certificates to those who complete an approved English apprenticeship. The provisions as a whole reduce bureaucratic burdens, for example by abolishing apprenticeship frameworks and the issuing authorities who issue them.\n&#xa0;\n27.\n&#xa0; \nThese \nnew delegated \npowers are exercisable in\n relation to\n England only.\n&#xa0;\nThe effect of new section \nA1(\n2) \n28.\n&#xa0; \nSection A1(2) provides a power for the Secretary of State to specify conditions which must be satisfied in \norder\n for an arrangement to be an approved English apprenticeship for the purposes of the new Chapter A1. The Department envisages that this power will be used to specify common requirements that all apprenticeships must meet.  These common requirements may change from time to time and therefore it would be inappropriate to specify them in primary legislation.  For example, the Secretary of State may wish to specify a minimum duration to allow all apprentices sufficient time to practise and embed the skills they have learned. \n&#xa0;\nThe effect of new section \nA1(\n4) &amp; (5)\n29.\n&#xa0; \nSection \nA1(\n4) and (5) provide a power for the Secretary of State to describe the kinds of arrangements which constitute alternative\n English apprenticeships.  The d\nepartment envisages that the Secretary of State will use this power to describe arrangements which are suitable for apprenticeships, but where the arrangements cannot satisfy the employment requirements of an approved English apprenticeship agreement.  \nRegulations made under a similar existing power at section 1(5) of the 2009 Act exist for certain occupations where the apprentice is part of a crew or collective in the fishing, creative or performance industries. Regulations also exist for elite athletes undertaking the Sporting Excellence Apprenticeship with the hope of competing in \nthe\n Commonwealth or Olympic Games.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation: new section \nA1(\n2)\n30.\n&#xa0; \nThe main elements of approved English apprenticeships – apprenticeship agreements, approved apprenticeship standards, and certificates are set out in the new sections. Following consultation with employers and other stakeholders, it is very likely that further detailed conditions will be identified as being ones that all apprenticeships should meet\n,\n \nf\nor example a minimum duration, a minimum amount of off-the-job learning, or minimum levels of English and maths \nachievement t\nhat need to be acquired to complete an apprenticeship.  These requirements may change from time to time, for example in response to changes in policy priorities, or as new English and maths qualifications become available or their titles change.  As such it would be inappropriate to specify them i\nn primary legislation, and the d\nepartment considers that the use of delegated powers to specify conditions that must apply to an approved English apprenticeship is appropriate.  \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation: new section \nA1(\n4) and (5)\n&#xa0;\n31.\n&#xa0; \nThe power to describe the kind of arrangements which constitute alternative English apprenticeships is similar to the power currently contained in section 1(5) of the 2009 Act to specify alternative English completion conditions. It is envisaged that\n the power will be used by the d\nepartment for the same purpose. \nThe department\n is encouraging the use of more innovation within apprenticeships and a new apprenticeship standard can be developed at any time.  Delegation allows for the creation of an \napprenticeship  in\n exceptional circumstances, for example in certain circumstances where a person is self employed, or where a sector and individual could benefit from an approved apprenticeship.  Delegation will require detailed consideration of the merits of any application for an alternative English apprenticeship.  A\n \nneed to use primary legislation would inevitably lead to delay and difficulty in keeping up with developments, and might constrain flexibility within the system.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of p\narlia\nmentary s\ncrutiny\n32.\n&#xa0; \nThe department considers that the use of the negative procedure to specify conditions that must apply to an approved English \na\npprenticeship is appropriate. Section 262(5) makes the current (and similar) regulation making power subject to the negative procedure.\n33.\n&#xa0; \nThe d\nepartment also considers the use of the negative procedure to describe the kinds of arrangements which constitute alternative English apprenticeships to be appropriate.  \n34.\n&#xa0; \nRegulations on alternative apprenticeships under the current law first came into effect in 2012 and were amended in 2013 using the affirmative procedure.  On both occasions only cases of genuine merit were proposed and on both occasions the \nR\negulations were approved unanimously and without controversy.  In 2013 three formal requests for alternative English completion conditions were received.  Of those only one was recommended for inclusion in the regulations and even this one was subject to considerable challenge before it went forward.  The department believes it has proved effective at weeding out cases that are not appropriate for apprenticeships. The sifting of requests has become largely an administrative act, and has not proved to be controversial or of wide interest.\n35.\n&#xa0; \nAs a result, the department does not consider that the additional cost, procedural hurdles and occupation of Parliamentary time associated with the affirmative procedure (which applies under the current law) are appropriat\ne to these powers; a change to \nthe \nnegative  procedure\n will enable the Secretary of State to act more swiftly where necessary to encourage innovation within apprenticeships and to respond to the nation’s needs at lower overall cost to the public purse. \n&#xa0;\nNew section \nA1(\n3)(c): Approved English apprenticeship agreements\n&#xa0;\nPower conferred on:\n              \n              \nThe Secretary of State \n&#xa0;\nPower exercisable by:\n              \n              \nRegulations made by statutory i\nnstrument \n&#xa0;\nParliamentary procedure:\n              \n Negative Resolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n36.\n&#xa0; \nSection A1(3)(c) provides a power for the Secretary of State to specify conditions which must be satisfied in \norder\n for an agreement to be regarded as an approved English apprenticeship agreement for the purposes of the new Chapter A1. \n37.\n&#xa0; \nThis power is exercisable in relation to England only.\nThe effect of the section\n38.\n&#xa0; \nThe d\nepartment envisages that the Secretary of State will use this power to prescribe the content of an apprenticeship agreement in a manner that minimises the burden and bureaucracy for employers\n \npossibly by prescribing standard wording.\nJustification of the Delegation \n39.\n&#xa0; \nThe power to specify conditions for approved English apprenticeship agreements is similar (but arguably wider than) the current power contained in section 32(2) of the 2009 Act to prescribe the form of an\n apprenticeship agreement. The d\nepartment envisages \nthat it will be used for the same purposes, and considers that the use of delegated power to specify conditions remains appropriate.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n40.\n&#xa0; \nThe department considers that the use of the negative procedure to specify conditions which must be satisfied in \norder\n for an agreement to be regarded as an approved English apprenticeship agreement is appropriate. Section 262(5) of the 2009 Act subjects regulations made under section 32(2) of the 2009 Act to the negative procedure. Regulations were introduced in 2012 and were not controversial.\n&#xa0;\nNew Section \nA7(\n5): Crown Servants and Parliamentary Staff\n&#xa0;\nPower conferred on:\n              \n              \nThe Secretary of State \n&#xa0;\nPower exercisable by:\n              \n              \nRegulations made by statutory i\nnstrument \n&#xa0;\nParliamentary procedure:\n              \n Negative Resolution\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n41.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection A7(5) provides a power for the Secretary of State to apply any provision  of Chapter 1 with modifications to apprenticeship agreements under which a person undertakes Crown employment, service as a member of the naval, military or air forces of the Crown, or \nemployment \nas a relevant member of the House of Lords or House of Commons staff.\n42.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis power is exercisable in relation to England only. \n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the section\n43.\n&#xa0; \nThis power provides the flexibility to modify the ne\nw provision made by Chapter A1 \nin its application to Crown servants and parliamentary staff.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the Delegation\n44.\n&#xa0; \nThis power is very similar to the power at section 36(5) of the 2009 Act which is currently subject to the negative procedure. \nJustification of the level of Parliamentary Scrutiny\n45.\n&#xa0; \nThe d\nepartment believes that the power will be used for essentially the same purposes as the current power at section 36(5) of the 2009 Act and therefore considers that the level of scrutiny should remain as at present.\nNew section A3: Apprenticeship Certificates\n&#xa0;\nPower conferred on:\n              \n              \nThe Secretary of State \n&#xa0;\nPower exercisable by:\n              \n              \nRegulations made by statutory i\nnstrument \n&#xa0;\nParliamentary procedure:\n              \n Negative Resolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n46.\n&#xa0; \nThis section provides the Secretary of State with the power to make provision about applications for apprenticeship certificates, the supply of copies of apprenticeship certificates and the charging of fees for the issue of a certificate or supply of a copy.\n47.\n&#xa0; \nThis power is exercisable in relation to England only. \nThe effect of the section\n48.\n&#xa0; \nThe d\nepartment envisages that the Secretary of State will use these powers to replace certificates (for example if these have been lost by the individual), or \nto charge a fee for issuing and - or \n- \n replacing\n certificates.  This will be beneficial to the individual as it will give them evidence of their apprenticeship and the achievement of their apprenticeship, which they will find helpful when, for example, seeking a new job.  \nJustification of the Delegation\n              \n49.\n&#xa0; \nThese powers replace the powers in sections 3 and 4 of the 2009 Act (so far as relating to English apprenticeships). The new sections as a whole will simplify the current system by removing the role of English certifying authorities. In future there may be situations where an apprenticeship certificate may not be required to be issued, for example where a trade specific certificate is the main recognisable standard for a particular occupation.  The use of the delegated power will regulate the supply of certificates and enable the Secretary of State to charge a fee for issuing or supplying a certificate.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n50.\n&#xa0; \nThe supply of copy certificates and the charging of fees for this or for the issue of an apprenticeship certificate is largely an administrative task and the department considers that the use of the negative procedure is appropriate.  \n&#xa0;\nClause 4 and Schedule 2: Driving Instructors &#xa0;\nPower conferred on:\n              \nThe\n \nSecretary of State\nPower exercised by:\n              \nRegulations made by statutory instrument\nParliamentary procedure:\n \n              \nNegative resolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n51.\n&#xa0; \nThe amendments made by \nSchedule\n 2 provide for a single system of registration for driving instructors which applies to both instructors who are disabled and those who are not. \n&#xa0;\n52.\n&#xa0; \nUnder the new system the Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors will have power to require a person, whether disabled or not, to undergo an assessment as to their ability to control a  vehicle in an emergency (“an emergency control assessment”) and to issue a certificate where satisfied of the person’s ability to do so (“an emergency control certificate”).\n&#xa0;\n53.\n&#xa0; \nThe new system requires changes to the regulation-making powers in Part 5 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. \n&#xa0;\n54.\n&#xa0; \nPart 1 of \nSchedule\n 2 amends Part 5 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 in the form it will be in once the amendments made to it by the Road Safety Act 2006 come into force.  Part 2 of \nSchedule\n 2 amends Part 5 as it has effect before those amendments come into force.  \n55.\n&#xa0; \nThese powers are exercisable in \nrelation to \nEngland and Wales and Scotland\n.\nThe effect of Part 1 of \nSchedule\n 2\nParagraph 2(a) – amending section 124(3)\n&#xa0;\n56.\n&#xa0; \nUnder section 123 a person is prohibited from giving paid driving instruction of any prescribed\n description unless registered in respect of that description. Regulations under section 124 may prescribe circumstances in which the section 123 prohibition does not apply. In particular, regulations may be made so that in prescribed \ncircumstances persons who are training to be driving instructors are not required to be registered. Section 124(3) sets out particular circumstances which may be so prescribed. Paragraph 2(a) of \nSchedule\n 2 amends section 124 so as to make it clear that those circumstances could include the circumstance that a person holds a current emergency control certificate. This would allow regulations to be made to exempt trainee driving instructors from the requirement to register in circumstances where the trainee holds an emergency control certificate.\nParagraph 3(3) – amending section 125\n57.\n&#xa0; \nSection 125A of the 1988 Act is repealed by paragraph 5 of \nSchedule\n 2. However, the definitions of “disability” and “relevant disability” given by section \n125A(\n8) are still required for the purposes of Part 5 of the 1988 Act, as amended. Accordingly, paragraph 3(3) amends section 125 to reproduce the definitions. This has the effect of preserving the current power to prescribe by regulations a disability which is to be treated as a relevant disability for the purposes of the Part.   \nParagraph 4(2\n)(\nb) – amending section 125ZA(2)\n58.\n&#xa0; \nUnder section 125ZA(1) the Registrar must register a person in respect of a description of driving instruction if the person makes an application for registration and the Registrar is satisfied that the prescribed conditions are met. Section 125ZA\n \n(2) sets out what conditions may, in particular, be prescribed. Paragraph 4(2) amends section 125ZA so as to add conditions requiring a person who has been required to submit to an emergency control assessment to hold a current emergency control certificate. \nParagraph 4(3\n)(\na) and (d) – amending section 125ZA(4)\n59.\n&#xa0; \nUnder section 125ZA(3) a person may be registered in respect of a description of driving instruction subject to fulfilling prescribed conditions so long as the person continues to be registered. Section \n125ZA(\n4) sets out what conditions may, in particular, be prescribed. Paragraph 4(3)(a) amends section 125ZA so as to add-\n&#xad;\n(a) \nconditions\n requiring a person to submit to an emergency control assessment (if required to do so by the Registrar in the circumstances mentioned in section 125(3D));\n(b) \nconditions\n requiring a person to hold an emergency control certificate following such an assessment;\n(c), conditions requiring that, if instruction is to be given in circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation of an emergency arising which necessitates the instructor taking control of the vehicle, a person will only give such instruction if they would be able to take control of the vehicle if such an emergency arose.  \nParagraph 11(4) and (5) – amending section \n133A(\n2) and (6) \n60.\n&#xa0; \nSection 133A\n \n(2) sets out in full the meaning of “emergency control assessment”. It refers to an assessment of a person’s ability to take control of a vehicle of a class \ncovered by the disabled person’s limited driving licence. This is no longer appropriate as, under the new system, people who are not disabled may also be required to undertake emergency control assessments. Paragraph 11(4) therefore amends section \n133A(\n2) to refer instead to an assessment of a person’s ability to take control of a motor vehicle of a prescribed class. Paragraph 11(5) makes a consequential amendment to section \n133A(\n6) which deal with the issue of emergency control certificates.\n&#xa0;\nThe effect of Part 2 of \nSchedule\n 2\nParagraph 17(2)\n&#xa0;\n61.\n&#xa0; \nThis paragraph inserts a new section 125(2C) and (2D) which sets out the circumstances in which the Registrar may require an applicant for registration to submit to an emergency control assessment. The circumstances are that the Registrar has reasonable grounds for believing that the applicant would be unable to take control of a motor car of a prescribed class if an emergency arose while he was giving driving instruction. \n&#xa0;\n \nParagraph 17(4) – amending section 125(5)\n62.\n&#xa0; \nUnder section 125(5) continued \nregistration\n as an approved driving instructor is subject to the condition that the instructor will, upon request by the Registrar, submit to a test of continued ability and fitness to instruct. Paragraph 17(4) amends section 125(5) to add a further condition that the person will, if required to do so by the Registrar, submit to an emergency control assessment on a day within such period as may be prescribed.  \n&#xa0;\nPar\na\ngraph 17(7) – amending section 125\n63.\n&#xa0; \nThis paragraph inserts section 125(8A) and (8B) which prevent a person making  a further application for registration if the person  has undergone an emergency control assessment, been refused an emergency control certificate and, in consequence,  either not been registered or had their name removed from the register. The person is  prevented from making a further application before the end of the period of 6 months , beginning with the date of the assessment, or before the end of such other period as may be prescribed, unless the Registrar is satisfied that there is good reason for allowing an earlier application.  \n&#xa0;\nParagraph 17(9) – amending section 125(10)\n64.\n&#xa0; \nSection 125A of the 1988 Act is repealed by paragraph 18 of \nSchedule\n 2. However, the definitions of “disability” and “relevant disability” given by section \n125A(\n8) are still \nrequired for the purposes of Part 5 of the 1988 Act, as amended. Accordingly, paragraph 17(9) amends section 125 to reproduce the definitions. This has the effect of preserving the current power to prescribe by regulations a disability which is to be treated as a relevant disability for the purposes of the Part.\n&#xa0;\nParagraph 23(3) – amending section 129\n65.\n&#xa0; \nThis paragraph inserts a new section 129(1B) and (1C) which set out the circumstances in which the Registrar may require a person who applies for a licence for the purpose of gaining experience in giving driving instruction to submit to an emergency control assessment. The circumstances are that the Registrar has reasonable grounds for believing that the applicant would be unable to take control of a motor car of a prescribed class if an emergency arose while he was giving driving instruction.\n   \nParagraph 23(4) – amending section 129(2)\n66.\n&#xa0; \nIn consequence of the new system, paragraph 23(4) substitutes a new section 129(2) to set out the circumstances in which the Registrar must grant a licence to persons seeking to gain experience in giving driving instruction. The amendment preserves the existing power to prescribe a fee for the granting of such a licence. \n&#xa0;\nParagraph 23(6) – amending section 129\n67.\n&#xa0; \nUnder section 129(5) a licence granted for the purpose of enabling a person to gain experience in giving driving instruction may be granted subject to prescribed conditions. Paragraph 23(6) amends section 129 to provide that those conditions may include-\n(a) \na\n condition requiring the person granted the licence, if required to do so by the Registrar at a time when the circumstances in section 129(1C) apply, to submit to an emergency control assessment within a prescribed period;  \n(b) \na\n condition requiring that, if driving instruction is to be given in circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation of an emergency arising which necessitates the instructor taking control of the car, a person will only give such instruction if they  would be able to take control of the car if such an emergency arose. \n&#xa0;\nParagraph 25(4) \nand (5) – amending section \n133A\n(\n2) and (6)\n68.\n&#xa0; \nSection \n133A(\n2) sets out in full the meaning of “emergency control assessment”. It refers to an assessment of a person’s ability to take control of a motor car of a class covered by the disabled person’s limited driving licence. This is no longer appropriate as, under the new system, people who are not disabled may also be required to undertake emergency control assessments. Paragraph 25(4) therefore amends section \n133A(\n2) to refer instead \nto an assessment of a person’s ability to take control of a motor car of a prescribed class. Paragraph 25(5) makes a consequential amendment to section \n133A(\n6) which deals with the issue of emergency control certificates\n.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n69.\n&#xa0; \nThe amendments to Part 5 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 set out above expand the existing powers to make regulations in relation to driving instruction under that Part. The department continues to consider that the power to make such provision should be delegated to the Secretary of State as a regulation-making power. The detail of such provisions is more appropriate to secondary legislation. There is also likely to be a need to amend such provisions and make further provision from time to time which would be less conveniently achieved if contained in primary legislation.  \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of p\narliamentary scrutiny\n70.\n&#xa0; \nThe negative resolution procedure applies, by virtue of section 195(3) of the Road Traffic Act 1988, to the existing powers to make regulations under Part 5 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the department continues to believe that this is appropriate. There should be Parliamentary scrutiny as the new powers extend to matters which are important to becoming and remaining a driving instructor but these are not so significant as to merit the affirmative procedure. \n&#xa0;\nClause 7: Suppliers of fuel and fireplaces &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPower conferred on: \n              \n              \nThe Secretary of State \n&#xa0;\nPower exercisable by: \n              \nPublication of a list  \n&#xa0;\nParliamentary procedure:\n              \n None\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n71.\n&#xa0; \nClause\n 7 provides for the amendment of\n Part 3, sections 20 and 21, of the Clean Air Act 1993 \nwhich deals with \nSmoke Control Areas\n.\n \nUnder Part 3, it is an offence to emit smoke from the chimney of any building, or to emit smoke from a chimney (not being a chimney of a building) which serves the furnace of any fixed boiler or industrial plant, within a smoke control area unless using an authorised fuel or exempted appliance.  It is also an offence under section 23 to acquire or sell an unauthorised fuel within a smoke control area unless it is to be used under the specified requirements of an exempted appliance.\n&#xa0;\n72.\n&#xa0; \nCurrently the Secretary of State has the power under sections 20 and 21 of the Clean Air Act 1993 to authorise fuels by regulations and to exempt \nclasses of fireplaces by \norder\n.  The regulations and \norder\n are made by statutory instrument. They are made every six months (April and September) in England to coincide with the common commencement dates.  \n&#xa0;\n73.\n&#xa0; \nAuthorised fuels and exempted fireplaces are not identified individually within the Clean Air Act 1993 but have been the subject of the power of delegated legislation as this allows new fuels and fireplaces to be authorised and exempted as they are developed. This Bill includes a modification to the\n \nprocedure by which thi\ns delegated power is exercised.\n74.\n&#xa0; \nThis change to the procedure applies in relation to\n England only.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the change in delegation\n75.\n&#xa0; \nManufacturers submit their products for testing to determine whether they are capable of being used without producing any smoke or a substantial quantity of smoke. The results are then checked by authorised contractors who subsequently make recommendations to the Secretary of State for inclusion in the six monthly \nSIs\n.\n \n76.\n&#xa0; \nUnder the Red Tape Challenge\n,\n \nthe \nGovernment made a commitment to simplify the process of exemption and authorisation, with a view to reducing burdens and improving efficiency.  Interested parties advised that the main burden associated with the current process was the delay between receiving a recommendation from authorised contractors and subsequent inclusion in the SIs.\n&#xa0;\n77.\n&#xa0; \nTo reduce the burden associated with the delay the Bill will amend sections 20 and 21 of the Clean Air Act to provide the Secretary of State with powers to authorise fuels and exempt appliances administratively by the publication of lists\n, thus avoiding \nthe need for the production of the six monthly \nSIs\n.  The government intends that this power would be exercised by publishing lists on the gov.uk website. Initial lists of authorised fuels and exempt appliances would be published upon the commencement of this provision; these lists would include the products approved under the existing SIs to ensure that these do not lose their approved status. Thereafter updated versions of the lists would be published on a monthly basis as new products are approved.  This will allow manufacturers to bring their products to market more rapidly and allow consumers access to latest \nthe \ntechnology.  The new procedure would enable lists to be updated and published as deemed necessary and if changes are required these will be made on a specific date each month.  The published lists will include details of the product type, conditions of use and date of grant, withdrawal\n or variation of any approval.\n Consumers without internet facilities may obtain access to the information via the \nDefra\n Helpline\n or by writing to or emailing the d\nepartment direct.\n&#xa0;\nJustification \nof the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n78.\n&#xa0; \nIn \norder to qualify for\n inclusion in the published lists, products must continue to meet the current requirements to demonstrate they are capable of being used without producing any smoke or a substantial quantity of smoke, therefore the safety and eligibility of these products for use in smoke control areas will remain unchanged. List publication and amendment will be subject to a robust system of quality controls and approval by senior staff.  The dates that products are added to the lists will be specified as will the dates of \nany  variations\n or withdrawals of approvals. This will ensure that there is legal certainty with respect to which products may or may not be used, or, in the case of fuels, sold and acquired for use in a smoke control area at any given point in time.  \n&#xa0;\n79.\n&#xa0; \nThe offences under sections 20 and 23 regarding the emission of smoke and the sale and acquisition of fuels for use within a smoke control area are not changed by the \nB\nill.  \n&#xa0;\n80.\n&#xa0; \nThe authorisation or exemption of a product would only be withdrawn if evidence which demonstrates that the product does not meet the eligibility criteria for use in a smoke control area came to light. \nThe department\n is not aware of any appliance exemption being withdrawn to date.  Some authorised fuels have been removed in the past as manufacture had ceased and the fuel had not been available for many years.  Variations of authorisations and exemptions have previously consisted of changes to brand name or manufacturer’s name and the SIs have indicated any previously known names for clarity.  It is not intended to change this process.\n&#xa0;\n81.\n&#xa0; \nIn the event of evidence indicating that a product authorisation should be withdrawn \nthe department\n would liaise with interested parties first to investigate the validity of the evidence and then to ensure the withdrawal is publicised appropriately and where possible consumers are notified of the withdrawal.  The new centralised lists will highlight the date at which any withdrawals or amendments were made which is an improvement on the current system where it would be necessary to compare lengthy product lists in the SIs in \norder\n for consumers and \nlocal authorities \nto identify any changes in the status of a product.  Finally there are some inherent additional legal safeguards to protect consumers and manufacturers.  The first of these is the requirement in the Clean Air Act 1993 to publish the lists.  The other is that a decision to withdraw an authorisation/exemption would be subject to judicial review if it is not taken correctly.  \n&#xa0;\nClause 9: Authorisation of insolvency practitioners&#xa0;Power conferred on:\n              \n              \nThe\n Secretary of State\nPower exercised by:\n              \n              \nOrder made by statutory i\nnstrument\nParliamentary procedure:\n              \nNegative\n Resolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n82.\n&#xa0; \nClause 9 will amend Part 13 of the Insolvency Act 1986 to allow individuals to be authorised to act as an insolvency practitioner in relation to certain categories of appointment only.   Currently, individuals who are authorised to act as an insolvency practitioner are authorised in relation to all categories of appointment.  \n&#xa0;\n83.\n&#xa0; \nThe amendments to Part 13 will provide for a person to be either fully authorised to act as an insolvency practitioner and practise in all categories of appointment or to be partially authorised to act only in relation to companies or only in relation to individuals.   \n&#xa0;\n84.\n&#xa0; \nThe clause will also prevent partially authorised insolvency practitioners from acting in relation to a company or individual that is, or was, a member of a partnership that has outstanding liabilities, without permission from the court. Such appointments require an individual to be fully authorised because this type of insolvency requires knowledge of both company and individual insolvency law.  \n&#xa0;\n85.\n&#xa0; \nThe new order-\nmaking \n \npower\n conferred as part of these changes is\n exercisable in relation to England and Wales and Scotland\n.\nThe effect of the \nprovision\n86.\n&#xa0; \nThe clause will amend section 391 of the Insolvency Act 1986 relating to recognised professional bodies.  Section 391(1) and (2) will confer powers on the Secretary of State by \norder\n:\nIn each case, an \norder\n may be made only if it appears to the Secretary of State that the body regulates the practice of a profession and maintains and enforces rules for ensuring that its insolvency specialist members are fit and proper persons to act as insolvency practitioners and meet acceptable requirements as to education practical training and experience.   An \norder\n which recognises a body for the purposes of granting partial authorisations has to state whether the partial authorisation relates to companies or to individuals.\n&#xa0;\n87.\n&#xa0; \nSection 391(5) will require the Secretary of State by \norder\n to revoke a professional body’s recognition where it appears that the body no longer meets the relevant requirements. The Secretary of State must also revoke recognition of a professional body in relation to full authorisations and replace it with recognition in relation to partial authorisations if\n \nit appears to the Secretary of State that the body is capable of providing its insolvency specialist members with partial authorisation only.  The Secretary of State may in the relevant \norder\n make transitional provisions to treat the body’s insolvency \nspecialist members as fully or partially authorised, as the case may be, for a specified period after recognition is revoked, or revoked and replaced.\n&#xa0;\n88.\n&#xa0; \nAn \norder\n under section 391 must be made using the negative procedure by virtue of section 419 of the 1986 Act.  \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n89.\n&#xa0; \nThe powers to recognise professional bodies which may authorise their members to act as an insolvency practitioner and to revoke a body’s recognition in section 391 have been delegated since the Insolvency Act 1986 came into effect.  The clause will replace these powers with powers enabling the \ndepartment\n to recognise professional bodies in relation to full authorisation or in relation to partial authorisation.  Professional bodies which are currently recognised will be treated as bodies capable of providing full authorisations.\n&#xa0;\n90.\n&#xa0; \nThe d\nepartment considers that such powers should continue to be delegated to the Secretary of State.  Delegation will allow the \ndepartment \nthe flexibility to determine in any specific case whether or not a professional body meets or continues to meet the requirements for recognition and whether or not it is or continues to be capable of granting full authorisations or is capable of providing partial authorisations only.  It will enable the \ndepartment\n to take swift action pursuant to its determination.  A need to use primary legislation to address such issues would inevitably lead to delay and difficulty. \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n91.\n&#xa0; \nThe d\nepartment considers it appropriate that \norder\ns relating to the recognition of professional bodies which regulate insolvency practitioners should continue to be made using the negative resolution procedure.  Decisions relating to the recognition of bodies which regulate insolvency practitioners can be taken by the executive to a large extent and do not\n merit the additional level of p\narliamentary scrutiny afforded by the affirmative procedure.  \n&#xa0;\nClause 10(3): New section 519A Companies Act 2006Power conferred on\n: \n              \nThe\n Secretary of State\nPower exercised by:\n              \nOrder\n made by statutory instrument\nParl\niamentary procedure: \n              \nNegative R\nesolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n92.\n&#xa0; \nThis clause inserts new section 519A into the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”). Subsection (1) defines \nlisted\n company and, also, non-\nlisted\n company, for the purposes of Part 16 (removal, resignation, etc of auditors). \n&#xa0;\n93.\n&#xa0; \nA \nlisted\n company is defined as a company whose “transferable securities” (these include shares and bonds) are included in the “official list” – in other words they have a main (London Stock Exchange) market listing – or whose shares are listed on a comparable market elsewhere in the EEA. A non-\nlisted\n company is defined as a company that is not a \nlisted\n company.\n&#xa0;\n94.\n&#xa0; \nIn the context of auditors ceasing to hold office and the amendments to the Act being made by clause 10, there is a distinction between a \nlisted\n company and a non-\nlisted \ncompany and an enhanced framework of regulatory requirements applies in the case of the former. For instance, if an auditor of a \nlisted\n company is ceasing to hold office that auditor must in all cases send the company a statement of reasons as to why he or she is stepping down. If an auditor of a non-\nlisted\n company is ceasing to hold office, however, that requirement does not apply in all cases – it applies where an auditor leaves before the end of his or her term and either one or more of the auditor’s reasons for leaving is of regulatory interest or there are matters which the auditor thinks the company’s shareholders or creditors should know about.  \n&#xa0;\n95.\n&#xa0; \nThe sending of such a statement leads in turn to other obligations on the part of the auditor or the recipient – for instance, the company must (generally speaking) send a copy of such to a statement to its shareholders and creditors and to the Registrar of Companies.\n&#xa0;\nDevolution\n96.\n&#xa0; \nThe new order-making\n power\n conferred by the \nclause \n is\n exer\ncisable in relation to \nEngland and Wales, \nScotland and Northern Ireland\n. In relation to \nNorthern \nIreland, this i\ns a transferred area. Discussions with the devolved administration about seeking a legislative consent motion. \nThe effect of the \nprovision\n97.\n&#xa0; \nSubsection (5) of new section 519A provides that the Secretary of State may by \norder\n amend the definition of \nlisted\n company. Since a non-\nlisted\n company is simply defined as a company that is not a \nlisted\n company, amending the definition of \nlisted\n \ncompany\n \n will\n simultaneously have the effect of altering what is a non-\nlisted\n company. \n&#xa0;\n98.\n&#xa0; \nAmending the definition of \nlisted\n company may be a relatively trivial matter – markets may change over time and the power could, for instance, be used to update terms and references used in the then current definitions (the power may already have been used of course) that have become obsolete. The power could, however, be used to provide that certain types of company, in respect of which the enhanced framework does not apply, will thereupon be subject to that framework. An example would be amending the definition to include companies that are listed on secondary markets or which are currently unlisted but, because of their size or the sector in which they operate, are of \nconsiderable economic or public importance.  Conversely, the power could be used to amend the definition to exclude a type of company from the list of \ncompanies  in\n respect of which the enhanced framework applies.   \n&#xa0;\n99.\n&#xa0; \nSubsection (6) of new section 519A provides that an \norder\n pursuant to new subsection (5) is subject to the negative resolution procedure.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n100.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAmending the definition of \nlisted\n compa\nny is justified because of the department\n’s wish for flexibility as regards keeping the current (and any future) definitions up-to-date and as regards determining precisely what type of company will or will not be covered by the enhanced framework of auditor leaving statement requirements.     \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n101.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn balance, and notwithstanding that this is a Henry VIII power, the department considers that the negative resolution procedure is appropriate. This is because, and as explained above, such a power might only be used in a very minor way – bringing references and terms used in the then current definitions up-to-date. Even if the power is used in a more material way, there will be cases in which there are no practical consequences. For instance, where the power is used to add new types of company (and thereby apply the enhanced framework to the same), the auditor of such a company may be sending the company a leaving statement in a case in which, prior to the exercise of the power, he would also have had to have sent such a statement – i.e. because he or she was leaving prior to the end of his or her term and, for example, there were matters which he or she thought the company’s shareholders needed to know about.  Moreover, these are technical, regulatory matters such that in any event the use of the power is not expected to attract widespread interest or be controversial. In th\ne circumstances, the d\nepartment does not consider that the a\ndditional procedures and p\narliamentary engagement associated with an affirmative resolution procedure statutory instrument can be justified. \n&#xa0;\n102.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are a number of existing Henry VIII powers on the face of the Act in respect of which the negative resolution procedure applies and which might therefore be considered a precedent. Section 857(1) is a power to make regulations further providing for the contents of a company’s annual return and subsection (2) provides that these regulations may amend the existing provisions at sections 855 and 856. Section 1099(4) relates to the Registrar of Companies obligations to keep an index of the names of companies and other bodies and allows the Secretary of State by \norder\n to amend the list of other bodies at section 1099(3). Section 1160(1) is a power to make regulations amending the definitions of “subsidiary”, “holding company” or “wholly-owned subsidiary” – see section 1159 of and \nSchedule\n 6 to the Act. Note that, like the proposed power to amend the definition of “public interest \ncompany\n”, each of these powers may be used in material way - making bodies or other persons subject to new obligations or, conversely, \nremoving obligations to which bodies or other persons are subject.  \n&#xa0;\n103.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPlease note that the department\n is considering whether it would be preferable to replace the terms ‘listed company’ and ‘non-listed company’\n with alternative labels before the Bill is introduced in Parliament. \n  \n&#xa0;\nClauses 13 – 17; and clause 18, which introduces Schedule 6 &#xa0;\nGeneral introduction to the ‘rights of way’\n provisions\n104.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy way of general background to these measures, Part 3 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (“the 1981 Act”) requires local authorities in England and Wales to maintain and keep under review maps and statements showing public rights of way in their area. The local authorities concerned are referred to in that Act as “surveying authorities” and the maps and statements are referred to as “definitive maps and statements”. Part 3 also sets out the procedures which apply where an authority wishes to make a change to the definitive map and statement for its area or where someone applies for such a change to be made.\n&#xa0;\n105.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA definitive map and statement is conclusive evidence of certain matters. For example, if a map shows a footpath, this is generally conclusive evidence that the public had a right of way on foot over the land on a particular date.\n&#xa0;\n106.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome rights of way are not recorded on a definitive map and statement. Section 53 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (“the 2000 Act”). \nprovides\n for unrecorded rights of way created before 1949 to be extinguished immediately after 1 January 2026 (known as the “cut-off date”), subject to certain exceptions. \n&#xa0;\n107.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 2000 Act also confers power on the Secretary of State to, by regulations, make transitional provisions and savings, in particular for cases where (a) orders modifying definitive maps and statements have been made but not confirmed before the cut-off date; (b) applications for definitive map orders have been submitted before the cut-off date; or (c) orders have been quashed because of a legal error (section 56(2\n)(\nb)).\n&#xa0;\n108.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Highways Act 1980 (“the 1980 Act”) also deals with public rights of way. For example, it allows applications to be made, in certain circumstances, to extinguish or divert a public right of way.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n109.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe new delegated powers conferred by the rights of way provisions in the Bill \nare  exercisable\n in relation to England only. \n&#xa0;\nClause 13: Unrecorded rights of way: protection from extinguishment&#xa0;\nPower conferred on\n: \n              \nThe\n Secretary of State\nPower exercised by:\n              \nRegulations made by statutory instrument. \n(Extension of existing regulation making power.)\nParl\niamentary procedure: \n              \nNegative R\nesolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n110.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis clause provides the Secretary of State with a method to protect certain public rights of way from extinguishment in 2026. \n&#xa0;\n111.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe general background to this, as explained in the general introduction to \nthe rights of way provisions\n, is that Part 3 of the 1981 Act requires local authorities in England and Wales to maintain and keep under review maps and statements showing public rights of way in their area. \n&#xa0;\n112.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome rights of way are not recorded on a definitive map and statement. Section 53 of the 2000 Act provides for the extinguishment, immediately after cut-off date, of unrecorded rights of way created before 1949, subject to certain limited exceptions. \n&#xa0;\n113.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat Act also confers power on the Secretary of State to, by regulations, make transitional provisions and savings (see the general introduction to \nthe rights of way provisions for further details of this.) \n&#xa0;\n114.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is thought that, in the period immediately before the cut-off date, there will be a large volume of applications to surveying authorities for modifications to be made to the definitive map and statement to show rights of way that are currently unrecorded. This is because individuals and groups in the voluntary sector are likely to carry out research so that they can make applications to have unrecorded rights of way shown on a definitive map and statement (with the result that they will not be automatically extinguished after that date). There is concern that surveying authorities will also carry out research into unrecorded rights of way during this period in order to comply with the requirement that they keep under review definitive maps and statements. This could lead to surveying authorities unnecessarily duplicating the work of individuals and the voluntary sector.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the \nprovision\n115.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe clause therefore inserts a new section 56A in the 2000 Act. This extends the regulation-making power in section 56(2) of that \nAct  to\n enable the Secretary of State to make regulations enabling a surveying authority to designate, during a period of one year after the cut-off date, public rights of way extinguished immediately after that date under section 53 of that Act. The exercise of the power is subject to the negative resolution procedure (see section 56(6) of that Act).  The new section 56A also sets out what else may be included in the regulations. It is envisaged that the power to make regulations will be used to provide for designated rights to cease to be regarded as extinguished as from the time of designation. Where a right is designated, surveying authorities will be required to decide whether to modify the definitive map and statement to show the right of way. If a right of way is then sho\nwn on the map, it will remain non-\nextinguished. If the authority decides not to show the right of way, it will normally be extinguished again. \n&#xa0;\n116.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProvision may also be made as to the procedure applicable in relation to such a determination. The provision that may be made by virtue of subsection (1\n)(\nd) includes provision applying \nSchedule\n 15 to the 1981 Act, subject to such modifications as may be specified in the regulations.\n&#xa0;\n117.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClause 13 is in the nature of a transitional or savings provisi\non. It is about \nthe  transition\n \nto a position where certain unrecorded public rights of way will no longer be able to be added to definitive maps and statements. It also provides a method to save unrecorded rights that would otherwise be extinguished on the cut-off date. It enables surveying authorities to wait until after the cut-off date to assess what research has been carried out by individuals and voluntary organisations. There will be a one-year period after that date within which they can act under the regulations to prevent rights of way being permanently extinguished. They will therefore be able to avoid duplicating any work done by individuals and voluntary organisations and focus, during the one-year period following the cut-off date, on areas where research has not been carried out by individuals and voluntary organisations.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n118.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs explained above in the description of the effect of clause 13, the clause is in the nature of a transitional or savings provision. As explained in the general introduction to \nthe rights of way provisions\n, the 2000 Act already confers power on the Secretary of State to, by \nregulations,\n make transitional provisions and savings in relation to the cut-off date. \nThe department\n therefore considers it appropriate that further provision for \ntransition and savings is also \ndealt with by delegated legislation. \n&#xa0;\n119.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe department\n also considers it appropriate that the procedure for the determination in relation to a designated public right of way be dealt with by delegated legislation. Clause 13 provides that the provision that may be made by virtue of subsection (1\n)(\nd) includes provision applying \nSchedule\n 15 to the 1981 Act, subject to such modifications as may be specified in the regulations. \nThe department’s\n intention is to introduce a procedure that closely follows the procedure set out in \nSchedule\n 15. However, due to the \nfact that the procedure will apply for only a transitory period, and deal with designated public rights of way (and not rights of way generally), it is anticipated that various modifications of \nSchedule\n 15 will be required. \nThe department\n has not finalised the details of the modified procedure, and needs the flexibility afforded by the regulation-making power.\n&#xa0;\nJustificat\nion of the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n120.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs described above in the description of the effect of the clause, the exercise of the power is subject to the negative resolution procedure. Clause 13 sets out in some detail the matters which may be provided for in the transitory period during which public rights of way may be designated. \nThe department \nconsiders in view of this that the negative resolution procedure is appropriate and proportionate.\n&#xa0;\n121.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 56(2) of the 2000 Act also provides a precedent for transitional and savings provision relating to the cut-off date being subject to negative resolution procedure. \nThe department \ndoes not see any good reason to depart from that in this case. One consequence of applying a different level of scrutiny in this case would be that provision for transition and savings would be fragmented, which\n the department\n considers a disadvantage for users.\n&#xa0;\nClause 15: Applications by owners etc for public path orders \n&#xa0;\nPower conferred on\n: \n              \nThe\n Secretary of State\nPower exercised by:\n              \nRegulations made by statutory instrument\nParl\niamentary procedure: \n              \nNegative R\nesolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\n122.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis clause provides the Secretary of State with a method to extend the circumstances in which applications to extinguish or divert certain public rights of way may be made.\n&#xa0;\n123.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe background to this clause, as explained in the general introduction to \nthe rights of way provisions, is that\n the 1980 Act also deals with public rights of way. For example, it allows applications to be made, in certain circumstances, to extinguish or divert a public right of way.\n&#xa0;\n124.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnder section 118ZA of the 1980 Act, owners, lessees and occupiers of land used for agriculture, forestry or the breeding of keeping of horses may apply to a local authority for an order (“a public path extinguishment order”) which extinguishes a public \nright of way over a footpath or bridleway crossing the land.  Section 119ZA of that Act confers a comparable right to apply for an order to divert such a right of way (“a public path diversion order”).  \n&#xa0;\n125.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnder the current law, applications for a public path extinguishment order or a public path diversion order cannot be made in relation to other land, even where there would be good reasons for making such an order. \n&#xa0;\n126.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurther background to this clause is that under section 121D applicants for public path extinguishment orders or public path diversion orders have a right of appeal to the Secretary of State, in certain circumstances.\n&#xa0;\nThe e\nffect of the \nprovision\n127.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSubsections (2) and (3) of the clause therefore amend, respectively, sections 118ZA(1) and 119ZA(1) of the 1980 Act to allow the Secretary of State to prescribe in regulations other kinds of land in England in respect of which such applications may be made. The effect of section 325(2) of that Act is that the exercise of the power is subject to the negative resolution procedure.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n128.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs explained above in the introduction to this clause, applicants for public path extinguishment orders or public path diversion orders have a right of appeal to the Secretary of State, in certain circumstances. The Secretary of State has only limited powers to recover the costs of these kinds of appeals and thus is forced to bear some of the costs. Extending the circumstances in which applications may be made is therefore likely to have a bearing on public finances. \nThe department \nneeds the flexibility afforded by the delegated legislative power.\n The \ndepartment \n intends\n to consider extending the circumstances in which applications may be made on an incremental basis, with coverage of the provisions being extended in light of the actual take up of the right of appeal and the impact on public finances.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n129.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs explained above in the description of the effect of the clause, the exercise of this power is subject to the negative resolution procedure.  As described above, subsections \n(2) and (3) of the clause amend\n the 1980 Act to allow the Secretary of State to prescribe in regulations certain kinds of land in England in respect of which applications for public path extinguishment or diversion orders may be made. \nThe department\n considers this is important, but not so important as\n to require a higher degree of p\narliamentary scrutiny than that offered by the negative resolution procedure. \nThe department \ntherefore considers the negative resolution procedure to be appropriate and proportionate.\n&#xa0;\nClause 17: Applications for certain orders under Highways Act 1980: cost recoveryPower conferred on:\n              \n              \nThe\n Secretary of State\nPower exercised by:\n&#xa0;\n              \n&#xa0;\nR\negulations made by statutory instrument. \n(Extension of existing\n \nregulation making power.)\nParliamentary\n procedure: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Affirmative R\nesolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction \n130.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis clause provides the Secretary of State with a method to enable local authorities to fix charges for certain orders under the \nHighways Act \n1980 Act locally. \n&#xa0;\n131.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nThe background to this clause is that sections 118ZA and 119ZA of the \nHighways Act 1980\n allow owners, lessees or occupiers of certain land to apply to local authorities for public path extinguishment orders or public path diversion orders. The amendments made by this clause deal with the recovery of costs in respect of such applications.\n&#xa0;\n132.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nCurrently, the sections contain powers which allow the Secretary of State, in relation to England, or the Welsh Ministers, in relation to Wales, to prescribe charges payable on the making of such applications (and further charges where an order is made on the application). Under such regulations, the authority dealing with the application would be able to recover its costs but only up to the prescribed amount which would be set centrally and may not be at a level which would allow the authority to recover all of its costs.\n&#xa0;\n133.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n&#xa0;\n \nThe Secretary of State has a general power in section 150 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 (“1989 Act”) to allow authorities to allow local authorities to charge for certain things locally. The power is exercised by delegated legislation. However, this power is only available where there is no other power or duty to impose a charge.\nThe e\nffect of the \nprovision\n134.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe clause therefore amends sections 118ZA and 119ZA of the\n Highways Act\n 1980 so as to limit the application of the charging provisions within those sections to Wales. The effect of this is to allow the Secretary of State (in relation to England) to use the power under section 150 of the 1989 Act to authorise charges to be imposed in respect of applications under sections 118ZA and 119ZA. \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n135.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe power in section 150 of the 1989 Act is exercisable by delegated legislation.\n&#xa0;\n \nThe clause has the effect of allowing the delegated power in section 150 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 to be exercised in circumstances where it couldn\n’t currently be exercised. The department\n therefore considers that clause 17 should be justified.\n&#xa0;\n136.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 150 provides a precedent for the delegation of legislative powers to the Secretary of State to allow local authorities to \ncharge for certain things. The department\n considers it appropriate that this precedent is followed in respect of charges for certain orders under the Highways Act\n 1980.\nJustification of the level of p\narliamentary scrutiny\n137.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe department\n considers it appropriate that the power in section 150 of the 1989 \nAct ,\n as extended by the clause, continues to be  subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. \n&#xa0;Clause 18 and Schedule 6 paragraph 3: Modifications arising from administrative errors&#xa0;\nPower conferred on\n: \n              \nThe\n Secretary of State\nPower exercised by:\n              \nRegulations made by statutory instrument\nParl\niamentary procedure: \n              \nNegative R\nesolution\n&#xa0;Introduction\n138.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis provision provides the Secretary of State with power to introduce a modified procedure for the correction of administrative errors in maps and statements of public rights of way.\n&#xa0;\n139.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe background to this, as explained in the general introduction to \nthe rights of way provisions\n, is that Part 3 of the 1981 Act requires local authorities in England and Wales to maintain and keep under review maps and statements showing public rights of way in their area.\n&#xa0;\n140.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSchedule\ns 14 and 15 to the1981 Act set out the procedure which applies where an authority wishes to make a change to the definitive map and statement for its area or where someone applies for such a change to be made. There is provision for such things as the making of applications, the making of orders, notification, publicity, consultation, referral (of opposed orders), determination, and finally, confirmation. \n&#xa0;\n141.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdministrative errors, such as a reference accompanying a path on a map to “FP23” when the path is in fact “FP33”, are often found in definitive maps and statements. There is currently not any separate procedure to deal with such cases. Surveying authorities are expected to follow the procedure in \nSchedule\ns 14 and 15 to the 1981 Act. This is unnecessarily burdensome in cases where errors are obvious and very unlikely to be contentious. \n&#xa0;\nThe e\nffect of the\n provision\n142.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe provision therefore inserts a new section 53ZA in the 1981 Act. Under this provision the Secretary of State may introduce a modified procedure for the correction of administrative errors. The procedure must follow the existing procedure in \nSchedule\ns 14 and 15 with such modifications as are prescribed in regulations. Subsection (3) provides that the exercise of this power is subject to negative resolution procedure.\n&#xa0;\n143.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSubsection (1\n)(\na) to (c) specifies the circumstances where surveying authorities may use the new procedure. Firstly, authorities must be satisfied that an event of the kind specified in section 53(3\n)(\nc) of the 1981 Act must have occurred (these are known as “evidentiary events”). An evidentiary event includes such things as the discovery by an authority that a public right of way shown on the definitive map of a particular description ought to be shown as a way of a different description.  Secondly, they must be satisfied that the need for the modification has arisen because of an administrative error. Thirdly, they must be satisfied that both the error and the modification needed to correct it are obvious. Surveying authorities must have regard to any guidance given by the Secretary of State in judging whether subsection (1\n)(\na) to (c) has been met.\n&#xa0;\n144.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe purpose of the provision is to provide a method to introduce a shorter procedure for correcting administrative errors in definitive maps and statements.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n145.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe department\n envisages that the modified procedure will generally be same as the procedure in \nSchedule\ns 14 and 15 to the 1981 Act, with modifications to make it shorter and more appropriate given the subject matter of administrative errors. The existing procedure relating to changes to definitive maps and statements is prescribed in primary legislation. \nThe department\n considers that the correction of administrative errors is important, but not so important as to require that the procedure for correcting administrative erro\nrs be subject to the degree of p\narliamentary scrutiny associated with primary legislation. As explained above in the description of the effect of the provision, the clause sets out in detail the circumstances in which surveying authorities may use the modified procedure.\n&#xa0;\n146.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe department\n needs the flexibility afforded by a delegated legislative power. This will enable \nthe department \nto change procedure relatively quickly, in view of practical experience and changes in case law.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n147.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs explained above in the description of the effect of the clause, the exercise of the power is subject to negative resolution procedure. As explained above the power to introduce a modified procedure is limited to relatively minor issues (administrative errors). \nThe department \nconsiders therefore that the negative resolution procedure is appropriate and proportionate.\n&#xa0;\nClause 18 and Schedule 6 paragraph 4: Register of applications under section 53&#xa0;\nPower conferred on\n: \n              \n              \nThe\n Secretary of State\nPower exercised by:\n              \n              \nRegulations \nmade by statutory instrument\nParl\niamentary procedure: \n              \nNegative R\nesolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n148.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis provision provides the Secretary of State with a method to specify that the duty to keep a register of applications under Part 3 of the 1981 Act does not apply to certain applications.\n&#xa0;\n149.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs described above in the general introduction, Part 3 of that Act requires local authorities in England and Wales to maintain and keep under review definitive maps and statements showing public rights of way in their area. Part 3 also sets out the procedures which apply where someone applies to a surveying authority for a change to be made to a definitive map and statement. \n&#xa0;\n150.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection \n53B(\n1) of that Act requires surveying authorities to keep a register of applications. Section 53B(6) provides that where section 53B mentions “prescribed” this means prescribed by the Secretary of State by regulations subject to the negative resolution procedure.\n&#xa0;\n151.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraph 6(4) inserts a new subsection (4A) into section 53B of the 1981 Act. \n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the provision\n&#xa0;\n152.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe new provision states that regulations may provide that section 53B(1) does not apply with respect to applications made in England, or to any prescribed description of such applications, unless the authority serve notice under paragraph 1A(4)(b) of \nSchedule\n 14 in relation to such an application. The effect of this is to confer a new delegated legislative power on the Secretary of State.\n&#xa0;\n153.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraph 1A(4)(b) refers to notice being given of an authority’s decision to determine an application having concluded under paragraph 1A that there is a reasonable basis for the applicant’s belief that the definitive map and statement should be changed.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the d\nelegation\n154.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe department’s\n policy is that the duty to register applications generally should not apply with respect to applications made in England, unless the authority has served notice as described above. However, \nthe department\n is still considering whether it might wish to make exceptions to this general policy in respect of certain categories of application. \nThe department\n therefore needs the flexibility afforded by the delegation of legislative power. Section 53B(1) and (6) also provides a precedent for conferring delegated power on the Secretary of State to prescribe the information that might be contained in the register in regulations. \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of parliamentary scrutiny\n155.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection \n53B(\n6) provides a precedent for regulations subject to the negative resolution procedure for prescribing the information that must be kept in the register. Whilst the exclusion of information from the register of all applications for changes to definitive maps and statements is an important matter, \nthe department \ndoes not consider it so important that the affirmative resolution procedure ought to apply. There is very little public interest in applications for changes to definitive maps and statements where there is no reasonable basis for such changes to be made. However, the private landowner over whose land the alleged right subsists, may have some, albeit mild interest in an application notwithstanding that there is no reasonable basis for it. \nThe department\n therefor\ne considers that some level of p\narliamentary scrutiny is merited and that the negative resolution procedure is appropriate and proportionate. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClause 18 and Schedule 6 paragraph 5: Modifications of definitive map by consent: England&#xa0;\nPower conferred on: \n              \nSurveying authorities\nPower exercised by:\n              \nOrder\n \nParliamentary procedure: \n              \nNone\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n156.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis provision provides the Secretary of State with power to introduce a shorter procedure for changes to definitive maps and statements of public rights of way where landowners give their consent.\n&#xa0;\n157.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy way of background, as explained in the general introduction to \nthe rights of way provisions\n, Part 3 of the 1981 Act requires local authorities in England and Wales to maintain and keep under review maps and statements showing public rights of way in their area.\n The local authorities concerned are referred to in that Act as “surveying authorities” and the maps and statements are referred to as “definitive maps and statements”.\n&#xa0;\n158.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPart 3 also sets out the procedures which apply where an authority wishes to make a change to the definitive map and statement for its area or where someone applies for such a change to be made.\n&#xa0;\n159.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nHighways Act \n1980 also deals with public rights of way. For example, it allows applications to be made, in certain circumstances, to extinguish or divert a public right of way.\n&#xa0;\n160.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnrecorded rights of way created before 1949 are sometimes discovered by surveying authorities. In such cases landowners might not object to the addition of the rights to definitive maps and statements if the right of way in question is reasonably diverted, to allow for current land usage. However, there is currently no provision for surveying authorities to modify definitive maps and statements and divert the right under the same procedure.\n&#xa0;\nThe effect\n of the provision\n161.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe provision therefore inserts two new sections into the 1981 Act: sections 54B and 54C. The new section 54B sets out a new procedure by which an authority may by order modify the definitive map in consequence of certain kinds of application under section 53(5) of the Act. The new procedure is generally only available in respect of applications where evidence relates only to the existence of a right of way before 1949.\n&#xa0;\n162.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of the features of the new \nprocedure,\n is that a landowner over whose land an alleged public right of way subsists must consent to it being used. The authority may make \na ”\ndiversion order”, under section 54B(2)(a) in order to secure this consent. This may divert the public right of way in question. Section \n54B(\n3) provides that the effect of a diversion order is twofold. It will create a new public path, and extinguish the public right over so much of the existing path as is necessary to enable the diversion.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n163.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe department considers that the delegation is arguably a delegation of legislative power, and that the provision should be justified in this memorandum. As explained above under the description of the effect of the provision, a diversion order will have the effect of creating a new public path, and extinguishing the public right over so much of the existing path as is necessary to enable the diversion . As such, an order will affect the rights of the general public over the public over a public right of way being diverted.  A diversion order is therefore arguably \nlegislative\n in character as a “creation and promulgation of a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases”.\n \n&#xa0;\n164.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe provision confers power to make modification consent orders including special orders on surveying authorities. It is intended to give surveying authorities (which are generally local authorities) more scope to resolve disputes about the existence of public rights of way at a local level. The provision sets out the limits to the exercise of the power (for instance that the authority must obtain the consent of all landowners). There is also a precedent for the function of diverting rights of way to be delegated to local decision-makers (see section 119 of the 1980 Act which confers power on councils to by order divert certain\n kinds of public rights of way).\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of Parliamentary Scrutiny\n165.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe delegated power in this instance is exercised by order with no parliamentary scrutiny. \nThe department \nconsiders this to be appropriate as the power is delegated to local authorities. There is also a precedent for this. Orders diverting rights of way under section 119 of the 1980 Act are not generally subject to parliamentary scrutiny.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClause 18 and Schedule 6 paragraphs 6(4), 6(8) and 6(11): Ascertainment of rights of way: Part 1 – Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981: powers to prescribe forms&#xa0;\nPower conferred on\n: \n              \nThe\n Secretary of State\nPower exercised by:\n              \nRegulations\n made by statutory instrument\nParliamentary procedure: \n              \nNegative R\nesolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\n166.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese provisions provide the Secretary of State with a method for prescribing the form of various documents associated with the procedure for ascertaining public rights of way in England.\n&#xa0;\n167.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs described above in the general \nto the rights of way provisions\n, Part 3 of the 1981 Act requires local authorities in England and Wales to maintain and keep under review maps and statements showing public rights of way in their area. Part 3 introduces Schedule 14 to that Act which sets out the procedures which apply where an authority wishes to make a change to the definitive map and statement for its area or where someone applies for such a change to be made.\n&#xa0;\n168.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nVarious provisions in Schedule 14 delegate power to “prescribe” something. Paragraph 5 of Schedule 14 states that this power is exercisable by the Secretary of State by regulations subject to the negative resolution procedure. \nFor example, \nparagraph 1 of Schedule 14 provides that an “application shall be submitted in the prescribed form”. In this example paragraph 1 confers delegated power on the Secretary of State to prescribe the form of applications made under paragraph 1 in regulations.\n&#xa0;\n169.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraphs 6(4), 6(8) and 6(11)\n of Schedule 6 to the \nBill make various amendments to the existing procedure:\n&#xa0;\nThe e\nffect of the provisions\n&#xa0;\n170.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe effect of each of these new provisions is that where they refer to doing something “in the prescribed form” they confer a new delegated power. The power is, by virtue of paragraph 5 of Schedule 14 conferred on the Secretary of State and is exercisable by regulations pursuant to the negative resol\nution\n procedure.\n&#xa0;\nJustification for delegation\n&#xa0;\n171.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is precedent in Schedule 14 to the 1981 Act for the Secretary of State to prescribe in regulations the form of various notices and forms associated with the procedure for public rights of way in England (\neg\n paragraph 1 to Schedule 14:see \nparagraph 168 \n above). \nThe department\n considers it appropriate that the precedent is followed.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of level of parliamentary scrutiny\n&#xa0;\n172.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe exercise of the existing delegated powers to prescribe certain things in Schedule 14 are subject to negative resolution procedure (\neg\n paragraph 1 to Schedule 14\n:see\n \nparagraph 168\n above). \nThe department\n considers it appropriate that this precedent is followed\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClause 22 and Schedule 7 paragraph 8: removal of restrictions on provision of passenger rail services &#xa0;\nPower conferred on\n: \n              \nThe\n Secretary of State\nPower exercised by:\n              \nOrder made by statutory i\nnstrument (extension of existing \norder\n-making procedure)\nParl\niamentary procedure: \n              \nNegative R\nesolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n173.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis paragraph widens the scope of the conditions and other provisions which the Secretary of State may include in any \norder\n he makes under section 24 \nof the \nRailways Act 1993 (“the 1993 Act”) (i.e. an \norder\n exempting passenger rail services from the franchising regime of sections 23 to 31 of that Act). \n&#xa0;\n174.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMost main line passenger rail services in England and Wales are designated under section 23(1) of the 1993 Act as services to be provided under franchise agreements with the Secretary of State\n. These franchised services are provided by private rail operating companies under franchise agreements made with the Secretary of State under section 29. \n&#xa0;\n175.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBecause, under the 1993 Act, the Secretary of State is the sole main line passenger rail franchising authority for England and Wales, other persons cannot directly procure themselves main line rail services which have been designated for franchising. However the Secretary of State may, by \norder\n under section 24 of the 1993 Act, exempt services from designation and thus carve them out of the franchising system. This would enable others to provide main line r\nail services \ninstead of the Secretary of State. \n&#xa0;\n176.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is envisaged that the section 24 \norder\n making power would be used, in conjunction with clause 22 of the Bill, to enable Passenger Transport Executives to take over the provision of regional passenger rail services from central government.   \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n177.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese powers are exercisable \nin relation to rail services in En\ngland and Wales, and in Scotland other than\n for rail services which start and end in Scotland. \n&#xa0;\nThe effect of \nSchedule 7 paragraph 8\n \n178.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe effect of the paragraph is to insert a new section 24A into the 1993 Act which would expand the scope of conditions and provisions which the Secretary of State may include in a section 24 \norder\n. \n&#xa0;\n179.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 24A would enable the Secretary of State to apply similar railway asset protection, contract enforcement and asset transfer provisions in connection with an “operator agreement” (i.e. a contract for de-designated passenger rail services) as currently apply in connection with franchise agreements of the Secretary of State. \n&#xa0;\n180.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMore specifically section 24A would enable a section 24 de-designation \norder\n of the Secretary of State to: -\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n181.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSchedule\n 7 \nparagraph\n 8 only affects section 24 Railways Act 1993 de-designation \norder\ns made by the Secretary of State (i.e. \norder\ns which relate to passenger rail services other than ones which start and end in Scotland). \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n182.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe new section 24A of the 1993 Act would enable the Secretary of State, in carving out passenger rail services from the franchising system, to apply equivalent railway asset protection, contract enforcement and asset transfer provisions as would have continued to apply had they remained within the franchising regime. In that sense the Secretary of State would be able to maintain substantial continuity in the legal framework which applied.\n&#xa0;\n183.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n These railway asset protection provisions would ensure that assets needed for railway operations were kept intact, such that upon operator default or failure the railway operations could be taken over as a going concern by a successor, thus enabling continuity of passenger rail services.    \n&#xa0;\n184.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n The contract enforcement provisions would strengthen the ability of the procurement body to be able to secure compliance with the terms of the passenger services contract b\ny \nproviding a statutory enforcement system to complement the normal civil law enforcement processes. \n&#xa0;\n185.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe asset transfer provisions would enable a more effective and efficient transfer of railway assets from an outgoing operator to a successor upon contract expiry or early termination.   \n&#xa0;\n186.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n The \ndepartment\n envisages decentralisation of regional passenger rail services involving regional franchise operations being taken over by Passenger Transport Executives. This has led to a fresh look at relevant legislation to ensure any decentralisation could be made to work effectively. It seems logical in this context to enable de-designated regional passenger rail to be able to be underpinned by equivalent legal provisions to those that apply to franchised services. \n&#xa0;\n187.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n The d\nepartment considers it is appropriate for these issues to be addressed in secondary legislation because this would allow the Secretary of State to determine in any specific case, and within the scope of the powers, what provision should be made to apply. \n&#xa0;\n \nJustification of the level of p\narliamentary\n s\ncrutiny\n188.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe power under section 24 of the 1993 Act to make an \norder\n is exercisable by statutory instrument subject to negative\n resolution\n. A section 24 \norder\n is only made where the railway services in question are already subject to the franchise regime. The extended scope of the power would enable similar provisions to apply after franchise de-designation as already applied before de-designation. Any operator contracted to provide passenger rail services by a party in whose favour a section 24 \norder\n is made would be engaged by entry into a freely negotiated commercial contract in the knowledge that su\nch provisions would apply. The d\nepartment therefore considers that the extended scope to such \norder\ns, enabled by \nSchedule\n 7 paragraph 8 of the Bill, is not such as to m\nerit application of additional p\narliamentary scrutiny through the affirmative procedure. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClause 23(a) and Schedule 8, Part 1: Permit Schemes: Removal of requirement for Secretary of State approval&#xa0;\nPower conferred on: \n              \nThe relevant local authority \nPower exercised by:\n              \nLocal authority \norder\n \nParliamentary procedure: \n              \nN\none\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n189.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPermit schemes are designed to control the carrying out of specified works in the area covered by the scheme. Permit schemes cover both street works and works carried out by the local highway authority. A permit must be sought from the relevant local authority for works which are to be carried out in a street covered by a permit scheme. Currently, permit schemes prepared by local highway authorities in England must, before they are implemented, be submitted to the Secretary of State for approval and given effect to by an \norder\n made by the Secretary of State. This clause removes the requirement that the Secretary of State must approve and give effect to a permit scheme by \norder\n.\n&#xa0;\n190.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPart 3 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 provides for permit schemes. Section 34 concerns the implementation of local highway authority permit schemes. Section 34(2) provides \n(in relation to England) \nthat a permit scheme, previously submitted to the Secretary of State for approval, may be approved with or without modifications. Section 34(4) provides that a permit scheme shall not have effect unless the \nSecretary of State\n gives effect to it by \norder\n.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n191.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe changes made by the Bill provide local highway authorities with a new power to give effect to permit schemes by order. The new power is exercisable in relation to \nEngland only.\n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the \nprovision\n192.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis clause, by the insertion of Part 1 of \nSchedule\n 8 to the Bill makes certain amendments to Part 3 of the Traffic Management Act 2004. A new section 33A (Implementation of local highway authority permit schemes: England) is inserted into Part 3 and replaces the requirement for the Secretary of State to give effect to a local highway authority permit scheme, by requiring that the local highway authority give effect by \norder\n to a permit scheme in its area. \nThe authority can also vary or revoke a permit scheme by order. \nSuch an \norder\n will be a local council \norder\n, which will not be a statutory instrument.  Accordingly, local highway authorities will be able to prepare and give effect to their own permit schemes.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n193.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe requirement for the Secretary of State to approve permit schemes is no longer required, given the generally high quality and consistency of such schemes. Providing local highway authorities with the ability to prepare and approve their own schemes is consistent with the principles of localism and removes an additional and unnecessary administrative layer which has resource considerations for the Secretary of State and local highway authorities. As local highway authorities will, in accordance with the \nclause, prepare their own permit schemes it is entirely logical that they give effect to such schemes, as the Secretary of State will no longer have an approval role. \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n194.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 39(2) of the Traffic Management Act provides for the Secretary of State’s current power to make an \norder\n giving effect to a permit \nscheme  to\n be exercisable by statutory instrument. No parliamentary process is prescribed for such \norder\ns and accordingly they are not laid before Parliament. Accordingly, although permit schemes will no longer be brought into effect by statutory instr\nument as there is currently no p\narliamentary scrutiny of \norder\ns made by the Secretary of State, the proposed ch\nange will not reduce or weaken p\narliamentary scrutiny. Permit schemes will still be evidenced by a formal a\ndministrative decision but the d\nepartment considers that process should be placed in the hands of the authority that prepares and is to operate a permit scheme.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Clause 23(b) and Schedule 8, Part 2 – road humps&#xa0;Power conferred on: \n              \n              \nThe \nSecretary of State \n&#xa0;\nPower exercised by: \n              \n              \nRegulations made by statutory instrument\n&#xa0;\nParliamentary Procedure: \n              \nNegative R\nesolution\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n195.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrently the Secretary of State has powers under section 90B of the Highways Act 1980 (\n“\nHA 1980\n”\n) to construct road humps. Local authorities also have these powers, by virtue of section 90A of the HA 1980. Paragraph 10 of \nSchedule\n 8 removes the Secretary of State’s powers. These powers are no longer necessary because in practice the construction of road humps is undertaken by local authorities.\n&#xa0;\n196.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 90C of the HA 1980 sets down consultation requirements where there is a proposal to construct a road hump under section 90A or 90B (now to be repealed).  Section 90C(1) currently provides that there must be consultation with the chief officer of police and such other persons or bodies as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State. These consultation requirements are amended by paragraph 11(2) of \nSchedule\n 8. The reference to consultation with the chief officer of police is removed and the Secretary of State’s power to prescribe \nconsultees\n expanded in consequence to cover any persons or bodies (\nie\n including the chief officer of police).\n197.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 90C also sets out requirements about the publication of notices and the procedures for dealing with objections. There is an existing delegated power in the form of section 90C(5) of the HA 1980 which provides that, where, as the result of the receipt of objections, a local inquiry is held, provisions in the Local Government Act 1972 apply, but with such modifications as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State.  The requirements about publicity and procedures for dealing with objections are amended by paragraph 11(3) of \nSchedule\n 8.  They are replaced with a power for the Secretary of State to specify in regulations the requirements about publicity and procedures for dealing with objections.  This power includes the power to apply the relevant provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 about inquiries and to do so with specified modifications.\n198.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 90D provides that the Secretary of State may by regulations make such provision in relation to the construction and maintenance of road humps as appears appropriate – for example, regulations about the size and maintenance of road humps etc. \n199.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 325 of the HA 1980 provides that powers to make regulations are \nexercisable\n by statutory instrument and that an instrument containing regulations under section 90C or 90D is subject to the negative resolution procedure.\n&#xa0;\n200.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese powers are exercisable in relation to England and Wales. \nThe department is\n giving further consideration to whether it is appropriate for the changes to apply in relation to Wales.\n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the provision\n201.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe amendments of section 90C made by paragraph 11(3) have the effect of enabling secondary legislation to make provision about matters which are currently prescribed (in the main) in primary legislation.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n202.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is now considered more appropriate to make provision in secondary legislation, as opposed to on the face of the HA 1980, about the publicity requirements and the requirements for dealing with objections where there is a proposal to construct a road hump. This will give the flexibility to revise the requirements from time to time, including \nto take\n account of developments in methods of communications.  At the moment, section \n90C(\n2) provides for publication of a notice in one or more newspapers circulating in the area of the highway authority and at appropriate points on the highway.  Alternative or additional and more advanced methods of giving publicity to the proposal may in future be considered to be appropriate.  Similar provisions relating to traffic calming matters are made using secondary legislation.  This is an opportunity to standardise the procedure.   \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of p\narliamentary scrutiny\n203.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs with the existing regulation making powers conferred by sections 90C and 90D of the HA 1980, it is considered appropriate for the new regulation making power being substituted into section \n90C(\n2) of the HA 1980 to be subject to the negative resolution procedure.  It is a narrow power, concerned with detailed procedural points, where specialist traffic management knowledge and expertise may be required.  The negative resolution procedure is regarded as the appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny.   \n  \n              \nClause 23(e) and Schedule 8, Part 5: Reduction of burdens relating to the use of roads and railways: Testing of vehicles&#xa0;\nPower conferred on\n: \n              \nThe\n Secretary of State\nPower exercised by:\n              \nRegulations made by statutory instrument\nParliamentary procedur\ne: \n              \nNegative R\nesolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n204.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPart 5 of \nSchedule\n 8 extends the Secretary of State’s regulation-making powers in relation to the roadworthiness testing of buses, coaches and \nlorries\n by amending sections 46 and 51 of the Road Traffic Act 1988.\n&#xa0;\n205.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSections 45 and 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 allow the Secretary of State to make provision by regulations for the examination of vehicles submitted for roadworthiness testing. In the case of section 45 these are any vehicles other than prescribed classes of goods vehicles and in the case of section 49 are prescribed classes of goods vehicles.\n&#xa0;\n206.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSections 46 and 51 provide for what may in particular be made by regulations under sections 45 and 49 respectively. \n207.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese powers are exercisable in relation to England and Wales and Scotland\n.\nThe effect of \nthe provision\n208.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraph 16(2) to (4) amends section 46 and paragraph 17(2) to (4) amend section 51. \n&#xa0;\n209.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraphs 16(2) and 17(2) allow provision to be made for charges to be paid to the Secretary of State by those occupying premises which are designated as stations for the roadworthiness testing of vehicles; namely, public service vehicles (i.e. buses and coaches carrying paying passengers) in the case of paragraph 16(2) and prescribed \nclasses of goods vehicles (i.e. those over 3.5 tonnes) in the case of paragraph 17(2). \n&#xa0;\n210.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe charges may be in connection with the Secretary of State’s provision of vehicle examiners; the issue of test certificates or notifications of the refusal of test certificates; the issue of duplicate or copy test certificates and the correction of errors in test certificates. \n&#xa0;\n211.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraphs 16(3) and (4) and 17(3) allow provision to be made for the occupiers of vehicle testing stations (for public service vehicles in the case of paragraph 16(3) and (4) and for prescribed classes of goods vehicles in the case of paragraph 17(3)) to keep registers of test certificates in the prescribed form and containing the prescribed particulars, for the inspection of those registers by prescribed persons in prescribed circumstances and for occupiers of such stations to keep records and provide returns and information to the Secretary of State.\n&#xa0;\n212.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraph 17(4) allows, in relation to the roadworthiness testing of goods vehicles, provision to be made to require amounts in respect of charges in connection with the Secretary of State’s provision of vehicle examiners, the issue of test certificates or notifications of t\nhe refusal of test certificates, \nthe issue of duplicate or copy test certificates or the correction of errors in test certificates to be paid to the Secretary of State on account and to allow the repayment of such amounts in prescribed circumstances. This paragraph also amends section 51 to allow provision to be made requiring payment \nto \nthe Secretary of State of charges for the supply of forms for test certificates and notifications of refusal of test certificates and to allow the repayment of such charges in prescribed circumstances.  \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n213.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraph 16(2) to (4) expands the existing powers to make regulations under sections 45 and 46 and paragraph 17(2)\n \nto (4) expands the existing regulation-making powers in sections 49 and 51. The department continues to consider that the power to make provision by regulation for the examination of vehicles submitted for roadworthiness testing should be delegated to the Secretary of State. The detail of such provisions is more appropriate to secondary legislation. There is also likely to be a need to amend such provisions and make further provision from time to time which would be less conveniently achieved if contained in primary legislation.  \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of p\narliamentary scrutiny\n214.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe negative resolution procedure applies, by virtue of section 195(3) of the Road Traffic Act 1988, to the existing powers to make regulations under sections 45 and 46 and 49 and 51 and the department continues to believe that this i\ns appropriate. There \nshould be p\narliamentary scrutiny as the new powers extend to matters which include charging but these are not so significant as to merit the affirmative procedure. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;Clause 23(f) and Schedule 8 Part 6: vehicle accessibility regulations – exemption orders &#xa0;\nPower conferred on: \n              \nN\no new power conferred; relates to current power exercisable by Secretary of State. \nPower exercised by: \n              \n              \nAdministrative \norder\n \nParliamentary procedure: \n              \nN\none. \nIntroduction\n215.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPart 6 does not introduce a new delegated power, but amends the procedure that applies to an existing exemption \norder\n making power. \n&#xa0;\n216.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 183(1) of the Equality Act 2010 enables the Secretary of State by \norder\n to grant exemptions from rail vehicle accessibility regulations (RVAR). \nCurrently the scrutiny procedure for an exemption \norder\n is either the affirmative or negative procedure. The Secretary of State decides, on the basis set out in the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Exemption \nOrder\ns (Parliamentary Procedures) Regulations 2008, which procedure will apply. \n217.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese powers are exercisable in relation to England and Wales and Scotland\n.\nThe effect of the \nprovision\n218.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPart 6 will amend the 2010\n Act so that exemption \norder\ns no longer need to be made by statutory instrument but can instead be made and amended by administrative \norder\ns issued by the Secretary of State.  Consequently the parliamentary scrutiny procedures that currently apply to exemption \norder\ns will no longer apply. \n219.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe principal benefit of Part 6 will be to reduce the resources required by \nthe department \nin processing exemption applications to their conclusions.  This is because the resources needed to produce an administrative \norder\n will be less than those required for preparing a statutory instrument and taking it through the parliamentary scrutiny process. The change will also save parliamentary time. In addition the \ndepartment \nexpects there to be a small benefit to applicants from the change by speeding up the process, so giving a decision sooner.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the use of administrative \norder and the level of p\narlia\nmentary s\ncrutiny\n220.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe scope of RVAR has been reduced since a similar proposal was made in the past (see below), such that they no longer apply to rail vehicles that are subject instead to EU accessibility rules. These rules require new, upgraded or renewed vehicles to comply with the technical specifications for interoperability for persons with reduced mobility (PRM TSI). The EU accessibility regime applies to mainline services, i.e. the majority of train services. RVAR now applies only to a minority (approximately one quarter) of rail vehicles – mostly light rail such as tramways, metros and underground. The two regulatory regimes have similar technical requirements.\n221.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe EU accessibility regime is implemented in the UK by the Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2011. One difference between the two regimes is that exemptions from RVAR are made by statutory instrument, while exemptions from the PRM TSI can \nby\n made in Great Britain by the Secretary of State making an administrative determination, subject in some cases to the approval of the European Commission – see regulation 14 of the 2011 Regulations. Removing the requirement for RVAR exemption \norder\ns to be made by statutory instrument will therefore bring the light rail regime more in line with the EU regime, which we believe is more proportionate, particularly given that other safeguards will remain.\n222.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe requirement in the Equality Act 2010 for the Secretary of State to consult the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC\n) before granting an exemption is unchanged, as is the requirement for him to make an Annual Report to Parliament on the use of the exemption powers.  \nThe department\n believe\ns\n that DPTAC’s continued involvement in considering the merits of each application will ensure that the needs of disabled people are given appropriate weight, while the Annual Report will allow Parliament to consider whether the powers had been used excessively in the past year and call Ministers to account if it so wished.\n&#xa0;\n223.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \ndepartment\n made clear during consultation that there would be no reduction in the strength of argument required before an exemption was granted.  More background information about the proposal is set out in the \ndepartment\n’s March 2013 consultation, which can be found with a summary of the consultation responses at:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-changes-to-exemptions-from-rail-vehicle-accessibility-requirements\n \n&#xa0;\n224.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA large majority of those who responded to the consultation supported the proposal, including DPTAC.\n&#xa0;\n225.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA similar proposal was made when the Disability Discrimination Bill was considered by Parliament before it became the Disability Discrimination Act 2005. That similar proposal was considered by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the Committee recommended that the proposal was not enacted - see paragraph 9 of the Committee’s Fourth Report for the Session 2004-5. In the end the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 amended the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 maintaining the requirement for parliamentary scrutiny in all circumstances, with the procedure being either the negative or affirmative procedure. The rail vehicle accessibility provisions of Disability Discrimination Acts, without significant further change, were re-enacted in the Equality Act 2010.\n&#xa0;\n226.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn its Fourth Report for the Session 2004-5 the Committee was concerned about the lack of evidence to support the proposal – see paragraph 7. The \ndepartment \nnow considers that it does have sufficient evidence and in particular points to the improved efficiency in public administration and the predominately supportive responses to the proposal following the recent consultation. An impact assessment for this measure will be available before introduction of the Bill to Parliament.  The \ndepartment \nalso believes that the large reduction in the scope of RVAR that has taken place since th\ne proposal was first considered\n justifies looking at this issue again. \n&#xa0;Clause 28: Model clauses in petroleum licences: procedural simplification&#xa0;\nPower conferred on\n: \n              \nThe\n Secretary of State\nPower exercised by:\n              \nRegulations made by statutory instrument, or publication of a document\nParl\niamentary procedure: \n              \nNegative R\nesolution, or none\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n227.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis clause provides the Secretary of State with an additional method for changing the model clauses for petroleum licences.\n&#xa0;\n228.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 2 of the Petroleum Act 1998 (a Consolidation Act) provides that Her Majesty has the exclusive right of searching for and boring and getting petroleum which exists in its natural condition in strata in Great Britain. Her Majesty has similar rights in respect of petroleum in areas of the UK which are outside territorial waters, by virtue of section 1(1) of the Continental Shelf Act 1964. Section 3 of the 1998 Act authorises the Secretary of State, acting on behalf of Her Majesty, to grant licences to others to bore for and get the petroleum referred to in both Acts. \n&#xa0;\n229.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 4 of the 1998 Act places a duty on the Secretary of State to make regulations concerning various aspects of petroleum licences, such as the content and procedure for licence applications, licence fees, the areas in respect of which applications can be made and model clauses to be incorporated in licences. Regulations made under section 4 are subject to the negative resolution procedure.\n&#xa0;\n230.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe model clauses set out in regulations must be included in licences unless the Secretary of State thinks that they should be modified or excluded in any particular case. The model clauses have been amended over time, and so petroleum licences issued at different times contain different clauses. The model clauses for all licences granted before 5th March 2004 can be found in consolidated form in the Petroleum (Current Model Clauses) \nOrder\n 1999 (S.I. 1999/160) and in  the Petroleum (Production) (Landward Areas) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/1436). The model clauses for more recently issued licences are contained in, or determined by reference to, regulations made in S.I. 2004/352, 2006/784, 2008/225, 2009/2814 and 2009/3283.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n231.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe power is exercisable in respect of licences to search and bore for \npetroleum \n&#xa0;\nin\n strata in England and Wales, Scotland, the territorial sea adjacent to the UK and the UK sector of the continental shelf”.\n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the \nprovision\n&#xa0;\n232.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis clause amends section 4 of the 1998 Act in respect of the duty to make model clauses. It removes the current duty, in paragraph (1)(e), to prescribe model clauses in regulations and replaces it with new subsections (2A), (2B) and (2C) which provide that the Secretary of State must still prescribe model clauses, but may do so either in regulations or in a published document. \n&#xa0;\n233.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhere the duty is discharged by prescribing model clauses in regulations, the negative resolution procedure will continue to used, by virtue of section 4(3) of the 1998 Act as amended by subsection (5) of the clause. Where the duty is discharged by prescribing m\nodel clauses in a document, no p\narliamentary scrutiny procedure would apply.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n234.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe power to determine the terms of petroleum licences has been a delegated power since the introduction of petroleum licensing in the Petroleum (Production) Act 1934. The department continues to consider that it is appropriate to delegate this power to the Secretary of State. It enables the licensor to set new terms of licences which reflect the most up-to-date technical and commercial practices, where a need to use primary legislation would inevitably lead to delay and difficulty in keeping up with developments. It is a common feature of all regulated industries for the regulator – in this case the Secretary of State – to be given the power to determine the conditions of licences.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n235.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe department considers that although the model clauses of petroleum licences are important, \nthey are not so important that p\narliamentary scrutiny is required in respect of all changes to them. The grant of an energy licence is an administrative act, and the model clauses do not set out matters that have proved to be controversial or of wider interest.\n&#xa0;\n236.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe generally more controversial aspects of petroleum extraction are regulated in other ways – through health and safety legislation, through environmental regulation, through the planning system and through the tax regime. The relevant regimes are set out in primary and secondary legislation \nwith the appropriate degree of p\narliamentary scrutiny. \n&#xa0;\n237.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a result, the department does not consider that the additional cost, procedural hurdles and occup\nation of p\narliamentary time associated with the making of statutory instruments are appropriate in every case; the amendments will enable the Secretary of State to act more swiftly where necessary, and at lower overall cost to the public purse. They will also make it easier for the Secretary of State to publish fully consolidated copies of the model clauses with greater regularity – the resources required to make consolidating statutory instruments, and the costs associated with making large instruments, currently act as a disincentive to regular consolidation exercises. \n&#xa0;\n238.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe amendments will allow the Secretary of State to include model clauses in regulations, using the negative resolution procedure, wherever it is considered appropriate because the changes are controversial or because they implement a significant change of policy. It is very difficult to predict at this stage when changes to model clauses will fall on one side of the line or the other when assessing how significant they are. But the department anticipates that it will be clearer when individual issues are being considered whether model clauses ought to be prescribed in regulations, taking into account consultat\nion responses and the level of p\narliamentary interest at the time. Where minor and technical amendments are being made, publication in a document is likely to be the preferable procedure. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Clause 29 and Schedule 10: household waste: de-criminalisation&#xa0;Power conferred on: \n              \nThe Secretary of State; the Lord Chancellor \nPower exercised by: \n              \nRegulations made by statutory instrument; \norder\nParl\niamentary procedure: \n              \nNegative R\nesolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n239.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Environmental Protection Act 1990 (“the 1990 Act”) enables a waste collection authority (“a WCA”) by notice to require the occupier of premises to place household waste for collection in receptacles of a kind and number specified (section 46). Failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with such requirements is an offence currently punishable with a fine of up to £1000 (section 46(6)).\n240.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs an alternative to prosecution, an authorised officer of a WCA may offer the opportunity of discharging any liability to conviction by payment of a fixed penalty (section 47ZA). The amount of such a penalty is the amount specified by the WCA in relation to its area, or, if no amount is so specified, £60 for offences in England (the ‘default’ amount). The WCA may make provision for treating the penalty as having been paid if a lesser amount is paid before the end of a specified period. The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision in connection with those powers of the WCA, and also has power by \norder\n to substitute a different amount for the ‘default’ amount (section 47ZB).\n241.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe London Local Authorities Act 2007 (“the 2007 Act”) enables a London borough council to make regulations requiring occupiers of premises to place household waste for collection in receptacles of a kind and number specified (section 20). Unlike the 1990 Act, failure to comply with such requirements is not an offence, although a penalty charge is payable by any occupier of premises in respect of which there has been a failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with any requirements imposed by such regulations (section 23). \n242.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is the duty of the borough councils to set the levels of penalty charges, but they do not come into force until the Secretary of State has been notified and does not object to them on the ground that they are excessive. If, at any time before the levels of fixed penalties have come into force, the Secretary of State does consider them excessive, the Secretary of State may make regulations setting the levels of fixed penalties (sections 66 and 67). \n243.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn relation to appeals, section 62 provides that the Lord Chancellor has the power to make provision by regulations relating to an appeal to an adjudicator if a person’s representations to a borough council are not accepted. No such regulations have yet been made, and section 62 goes on to provide that, until such time as regulations are in force, any regulations under section 80 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 shall, with any necessary modifications, apply in relation to representations, appeals and adjudicators as if made under the corresponding provisions of the 2007 Act.\n&#xa0;\n244.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe delegated powers conferred by the clause and Schedule are exercisable in relation to \nEngland only.\n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the \nprovision\n245.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis clause amends the 1990 Act to remove, in England, the criminal offence under section 46(6). In place of the fixed penalty system available as an alternative to prosecution, this clause also introduces, in England, a more proportionate sanction for non-compliance, by making provision for the imposition\n of a fixed monetary penalty in \ncases where a specified threshold is reached and procedural safeguards have been met. The amount of such a penalty is the amount specified by the WCA in relation to its area (new section \n46B(\n1)(a)), or, if no amount is so specified, £60 (new section 46B(1)(b)). A WCA may make provision for treating a fixed penalty as having been paid if a lesser amount is paid before the end of a period specified by the authority (new section 46B(2)).\n&#xa0;\n246.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs part of the amendments to the 1990 Act, this clause confers on the Secretary of State the power, by regulations, to make provision in connection with the powers conferred on waste collection authorities under new section 46B(1)(a) and (2) (new section 46B(3)). In particular, such regulations may require an amount specified by the WCA to fall within a range prescribed in the regulations, and may restrict the extent to which, and the circumstances in which, a WCA can make provision under new section \n46B(\n2). The amendments made by this clause also confer on the Secretary of State the power, by \norder\n, to substitute a different amount for the amount for the time being specified in subsection (1)(b) (i.e. the ‘default’ amount) (new section 46B(5)). \n247.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis clause and \nSchedule\n 10 amend the 2007 Act for the purposes of ensuring a degree of consistency between the penalty systems relating to household waste under the 1990 Act and the 2007 Act. \n&#xa0;\n248.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe amendments provide that a London borough council may require a person to pay a penalty charge for a failure to comply with requirements (imposed by regulations made under section 20(1)) relating to household waste receptacles (new section 20A). It is the duty of the borough councils to set the levels of penalty charges payable to them under section 20A (new section \n20B(\n1)), and the borough councils may make provision for treating a penalty charge as having been paid if a lesser amount is received by the relevant council before the end of a period specified by the borough councils (new section 20B(3)).\n&#xa0;\n249.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNew section 20B(4) confers on the Secretary of State the power, by regulations, to make provision in connection with the functions conferred on the borough councils under new subsection 20B(1) and (3). In particular, such regulations may require the levels of penalty charges to fall within a range prescribed in the regulations, and may restrict the extent to which, and the circumstances in which, the borough councils can make provision under subsection (3).\n250.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNew section 20D makes provision relating to appeals against decisions to impose penalty charges. These extend the existing system of appeals provided for by the 2007 Act to the revised penalty charge system provided for by this clause. Subsection (1) \nconfers on the Lord Chancellor power to include in regulations made under the existing power in section 62(2) provision relating to appeals to an adjudicator against a decision under section 20A to require a person to pay a penalty charge. Subsection (2) confers on the Secretary of State a power, exercisable by regulations, to prescribe modifications to the application of regulations under section 80 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 in relation to appeals against decisions to impose penalty charges  (subsection (2) applies regulations under section 80 until such time as regulations made by the Lord Chancellor are in force).\nJu\nstification of the delegation\n251.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe amendments to the 1990 Act conferring power to make provision in connection with the powers conferred on WCAs in England in relation to\n the amount of any penalty and \nto make provi\nsion for early payment, and to \namend the ‘default’ amount, give the Secretary of State \npowers\n which are similar to those currently provided for by the 1990 Act. These powers enable the Secretary of State to exercise a degree of control over the amount of any fixed penalty that a WCA may impose (for example, by setting a range into which any fixed penalty must fall). The department considers it appropriate to continue the Secretary of State’s ability to exercise a degree of control over the amount of any fixed penalty that a WCA may impose under the new system of fixed penalties – this also enables the amounts to be “future proofed” to an extent, without the need for primary legislation when the amounts need to be changed. In \norder\n to enable a degree of consistency between the penalty levels and systems under the 1990 Act and the 2007 Act, the department considers that it is also appropriate to give the Secretary of State similar powers under the 2007 Act to make provision in connection with the powers conferred on London borough councils in relation t\no the amount of any penalty and\n to make provision for early payment (there is no ‘default’ amount in the 2007 Act).\n252.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe department considers that the powers conferred on the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State in relation to appeals under the 2007 Act are a necessary consequence of extending the existing appeals system to take account of the amendments made by this clause. The Lord Chancellor already has power to make provision by regulations relating to appeals (section 62), and this power is extended to enable the revised penalty charge provision introduced by this clause to work properly within the existing appeal structure set out in the 2007 Act. Similarly, the amendments made by this clause to apply (until such time as regulations made by the Lord Chancellor are in force) regulations under section 80 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 in relation to appeals continues the existing approach taken by the 2007 Act; the department considers that the additional power conferred to enable the Secretary of State to prescribe modifications to those regulations is necessary to ensure that the application of such regulations works properly.\nJustification of the level of p\narliamentary scrutiny\n253.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll the powers conferred by this clause and \nSchedule\n 10 are to be exercised by statutory instrument subject to negative procedure (in relation to the 1990 Act, by virtue of section 161 of that Act; in relation to the 2007 Act, by virtue of section 82 of that Act). \n&#xa0;\n254.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe powers conferred by way of amendment to the 1990 Act relate to the setting of amounts for fixed penalties rather than the circumstances in which fixed penalties may be imposed. They replace similar powers which were subject to negative procedure. Given the limited scope of the powers, the department considers that it is appropriate for their exercise to be subject to negative procedure (the similar powers which are replaced were also subject to negative procedure). \n&#xa0;\n255.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn relation to the powers conferred by way of amendment to the 2007 Act, the power of the Lord Chancellor exercisable under section 62(2) of that Act (relating to appeals) is already exercisable by way of negative procedure, so an extension of that power by virtue of the new section \n20D(\n1) of that Act to cover different circumstances should, in the department’s view, be similarly dealt with. The power of the Secretary of State under new section 20B(4) relates to the setting of amounts for fixed penalties rather than the circumstances in which those penalties may be imposed and, as with the changes to the 1990 Act, the department considers that it is appropriate for the exercise of such power to be subject to negative procedure. The power of the Secretary of State to make modifications to the applicability of regulations made under section 80 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 is something which, as a consequential and technical provision, the department considers is suitably scrutinised by means of negative procedure.\n&#xa0;Clause 30 and Schedule 11, paragraph 1: power to extend provisions of Destructive Imported Animals Act 1932 to other destructive non-indigenous animals&#xa0;&#xa0;\nPower conferred on:\n              \nNo new power conferred.  The amendment affects an existing delegated power that is conferred on the Secretary of State and the Welsh Ministers.\n&#xa0;\nPower exercised by:\n              \n              \n              \nOrder made by statutory i\nnstrument\n&#xa0;\nParliamentary procedure:\n              \n              \nAffirmative\n R\nesolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\n256.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis clause loosens the precondition applying before Ministers may make an \norder\n under section 10 of the Destructive Imported Animals Act 1932.  By \nsection 1 of that Act, Ministers are currently empowered to prohibit, or control by licensing, the importation into, and keeping within, Great Britain of musk rats.  By section 10(1) of the Act, Ministers are currently further empowered to make any such \norder\n as they are capable of making with respect to musk rats so as to apply with respect to any other non-indigenous mammalian species – but only where Ministers are satisfied that by reason of their destructive habits “it is desirable to prohibit or control the importation or keeping of them and to destroy any which may be at large”.\n&#xa0;\nDevolution\n&#xa0;\n257.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese powers are exercisable in relation to England and Wales. This area is devolved to Wales. The amendments affect the existing powers of both the Secretary of State and the Welsh Ministers. The department is discussing the need for a legislative consent \nmotion  with\n the devolved administration. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the \nprovision\n&#xa0;\n258.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe provision contained in paragraph 1(2) of \nSchedule\n 11 of the Bill now dilutes the precondition that Ministers must first be satisfied that any members at large (of a species in respect of which they propose to make an \norder\n under section 10(1)) should be destroyed. By virtue of the amendment, it is, in the alternative, sufficient for Ministers to “\nkeep under review whether any which may be at large should be destroyed”.\n&#xa0;\n259.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdditionally, the provision\n (a new s.10(1A))\n contained in paragraph 1(3) of \nSchedule\n 11 now \nensures beyond all doubt that\n the power to make an \norder\n under section 10(1)\n \nalso includes the power to revoke or amend such an \norder\n. Doubt as to this had arisen because, in relation to Acts passed after 1889 but before the commencement of the Interpretation Act 1978, the power under section 14 of that Act to revoke, amend or re-enact instruments only extended to rules, regulations and bye-laws (see paragraph 3 of \nSchedule\n 2 to that Act).  Section 10(1) DIAA contains an \norder\n-making power, so is not expressly caught by section 14.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n&#xa0;\n260.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe delegated power already exists; but the precondition to its use has been slightly loosened so that it refers to the \norder\n-maker being satisfied that it is desirable \neither\n to destroy any animals of the\n species which may be at large (the current requirement) or (new)\n to keep under review whether such animals should be destroyed.  \nThis is because there may be situations and species (such as the grey squirrel) where the promotion of a policy of destruction is currently deemed impractical, but it is still wished to be able to impose the Act’s controls on that species’ importation and keeping.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n&#xa0;\n261.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny remains as already provided for in the Act: affirmative procedure.\n The department considers that this level remains appropriate. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;Clause 33 and paragraph 6(3) and (4) of Schedule 14: schools - reduction of burdens -publication of reportsPowers conferred on\n: \n              \nThe\n Secretary of State\nPowers exercised by:\n              \nRegulations made by statutory instrument\nParl\niamentary procedure: \n              \nNegative R\nesolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n262.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nC\nlause \n33 \ngives effect to \nSchedule\n 14. Paragraph 6(3) of \nSchedule\n 14 provides for every registered parent of every registered pupil at a maintained school to be informed by the appropriate authority of the overall assessment contained in the school inspection report within a period to be prescribed by regulations. Paragraph 6(4) of \nSchedule\n 14 places a similar duty on the governors of foundation or voluntary schools which have a religious character, in respect of the report of an inspection of the religious education in those schools. \n&#xa0;\n263.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraph 6(3) and (4) of \nSchedule\n 14 substitute, respectively, the provisions at sections 14(4) and 49(4) of the Education Act 2005.  \n&#xa0;\n264.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 14(4) currently requires maintained schools \nto make copies of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills inspection reports available to the public and to provide a copy of the report to parents of the pupils of the school, \nfree of charge. Schools must also provide the report to any other person who asks for one and, in prescribed cases, may request payment from those persons of such fee as they think fit (not exceeding the cost of supply).\n&#xa0;\n265.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 49(4) of the Education Act 2005 places a similar duty on foundation and voluntary schools which have a religious character, in respect of reports of inspections under section 48 of that Act (inspection of religious education). \n&#xa0;\n266.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince September 2012 maintained schools have been required to publish i\nnformation as to where and by what means parents may access the most recent report about the school published by her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills \nunder the School Information (England) Regulations 2008 (S.I. No. 3093) (“the School Information Regulations”).\n In practice in \norder\n to comply schools are likely to publish \na link to any \nOfsted\n reports on their website\n.\n For that reason, it is considered appropriate to revoke the current requirements in section 14(4) of the Education Act 2005. The duty to publish the school inspection reports which the School Information Regulations place on maintained schools renders the current requirements at section 14(4) superfluous and burdensome on schools. \n&#xa0;\n267.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReligious inspection reports are published on faith body websites and therefore are already accessible to parents and others. In addition, paragraph 6(5) of \nSchedule\n 14 amends the School Information Regulations by inserting a new duty (at new paragraph 3A of \nSchedule\n 4 to those Regulations) for \nfoundation or voluntary\n schools\n which have a religious character\n to publish \ninformation as to where and by what means parents may access the most recent report about the school sent to the governing body under section \n49 of the Education Act 2005. As above it is probable that schools will comply by publishing \na link to the reports on their website. Removing the current duty at section 49(4) will reduce administrative costs. \n&#xa0;\n268.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese \nnew delegated \npowers \nconferred by paragraph 6(3) and 94) of Schedule 14 \nare exercisable in\n relation to\n England only.\nThe effect of \nthe provision\n&#xa0;\n269.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraph 6(3) and (4) of \nSchedule\n 14 has the effect of substituting current provisions at section 14(4) and 49(4) of the Education Act 2005 respectively. \n&#xa0;\n270.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe new section 14(4)\n will impose a duty on the appropriate authority, once they are in receipt of the school inspection report, to inform every registered parent of the overall assessment contained in the report within a period to be prescribed through regulations.\n&#xa0;\n271.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe new section 49(4) will place a similar duty on the governing body of a foundation or voluntary school which has a religious character, in respect of \nthe report of an inspection of the denominational education and the content of the school’s collective worship.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n272.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe periods within which parents must be notified of the result of the school or religious inspection under new sections 14(4) and 49(4) of the Education Act 2005 must be prescribed through regulations.  It is considered that these timescales are best dealt with by regulations because of the desirability of not putting detailed procedural requirements on the face of the Bill and because of the possible need to update procedural requirements to reflect changing circumstances and to respond to stakeholders’ advice and concerns where necessary.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n273.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe negative procedure proposed for the new regulation-making powers at sections 14(4) and 49(4) of the Education Act 2005 mirrors the procedure which Parliament considered appropriate for the current regulation-making powers currently in those sections.\n \nThis is set \nout  at\n section 121(1) of the Education Act 2005. Like the previous regulation-making powers, the details which those regulations will prescribe relate to a purely procedural matter prescribing how quickly schools must notify parents of the result of an inspection.\n&#xa0;\nClause 36 Criminal procedure: written witness statements&#xa0;\nPower conferred on\n: \n              \nThe\n Criminal Procedure Rule Committee\nPower exercised by:\n              \nCriminal Procedure Rules\nParliamentary proc\nedure: \n              \nNegative R\nesolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n274.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis clause allows Criminal Procedure Rules, made under sections 69 and 72 of the Courts Act 2003, (\ni\n) to extend the period during which a party to criminal proceedings may object to another party using the written statement of a witness, instead of calling the witness to give evidence in person; and (ii) to provide the supplementary procedure where a written statement is used.\n&#xa0;\n275.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 provides that in criminal proceedings the written statement of a witness shall be ‘admissible as evidence to the like extent as oral evidence to the like effect by that person’, if the conditions listed in that section are met. The conditions include requirements for a declaration by the witness, for signature by the witness, for the way in which the written statement must be delivered to (in the language of the Act, be ‘served on’) the other parties, for the way in which it must be presented to the court and, crucially, a requirement that none of those on whom the statement has been served has objected within 7 days. The section applies equally to prosecution and defence witnesses. In practice, it is the most commonly encountered provision by which evidence other than oral testimony is admitted in criminal proceedings. This clause amends that section.\n&#xa0;\n276.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe new delegated power\n \nconferred by the clause is \nexercisable in relation to England and Wales\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the provision\n&#xa0;\n277.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe amendment made by clause 36(3) means that, where a written statement is served, other parties will never have less than the current 7 days in which to object, but Criminal Procedure Rules will be able to extend that period, in specified circumstances or generally. The point of allowing for a longer period is to remove any perceived need to enter a ‘holding’ objection, so as to keep the objector’s options open while they assess the statement. Objections can be withdrawn before the trial takes place, but experience demonstrates that that often is overlooked, with the result that witnesses attend court \nwhen they need not have done. A longer time limit for objection would remove the need to object just out of caution.\n&#xa0;\n278.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCriminal Procedure Rules already provide generally for the content and service of documents in criminal proceedings, and for the way in which evidence and other material is presented to the court. Section 9 of the 1967 Act, passed long before the Criminal Procedure Rules first came into force in 2005, contains procedural requirements that constrain what the Rules can provide in relation to written witness statements. The repeals made by clause 36(4) mean that the Rules will be able to \nprovide  the\n necessary supplementary procedure. \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n&#xa0;\n279.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Criminal Procedure Rule Committee was established by the Courts Act 2003 specifically to make and maintain rules governing the practice and procedure of the criminal courts. The chairman is the Lord Chief Justice, and members are drawn from among those involved in the criminal justice system, including the judiciary, the legal professions, prosecutors, the police and voluntary organisations. It is independent of government. The amendments made by this clause confer on the Committee an additional power consistent with its existing statutory responsibilities. This helps to ensure that criminal procedure is consistent and easy to find, \nand  makes\n it possible for the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee to keep that procedure up to date and efficient in the light of experience.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n280.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSignificant safeguards (such as the right to object to the introduction of written evidence and the minimum period for objection) will remain on the face of the 1967 Act. Section 72 of the Courts Act 2003 requires that Criminal Procedure Rules must be allowed by the Lord Chancellor and must be contained in a statutory instrument subject to annulment by resolution of either House of Parliament. This clause concerns only criminal procedure, and contains nothing that might justify an\ny more searching scrutiny. The p\narliamentary procedure for which section 72 provides therefore is justified.\n&#xa0;\nClause 37 Criminal procedure: written guilty pleas&#xa0;\nPower conferred on\n: \n              \nThe\n Criminal Procedure Rule Committee\nPower exercised by:\n              \nCriminal Procedure Rules\nParl\niamentary procedure: \n              \nNegative R\nesolution\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\n281.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis clause allows Criminal Procedure Rules, made under sections 69 and 72 of the Courts Act 2003, to dispense with the present requirement for written material to be read aloud to magistrates where the defendant pleads guilty without attending court and where the magistrates can read the documents for themselves.\n&#xa0;\n282.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSections 12 and 12A of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 allow a defendant to plead guilty in writing without attending court. The procedure can be used only for comparatively minor offences, and only where certain procedural requirements have been met. The procedure is widely used in minor road traffic cases and for TV licence evasion, for example. Even though the parties are absent and the court deals with the case on the papers, section 12 requires the prosecution case and the defence representations to be read aloud to the magistrates.\n&#xa0;\n283.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe new delegated power\n \nconferred by the clause is\n exercisable in relation to England and Wales.\n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the \nprovision\n284.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis clause amends section 12 of the 1980 Act. Criminal Procedure Rules will be able to specify what, if \nanything,\n need be read aloud, and in what circumstances. Though the parties themselves are absent, the proceedings are still a trial and members of the public may be present. The point of allowing rules to dispense with some or all of the current requirements is so that they can provide for the prompt and efficient disposal of court business in a way that is consistent with the defendant’s right to a fair trial and with the principles of open justice.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n285.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Criminal Procedure Rule Committee was established by the Courts Act 2003 specifically to make and maintain rules governing the practice and procedure of the criminal courts.

Section 59 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 allows a Crown Court judge to make an \norder\n for the return to its owner of property seized during an investigation.\n&#xa0;\n289.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe new delegated\n powers\n conferred by the clause\n are exercisable in relation to England and Wales.\n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the \nprovision\n290.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe clause makes amendments to each of the above five Acts which will allow Criminal Procedure Rules to supply the necessary supplementary procedures.\n&#xa0;\n291.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Rules already provide for the procedure on similar applications under other statutory provisions. However, the Courts Act 2003 and the above five Acts are in slightly different terms, so that the Rules cannot yet govern the practice and procedure on applications under those particular provisions. Moreover, the 1984 Act contains procedural requirements that constrain what the Rules can provide in relation to applications for production orders under that Act. \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n&#xa0;\n292.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Criminal Procedure Rule Committee was established by the Courts Act 2003 specifically to make and maintain rules governing the practice and procedure of the criminal courts.

These same powers, once amended by this clause, will enable regulations to be made by the Treasury which (\ni\n) provide for the circumstances in which the Treasury or the Secretary of State may authorise other persons to manage the CTFs of certain looked after children, and (ii) require local authorities to provide certain information to such an authorised person.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of p\narliamen\ntary s\ncrutiny\n302.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Act currently provides that any regulations made under sections 3(10) and 16(1) of the Act are subject to the negative procedure pursuant to section 28(8). Other than in specified circumstances concerning a child’s eligibility for CTF or payments to a child’s account, all regulations making provision of an administrative nature, such as management of accounts or provision of information, are made by negative procedure.  Further regulations made under the powers to be amended by this clause will continue to be subject to the negative procedure and the Treasury considers that the negative procedure continues to provide the appropriate degree of scrutiny.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClause 48: Ambulatory references to international shipping instrumentsPower conferred on: \n              \n              \nHer Majesty in Council and/or Secretary of State\nPower exercised by: \n              \n              \nRegulations made by s\ntatutory instrument/Direction \nParliamentary procedure: \n              \nVaries (as explained further below)\nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\n303.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis clause amends the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 so that the powers to make secondary legislation wherever they appear in that Act can be exercised so as to provide for a reference in the legislation to an international agreement to be interpreted as a \nreference to the agreement as modified from time to time. \n&#xa0;\n304.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe current practice of implementing international maritime \nconventions,\n and regular changes to them, by means of a mixture of primary legislation and secondary legislation has resulted in a complex regulatory structure that is confusing to industry and the regulator alike. It is also time consuming and resource intensive, leading to delays in implementation – which in turn can result in ships being challenged during inspections in foreign ports leading to delays and inconvenience to UK ships.\n&#xa0;\n305.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe clause has been designed to address these issues by making it possible to streamline the incorporation of the provisions of international maritime conventions so that, where it is considered appropriate to do so, the government would not need to make further secondary legislation or publish any other regulatory document in \norder\n to give effect to changes to international obligations and standards; changes to the text of an international agreement would be automatically incorporated into UK law in the circumstances specified in the secondary legislation.\n306.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis power \nis exercisable in relation to England and \nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the \nprovision\n307.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe clause provides that the existing powers to make secondary legislation contained in the Merchant Shipping Act may be exercised so as to make ambulatory provision.  It also provides that the operation of the ambulatory reference may be \ndis\n-applied or delayed.  It is not proposed to consider each of the individual powers to make subordinate legislation affected, which are subject to different parliamentary procedures; some of which already allow what are in effect ambulatory references to be made in certain circumstances.  This memorandum will consider two issues.  The first being the principle of allowing ambulatory references in secondary legislation, the second being the power of direction provided for in subsection (5) which would have the effect of limiting the operation of the ambulatory reference.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n308.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe principle of allowing ambulatory references in legislation is now well established most notably in paragraph 1A(1) which was added to \nSchedule\n 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 by section 28 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006.\n&#xa0;\n309.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInternational instruments in the marine sector such as SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) are often of a highly technical nature specifying standards of construction, equipment and procedures that must be complied with.  \nBecause of the international nature of shipping operations once the provision come into force they must be complied with by the UK shipping industry where it operates in the territorial waters of a signatory country, irrespective of whether the UK has incorporated the relevant requirements into its domestic law.  In addition once the UK has become a party to an international instrument which has come into force it is under an obligation to apply the terms of that instrument both to its own ships and, usually, to ships of other nations operating within its jurisdiction.  \n&#xa0;\n310.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn some cases therefore allowing a change to an international instrument to take effect through the operation of an ambulatory reference in the manner proposed in this clause represents the most timely and cost effective method of providing certainty to the industry and allowing the UK to comply with its international obligations.\n&#xa0;\n311.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n Subsection (5) provides that secondary legislation may authorise the Secretary of State to give a direction wh\nich will have the effect of \ndis\napplying\n or delaying the operation of the ambulatory provision.  \nSubsection (6) extends this power of direction to include \ndisapplying\n any provision of subordinate legislation to which the ambulatory provision relates and making alternative provis\ni\non.\n \nThe reason that the\nse\n power\ns are\n being sought is that there may be occasions when it is necessary to delay or prevent an obligation which arises as a result of an ambulatory change from having effect \nand in\n \nsome cases make alternative provision\n.  Such instances are expected to be rare; an example might be where the new provision would be inconsistent with an existing EU law obligation which is likely to be the case where the EU adopts higher standards than are required by the international agreement.  \nIn such cases it would be important that the existing secondary legislation did not remain in force\n. \nIt would of course be possible to achieve the same result by amending the secondary legislation which gives effect to the ambulatory provision.  However, this is likely to be difficult to achieve in the required timescale particularly where the instrument requires the affirmative process and \nwould be inconsistent with the g\novernment’s policy of reducing the number of statutory instruments required to implement the international obligations.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n312.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs far as the exercise of delegation conferred by the making of the ambulatory reference itself is concerned this will only be possible where there is an existing power to make secondary legislation.  The level of scrutiny appropriate to the subject matter of such legislation will have already been co\nnsidered by Parliament and the d\nepartment sees no reason why, if an ambulatory reference is to be included in such legislation\n,\n that there should be any change to the level of scrutiny.  In a number of cases, particularly where the purpose of the legislation is to incorporate changes to the text of an international instrument, the secondary legislation is subject to the affirmative procedure.  Parliament will, in almost all such most cases, have the ability to consider the instrument containing the ambulatory reference under either the negative or affirmative procedure.\n&#xa0;\n313.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a further consideration which is that in most circumstances a change to UK law taking effect as a result of the operation of the ambulatory reference will only take effect following a change to an international agreement which will have been agreed to by the UK government and which will already been notified to Parliament. The only instances where this will not be are \ncases  where\n the international instrument contains a process whereby supplemental provision can be made through the issue of a code or a standard or changes can be made to the terms of the instrument through the so called tacit agreement procedure whereby a change becomes effective and binds all the signatories of the agreement once a certain number of signatories have agreed.  However, in both cases the possibility of such changes being made without the further need for the explicit approval of the UK government was already present when the decision was made to accede to the agreement so this should not of itself demand additional scrutiny.   \n&#xa0;\n314.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs already noted to the extent that the power of the Secretary of State to issue directions \nunder  subsection\n (5) is novel this should not necessarily mean that any additional scrutiny is needed.  Firstly, the inclusion of the power in secondary legislation will of it\nself be subject to the level of p\narliamentary scrutiny that has already been considered appropriate for the relevant secondary legislation.  Secondly, the effect of the exercise of the power will \nnormally \nbe to preserve the existing le\ngal position. As a result, the d\nepartment does not consider the power should be subject to any additional procedure and that the additional cost, proced\nural hurdles and occupation of p\narliamentary time associated with the making of a statutory instruments would not be appropriate in this case; the power will enable the Secretary of State to act more swiftly where necessary, and at lower overall cost to the public purse.\n&#xa0;\nClause 49 – power to spell out dates described in legislation&#xa0;\nPower conferred on: \n              \n              \nA Minister of the Crown\nPower exercised by: \n              \n              \nOrder\n  made\n by statutory instrument\nParliamentary Procedure: \n              \nN\none\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n315.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClause 49 confers a power on Ministers to amend legislation – primary and secondary - by statutory instrument in \norder\n to spell out dates described in it. So, for example, if a section of an Act refers to “the day on which this section comes into force”, the power would allow the actual date to be substituted, when it becomes known. The amendments to be made by secondary legislation are therefore editorial rather than substantive.\n&#xa0;\n316.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe purpose of the power is to improve the accessibility of legislation, so that those reading legislation will be able to see on the face of the legislation what the relevant dates are without having to look them up, for example by searching through commencement \norder\ns. The power can be used on an ongoing basis, in relation to legislation passed or made after the enactment of the Bill, to replace references to commencement dates with actual dates as and when they become known, but it will also be possible to use it to amend references to commencement dates in existing legislation. \n&#xa0;\nDevolution\n317.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis \npower\n  is\n exercisable in relation to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The power could therefore be used to change references to commencement in legislation which deals with a matter devolved to Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales. In the light of this, discussions are taking place with the devolved administrations to ascertain whether it would be appropriate for legislative consent motions to be sought in respect of clause 49. \n&#xa0;\nEffect of the \nprovision\n318.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe effect of this clause is to provide a flexible mechanism through which legislation can \nbe  edited\n to enable those reading it to readily understand when it came into force. \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation\n319.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is appropriate for the relevant amendments to be made by \norder\n made by statutory instrument so that they are accessible and published in the statutory instrument series.\n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of parliamentary s\ncrutiny\n320.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe proposed new power is not subject to any form of parliamentary procedure. This is because the amendments made using the power will not involve any substantive policy decisions but will reflect decisions made previously. Similar powers have been included in previous legislation – for example, clause 7(2) of the Offender Rehabilitation Bill introduced in the House of Lords on 9 May. This power was not subject to any form of parliamentary procedure.  The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in their Report on that Bill said “we welcome the facility introduced by clause 7(2\n)(\na), as we can see some real advantages for users of legislation in the replacement of references to commencement dates” (First Report of 2013/14; HL Paper 12). Clause 22(3) of the draft Pensions Bill, published on 2 January 2013, also included a similar power, although this was ultimately dropped as it became unnecessary.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClauses  50-57 – orders disapplying legislation no longer of practical use Power conferred on: \n              \n              \nA \nMinister of the Crown\nPower exercised by: \n              \n              \nOrder\n made by statutory instrument\nParliamentary procedure: \n              \nA\n special form of procedure based on section 16 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. \nIntroduction\n321.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe purpose of clause 51 is to enable a Minister of the Crown to use delegated legislation to \ndisapply\n legislation – Acts of Parliament and subordinate legislation made under such Acts -  which is no longer of practical use, thus  rationalising the law. Clauses 54-56 provide safeguards for the use of the power, including the need for appropriate consultation. \n&#xa0;\nDevolution\n322.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis\n power is \nexercisable in relation to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. As \nsuch \nit \nis capable of being used to \ndisapply\n legislation \ndealing with a matter \nwhich falls within the legislative competence \nof \n one\n or more of \nthe devolved \nlegislatures. \nWhere this is the case, and by virtue of clause 52, the Minister must obtain the consent of the relevant devolved administrations before making an \norder\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe effe\nct of the provision\n323.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis clause is intended to provide an accessible mechanism, distinct from, but supplementary to, the Law Commission’s Statute Law (Repeals) Acts and the mechanism provided by Part 1 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006, for removing legislation which is no longer of practical use. The main reasons are likely to be one or more of the following:-\nJustifying the use of delegated legislation\n324.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe use of delegated, rather than primary, legislation to \ndisapply\n legislation which is no longer of practical use will facilitate the removal of \nsuch  legislation\n, so that the statute book can be regularly rationalised in a way which is not unduly burdensome. \n&#xa0;\n325.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Law Commission is responsible for modernising and simplifying the statute book to make it more accessible to those who use the law. This responsibility is fulfilled through the Statute Law (Repeals) Bills which are introduced every \nthere\n or four years. The Scottish Law Commission and the Northern Ireland Law Commission have a similar remit. The reasons for using the power in clause 51 to \ndisapply\n  legislation which is no longer of practical use – which are indicated in paragraph 323 above - are similar to those which the Law Commission takes into account in the context of their repeals work.  However, the advantages of using clause 51 might include the following:-\nJustifying the level of p\narliamentary scrutiny \n326.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \ndepartment\n recognises that it will be possible to use the power in a wide range of situations, and that the question of whether legislation continues to be of practical use does not invariably have an obvious answer. Therefore, the procedure sets down a number of safeguards which the Minister must observe in \norder\n to proceed. These are as follows:- \n327.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is anticipated that each House will amend its standing \norder\ns to deal with the procedure for reporting on draft \norder\ns laid before Parliament under the new power. \n&#xa0;\n328.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe procedure is considered to provide adequate safeguards and an appropriate level of scrutiny for these \norder\ns. It is based on section 16 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 and, like that section, differs in important respects from the usual form of negative procedure under which an \norder\n may be made but is subject to annulment. It provides for an \norder\n to be laid in draft. It also provides that, if a committee of either House recommends that an \norder\n in terms of the draft should not be made, the Minister will not be able to proceed with the making of the \norder\n unless the committee’s recommendation is rejected by a resolution of that House. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n329.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClauses 58 to 61 of the Bill contain two delegated powers.  The first power, in clause 59(1), enables a Minister of the Crown to specify, by \norder\n, the regulatory functions to which the duty to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth (clause 58) and the duty to have regard to any guidance issued (clause 60(4)) apply.  The second power, in clause 60(1), enables a Minister to issue, and from time to time revise, guidance in relation to the exercise of the growth duty.\n&#xa0;\nDevolution\n330.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe powers \nare  exercisable\n in relation to \nEngland and Wales,\n Scotland, and Northern Ireland\n only in relation to matters which\n&#xa0;\nare not\n&#xa0;\ndevolved Welsh matters or are not transferred to Northern Ireland, or which, as regards Scotland,\n&#xa0;\nare reserved.\n There is an express carve out (in clause 59(3)) for devolved matters. \n&#xa0;\nPower exercised by: \n              \nOrder\n made by statutory instrument\n&#xa0;\nParliamentary procedure: \n              \nA\nffirmative \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n331.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe power in clause 59(1) enables a Minister of the Crown to specify, by \norder\n, which regulatory functions are those to which the growth duty in clause 58 and the duty to have regard to guidance in clause 60(4) apply.  \n&#xa0;\n332.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe functions which can be specified by \norder\n are those defined in clause 61.  They include functions exercisable by or on behalf of the Crown (clause 61(2)).\n&#xa0;\n333.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBefore making an \norder\n under clause 59, the Minister must consult any person whose functions are to be specified by \norder\n and such other persons as he considers appropriate.  An \norder\n made under this power must be made by statutory instrument and it is subject to affirmative procedure.\nJustification\n of the delegation\n334.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is appropriate to specify regulatory functions by \norder\n to allow flexibility to add or remove functions where a new regulator or new regulatory functions are created.\nJustification \nof procedure \nand  p\nrecedent\n335.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe procedural requirements for specifying regulatory functions that are subject to the growth duty are broadly similar to the requirements for specifying regulatory functions that are subject to the duty to have regard to the better regulations principles and a statutory code of practice which are set out in section 24 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006, namely that:\n336.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \ndepartment\n considers that clause 59 provides a significant safeguard in relation to the growth duty as it will provide Parliament with the opportunity to debate and approve which particular regulatory functions will be subject to the growth duty.\n&#xa0;\nPower exercised by: \n \n              \nI\nssuing guidance and bringing it into force by \norder\n made by statutory instrument\n&#xa0;\nParliamentary procedure: \n              \nGuidance may not be issued unless a draft has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House; an order bringing the guidance into force is not subject to any parliamentary procedure\n \nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\n337.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClause 60(1) contains a power enabling a Minister of the Crown to issue from time to time guidance to which persons must have regard when exercising the growth duty \nunder clause 58(1).\n&#xa0;\n338.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClause 60(2) and (3) provide that this guidance may concern: \n(a) \n              \nthe\n meaning of economic growth;\n(b) \n              \nthe\n ways in which regulatory functions may be exercised so as to promote economic growth; and \n(c)\n              \nthe\n ways in which compliance with the growth duty can be demonstrated.\nJustification\n of the delegation\n339.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is common for statutory guidance to be issued in a \ndocument  rather\n than being set out in legislation, as this is more flexible.  It will enable the \nGovernment\n to respond quickly to the experiences of those exercising the growth duty in practice and it will ensure that the guidance can be tailored to the needs of different sectors.  \nJustification \nof procedure and p\nrecedent\n340.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \ndepartment\n recognises that the duty to have regard to the promotion of economic growth is potentially wide-ranging and there are therefore rigorous consultation and scrutiny requirements that will apply to the exercise of this power.   \n341.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe procedural requirements for issuing guidance are substantially the same as the procedural requirements for issuing a statutory code of practice in relation to the exercise of specified regulatory functions which are set out at section 23 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006.  The requirements are that:\n342.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNo parliamentary procedure is required for the making of an \norder\n bringing the guidance into force. An \norder\n bringing guidance into force is similar to a commencement \norder\n and it is not usual for commencement \norder\ns to be subject to parliamentary procedure.\nClause 62: consequential amendments, repeals and revocations Power conferred on\n: \n              \n              \nThe\n \nSecretary of State\nPower exercised by: \n              \n              \nOrder\n made by statutory instrument\nParliamentary procedure: \n              \nA\nffirmative for \norder\ns which amend, repeal \nor  revoke\n  any provision of primary legislation; negative for other \norder\ns. \n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n343.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe purpose of clause 62 is to enable the Secretary of State to use delegated legislation to make such provision as is appropriate in consequence of the Act. Such provision may include transitional, transitory or saving provision, and amendments, repeals, revocations or other modifications of any provision of primary or subordinate legislation. \n&#xa0;\n344.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis power is exercisable in relation to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. \n&#xa0;\nDevolution\n&#xa0;\n345.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis power is exercisable in relation to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and includes power to amend legislation passed or made by the devolved legislatures. Any amendments would, however, be consequential on other provisions of the Bill. Discussions as to whether a legislative consent motion is necessary are taking place.\n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the \nprovision\n346.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is a standard clause which provides a mechanism for amending legislation which needs to be changed in consequence of the Act. \n&#xa0;\nJustifying the use of delegated legislation\n&#xa0;\n347.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Bill includes many of the consequential amendments of primary legislation that will be needed as a result of the substantive provision being made by the Bill, although some further consequential amendments of primary legislation may need to be made. \n&#xa0;\n348.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n In addition, consequential amendments of subordinate legislation will be needed.  It was decided that (in the majority of cases) it would be more appropriate to deal with these amendments through an \norder\n making power, rather than on the face of the Bill.\n&#xa0;\nJustifying the level of p\narliamentary scrutiny \n349.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhere the \norder\n making power is to be used \nto  amend\n, repeal or revoke primary legislation, the affirmative procedure was considered appropriate. This is in accordance with normal practice. In other cases, it was considered that the negative procedure is appropriate.  Clause 62 deals with changes which need to be made in consequence of the substantive provisions in the Bill. The policies behind the substantive provisions will already have been debated and approved. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClause 64: Commencement&#xa0;\nPower conferred on\n: \n              \nThe\n Secretary of State\nPower exercised by:\n              \nOrder\n \nmade  by\n statutory instrument\nParliamentary procedure: \n              \nNone\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n350.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClause 64(4) provides that, unless otherwise specified by clause 64, the provisions of the Act will come into force on such day as the Secretary of State may by \norder\n appoint. Clause 64(5) provides that an \norder\n may appoint different days for different purposes. Clause 64(6) provides that the Secretary of State may by \norder\n make such transitional, transitory or saving provision as he or she considers appropriate in connection with the coming into force of any provision of the Act.  \n&#xa0;\n351.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis power is exercisable in relation to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. \n&#xa0;\nThe effect of the \nprovision\n352.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is a standard clause which provides for the commencement by \norder\n of provisions whose commencement dates cannot be identified on the face of the Act; and for any transitional, transitory or saving provision to be made in consequence of the commencement \norder\n or in connection with the coming into force of a provision other than by a commencement \norder\n.  \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the delegation \n353.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor various reasons it has not been possible to identify all commencement dates on the face of the Act. The use of delegated legislation allows for commencement at an appropriate time. \n&#xa0;\nJustification of the level of Parliamentary Scrutiny\n354.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is standard for commencement provision to be subject to no parliamentary procedure. The substantive policy will already have been debated and agreed. \n&#xa0;PENNY COTTONCABINET OFFICE18th September  2013&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1\n&#xa0;\n ‘Prescribed’ means prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State, as set out in section 192(1) of the 1988 Act.\n Woolf, \nJowell\n and Le \nSueur\n, De Smith’s Judicial Review, 6\nth\n edition 2007, paragraph B-010.\n There are two exceptions to this, set out in Schedule 6 paragraph 2(2) and (3) to the 1980 Act (procedure for making and confirming certain orders relating to footpaths and bridleways).
