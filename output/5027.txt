[[[ISSUES AND RESPONSES]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[A]]]

[[[The effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police area]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[B]]]

[[[The role of commissioners in holding their chief constables to account]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I developed my first four-year Police and Crime Plan in consultation with the Chief Constable to ensure it was informed by the Force’s strategic assessment of risks, threats and opportunities, and consistent with the Force’s operational service delivery plan in terms of shared policing priorities, strategic objectives and target outcomes.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Having established common priorities and objectives, I then negotiated agreed performance measures and, where appropriate, performance targets that would enable regular and timely indications as to whether the policing policies, objectives and initiatives incorporated in my Plan are being successfully delivered by the Chief Constable and the Force under her direction and control.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The 2013/14 annual policing budget and medium-term financial plan covering the period 2013-2017 was developed by the Chief Constable and presented to me for consideration and approval.  This process gave me the necessary assurance that:d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Having set my budget for 2013/14 and published the Police and Crime Plan at the end of March 2013, I have agreed a corporate framework for holding the Chief Constable to account for the delivery of the policing priorities and objectives contained in the Plan.  This involves:  e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; With the Chief Constable I have set up a Joint Independent Audit Committee which is charged with reviewing and testing the adequacy and effectiveness of the corporate governance framework and internal management control environment.  This committee reports to both me and the Chief Constable and is due to present to us its first ‘Annual Assurance Report’ later this month (17th December).f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I have regular liaison meetings with HMIC to obtain an independent opinion on the performance of the Force.  HMIC inspection reports and Value for Money (VFM) Profiles contribute to my evidence base and inform my assessment of the performance of the Chief Constable and the Force.g)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I also take into account reports from the external auditor (Ernst and Young) that help inform my views on the quality of financial management arrangements and probity exercised by the Chief Constable and the Force.h)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An area that needs further development is the formal ‘Performance Development Review’ (PDR) process applicable to the Chief Constable to reflect the new governance arrangements following the introduction of PCCs and the establishment of PCCs and chief constables as separate legal entities with specific respective roles and responsibilities.  This is a national issue that has been identified by the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC).&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The role of police and crime panels in holding their commissioners to account]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It has established procedures for determining and conducting its business together with a protocol covering the requests for information from my Office which are conducive to efficient and effective working.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Panel received my draft Police and Crime Plan and subjected it to intensive, but fair, challenge as to the evidence base underpinning my policing and crime priorities and objectives.  c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Panel established a ‘Task and Finish’ group to scrutinise my budget plans in detail in order to inform its views and recommendations concerning my council tax precept proposal for 2013/14. This process also facilitated the Panel to form a view as to whether the proposed annual budget and medium term financial plan had allocated resources appropriately in accordance with priorities and objectives set out in my police and Crime Plan. d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; These processes helped ensure that I and the Panel had shared confidence that the Plan had correctly identified and was properly addressing the ‘right’ priorities of the communities and stakeholders across the Thames Valley, and that the associated objectives could be delivered within the reduced level of resources available. e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Panel’s work programme and business procedures ensure it is reviewing my performance in delivering the strategic objectives set out in my Police and Crime Plan in a methodical and mutually supportive manner.  This process has introduced an independent performance monitoring regime that is effectively acting as an ‘early-warning’ system to inform me, as much as the Panel, as to whether my objectives are being successfully achieved according to plan.f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Finally, where there has been tension between the Panel and myself, it has usually involved the following, linked, issues:Nevertheless, Parliament was quite deliberate in its decisions when creating Panels with a limited set of responsibilities, duties, powers and resources.  This was to avoid panels inadvertently usurping the role of the electorate and of PCC’s.&#xa0;&#xa0;
