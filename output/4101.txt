[[[[PHS0043]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Executive Summary&#xa0;My complaint to PHSO was about the administration and judicial conduct at Barnet County Court. A small claim took 2 years and the courts malice led to an unfounded award of £3k and bankruptcy proceedings. I am in the 1% to have my case fully investigated and upheld (partially). The investigation serves to protect the interests of the public body. Double standards for evidence and shifting goal posts are hallmarks of the investigation. The PHSO exists to perpetuate itself. &#xa0;Original Case&#xa0;I was subject to a campaign of harassment by admin staff at Barnet County Court. On complaining the harassment escalated.  A memo was written to the Judge saying ‘teach her a lesson’. Another memo was equally inflammatory both were heeded by the Judges. One awarded costs of £3k in a case worth £1k. This was a small claim I was un-represented whilst the defendant had a large legal team. District Judge Marin did not explain what unreasonable behaviour merited this outrageous award because he knew there was no basis for it. Litigants in Person are stereotyped and deemed acceptable punch bags by courts around London. There is significant abuse of power. Upon complaining I got no reply and so went via my MP to the PHSO.&#xa0;PHS&#xa0;STAGE ONEThey refused to look at my complaint because I’d not had a final response. I explained that over many months I got NO response to any correspondence, which therefore was part of my complaint. Ignoring this they told me to wait but when I asked how long they weren’t able to tell me. The person spoke well but actually he was a robot following orders.&#xa0;&#xa0;STAGE TWOThis stage was good because of the individual she understood the complaint fully and summarised it properly. &#xa0;LULLED INTO FALSE HOPE WITH A REAL PERSON WHO CAN THINK&#xa0;&#xa0;STAGE THREEThere was no hint the investigator had either the qualifications or experience to investigate a complex case. The PHSO’s idea of an investigation involves the placement of a certain template onto a case. One’s case is made to fit that template and inconvenient bits are dropped or otherwise explained away. Double standards for evidence are employed and goals change all the time. There is bias towards protecting the public body. I needed information to launch a higher court appeal however the PHSO and Ministry of Justice colluded in preventing this happening. Serious and illegal mal administration is ignored whilst trivial matters are upheld. The investigators conduct was poor she misrepresented conversations we had and failed to award costs I’d incurred despite saying she would. I was cheated again. The system is there to batter you into submission so you never dare go near them again.  &#xa0;One of the reasons for taking on my case was disability discrimination. Ironically in her report the investigator was guilty of the same:&#xa0;

[[[‘Due to her anxiety she didn’t understand what she was told’.]]] &#xa0;This was a case of direct discrimination by PHSO the bastions of good complaint handling. She has no evidence to back up this comment and it is untrue however she is allowed to present it as fact. &#xa0;By contrast my evidence and assertions e.g. memos saying ‘TEACH HER A LESSON’ are disregarded. &#xa0;No timescale for the investigation was given. I was suddenly presented with a draft report and told I had 2 weeks to respond. As it had a lot of errors I asked for my file. I was then given 2 weeks to digest 2000 pages/ 5 kg of papers. The PHSO disregarded my legitimate and properly expressed needs for more time. I felt disrespected by their double standards. From their files I learned the investigator delayed the investigation three times amounting to a 6 month delay. No reasons were given yet she pressured me to deliver in 2 weeks.&#xa0;My complaint to [name redacted] was redirected to [name redacted] as there is no access to the heads of this organisation. This reconfirms their arrogance and ethos that they are above us. Even a complaint has to satisfy their criteria before being considered. I do not know any other organisation that demands this but it certainly helps dispose of them. OPEN ACCOUNTABLE?? &#xa0;&#xa0;CONCLUSION&#xa0;The PHSO is a top-heavy organisation that invests in finding ways to keep itself in existence whilst delivering no benefit to the public. By protecting the poor behaviour of public bodies the PHSO has created systemic indifference to complaints. Malignant cultures thrive where no punishment is ever delivered and often only encouraged. The last place such menace should be found is in the Justice system but it is rampant here. Being in the 1% cost me time, effort, uncertainty and loss of opportunity to lodge an appeal. I felt insulted and disrespected in my interactions with the investigator. I hope the 99% may take some solace in that they were saved the additional layers of grief the PHSO inflicted on me. &#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
