"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from Matthew Grove, Police and Crime Commissioner for Humberside [CST0009]&#xa0;\nMany thanks for affording me the opportunity to submit written evidence in relation to your inquiry into \ncrime\n statistics.\n&#xa0;\nThis inquiry is timely as Police and Crime Commissioners are one-year into their roles in holding their Chief Constable to account for the delivery of pol\nicing on behalf of the public.  \nThis inquiry must consider the impact of this signi\nficant \ndevelopment.  It should take into account the \nimprovement in local accountability\n,\n and the transparency\n, contextualisation\n and timeliness of information to the public \nby Police and Crime Commissioners, \nespecially when \ncompared to \nthe time-lag in pub\nlishing national statistics which generally have\n little in the way of local context.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 1: Are crimes being recorded by the police when they should be? Are crimes being categorised correctly?&#xa0;\nWe have all seen the \ncontinued \nreductions in recorded cr\nime over the last several years and the ‘gap’ between recorded crime statistics and the crime survey results.  This ‘gap’ is arguably one of the reasons behind some of the dissatisfaction we hear \nfrom the public \nabout published crime statistics.\n&#xa0;\nLocally, \nthis ‘gap’ has been relatively small and consistent over the years due to the ethical approach adopted\n locally, following the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) \nto the letter\n.\n&#xa0;\nWhat has \nnot\n happened over this period is a \nproper and informed \ndebate \nabout the victi\nms ‘needs’ and a more common-\nsense approach to recording for certain crime categories.  For example, there is a tendency to \n‘\ncrime\n’\n criminal damage or \nthe \nmore minor \n‘\nviolent\n’\n incidents when the victim \nmay \nmerely want some form of restorativ\ne solution \nand\n does not feel a crime has been committed.  Police officers are not always afforded \nthis kind of \ndiscretion\n and \nthe NCRS rules \nsometimes \ntake an element of this away from them.\n&#xa0;\nLocally, we have tended to take a risk-averse approach to the re\ncording of crime.  This has arguably been a contributory factor in our higher levels of crime when compared to our peers.  This makes comparison difficult, but also raises the question over\n whether it is possible or even necessary to have national comparat\nive statistics, especially as the focus of Police and Crime Commissioners is \npredominantly \non local provision.  It also raises the question over whether a national standard for crime recording\n should continue to be \nviewed as achievable or even necessary.\n&#xa0;\nThe other thing we have to remember with recorded crime statistics is that whilst the ‘traditional’ crimes (burglary, vehicle crime, and so on) are falling, fraud is replacing such crimes as the offence of choice for an increasing number of \noffenders\n.  The\n clear message needs to be that whilst\n other reported crime decreases,\n fraud in the \nUK\n is growing.  We also know that a large volume of fraud remains unreported, due to a number of factors such as victimisation of vulnerable and hard \nto reach groups, and w\ne do not know the full scale of the threat and its impact on \nour \nlocal communities.  By focusing on ‘traditional’ crime recording, we are al\nso in fear of putting\n our resources \nnot\n in the places where they are most needed and will reap \nthe greatest benefit \nto victims and our communities.\n&#xa0;\nIt terms of the categorisation of crimes, my \nbiggest\n concern is in relation to elements of violent crime.  The category of violent crime \nwithout injury\n can at times be a ‘catch all’.  Although it is right that we \nsomehow ca\npture minor assaults, as they could be an indicator of escalating activity by a person, whether we should \n‘\nmix\n’\n these incidents in with \nall\n violent crime is questionable.\n&#xa0;\nThere is a further anomaly around violent crime.  Locally we are viewed as having on\ne of the highest levels of recorded violent crime and yet a very low homicide level.  This undermines the validity of the data to some extent and an overall high rate of violent crime doesn’t display the local context, where we \ndon’t\n have a culture of more\n serious and gun crime that you see in other areas of the country.\n  People make the incorrect assumption that they live in a violent place according to the statistics, whereas the reality is somewhat different in most parts of Humberside.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 2: What are the factors which can influence police mis-recording of crime?&#xa0;\nFollowing on from Question 1, they key issue \nis the time-frame for criming.\n&#xa0;\nI believe \nwe need to \nquestion whether the police are sometimes too quick to crime an incident before taking in\nto account the victims wishes and feelings.  The NCRS rules have to some extent taken away the common-sense element of policing.  There is no doubt in my mind that recording rules are a necessity, but we need to look \npotentially \nat a ‘cooling off’ period \nf\nor certain crime types and \nthe ability for discretion by police officers to take what they consider to be an appropriate response (which might not include criming), \nwhilst \nultimately record what is right after taking \nsuch \ntime and accounting for the victim\ns needs.\n&#xa0;\nThe removal of the target culture has \nundoubtedly \nhelped in reducing the possibility \nof \n‘gaming’ by \nofficers categorising crime\ns\n incorrectly, e.g. criming a dwelling burglary as a theft from dwelling when they may have reached their ‘quota’ of dw\nelling burglaries for the month.  This type of activity must be discouraged and the removal of a target culture helps in this respect.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, the over reliance on quantitative data combined with simplistic and inappropriate centrally set targets in \nthe past has, in my opinion, \ncorrupted policing and led to perverse outcomes, devoid of common sense that has undermined public confidence.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 3: Are the right checks in place to ensure that the systems for recording crime functions effectively and accurately?&#xa0;\nThe Police and Crime Commissioners are there to hold their Chief Constable to account on behalf of the public.\n&#xa0;\nThe question we need to ask is whether public perception of crime recording reflects the reality.  It is important\n that systems are in place locally and that they are effective for local circumstances.\n&#xa0;\nIn Humberside, as part of my Police and Crime Plan, I will be rolling out mobile technology to ensure officers are visible in our local neighbourhoods\n and\n in the place\ns where they are most required.  We need to\n recognise the risks in rolling-\nout such technology\n, \nensuring the correct impact on crime recording, consistency and the use of common-sense by officers to individual situations.\n&#xa0;\nI am aware of the work by Her Maj\nesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) around data integrity.  This relies on a limited sample and doesn’t fully take into account the work undertaken by local Crime Registrars\n in their audits, findings and learning points.  This local element to me is\n important to \nensure that \nour\n systems locally are as effective and accurate as they can be.  We need to create an atmosphere where we do things right for the victim in the first instance and correct any issues \nquickly \nif things do not go as expected.\n&#xa0;\nI wi\nll give an example where it could be questioned whether crimes are being recorded accurately.  Locally we have a high incidence of criminal damage (a crime) and a low incidence of anti-social behaviour (an incident).  It could be argued that we have taken \na risk-averse approach to recording, hence the high-level of criminal damage.  Less risk-averse approaches could produce a more \n‘\nbalanced\n’\n level of crimes and incidents.  Our approach indicates that we could be over-recording criminal damage, although our \ndata integrity audits show that NCRS compliance is excellent, i.e. we’re \nnot\n over-recording.  \nBut this raises two questions: (i) whether othe\nrs are following a similar line\n and (ii) \nthe \ncomparability of figures between forces.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 4: Has enough been done to ensure the integrity of crime data? What more should be done?&#xa0;\nSee answer 3 above.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 5: To what extent can policy-makers have confidence in the statistics which result from the recording of crime by police forces?&#xa0;\nIt is important for \nPolice and Crime Commissioners to have confidence in the\nir\n statistics locally in order to hold to account the Chief Constable on behalf of the public.  This is impo\nrtant for me at a local level.\n&#xa0;\nI \nam \nuncertain as to the level of confidence within other po\nlice forces and the ability for national policy-makers to have confidence in this data.  However, the duties of the Police and Crime Commissioner are clear\n,\n and if they are undertaken adequately then confidence in the data should be high.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 6: Should recorded crime statistics be classified as National Statistics?&#xa0;\nIt is important that the statistics are accurate at a local level as part of my statutory duties.  \nThe focus on local solutions through local statistics must be the way forward in the firs\nt instance.\n&#xa0;\nI believe that the National Statistics can be unrepresentative of the local picture.  In addition, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) now tend to produce quarterly figures which are devoid of context and tend to merely restate th\nose\n figures presented to them in the first \ninstance\n.  This is due in part to the risk-averse nature of crime statistics publications.  However, the ONS has produced guidance on the publication of local data which is useful to follow.\n&#xa0;\nWe also need to bear in \nmind that we should all move away from the current culture of the recorded crime data being seen as the ‘result’ which is then often used as the stick.  We need to move to a place where the figures are used as ‘guidance’, for what they tell us as part of a\nn overall holistic assessment of performance.  This includes a mixture of local qualitat\nive as well as quantitative data\n.\n&#xa0;\nFinally, we need to publish statistics with con\ntext and in a manner which incentivises \npeople \nto \nreporting and/or forces \nto \nrecord.  \nThe clearest examples are the increasing rates of sexual crime and \ndomestic violence that are evident throughout many parts of the country at present.  Such rises are depicted by the media and others as failure, whereas what they actually demonstrate is su\nccess through partnership working and the increase in the confidence of victims to report the crime by the variety of means we make available to them.\n&#xa0;\nThe more serious crimes tend to be grossly underreported and we must make all efforts to encourage repor\nting of such crimes.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
