[normal]Supplementary written submission from Phil Watts (BRC 76)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Building Regulations certification of electrical installation and repairs in dwellings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following the Select Committee meeting last Monday I felt it was prudent to outline some of the major issues that were discussed. You may find this helpful for the Committee.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The current requirements of Part P, Electrical Safety, Building Regulations.[bold]Design and installation[bold]&#xa0;[bold]P.1 [bold]Reasonable provision shall be made in the design and installation of electrical installations in order to protect persons operating,
[normal] [bold]maintaining or altering the installations from fire or injury.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This has been ‘achieved’ (for domestic dwellings only) by making the majority of electrical work in or attached to domestic dwellings ‘NOTIFIABLE WORK’. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]‘[bold]Notifiable[bold] work’[bold] now consists of –
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Within Zone 0, 1 or 2 in a bathroom or shower room
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A room containing a swimming pool or sauna heater
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]‘Non-[bold]notifiable[bold] work’[bold] consists of – 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For notifiable electrical work, one of three procedures must be followed, to certify that the work complies with the requirements set out in the Building Regulations
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The work must also be inspected and tested in accordance with the procedures laid down in BS7671, the Wiring Regulations, currently the 17
[normal]th
[normal] edition:2008, as amended in 2011.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Benefits of Part P.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Part P achieved a number of things.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]What Part P has not achieved.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Unfortunately Part P has not fully achieved its main requirement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Negative effects of Part P.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Part P has had a number of detrimental issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Notification procedures[bold]&#xa0;[bold]As previously stated, notifiable works can currently be notified in one of three ways, none of which are satisfactory, as they are all open to abuse.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Qualified Supervisor[bold] – this person is the point of contact for the competence process. There is no limit to how many ‘electricians’ one Q.S. can cover, so in large firms the Q.S. could be responsible for hundreds of installers. The installers do not even have to be qualified or competent electricians, however the Q.S. is responsible for ensuring the work is carried out suitably, not really possible when they are responsible for a large number of installers! The Q.S. is the only person assessed by the scheme providers, hence if two decent jobs can be prepared with the correct paperwork, it is not difficult to pass the assessment process to be registered as an approved domestic installer, even though the majority of the workforce may have no idea about electrical safety, theory, principles or practice. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Qualifications and Competence[bold]The EAWR 1989 and BS7671:2011 both state that persons undertaking electrical work should be competent enough to avoid danger. Neither uses the term ‘qualified’. So what do we mean by the term? Taking two definitions from different sources, the term qualified is defined as;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a/. meeting the proper standards and requirements and training for an office or position or task;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b/. quality or skill needed for a particular activity, 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]       The Wiring Regulations (BS7671:2011) defines a competent person as someone who;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Possesses sufficient technical knowledge, relevant practical skills and experience for the nature of the electrical work undertaken and is able at all times to prevent danger and, where appropriate, injury to him/herself and others.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The National Occupational Standards detail the knowledge and skills requirements for persons involved in electrical installation work, so why do we allow people who have clearly not attained these standards to carry out electrical work?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Way Forward?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]a).  Licensing[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Currently the J.I.B. operate a system that recognises qualifications, job experience and knowledge, and grades applicants accordingly. In conjunction with the E.C.A. they administer the E.C.S. card system. (Electrotechnical Certification Scheme).    
[normal]http://www.ecscard.org.uk/
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Briefly, the ECS card is the ‘electrical equivalent’ of the CSCS card that is operated on most construction sites, where possession of a card is required for all personnel to gain access to work on site. The CSCS card is awarded following successful completion of a Health &amp; safety test. The ECS card, which should be a requirement for all persons carrying out electrical installation, requires two things;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On achievement an applicant is provided with the ECS card which details their grading as assessed by JIB and their details, which can then be shown to potential customers. This provides the customer with proof of identification and gives them a guide as to the competency of the person turning up on their doorstep to do the work. The cost of the JIB application, grading and exam is £78.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The JIB/ECA administered ECS card scheme is the one scheme that is currently capable of grading all operatives with at least some level of accuracy. This system or something very similar should be adopted, and developed into a scheme providing a license to practice as an electrician, as exists in many other countries. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b).   Notification[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The option of changing what constitutes ‘notifiable work’ again does not make much sense. To make everything ‘notifiable’ would cause a major overload for Building Controls and ‘competent person schemes’. Currently major works are notifiable, and that is how it should remain, but a campaign to raise awareness and explain how the system works should be undertaken. All installers, whether in a ‘scheme’ or not must ensure the process is followed as required under the Building Regulations. Again, if licensing is brought in, this information can be promulgated during the licensing process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c). Inspection, Testing and Certification[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]A campaign to ensure that all work (including minor works which are not notifiable), is correctly inspected, tested and certified would reap real benefits in improving the safety of installations. Currently many of the operatives carrying out installation work are not sufficiently qualified or competent to complete the installation work correctly, let alone the inspection, testing and certification. The licensing of electricians would again alleviate this situation, as only suitably qualified persons will be able to work alone. This does not preclude the option of supervised persons assisting and learning on the job. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]d). Enforcement[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The HSE already have powers under the Health &amp; Safety at Work Act and the Electricity at Work Regulations, to prosecute anyone who fails to install electrical systems safely. Anyone failing to follow the correct procedures for notifiable work can also be prosecuted for not complying with the Building Regulations. Those attempting DIY in their own home are harder to control, as much of it is non-notifiable work not carried out in the workplace. One suggestion is to introduce a requirement for an inspection and testing 
[normal]certificate as part of the home insurance for private homes and as part of the landlords requirements for rented accommodation. If the inspection and testing certificate were valid for a maximum of 3 years for private and two years for rented accommodation, this would then mean that all dwellings would need proper inspection and testing regularly. The cost of a periodic inspection and test averages at about £160, not so much when taken over a three year period. In this way electrical DIY would be much less appealing and much more work will be left to the professionals.
