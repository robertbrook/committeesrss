[[[Executive Summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.              The achievement of White working class children has become one of the most high profile issues in English education. In reality, however, the situation is not as simple nor as clear-cut as imagined in much of the media coverage. ‘Social class’ is a term whose frequent use in everyday speech belies the complexity of applying it in educational research and the different interpretations can cause very serious misunderstandings. The best available data demonstrate clearly that working class pupils, in all ethnic groups, achieve less well on average than their middle class peers. However, the current debate is skewed by a focus on the smaller inequalities of achievement between working class children in different ethnic groups. The broad image of ‘White working class’ failure reported by many commentators is based on data that describe the low average attainments of those in receipt of free school meals (FSM). This is a crude indicator of family poverty and does not capture the everyday meaning of ‘working class’: most people who think of themselves as ‘working class’ would not be placed within the FSM group in educational statistics. Using a more reasonable and robust measure of social class (related to socioeconomic status) reveals a strong direct relationship between social class and differences in educational achievement: working class children (in each ethnic group) tend to underachieve in relation to their middle class peers of the same ethnicity. In addition, White working class children do less well on average than working class children in some – but not all – minority ethnic groups. The simplistic and alarmist picture that is built on FSM data, therefore, is misleading and dangerous: this erroneous view distracts from the larger inequality of achievement related to class differences within the White group, feeds anti-diversity sentiments that could inflame racial hatred, and hides the continuing inequality of achievement experienced by many minority ethnic pupils.&#xa0;

In view of our internationally recognized expertise in the field, our evidence to the committee examines the issues in relation to questions of racism and ethnic diversity in education.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Understanding Under]]]

[[[achievement]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.              There are several different ways of thinking about underachievement. In general terms the concept is based on comparing the achievement of one group (‘A’) against another (‘B’) and judging the scale of the inequality in attainment. If we abandon long-discredited notions of inherited and stable differences in ‘intelligence’ between different social groups – and the overwhelming scientific consensus is that we should - then underachievement is based on the idea that if one group can achieve so highly, there is no reason why all groups cannot achieve at such a level: this is the view accepted in most UK education policy since the late 1970s. &#xa0;4.              For example, if 50% of social group ‘A’ attains a particular level of achievement but only 20% of group ‘B’ achieves the same level, then we can say that group ‘B’ underachieves by 30 percentage points in relation to group ‘A’.&#xa0;5.              There are other approaches to measuring underachievement but none enjoy the advantages of this approach, which is easily understood and widely accepted by education professionals, policy-makers and parents.&#xa0;

[[[A Word of Caution: t]]]

[[[he danger of deficit analyses]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.              One of the most basic lessons in statistical analysis is that association does not prove causation. If reliable data suggest that a social group is underachieving, this raises a cause for concern and the reasons for the underachievement should be investigated. Unfortunately, the history of British education (in policy and practice) suggests that when lower socio-economic groups and/or minority ethnic groups are found to underachieve there is a tendency to automatically assume that the problem must lie with the group itself, as if that group exhibits some kind of deficit. The popular press frequently blame underachievement on a lack of support by parents and/or low aspirations on the part of pupils; but there are many cases where extremely supportive and ambitious parents and children are thwarted by the low expectations of schools and institutional selection measures that make it difficult for some children to succeed no matter how hard they work, e.g. by placing them in low-ranked teaching groups (‘sets’, ‘streams’ and/or ‘bands’) that do not cover the whole curriculum and where children are entered for examinations in which the highest pass grades are simply not available.&#xa0;7.              Working class students tend to do less well but this does not necessarily mean that they or their parents are the problem. Such deficit assumptions often blame the victim and fail to consider other factors that are highly significant but lie beyond the control of the pupil and family.&#xa0;

[[[ the same]]]&#xa0;8.              ‘Social class’ is a term whose frequent use in everyday speech belies the complexity of applying it in educational research and the different interpretations can cause very serious misunderstandings. &#xa0;9.              In common usage there is an assumption that ‘social class’ relates to a combination of factors (often including income, lifestyle, social status etc) that describe an important set of family characteristics. Researchers use a variety of different scales to try to capture the importance of social class, also commonly referred to as ‘socioeconomic status’ (SES). These scales are regularly revised to reflect changing understandings in society and using them in research can be quite expensive (because they require a good deal of detailed information on each respondent). Gathering reliable data on family circumstances from children can be especially difficult. Performing robust analyses of educational data using SES is, therefore, time-consuming, expensive and complex. However, the use of nationally-representative samples can provide an excellent compromise between the need for sufficiently detailed background data to be gathered without the necessity of including every child in the research itself. See paragraph 14 (below).&#xa0;10.              

[[[The advantage]]]

[[[s]]]

[[[ of using ‘FSM’ ]]]

[[[as an indicator]]]: A great deal of educational research, including some official statistics, use a much simpler approach to give an indicator of economic disadvantage, that is, receipt of free school meals (FSM). This is a crude proxy for family poverty. The main advantages of this approach are that:&#xa0;(a)              the data are inexpensive to collect (every school can give such details as a matter of course); &#xa0;(b) the analysis is simple (comparing FSM with Non-FSM); and&#xa0;(c ) the results are often very clear (usually showing a stark difference between the two groups).   &#xa0;11.

[[[s]]]

[[[ of using ‘FSM’ ]]]

[[[as an indicator]]]: pupils in receipt of free school meals are among the most economically disadvantaged in the school population but:&#xa0;(a) FSM is an incomplete measure of disadvantage: some pupils who qualify for FSMs do not take them up, partly because of the social stigma that attaches in some schools and communities;&#xa0;(b) FSM is not the same as ‘working class’. According to one national survey 57% of British adults describe themselves as ‘working class’.[] But FSM pupils account for around 14% of 16 year olds.[] &#xa0;FSM status is a reasonable indicator of whether a child lives in a household with no employment but it is the least powerful of the many different SES indicators that are available.&#xa0;12.              Although many commentators, researchers and others frequently use FSM as a short-hand for ‘working class’ this is neither accurate nor helpful. The majority of people who think of themselves as ‘working class’ are excluded from the FSM group. When commentators use ‘FSM’ as if it were a measure of working class status, they effectively treat around 85% of the pupil population as ‘middle class’! &#xa0;

[[[Q: ]]]

[[[Is there working class under-achievement?]]]

[[[ A: Yes]]]&#xa0;13.              Robust measures of socioeconomic status (SES) are very strongly associated with significant differences in educational achievement. Put simply, research consistently shows that the higher a pupil’s SES, the more likely they are to succeed in school, to attend elite universities, and to achieve the highest degree classifications. This general pattern is broadly true for both genders and within each of the main ethnic minority groups. Hence, working class pupils (measured by SES) are less likely to achieve the best results than middle class pupils of the same sex and ethnic origin.&#xa0;

Connolly (Queens University, Belfast).&#xa0;14.              This table shows the proportion of children gaining five or more higher grade GCSEs in the summer of 2006. Remarkably, because of a change in the frequency of government-funded surveys of this kind, this is the most complete analysis of achievement (by class and ethnic origin) that will be available until a new survey in the summer of 2015.[] This data has one major advantage in that it uses a robust measure of SES which approximates to the common usage of terms like ‘middle’ and ‘working’ class. In addition, the sample is nationally representative. We can see that, using this measure of social class, there are several answers to the question ‘is there White working class underachievement?’ depending on the comparison group:&#xa0;(a) There is underachievement insofar as White working class children achieve less well on average than White middle class children. The gap between White middle class and White working class achievement is 34 percentage points.              (b) We can also see that there is underachievement in relation to working class children in some minority ethnic groups (including Indian, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and Black African children). The largest gap is in relation to working class Bangladeshi peers (26.7 percentage points). &#xa0;(c) However, White working class children are more likely to succeed educationally than their working class peers of Black Caribbean and Mixed ethnic heritage (in the latter group most children have one White and one Black Caribbean parent). This is also likely to be the case for Gypsy/Roma and Traveller children although they are not included in this dataset. The gap between White working class children and their Black Caribbean peers is 11.7 percentage points.&#xa0;15.              Taking account of a reliable and representative understanding of social class, therefore, it is not the case that White working class children underachieve in relation to working class children from all other ethnic backgrounds.&#xa0;

[[[But what about all the news stories?]]]&#xa0;16.              For several years it has been common to read of the especially disadvantaged position of White working class children in schools; indeed, they are often described as the very lowest achieving group:&#xa0;              White working-class boys ‘worst performers at school’ (2008)’[]&#xa0;              White working class boys are schools' worst performing ethnic group by age of 11 (2009)[]&#xa0;              White British pupils from working class homes are more likely to fail at school than any other ethnic group (2012)[]&#xa0;              WHITE British working class children are a “hidden problem” in schools and least likely to succeed (2013)[]&#xa0;17.              As we have shown (paras 14 &amp; 15) White working class children are not the very lowest achieving group. The stories noted here are, in fact, reporting data that compares White FSM pupils (mostly households without employment) against other FSM pupils from minority ethnic groups. This pattern is important but it relates to a much smaller group of children than is supposed by the phrase ‘working class.’ We believe that this slippage in terminology has important and damaging consequences, which should be born in mind when addressing the question of White educational achievement.&#xa0;

[[[:  ]]]We noted earlier that White working class underachievement is greatest in relation to their White middle class peers (para. 14). The differences in achievement between N-FSM children of different ethnicities is also generally much smaller than the gap between White N-FSM and White FSM – and yet this larger gap goes unreported in a great deal of commentary in the media and elsewhere. In the most recent data on children attending state-maintained secondary schools:[] 30.5% of White British children known to be eligible for FSM achieved five or more higher grade GCSEs including English and mathematics (both sexes). The achievement of other groups was as follows: 41.3% of FSM ‘Mixed’ children (a gap of 10.8 percentage points); 51.8% of FSM ‘Asian’ children (a gap of 21.3 percentage points); and 45.6% of FSM ‘Black’ children (15.1 percentage points). However, the same level was achieved by 62.7% of N-FSM White British children (a gap of 32.2 percentage points). An overwhelming focus on White FSM children in comparison to other FSM children in different ethnic groups, therefore, distracts from the larger underachievement within the White group.&#xa0;18 (b):

[[[ sentiments and could inflame racial hostility: ]]]Based on a misrepresentation of the true picture, there is a danger of inciting racial hostility by encouraging a wholly misleading image of White racial victimization. Around 10 per cent of White children receive FSM but reporting their attainment as a ‘working class’ issue risks giving the impression that this applies to more than half of all White children (see para. 11b). This is not only untrue but wholly irresponsible and dangerous.&#xa0;18(c ):

[[[and the continuing issue of institutional racism in schools]]]: The latest GCSE results for state-maintained schools show that overall White British pupils are more likely to attain five or more higher grade GCSEs (including English and maths) than their peers of Black Caribbean, Mixed (White/Black Caribbean), Pakistani and Black African ethnic heritage.[] And yet these wider patterns are absent from debate. For many years it has been known that Black and other minority ethnic groups face a range of disadvantages within the school system. This has been documented by numerous research studies, conducted by a range of researchers who have been funded by a diversity of academic and charitable bodies. Institutional racism is subtle, complex but very damaging. The distorted and erroneous view of White victimization is driving a belief that racism has been eradicated in schools. Funds to support the recruitment and retention of Black and minority ethnic staff have ended and specialist support for minority achievement is being cut in many areas. This is a dangerous situation in which racial inequalities not only persist but could grow.&#xa0;

[[[overnment]]]&#xa0;19.              Informed policy-making assumes an accurate understanding of the current situation; at present, detailed and robust information about attainment in relation to both social class and ethnic origin is surprisingly scarce. The best available statistical evidence arises from a survey conducted in 2006 (see para. 14). The present debate is largely shaped by crude data (based on free school meal statistics) that dangerously mis-represent the true situation when they are reported in broad and over-simplistic terms (see para. 18). A crucial role for government, therefore, is to fund robust and reliable research into education, including both quantitative and qualitative studies that are fit for purpose.&#xa0;20.              The situation that we outline in this document could be addressed successfully if government policy was made with greater awareness of the fact that every policy change is mediated by differences in social class and ethnic background at the school level; even policies that are silent on class and race matters will have different impacts according to class and race. This is because schools, like society, are not level playing fields and so, unless an understanding of present inequalities and problems is built into every stage of policy formation, then even well-intentioned policies can have direct negative unforeseen consequences.&#xa0;21.              The use of academic selection inside schools (in sets, streams and/or different exam pathways) is known to be biased on race and class grounds, and yet reforms are frequently enacted with little or no safeguards against such problems. There is a strong case for strengthening the use of equality impact assessments to avoid such problems in the future. Unfortunately, to date the use of impact assessments has tended to be piecemeal and, in many cases, they have not dealt with race inequalities in a rigorous or meaningful way.&#xa0;22.              A serious commitment to equality of opportunity requires that all adults in positions of responsibility in schools (including headteachers, teachers, teaching assistants and governors) receive appropriate training to increase their awareness of how class and race inequalities are frequently (if unwittingly) institutionalized. There is considerable research evidence showing that routine decisions about assessment, selection and discipline, for example, act unnecessarily to disadvantage particular groups of pupils, especially those from working class and minority ethnic backgrounds. Robust measures to work towards greater social justice in education is an essential element of any system that aspires to be numbered among the best in the World.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
