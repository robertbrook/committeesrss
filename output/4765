[normal]Written evidence submitted by Andre [bold]Menache[bold] BSc([bold]Hons[bold]) [bold]BVSc[bold] MRCVS on behalf of the Animal Welfare Party. (www.animalwelfareparty.org)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Executive summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]The Animal Welfare Party (formerly Animals Count) is a UK political party 
[normal] believing in a better future for people, animals and the environment. Our policies are aimed at creating a fairer, more equitable and sustainable society in which the interests of the environment, people and animals are taken into account. 
[normal]The party’s principles include:

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In respect of animals kept as companions- our party believes in the need to:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Exact figures on the number of non human primates (hereinafter referred to simply as primates) kept in the UK do not exist. The estimated number of primates kept as pets in the UK is of the order of 5 000. 
[normal]The capture and transport associated with trapping in the wild may result in much suffering (physical as well as mental) to the animals
[normal] and may also be responsible for the death of individuals at the time of capture or during subsequent transport
[normal]. 
[normal]Smuggling of primates into the UK and the unregulated sale by private breeders are the major contributors to the current situation. In addition, it is possible that primates that are surplus to requirement for scientific purposes at registered primate breeding centres could find their way onto this market.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The absence of official figures and the fact that there exists only a rough estimate of the true number of primates kept as pets in the UK is already an indicator that the existing regulatory framework and Code of Practice do not offer adequate protection for the welfare of primates kept as pets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The current situation, in which the largely unregulated sale and housing of exotic pets in general, and of primates in particular, is allowed to flourish in the UK, is out of step with society’s increasing recognition of the principle of animal rights. The keeping of wild animals as pets is also inconsistent with basic principles of animal health and welfare. Unlike dogs and cats, the expert knowledge base required for the keeping of primates as pets is beyond the reach of most ordinary citizens.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Very few people have the expert knowledge required to properly care for a primate; and their specialised needs with respect to their diet, their housing, environmental enrichment, the need for social interaction with members of their own species, in addition to the need to move around and explore. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Therefore, a common sense approach means that we as a society should err on the side of animal welfare and implement a ban on the keeping of primates as pets. It should be obvious to anyone that it would be virtually impossible for a private individual to fulfil all of the Five Freedoms in order to keep a monkey as a pet, as outlined by the RSPCA:   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]In addition to the above welfare considerations, there are also strong public health reasons for advocating a ban on the keeping of primates as pets. Since primates and humans are more closely related in evolutionary terms than say, people and dogs, the risk of transmitting serious infection either from primate to human, or vice versa, is very real. There are a number of potentially serious viral and bacterial diseases that may be transmitted via saliva, nasal secretions or faeces. These are in addition to the risks of injury to people from bites or scratches.
[normal]Implementation of a ban on the keeping of primates as pets.[bold]Once registered, the premises would be visited as soon as possible by a veterinary inspection team (ideally a veterinary surgeon and an animal behaviourist) to assess the health and welfare of the primates. If the health and welfare conditions were found to be significantly lacking (based on a predetermined list of criteria, along the lines of the Five Freedoms), then the primate(s) would be confiscated and placed in a suitable sanctuary. The costs to the sanctuaries of keeping additional animals could be met in part by the fines collected from individuals who had not registered their primates and from licence fees (see below). 
[normal]However, if the health and welfare conditions were found to be very marginally lacking then the inspection team could carefully weigh up the possibility of issuing a list of improvements to the owner, and provided these could be met within a specified time period, allow the owner to keep the primate as a pet. This exception would apply chiefly to those situations where there is convincing evidence to show that the owner and primate have formed a strong emotional bond and to separate them could conceivably cause more distress to the primate than removal to a sanctuary (assuming a suitable sanctuary would be available). In these 
[normal]cases, arrangements would need to be made to ensure that the primate could not be used for breeding purposes (e.g. contraception, sterilisation or other appropriate guarantee). Owners allowed to keep their primates as pets would need to pay an annual licence fee to ensure that the primate could be accounted for, for the rest of its life. The licence fee could also go towards covering the cost of sanctuaries who receive confiscated primates.
