defaultHastoe is a rural specialist housing association and has developed affordable homes for local people in more than 200 villages across the south of England.  Most of these schemes are on rural exception sites.
defaultLocal transport is a significant factor in determining our residents’ quality of life.  Poor transport links can limit their ability to work, to access training, health care, quality food and their ability to maintain social networks.
default  
defaultOur experience is that rural public transport where we build homes is often irregular and inconvenient.  
defaultThrough our social media channels, we asked residents how effectively Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities and how they could be improved.

default Community transport services only partially meet my needs - they never run in the evenings, Sundays or public holidays. They also only run to certain places on certain days. They are not actually that 'flexible'. 
default 
defaultStandard bus services were good but expensive here before the cuts
default.
defaultThey could be improved by
default re-introducing bus subsidies (scrapped by Somerset County Council in 2011) so standard/community services can run to cover these times. For example, last year, on the Queen's jubilee weekend, there were no services for 
defaultfour
default days because of the public holidays.
defaultDespite the current vogue for 'community transport' it's definitely not the cure-all for rural isolation - people need regular, reasonable services for essential trips - like getting to work - and community transport just can't meet that need
default.

default3.1default              defaultHastoe gives serious consideration to the transport implications for residents when assessing potential development sites
default to ensure new residents are not isolated from the community.
default3.2default              defaultSome rural communities have established community-owned and based rural transport which provides such key transport services where the public and private sectors have failed. 
defaultIn our experience these range from share a car services to more sophisticated transport services based on timetables.
defaultAn alternative to investing in transport services is to support the development of community based services and facilities.
default4.1default              
defaultHastoe’s rural housing management model is based on taking our services to the communities we serve rather than relying on them coming to us.  We have a mobile housing management team who tour our rural schemes and we operate a multi-function ‘Hastoe to you’ bus.  This brings a wide range of services to our rural communities including roadshows on specific subjects such as welfare reform or money management (promotion of credit unions over moneylenders and pay day loan companies).

defaultSupporting the burgeoning network of community owned shops through working alongside the Plunkett Foundation.  Community based shops not only provide local people with food and goods that they would otherwise need to travel to purchase, but also act as a social space while keeping volunteers active within their community.

defaultSupporting the development of Village Agents.  This is 
defaultan innovative response to a recognised need that many people living in our rural communities are unable to connect with the key services that help maintain well-being and support their quality of life. 
defaultThe Somerset Village Agents Project was launched in January 2012 and builds on a tried and tested concept originating in Gloucestershire. 
defaultIssues dealt with include:
