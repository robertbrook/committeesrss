"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Dr Carl Reynolds (GMC022)I am a respiratory physician and an academic. I have previously written in the British Medical Journal[1][2] on the topic of conflict \nof interest, am co-founder of Bad Guidelines, a successful campaign for guidance on interactions between healthcare professionals and the pharmaceutical industry to be evidence based[3], and part of a campaign for medical education accredited free from ind\nustry influence called Conflict Free Conferences[4].\nI am writing to draw attention to two areas where intervention from the GMC would be beneficial to both doctors and patients.\nConflict of interest and routine researchAs a physician I care deeply about \nproviding the best treatment I can to my patients. In many areas of medicine establis\nhing what the best treatment \nis hard in itself either because of an abundance of conflicting evidence or a lack of evidence altogether.\nUnfortunately, this is made even ha\nrder because a lack of means to track conflict of interest for health care professionals creates difficulty in identifying instances where educational and academic resources may be being deliberately biased to a commercial end. A register of doctors' confl\nicts of interest would make critical appraisal of such resources much easier.\nThe GMC may consider making part of register available, specifically the list of doctors names, specialties, and GMC numbers to allow others to keep track of these conflicts of i\nnterests in a similar way to existing websites such as \nwww.theyworkforyou.com\n do for politicians.\nIt is a lost opportunity when the potential learning from situations where there is genuinely no evidence availa\nble that one treatment will be better than another is not captured through pragmatic randomised controlled trials or other means. The GMC should consider reinstating a recommendation to encourage such research[6]\nCreating a register for doctorsâ€™ conflicts \nof interest and encouraging research in routine care would both bode well with the first of the GMC's duties of a doctor:\n\"MAKE THE CARE OF YOUR PATIENT YOUR FIRST CONCERN; Protect and promote the health of patients and the public; Respect patients' right \nto confidentiality; Never discriminate unfairly against patients or colleagues;\"\nas well as Beauchamp and Childress's primary principle of medical ethics \n\"Respect for autonomy: respecting the decision-making capacities of autonomous persons; enabling indi\nviduals to make reasoned informed choices.\"\nand intervention here would be most welcome.\nReferences1. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2483855/\n2. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22531810\n3. http://badguidelines.org/\n4. http://www.conflictf\nreeconferences.com/\n5. http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/duties_of_a_doctor.asp\n6. http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f3879\n7.http://www.ukcen.net/index.php/ethical_issues/ethical_frameworks/the_four_principles_of_biomedical_ethics\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
