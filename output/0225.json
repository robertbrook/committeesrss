"Written evidence submitted by the Royal Statistical Society (FSS034)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThese practitioner-orientated publications, intended for wide dissemination, will go some way to satisfying part of one of the key recommendations of the Silverman review ‘Research and development in forensic science: a review’.  These manuals endeavour to provide lawyers, courts and expert witnesses with practical guidance and ‘authoritative reviews’ of the interpretation and evaluation of judicial evidence with a statistical or probabilistic component.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAn independent forensic science institute with a remit to commission and conduct research and development in forensic science would be the most obvious, and perhaps most desirable, way of filling this significant institutional gap in the UK’s criminal justice machinery. Notably, Recommendation 1 of the US National Academies’ wide-ranging and authoritative review of forensic science in the USA was that:\n&#xa0;\nTo promote the development of forensic science into a mature field of multidisciplinary research and practice, founded on the systematic collection and analysis of relevant data, Congress should establish and appropriate funds for an independent federal entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science (NIFS). (National Research Council, \nStrengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward \n(2009), 2-21).\n&#xa0;\nPrior to its closure and the dispersal of its physical and human resources, the Forensic Science Service (FSS)  might have provided firm foundations on which a UK institute could be built. With the FSS disbanded, and its expertise dissipated (and potentially draining away), the creation of an independent institute presents greater challenges. Moreover, there is an additional element of urgency, in that some key staff may retire or relocate overseas before their advice or other, more substantial, contributions can be secured.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is worth noting that some statements that forensic scientists have routinely stated, for example, that a particular technique provides a unique identification, are now of questionable scientific validity and some courts in the US have limited what can be said.  The book by Brandon Garrett \n(2011) \nConvicting the Innocent\n (Harvard University Press) studied the first 250 people exonerated by the Innocence Project on the basis of DNA evidence (theirs did NOT match the crime scene). In 75% of the cases, there was erroneous eye witness testimony and in 75% of the cases there were errors in the forensic evidence (some cases had both types of incorrect evidence). Also, some state courts now carefully examine eyewitness identifications and evaluate whether \"line-ups\" were properly conducted. Two examples are State v. Lawson Or. No S059234 (2012) and State v. Henderson 27. A. 3d 872 (NJ. 2011). \n&#xa0;\nScientific evidence today plays an ever-expanding role in criminal proceedings in the UK, and statistics and probabilistic reasoning underpin modern science. One unfortunate consequence of the closure of the FSS, however, has been the dispersal of its in-house statistics and interpretation group.  This group was a significant national asset, both in terms of its direct input into FSS case-work and as a producer of published research at the cutting edge of international debate. The synergy which arises when a group of talented individuals work together far outweighs the opportunity for the education of others that may be thought a benefit of dispersal. Yet it is difficult to see how a disaggregated constellation of small providers could ever achieve the economies of scale (supposing it had the motivation) to r\neplicate such concentrated expertise in forensic statistics. This would be another area, of prime concern to the Society, for proactive intervention and strategic direction for any mooted forensic science institute for the UK. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Society is unaware of a published strategy for forensic science in the UK.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBy its very nature, research is a long-term activity.  A period of two years since the announcement of the closure is too short a time for the effect on research to be noticed.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSee paragraph 9\n above.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nht\ntp://www.rss.org.uk/statsandlaw\n"
