[normal]
[normal] In support of the written submission by the Community Law Partnership, the ITMB would also like to express concern regarding clause 21 of the bill which proposes to remove the power of ministers to require local authorities in England to prepare local housing strategies under Section 87 of the Local Government Act 2003 (including the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers).
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal] Clause 21 proposes as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](1) Section 87 of the Local Government Act 2003 (which confers powers on the Secretary of State, in relation to England and the Welsh Ministers, in relation to Wales, to require local housing authorities to have housing strategies and to prepare housing statements) ceases to have effect in relation to England.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal] We would refer to Housing Act 2004 Section 225 and the duty on local authorities to assess the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal] We would also refer to the fact that some 14% of the Gypsy and Traveller population in England who live in caravans reside on unauthorised encampments and unauthorised developments.
[normal]  The reason why this occurs is that there is inadequate provision of sites due to the stigma and discrimination experienced by these communities, especially in respect of accommodation issues.
[normal] The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has found that ‘the lack of secure accommodation for 
[normal]nomadic
[normal] groups remains the lynchpin of a plethora of other inequalities.’
[normal] The EHRC has also noted that ‘the main barrier to provision is the planning system and, more fundamentally, resistance from the sedentary population to the idea of new sites for Gypsies and Travellers.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal] The impact of the discrimination and inequality experienced by Gypsies and Travellers in accommodation provision is evidenced in DCLG planning application data where Gypsies and Travellers are less likely to be granted planning permission:  
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]
[normal] We note that the UN Special 
[normal]Rapporteur
[normal] on Housing, following her recent visit to the UK, stated:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]In closing, let me also mention that during my visit I have also received multiple testimonies on the shortage of sufficient, adequate and safe sites for Gypsy and Traveller communities across the United Kingdom, many of whom feel this is part of the stigma and discrimination they regularly face from Governments and society as a whole.  
[normal]Despite multiple efforts and policies put in place to address this situation, it is fair to say that leaving local authorities to make their own decision with no accountability and national process to reconcile the Gypsy and Traveller settled communities remains a source of concern.[bold] 
[normal][
[normal]our
[normal] emphasis].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is a clear failure in terms of legislation and policy towards Gypsies and Travellers in England to ensure that the accommodation needs assessment are then progressed to ensure that sites are provided.  The Government’s current planning policy, 
[normal]Planning policy for traveller sites
[normal], states that every local authority should already have in place a five year deliverable supply of sites.  However, virtually no local authorities have such a policy in place within their Local Plan.  In light of this it is clear that not only should there be proper local housing strategies but 
[normal]there should be Government involvement to ensure that sites are provided, otherwise history has shown over many years that local authorities will fail to provide the necessary sites.  Indeed it is clear that what is needed is a duty to provide or facilitate the provision of sites. It was the existence of that duty (contained within the Caravan Sites Act 1968) between 1970 and 1994 that brought about the existence of virtually all the local authority Gypsy and Traveller sites that currently exist.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In these circumstances, we strongly oppose Clause 21 and would ask that it be withdrawn.
