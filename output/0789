Written evidence from Baxter Healthcare (LTC 41)defaultBaxter Healthcare welcomes the opportunity to respond to The Health Committee’s 
defaultexamin
defaultation of
default the way in which the NHS and social care system in England supports people with long-term conditions
default.
defaultBaxter is a worldwide, 
defaultd
defaultiversified 
defaulth
defaultealthcare 
defaultc
defaultompany that is known for applying innovative science and technology to develop 
defaultspecialty
default therapeutics, medical products and services that save and sustain patients’ lives.
default 
defaultOur core purpose is to improve the quality of life of patients with rare and chronic diseases. From hospital to home, we strive to deliver better and more affordable healthcare for people worldwide. 
defaultThe committee has asked following questions and our responses are below.
defaultThe scope for varying the current mix of service responsibilities so that more people are treated outside hospital and the consequences of such service re-design for costs and effectivenessdefaultThere is huge scope for 
defaultenabling more
default people with
default long term conditions 
defaultto be treated 
defaultoutside of the hospital environment.
default 
defaultDespite a wealth of evidence to support both clinical and cost effectivene
defaultss of home based therapies, 
defaultuptake
default for many diseases
default is poor 
defaultand is in fact declining in certain
default parts of the UK.
default 
defaultIn particular, the use of Peritoneal Dialysis
default (PD)
default 
defaultand home Haemodialysis 
defaultfor the treatment of 
defaultchronic kidney fa
defaultilure is at an all time low, despite a plethora of guidelines, evidence and quality standards supporting its use
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition to the treatment of chronic kidney failure, there are many other conditions that lend themselves to home or self-care treatment.
default 
defaultThese include 
defaultparentral
default nutrition for patients who have intestinal failure, outpatient 
defaultparenteral
default anti-microbial therapy (OPAT) and immunoglobulin therapies (IG) for people suffering from immunological disorders.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne of the reasons for the decline in the uptake of home dialysis is thought to be the overestimation of the need to increase in-centre haemodialysis capacity
default which has resulted in a proliferation of centre based dialysis facilities throughout the UK.
default 
defaultOnce a centre has been commissioned, it is incumbent upon clinicians and managers to keep the facility working at capacity to ensure cost effectiveness.
default 
defaultHowever, decommissioning of such services and re-allocating staff to support home dialysis patients would greatly improve the ability for more people to be treated at home.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs well as the many quality of life benefits
default and improved outcomes
default that patients report by being on a home 
defaultbased treatment it
default also generates cost savings
default.
default 
defaultWith the current focus by the NHS on
default QIPP
default, to improve patient outcomes and generate cost savings these forms of treatment need to be fast tracked and implemented on a more substantial scale so that the full benefits can be realised by patients and the NHS alike.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother strategy that 
defaultwill
default aid the uptake of self care or home treatments is patient education, trai
defaultning and empowerment.
default 
defaultRaising awareness of the availability and success of home based therapies amongst patients and the public can promote their use. This requires the commitment of all those involved in the design and delivery of services
default, including the physicians and nurses who discuss treatment options with their patients
default. High quality
default 
defaulttraining and education of patients and their families before comme
defaultncing and during their time on
default home based treatments will also
default improve patients’ adherence to treatment regimes
default and thus promote clinical and cost effectiveness of treatments.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe readiness of local NHS and social care services to treat patients with long-term conditions (including multiple conditions) within the communitydefaultUptake of home or community based treatments varies considerably across the UK.
default 
defaultOur experience shows that in areas where there is a belief and culture in home therapies from b
defaultoth clinicians
default and 
defaultcommissioners, uptake is higher.
default 
defaultIn areas where there is a lower level of belief, barriers from social care services tend to become more difficult to overcome.
defaultThe IT infrastructure that can support the treatment of patients in the community is still weak.
default 
defaultAnecdotally, there is resistance to the uptake of remote monitoring systems due to potential liability issues on the part of the clinician.
default 
defaultIf the
default appropriate IT capabilities 
defaultwere available 
defaultto enable clinicians to have remote oversight of the patients’ clinical condition
default,
default 
defaultreassurance (that the patient can be managed as well outside the acute setting as within hospital) could be 
defaultprovide
defaultd
default to all parties.
defaultThe practical assistance offered to commissioners to support the design of services which promote community-based care and provide for the integration of health and social care in the management of long-term conditionsdefaultTo our knowledge there is very little available 
defaultfor 
defaultcommissioners to promote 
defaultor support the design of services for 
defaulthome based therapie
defaults or to further integrate health and social care services.
default 
defaultWe believe that should such support be made available,
default the uptak
defaulte of home treatments for long term conditi
defaultons could see an increase.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe recent changes to the NHS
default in England
default, and in 
defaultparticular the commissioning of specialist services, has led to a relatively small number of commissioners being given responsibility for a much wider scope of specialist services.
default 
defaultTheir task of being fully informed on all available treatment
default options 
defaultfor the full range of diseases within their remit is therefore made even more erroneous. 
defaultMany of these rare diseases f
defaultrequently co-
defaultexist with a range of other long term conditions and patients would benefit enormously from self care and home care
default being offered.
default 
defaultThe recent production of specialist commissioning service specifications should help with this, however the quality of these is variable and work needs to be done to ensure that they are consistent in approach.
defaultThe development of 
defaultCQuINS
default should also help commissions to drive innovation and develop services for patients at home.
default 
defaultHowever uptake of specific home therapy based 
defaultCQuINs
default varies and is not yet mandatory.
default 
defaultIt is essential that commissioners become fully engaged with Health and Wellbeing Boards to ensure a full understanding of the social care barriers that need to be addressed.
defaultThe ability of NHS and social care providers to treat multi-morbidities and the patient as a person rather than focusing on individual conditionsdefaultBaxter is not in a position to comment on this question however we would encourage the development of a simple mechanism for regular feedback from patients groups, individual patients and others to monitor this closely.
defaultObesity as a contributory factor to conditions including diabetes, heart failure and coronary heart disease and how it might be addresseddefaultBaxter is not in a position to comment on this question.
defaultCurrent examples of effective integration of services across health, social care and other services which treat and manage long-term conditionsdefaultBaxter has a number of examples of good practice with effective integration of services to treat and manage long-term conditions.
default 
defaultThe concept of shared fields of practice, of which home dialysis is one 
defaultexample, requires collaboration and equity among health care professionals to ensure that the impact of change is for the benefit of the patient. 
defaultAutomated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) is a home-based therapy usually carried out by patients themselves.
default 
defaultTraining takes place in a renal unit or specialist training centre in all aspects of care.
default 
defaultThe parent unit regularly follows up patients either in clinic or in the community.
default 
defaultHowever, many patients with end-stage renal disease are unable to undertake peritoneal dialysis (PD) on their own, yet would prefer treatment in their own homes.
default 
defaultIn particular, the majority of elderly patients are on the hospital based treatment, haemodialysis (HD) despite the problems and costs of transport, achieving vascular access and, often, poor tolerance of the HD process. 
defaultTo address this problem, assisted PD using community 
defaultHealthcare Assistants h
defaultas been developed.
default 
defaultHealthcare assistants visit the patient’s home once a day to check the previous day’s treatment, check the patient’s wellbeing and set up the dialysis for the next treatment.
default 
defaultThe healthcare assistant is trained to observe for a range of sign and symptoms and to call the patient’s parent renal unit should they have concerns.
defaultThis system has been operating in the UK for almost six years and seen great success.
default 
defaultOver 250 patients are currently using the service which represents almost 10% of the PD population, all of whom would not be able to have a home based treatment if the service was not available.
default 
defaultThe system required collaboration and team work between the NHS renal unit, the home care provider and the nursing support organisation to enable seamless high quality care.
defaultThe implications of an ageing population for the prevalence and type of long term conditions, together with evidence about the extent to which existing services will have the capacity to meet future demanddefaultThe implications of an ever increasing elderly population will inevitably impact on the prevalence and type of long term conditions experienced.
default 
defaultIn many long term disease areas, as treatments improve, patients live for longer and thus are susceptible to a greater number of co-morbidities.
default 
defaultFor example people with the bleeding di
defaultsorder haemophilia, would
default have an average survival of
default 15 years if born in 1960, whereas today they have a normal life expectancy as techniques such as prophylaxis are now used to better manage their condition.
default 
defaultIn addition, treatments for long term diseases are now offered to older patients than previously.
default 
defaultThus, more patients are being treated for more diseases with more treatments than before.
defaultCapacity planning
default therefore
default needs to be much more holistic
default than in the past
default, and 
defaultconsider all available locations for care.
default 
defaultI
defaultntegrat
defaultion between primary, secondary, community and social care needs to be factored into capacity planning and the use of ho
defaultme care
default considered for a greater proportion of patients
default.
default 
defaultRemote
default monitoring systems 
defaultand electronic health records should be
default considered as 
defaultintegral to the support of patients and these must be accessible to patients as well as clinicians in both primary and secondary care
default.
defaultCurrently there are many 
defaultperverse 
defaultfinancial 
defaultincentives
default that exist
default,
default 
defaultpreventing the uptake of home treatments.
default 
defaultFrequently 
defaultthe acute hospital
default is financially penalised for moving care out of the hospital setting, despite home treatments being clinically effective and more cost effective and than in-centre alternatives. One example of this is the use of outpatient anti-microbial therapy (OPAT) for the treatment of 
defaultmulti-resistant TB.
defaultThe interaction between mental health conditions and long-term physical health conditionsdefaultBaxter is not in a position to comment on this question.
defaultThe extent to which patients are being offered personalised services (including evidence of their contribution to better outcomes)defaultBaxter is not in a position to comment on this question however we would encourage the development of a simple mechanism for regular feedback from patients groups, individual patients 
defaultand others to monitor this closely.
default 
defaultThe regular use of patient reported outcome and experience measures should become routine practice.
