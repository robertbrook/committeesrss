"Written evidence from Claire Morgan (CYS 107)&#xa0;\nI would like to submit the following comments as part of the cycling safety consultation. \n&#xa0;\n1. General information &amp; context&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI \nam a \n“utility cyclist” living in the rural village community of \nOvingdean\n \non the eastern outskirts of Brighton in East Sussex. The village is bounded on all sides by main roads including the A259 trunk coastal road to the south.\n \n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\nlthough I am a Brighton &amp;\n Hove City Council officer, I am writing in a personal \ncapacity f\nrom the perspective of \na resident of a city which is apparently the UK’s least car-dependent outside London. Yet, a\ns someone who has placed concern and action for the environment at the core \nof my lifestyle since the early eighties, I have become increasingly concerned about (a) the relentless \nlocal \nmarch of a “car culture” and (b) the resulting, highly damaging in every respect, “them and us ‘war’ ” which has developed between regular drivers\n and cyclists. \n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nW\ne must do everything we can to encourage \nmore \npeople to cycle\n, more often – the \nreasons for, and benefits of, \nthis are well documented.  As a society, we urgently need to pursue a variety of enhanced and new measures, targeted at ALL road \nusers,\n \nthat\n will support and enable safe and responsible cycling\n. But with th\nis encouragement must come a \ncorresponding \nunderstanding \nthat cyclists cannot \nuse their relative superiority in terms of \nthe \nspeed and strength of their mode of transport\n compared to pedestrians to intimidate and thus \ndeter \nmore vulnerable \nnon-car-borne \nroad/street users.\n This is something I have been dismayed to observe increasingly\n in the city of Brighton and \nHove, and I can only ascribe it to the attitudes mentioned in \n1.2 above.\n&#xa0;\n2. Roads, highway layout, road speeds and maintenance&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;\n \nDespite\n the widespread existence of dedicated cycle lanes in \nmore \nbike-friendly countries such as \nHolland, Belgium, \nDenmark\n and Germany\n, I d\no NOT \nbelieve that \nsimply b\nlanketing this\n \ncountry \nwith \nsegregated \ncy\ncle lanes is \nthe answer to \nimprov\ning cycle safety. Indeed, the above-listed \ncountries would \nnot claim it is: their situations ar\ne the result of an average of 25 years+ \nof positive, innovative cycle-promoting action. \n \nAs always, \nas\n intimated above, a \nrange of long-term measures, linked to comprehensive education programmes for all road users, and in some cases improved and extended legislation, is the best solution.\n C\norralling cyclists into special lanes militates against \nnormalising cycling as a transport mode and nurtures too many motorists’ belief that cyclists should not be on “their” road when and if there is no alternative route, or a cyclist chooses not to use a provided path.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;\n \nSegregated\n \ncycle lanes \nare \nin my v\niew \nmore appropriate for “high-volume” urban areas, \nor \nfor linking these areas along key arterial or “desire \nroutes\n” where there is significant potential for harm to cyclists.\n However, \ncycle paths MUST be continuous, sensibly joined up, or safety is again compromised as cyclists are \nrepeatedly and/or unexpectedly \n“turfed out” onto the highway. \nCycle lanes \nshould also be \nmaintained on the same maintenance/repair schedule as the highway, including cutting back vegetation.\n \nThis can include\n requiring private homeowners to prune back vegetation emanating from their premises. \nOutside urban areas, where there may nevertheless be roads carrying fast traffic (such as in my local area), where pavements exist these should wherever possible \nbe re-designated and signed as shared-use. This will improve cyclists’ (and \ndrivers’ )\n safety, as well as encouraging more cyclists.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 \nColouring all cycle lanes, whether kerb-lined or not, in a different colour to give clarity to cyclists and other road users including pedestrians (\ncf\n blue cycle lanes in London).\n This also raises awareness of cycling\n &amp; cyclists\n in general …\nPage 2&#xa0;\n2.4. Re-designating an increased number of one-way smaller urban/city centre routes as able to be used as \ntwo-way for cyclists. It is my observation in Brighton and Hove that cyclists, like water, will always prefer the shortest and quickest route, and wil\nl often be prepared to break the law on one-way streets to achieve this, thus compromising other road users’ and their own safety. A similar increase in the number of routes where all traffic except cyclists may turn right, left or go straight ahead would \nbe helpful \nfor the same reason.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n \nBrighton &amp; Hove has introduced an extensive programme of \n20mph zones, including many around schools\n. While not necessarily popular with \ndrivers, it has been widely welcomed by cyclists and other road users as supporting\n road safety in general, not simply for cyclists. \nIt should be noted that these zones are, in the main, not supported/’enforced’ by road humps, which could impede the comfortable passage of cyclists, buses and emergency vehicles.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n \nRoad repair and maintenance generally should be carried out in a manner which does not leave a \n“gutter gap” where asphalt ceases before the kerb or verge: this creates a hazard for cyclists (and moped/motorbike users) when and if they are pushed towards the side of the ro\nad by traffic, or out of nervousness. Such improved road surfacing would also benefit pedestrians.\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n \nPolice and traffic wardens must be encouraged to clamp down on parking across cycle lanes, and the few cases where parking across cycle lanes is permitt\ned should be abolished. \n&#xa0;\n3. Helmets and cycle equipment&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;\n \nI\n am NOT a supporter of compulsory bike helmet wearing, and in fact believe that legislating to make adult cycl\nists do so is counter-productive, as it militates against the ease and simplicity \nof just getting on a bike and riding away\n. D\nata about the benefit\ns\n or otherwise to individual cyclists’ safety from wearing helmets is polarised – at least for adults.  There is evidence showing that drivers see helmet-wearing cyclists as less vulnerable, and \nthey \nthus drive less carefully: there is also evidence indicat\ning that cyclists themselves cycle less carefully if they are wearing a helmet, for similar reasons. \nFurther information, however, indicates that \nhelmet wearing for children \nis\n \nbeneficial due to the different way in which children tend to fall from their b\nikes, compared to adults, \nie\n children tend to sustain more head injuries when they fall from a bike than adults, although of course collisions with motorised transport are identically dangerous for all age groups.\n Improving road maintenance (see [2] above)\n would help reduce the need anyway!\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nAll new bikes sold should be required to have an \nenhanced level of reflective items on board\n – something as simple as a range of stickers would be helpful.\n&#xa0;\n4.              Training&#xa0;4.1\n              \nThe nationwide children’s \n“cycle proficiency” scheme is not compulsory, but it should be made so, and centrally funded – to include secondary-aged children.\n4.2\n              \nSome \nbus and PSV drivers already undergo cycle/cyclist awareness training – this should be made compulsory, with a requirement t\nhat it is refreshed on a regular basis. Brighton &amp; Hove City Council runs a programme whereby cyclists are invited to sit in a bus driver’s cab, to identify the blind spots. I would like to see this programme extended for cyclists.\nPage 3&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5. Public information and awareness-raising&#xa0;\nThe big success of making drinking and driving \nsocially \nunacceptable came through public information campaigns\n over a sustained period of time\n, as did other successful campaigns like smoking\n cessation\n. \nThe scope for \nhelping the safety of cycling through such public information campaigns is immense. \nCampaigns don’t need to be as graphic as some countries (\neg\n Australia) have chosen to do, but a campaign could take forms such as the following:\n&#xa0;\n6. Legislation&#xa0;6.1\n              \nThe \nHighway Code needs to be updated, so \nit is less focused on motorised vehicles, and more inclusive of the safety-enhancing needs of other road users including cyclists. This could include stating a \nminimum space between vehicles and bikes, both while passing and before and after overtaking. \n6\n.2\n              \nConsideration of introducing a \n“presumption of guilt” law, such as operates in other continental European countries, whereby in\n the event of a collision between a cyclists and a motorised vehicle, the driver of the latter is automatically assumed to be \nat fault, unless it can be proved otherwise. This legislative approach appears to cement an attitude of greater respect for cyclists’ safety and well-being from drivers.\n6.3\n              \nEnshrining in law a requirement for \nbicycles to be kept in a roadworthy state.\n&#xa0;\n7.              Cyclists are not necessarily a special case …&#xa0;\nThe need to encourage cycling does not mean \nignoring others’ rights to fairness and respect. \nAny message \n–\n through\n \npublic information films or general government guidance \n–\n should\n \nbe that with rights come \nresponsibilities, and c\nyclists should be held accountable for their own \ninap\npropriate cycling in the same way as motorists should be.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n"
