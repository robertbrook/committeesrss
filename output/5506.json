Neil Carmichael; Alex Cunningham; Bill \nEsterson\n; Pat Glass; Siobhain \nMcDonagh\n; Ian Mearns; Mr Dominic \nRaab\n; \nMr David Ward\n; \nCraig Whittaker\n \nQuestions \n1-113\nWitness\nes\n:\n \nSir Michael Wilshaw, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills, and \nDebbie Jones, Director of Social Care and Regional Director for \nLondon\n, \nOfsted\n, gave evidence.\nQ1 &#xa0; \nChair: Good morning and welcome to this session of the Education Committee, looking at \nOfsted’s\n annual report on social care.  This is the first report that has separated social care from education, and of course it comes after a\nn\n hiatus; there was not a social care report at all last year.  Could you briefly just tell us why that was?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: The social care report was included in the main annual report last year.  When I appeared in front of you, I would have answered questions on social care.  \n&#xa0;\nQ2 &#xa0; \nChair: Okay.  I will not overly examine that.  Sir Michael, you have highlighted issues \nabout \nBirmingham\n, our second-largest city.  You talked about a number of statistics, not just its performance on looking after children, but the number of neighbourhoods that have declined dramatically over the last 10 years and the levels of statutory homelessness and long-term unemployment.  You said that these statistics are “shocking” and “a national disgrace”.  You then went on to say that, “As somebody once said about banks, ‘if they are too big to fail, they are too big’.  The same could be said for our second city.”  Could you expand on that?  Do you know if the Government has any intention to intervene in the radical way that you suggest?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: I have been clear, and I was clear in the speech I made on social care that talked about \nBirmingham\n, that the Government should intervene.  You touched upon the statistics of the things that are going wrong in \nBirmingham\n.  We have to remind ourselves this is our second city.  It is the largest unitary authority in \nEurope\n.  It has responsibility for more children than any other part of this country.  There have been seven failed inspection judgments; eight \nwhistleblowing\n incidents in four years; nine years of inadequate serious case reviews; and 10 years of failure for vulnerable children.  You mentioned the very high mortality rate and the number of neighbourhoods that have declined in relation to similar sorts of cities.  I felt it was incumbent on me as Chief Inspector to highlight what was going \nwrong in \nBirmingham\n and say that something radical has to happen.  This has gone on for far too long.  I am pleased to see that the council has injected a substantial amount of money—£20\n&#xa0;\nmillion—into social care in the last few weeks, which we hope will make the difference.  We will be inspecting social care again in the next few months.\n&#xa0;\nQ3 &#xa0; \nChair: Clearly, in your speech, you did not think that the correct prescription was simply throwing more money at it; you thought there was something more fundamentally wrong and it needed more radical surgery.  Do you stick to that view?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: I still do.  Corporate governance needs to be addressed.  \nLondon\n is doing it significantly better.  Corporate governance was addressed in \nLondon\n years ago by the GLC.  The old Inner London Education Authority was split up.  \nLondon\n now—educationally certainly, and also in terms of social care—is doing significantly better.  I do not know Birmingham as well as I am sure many of you do, but everyone I talk to about Birmingham, including, I have to say, Birmingham MPs, would agree with much of what I have said and would also say that it is an issue of corporate governance.\n&#xa0;\nQ4 &#xa0; \nChair: Have you spoken to Ministers?  Have we had any Government response to the suggestion that \nBirmingham\n should be split up?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: I spoke to the Secretary of State; he knew exactly what I was going to say before I said it.  The ball is very much in his court and, I am sure, in the court of the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.  \n&#xa0;\nQ5 &#xa0; \nChair: If you were giving one of your \ngradings\n to the nation’s children’s social care overall, what grading would you award?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Overall in the country?  I would say “requires improvement”; grade three.\n&#xa0;\nQ6 &#xa0; \nChair: And how would you describe its trajectory at the moment?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Unless particular issues are sorted out, I would say it is going to remain on grade three.  \n&#xa0;\nQ7 &#xa0; \nChair: So it is coasting at an unacceptable level.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: It is coasting at an unacceptable level, and unless leadership improves, unless turnover decreases in terms of leadership of directors of children’s services, unless the safeguarding boards’ roles and responsibilities are properly defined, and unless the issues of recruitment of social workers in parts of the world \nsuch as \nBirmingham are addressed, the situation will continue as it is.  \n&#xa0;\nQ8 &#xa0; \nChair: If you were external to your own organisation and you were grading it in social care, given that historically you have been more of a schools and education regulator than a social care regulator, what grading would you give it?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: I am tempted to say grade one: “outstanding”.  \n&#xa0;\nQ9 &#xa0; \nAlex Cunningham: Despite the lack of social care credentials in the overall team.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: If I can tell you what we have done, certainly in my time in office, we have increased the number of senior HMI by nearly 50%; we have appointed an outstanding Director of Children’s Services to lead those HMI; we have increased the number of HMI; we have regionalised them into our eight \nOfsted\n regions; we have appointed more regulatory inspectors and done something about the performance management of a significant number of weak regulatory inspectors—\n&#xa0;\nQ10 &#xa0; \nChair: Sorry to interrupt.  Can you quantify that?  Have you identified the number, or percentage, who were weak?  \nSir Michael Wilshaw: We have identified about a third of regulatory inspectors that we did not think were good enough, and we are doing something about that.  As I say, we have created a middle tier of managing inspectors in the regulatory workforce to ensure that there is good training and that performance management is robustly done and that they do a good job in the institutions that they inspect, particularly children’s homes.\n&#xa0;\nQ11 &#xa0; \nChair: Is that work in progress?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: It is a work in progress.\n&#xa0;\nQ12 &#xa0; \nChair: As Chairman of this Committee, I would have to say I would give you at best a “good”, and you would have to persuade me you had some outstanding features.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: I was going to say to you I would like to say “outstanding”, but it was probably “good”, with some outstanding features.  \nChair: Excellent.  Thank you very much for that. \nBill Esterson: I am reminded of my granddad’s comment that self\n&#x2011;\npraise\n is no praise at all.  \nSir Michael Wilshaw: I hope you detected a certain tongue in cheek.  \n&#xa0;\nQ13 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: Yes, we gathered that.  On this point about you coming from an education background, the point is often made about the description of education for the Department but also for local authorities and the concern that having education and children’s services in one department in local authorities can lead to problems.  This is something I have heard around the country.  Do you think that there is an argument for splitting these things, or do you think they are better within one area?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: I can understand why they were put together after the Victoria \nClimbié\n case.  Good local authorities—and I am sure my colleague would endorse this—manage it extremely well and appoint good people to run their schools and education services.  What we have noticed in the weaker authorities, in particular ones that we fail for children’s services, is that, apart from poor leadership, poor management and poor oversight, they are not coping with the number of responsibilities that they have under them.  They are not coping with children’s services and adult social care, and they are not coping very well with education and libraries and other responsibilities that might have been given to them.  It is really the responsibility of the chief executive and the leader of the council to do something \nabout that.  We have examples of good local authorities where they are managing it very well and others where they are not.  \nDebbie Jones: Can I make a point here?  It is really important not to confuse capacity issues with the issue of putting schools and social care together or, for that matter, anything else.  What we have seen in \nOfsted\n—and certainly what I saw as a director of children’s services—is if you put the capacity and the expertise in the right place at a leadership level and, indeed, further down the organisation, the benefits of that join-up and integrated working are considerable.  Indeed, you asked earlier about the previous profile in relation to social care within \nOfsted\n.  In addition to my national responsibilities as National Director for Social Care, I am also the Regional Director for \nLondon\n, and I have already seen the benefits of join\n&#x2011;\nup\n between the schools HMI and the social care HMI, since that is what makes sense to Joe Public out there. \n&#xa0;\nQ14 &#xa0; \nIan Mearns: This question of resources is quite simple to put to one side, but I was recently speaking to the treasurer of a large local authority in the \nn\north\n-e\nast of \nEngland\n, who showed me a picture of what CLG were anticipating the cuts to be.  I think they were looking at cuts of about £5.5\n&#xa0;\nbillion over the space of a number of years.  If you put children’s services and adult social care to one side—and of course the education budget otherwise, in terms of schools, is ring-fenced and outside of that—and then put everything else into another block, everything else would have to go in order to cut that £5.5\n&#xa0;\nbillion over a number of years.  Nothing would be left in terms of libraries, leisure, highways—nothing.  \nPat Glass: Refuse collection.\nIan Mearns: Refuse collection.  Nothing would be left.  In other words, it is very difficult for a chief executive or a leader of a council to say, “Look, we are going to do away with everything else and just do adult social care and children’s care”.  We are, quite rightly, expecting local authorities to do more with less, but if they are trying to do much, much more because of rising demand with quite a bit less in the case of some local authorities, my question is: do \nOfsted\n inspectors really take into account those massive resource changes over a short space of time when they are coming to their findings in inspecting local authorities?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: If you are saying, “Is this a system under pressure?” it is absolutely a system under pressure.  We have 1\n&#xa0;\nmillion or so children \nwho\n are living in very difficult families where there is alcohol addiction, history of domestic violence, drug addiction, mental health problems, and so on.  That is a huge number.  Social services and children’s services have got to deal with that, and money is inevitably going to be an issue.  I am not going to sit here and say it is not.  All I would say is that we see good local authorities that are struggling with it doing exceptionally well, because the management and the leadership is good and they have very clear policies on a range of issues and clear benchmarks on intervention, for example.  Where we see weak local authorities, we see weak leadership and a lack of clarity on all those issues that make for good children’s services.\n&#xa0;\nQ15 &#xa0; \nChair: How much correlation is there between the expenditure and outcomes for children?\nDebbie Jones: It is very difficult to establish a clear correlation.  To be quite honest with you, I do not know.  As you know, we have started our new single inspection framework, and inevitably, through watching and looking at the journey of the child, we are unlikely to see the \ninfluence of budget cuts, but we will see the impact of investment at different stages of that child’s journey.  That will potentially provide us with a clear picture.  What we do know is that the absence of money is, by definition, not necessarily an indicator of whether an authority is going to do well or badly.  Clearly, when there have been poor inspection outcomes, as Sir Michael has just said in relation to \nBirmingham\n, there is an issue of investment.  I would expect—I speak as a former director of children’s services—to be very clear with the corporate centre and, indeed, with politicians, as to what is the impact.  But the reality is that there are considerably fewer resources and it is a question of choice, and that choice is vested ultimately in the corporate entity and the political leadership.  It is not for us in \nOfsted\n to make any judgment on that, but we will make judgment in relation to capacity and in relation to perhaps where there are gaps, and inappropriate gaps.  \n&#xa0;\nQ16 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: Sir Michael, you have mentioned now twice the importance of the quality of leadership from both the chief executive and the leader of a local authority.  Who decides, in your view, when that is good quality and not?  If there is agreement about a lack of quality of leadership, what is the answer?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: A third of the directors of children’s services have left within the last year.  That is a very high number.  There are too many temporary posts.  I make an assumption that the effectiveness of leadership is monitored by the safeguarding boards in each local authority, and you probably know that we have been critical of a number of safeguarding boards.  We have started to inspect them, and we have called upon the Government to clarify their roles and responsibilities, particularly in holding the leadership to account.  It is no good \nOfsted\n coming in and heavily criticising the leadership—both the top leadership and also the middle layers of leadership in children’s services—if the safeguarding board and those responsible for holding it to account do not know that already.  \n&#xa0;\nQ17 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: You think inspection of safeguarding boards is going to make a difference.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: We have just started our single inspection framework, and part of that framework is to inspect the work of safeguarding boards.  We will be in a better position in a few months’ time, when we have got more inspections under our belt, to make a judgment as to how good they are and what needs to be done, but certainly I and Debbie have raised the issue with Government that they have got to clarify what their roles and responsibilities are, particularly as we are moving to multi-agency inspection in a year’s time.\n&#xa0;\nQ18 &#xa0; \nMr Ward: Can I just ask what analysis has been done on exit interviews with those who have left, at a senior level but also among social workers, who are in post on average for eight years?  That is a vast loss of experience and, indeed, training and development.  Have we analysed why?\nDebbie Jones: We have just started, as Sir Michael has said, with the new inspection framework.  The questions in relation to length of time and reasons why directors leave are probably issues that should be addressed to the Association of Directors of Children’s Services and, indeed, to chief executives themselves through SOLACE and the LGA.  What we have been very clear about in relation to the senior leadership is that the link between inspection outcome and a change in leadership is not one that we would make.  We recognise that organisational instability is a bad thing, and that good leaders, wherever they are, should \nbe promoted, nurtured and supported, because the leadership in this arena is a very tough one.  That applies further down the system as well, if you look at social workers and the length of stay of social workers.  Social work is an incredibly tough job; there is no question about it.  What we found in our last inspection round and, indeed, we are finding in this one is that where you have got social workers who are supported, nurtured and given realistic caseloads and workloads, those are the issues that count the most.  I could not say whether the average tenure of a social worker has got worse or better, but what I would say is that it is important to look at why social workers stay as well as why they go.  That is something that we will be picking up through our inspection experience.\n&#xa0;\nQ19 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: Your report shows the increase in the volume of social care work over the last five years on core assessments and child protection plans, for example.  You say in the report, “There are no simple means to establish whether increases or decreases”, in social care work, “represent an improving picture”.  Do you think that the fact that the level of this work has gone up is due to better practices, or is it more to do with the financial climate and the impact that has on children and families?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: There are a range of factors.  The most important one is that the national consciousness of what can go badly wrong in terms of children’s services is much greater than it has ever been, because of the high-profile deaths that have taken place over the last few years.  As a consequence of those tragedies, the volume of cases under scrutiny has gone up and the pressure on children’s services has gone up, and our inspection frameworks are that much more rigorous as a result of those issues.  I come back to this central issue: that it is a system under enormous pressure, not just from \nOfsted\n but because of a national concern about the way we treat our most vulnerable children.\n&#xa0;\nQ20 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: You mentioned the high-profile cases.  Are they a fair reflection of the state of the nation’s child\n \nprotection system?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: There are always going to be the cases that grab the headlines and the publicity, and we have all got to worry about what happens to children who are badly injured and die, and we have to look at mortality rates in relation to those in the rest of the world and draw our own conclusions.  But the major concern must be how well our children’s services are doing for all the children, not just those who are in the worst possible predicaments.\n&#xa0;\nQ21 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: What conclusions do you draw when making those international comparisons?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: That we should, very clearly, worry about mortality rates in relation to what is happening in the rest of the world, but we have also got to worry about the parlous state of children’s services throughout the country, and worry about those children who do not die and do not hit the headlines but are going through miserable lives because they are not being properly supported.\nDebbie Jones: If I may add to what Sir Michael has said there, we are very clear that international comparisons and, indeed, child-death figures only tell one side of the story.  We have been very clear about that overall.  Whilst there is a huge amount of learning to be got from serious case reviews, what we are interested in equally is the experience of children before they get to that point.  You are quite right when you say there has been an increase in children that are on child protection plans; in fact, there has been a considerable increase.  \nCertainly since the death of Peter Connelly, we have seen several spikes, both in the numbers of children on child protection plans and, indeed, in the numbers of children who are looked after.  It is assessing the quality of that experience that is telling us a lot.  Within \nOfsted\n, we get notifications of serious incidents—i.e. those incidents that would hit the benchmark, potentially, for a serious case review—and we look at those statistics.  We will be publishing information about those statistics in the springtime.  \n&#xa0;\nQ22 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: Do you think that the attention paid to high\n&#x2011;\nprofile\n cases is helpful or not?\nDebbie Jones: I would say that inevitably, when a child dies in difficult circumstances, there is interest from the public and from the media.  \nIt is important that w\ne are clear that you do not just get the learning from the high-profile cases; you get the learning from the other in\n&#x2011;\ndepth inspections certainly that we do and work that is done through other sources.  It is only one element of learning.  Sir Michael has been very clear in terms of the statements he has made with reference to organisational instability and some of the response that\n \nthat can at times be unhelpful.  We are very clear; we look beyond that.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: It is a learning process for us as well.  One of the consequences of the Baby P case was that there was some criticism of \nOfsted\n and the way we inspected, and that we were too process-driven and too interested in ticking boxes and form-filling.  As a result of that, our inspection process has changed.  We believe it is much improved and we look in a much more focused way at what is happening on the ground.\n&#xa0;\nQ23 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: In your Church House speech, you pointed to society’s role and, more specifically, the importance of parents’ attitudes towards taking responsibility “for seeing their children raised well”.  Are the greatest challenges to child protection today societal or within the child\n \nprotection system itself?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: It would have been negligent of me if I had not mentioned those societal issues.  The figures are there for everyone to see of 1\n&#xa0;\nmillion children \nwho\n are in these difficult circumstances.  The question was asked a moment ago about the linkage between education and social care.  As an ex-head\n \nteacher, I saw the result of children being brought up badly by their parents.  Society has got to worry about what is happening in families, and in families in particular parts of the country.  Children’s services have got a part to play in helping and supporting those families, but families and communities have got a huge part to play in supporting children.  You know the old phrase, “A child is brought up by the village”.  Communities have got a big part to play in supporting our most difficult families and our most vulnerable children.\n&#xa0;\nQ24 &#xa0; \nMr Raab: I welcome, Sir Michael, your candour on this issue, but, having made the diagnosis, we are policymakers, whether in Government or in Parliament.  What can Government or Parliament do to promote greater parental responsibility without risking having a countervailing negative impact on the children themselves?  Whenever you talk about carrots and sticks, you have this.  Do you have any practical things in mind on the policy side?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Messages have got to go out not just to families about the importance of raising children properly and giving them very clear boundaries, but also to children’s services, and particularly to social workers on the ground, about how they interact with those families.  What they have got to do is to do, in many ways—and I mentioned this in the \nspeech—what the troubled families initiative is doing: to send out some tough messages to families that are not looking after their children properly.\n&#xa0;\nQ25 &#xa0; \nMr Raab: What would that interaction sound like?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: It would sound like: “By the time I return next week, I want to see this”.\n&#xa0;\nQ26 &#xa0; \nMr Raab: If not, what?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: “If not, we will take action.”  These families need to know that they cannot go on treating their children like this, that they cannot go on behaving in this manner, and that they have got to hit the targets that are being set by social workers.  Where we see good practice, we see social workers, supported by experienced people, going into these families and giving out those tough messages.\n&#xa0;\nQ27 &#xa0; \nMr Raab: So a bit more stick and a bit less carrot.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Some clear messages to parents \nwho\n behave badly.  As a head teacher, I used to tell parents that they were behaving badly and that they were bad parents.  It did not often go down extremely well, but, nevertheless, that was my responsibility, and it is the responsibility of social workers to do the same.\nDebbie Jones: To supplement Sir Michael’s candour, it is probably important to remind ourselves that we were very clear, particularly when you take account of that big figure—the 1\n&#xa0;\nmillion children—that social workers by themselves cannot do the job.  That is why Sir Michael has emphasised the issue of community and why Louise Casey’s troubled families initiative is so interesting.  Within that support team, we do not just have social\n \ncare workers; we have a range of professionals with different skills.  \n&#xa0;\nQ28 &#xa0; \nChair: But they are all professionals, Debbie.  You said “the community” and “it takes the village to raise the child”.  We are not talking about professionals who work with children; we are talking about the community.  Michael in his speech said that the family and the community had, to an extent, been hollowed out.  I suppose what Dominic was trying to get at was how we start going about filling that in again, or rebuilding that, which is not just about the excellent troubled families initiative with excellent workers and multi-agency working; it is about somehow expanding beyond the professional to the community.  How on earth do we do that?\nDebbie Jones: Graham, what I would have gone on to say is—\nChair: Beautifully done.\nDebbie Jones: One of the issues that is really of significance to us, both in relation to our new inspection framework and generally in our discussions with the sector, is the investment in prevention and early help.  That is absolutely crucial.  There are a range of initiatives out there now.  I absolutely agree that it is not just for professionals, but where we have seen and where we continue to see some really innovative value-added community\n&#x2011;\nsupport\n initiatives, they are not just done by professionals, by social workers or, for that matter, by teachers; they are done very much by pulling together the energy that is within communities.  That is why we will be looking, in line with what Professor Eileen Munro said in her last report, at where \nearly help is targeted and, indeed, where those initiatives are capitalised on.  The new guidance in relation to local safeguarding children’s boards requires us also to look at where that value-added comes in and impacts on the high\n&#x2011;\nend work.  \n&#xa0;\nQ29 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: That sounds like what the Prime Minister had in mind when he talked about the “big society”.  Just talking about the role of the professionals, it has already been said that you cannot leave these things just to professionals.  Sir Michael, you have a particular style and approach that you brought as a head teacher, and there are others who do similar things.  I can see how that works, but how do you change that culture, whether in schools or elsewhere, when working with children so that others apply the approach that you have advocated?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: One of the things that is improving schools at the moment—no doubt we will talk about this in a couple of weeks’ time—is that good practice is being spread much more widely now than ever before.  Good heads are taking over more schools and disseminating good practice.  That is what we have got to see in this area.  We have got to see good directors of children’s services and good senior managers showing what can be done in the most difficult circumstances with the resources that are at their disposal.  I am not sure that is happening in the same way as it is happening in schools.\n&#xa0;\nQ30 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: Do the professionals share your view that this is the right approach?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Debbie probably will be able to answer that better, since she was President of the ADCS before she joined us.  I would not say they agree with everything that I have said, but nevertheless, I think they understand the great challenges that face them.\nDebbie Jones: Yes.  Sir Michael has always been very challenging and forthright in his engagement with the sector, and that is what I experienced as President of the ADCS, and I can assure you that is what I experience now as his National Director of Social Care.  The sector is always very clear about what he thinks, but there is a question of dialogue and engagement.  We will not always agree—we did not before and we do not now—but we will have a dialogue.  Speaking as \nOfsted\n now, the very fact that we, within \nOfsted\n, responded to the concerns that were raised by the sector in relation to the four different inspection frameworks and the work that was done back then on the multi-agency inspections—and Sir Michael responded to those concerns, hence we have the single inspection framework now and a different model going forward—for me demonstrates very clearly the question of exchange of views, exchange of concerns, and then responding to them.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Can I just come back to the issue of society and why I said what I said and will continue to say those sorts of things if necessary, and this issue of the “big society” as well?  If the social taboos are diminishing and creating this sort of vacuum in some of our communities, there will be people who can step into that vacuum.  That is an issue for policymakers.  \n&#xa0;\nQ31 &#xa0; \nChair: Can you explain that a bit more?  What social taboos are vanishing?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Dads simply walking away from their family responsibilities, for example, or parents not engaging with schools—a range of things.  Where we have that happening, there have to be policy answers to this one.  I want to mention this when we talk \nabout early years and our most disengaged parents engaging with Sure Start centres and early-years provision: in my experience, in the most difficult communities, there are always going to be good people who want to help.  How do you incentivise good citizens, good people and good family members to engage with the most difficult members of society?  That is a policy issue for Government.  How do you financially incentivise those people to get up in the morning, knock on the neighbour’s door and say, “Your children are not up yet.  They have not had their breakfast yet.  Why are you not taking them to school?”  \nMr Ward: You would get a brick through your window, I would have thought.\n&#xa0;\nQ32 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: Yes, you would certainly get a reaction and an accusation of interference, would you not?  The last question from me is about \nOfsted’s\n role.  How much of your role is as a provider of factual inspection results, and how much of it is as a commentator and, in fact, an \ninfluencer\n on the broader social issues such as those we have been discussing?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Our job is to do both.  It is to comment and provide a commentary on the present situation and where standards are in children’s services, and that is what we will do and are obliged to do every year.  But our job is also—as it is in schools—to challenge the system to do better.\n&#xa0;\nQ33 &#xa0; \nMr Ward: Going back to the \nincentivisation\n and sharing of good practice, within schools that is to be done through retaining your \nconcept of \noutstanding only by sharing.  In what ways can we incentivise people to go to \nBirmingham\n from a good area and to spread that good practice?\nDebbie Jones: Partly to respond to the earlier question, Sir Michael has been very clear that inspection is as much about improvement as anything else.  One of the themes that we have done a significant amount of work on, in conjunction with the sector, is the development of improvement.  It is not enough for us to go into an authority, say it is failing and then just walk away.  Sir Michael has been very clear that that is not what we are doing.  Developing the improvement approach is something that is new, different and challenging, but something that we are clearly investing in.  We will be appointing a Director of Improvement in the next couple of weeks, and we will be working very closely with the sector and with local government in order to ensure that the work that we are doing complements as opposed to replaces that.\n&#xa0;\nQ34 &#xa0; \nMr Ward: Do you need our help in terms of any recommendations?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: What we are doing in saying that inspection is also about improvement is quite controversial.  Some people would disagree quite vehemently with that.  I am very keen that we are seen as improvers through inspection, monitoring and dissemination of good practice.  It has made an enormous difference in schools.  We are seeing real improvements in our schools system, partly because of the judgments we make and partly because HMI are heavily involved in monitoring schools that are not doing very well, but also in disseminating good practice through workshops and seminars.  We are replicating that model in social care; from April 2014, we will be doing the same in social care as we are doing in schools.\n&#xa0;\nQ35 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: LEA inspectors used to be there to provide improvements.  It sounds like you are going back to a model that was discredited when \nOfsted\n was created.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with that, by the way.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: The question is: did they do it well?  My view is that they never did it particularly well.  We think that HMI do it a lot better.\n&#xa0;\nQ36 &#xa0; \nChair: Can I take you back to this community thing?  It is such a difficult issue.  How do you get the village involved in the bringing up of a child in a world in which you cannot stop and talk to a 10\n&#x2011;\nyear\n&#x2011;\nold child in the street without risking someone suggesting you are trying to groom them?  It is interesting that social care has the dynamic of forcing the village away from the child at the same time as highlighting the need to get greater engagement.  You mentioned financially incentivising people to get up in the morning and knock on the next door neighbour’s door and tell them to get their kids to school.  I am struggling to see that as a practical measure.  Is there anything around clubs?  The truth is as an individual you are afraid to engage with children, but the people who I see in my community doing it are the clubs.  I see the football club, the rugby club, the cricket club and the rugby league club doing it; they have the CRB checks and the organisational backing to allow them to create those quality relationships between adults and children.  Every time we look at children who are struggling in this country, it is the quality of relationships with adults that comes out again and again as the thing they are craving.  What is there around organisations and fomenting and supporting these organisations that could help lead to the community—hollowed out as you have suggested it is—coming back again and being able to play a role in these children’s lives without putting individuals in an invidious position where they feel at risk?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: We need good people to stand up and be counted and not to shy away from being good citizens and doing more.  That has been my experience.  Once you identify people who want to do more in their societies and who want to be better citizens by helping others, that becomes the standard.  Your mention of people shying away from the 10\n&#x2011;\nyear\n&#x2011;\nold child whom they see in trouble just because others might accuse them of \nx\n, \ny\n and \nz\n is a big national issue, is it not?  We need to turn that around.  \n&#xa0;\nQ37 &#xa0; \nChair: I am trying to work out how.  When I was a child, an adult could stop and kick a ball with me for 10 minutes.  That same adult would not do so now.  I am not sure wishing it to change is going to be enough.  We are going to have to find some kind of policy approach to facilitate more high-quality relationships between adults and children.  \nDebbie Jones: What you have raised is a very live and a very real tension, but it is important that we do not conflate issues of safety and risk with incentivising or capacity-building within communities.  What we see and we hope that we will see in our focus on early help is that, where communities have been incentivised and where good schemes have been shown to work, there will be good systems of risk assessments, there will be compliance with CRB processes and all of that, but, more importantly—that is part of the framework and the process—there will be the opportunity to engage creatively.  We know it happens.  We have seen it happen.  We have already mentioned the troubled families initiative, but that is only one initiative amongst many.\n&#xa0;\nQ38 &#xa0; \nChair: Does the troubled families initiative use volunteer community members at all?\nDebbie Jones: No, it does not use volunteers.  I do not know; you would have to check that with Louise.  The important thing is that it is only seen as part of the jigsaw.  To reinforce that point I have made, it is very important not to get over-excited by issues of risk and safety.  It is important that they are addressed, but they are separate to the issues of initiating and creating.\n&#xa0;\nQ39 &#xa0; \nChair: Really?  I am talking about ordinary members of the public who historically perhaps would have been more likely to intervene—see the child was miserable, build a relationship, and invite them into the shed to play with the metalwork or whatever it is.  They just would not do that now.  You just would not invite a child into your shed to play with your metalwork, for exactly the reasons you have said we should not be obsessed by.  You would not do it.  The truth is, therefore, you just do not get those relationship opportunities \nany\n \nmore\n and the child is alone and miserable, and nobody interacts with them apart from a professional.  \nDebbie Jones: The very fact, Graham, that we have good and creative schemes, whether they are run as after-school clubs or whether they are run in the communities, provides a different perspective.  It is really important that we have those safeguards in place.  Quite rightly, they are a tension, but we might as well all go home and give up if that is the reason why we are not doing more in the early-help space.  That is very definitely an area that we will be looking at.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: At the end of the day, you cannot get away from this issue of the family.  The family, whether it is a nuclear or extended family, are the great educators.  That is my view.  If those family structures are going to continue to be weakened, particularly in our poorest communities, we are going to continue to have these sorts of problems.  It is strengthening the family, strengthening the community, and doing all sorts of other things to help those families.  If you have got very big, impersonal schools in the toughest areas, that does not help.  If you do not recruit the best head teachers and teachers to these sorts of communities, you are going to have problems.  If you have a proliferation of games arcades and all sorts of temptations that get in the way of good parenting and good families, and if you build huge, impersonal, rather dull estates, those are planning issues.  It is a societal issue, this one, but we are going to continue to have problems beyond my time and your time if we do not address these societal issues.\nPat Glass: I think I might have said to you before that I am a great believer that I am my child’s first educator.  The school and the church may help me, but it is my responsibility.  I am not sure how we get that kind of responsibility and family ownership beyond the people who have got it now.  I do not see that so much when I knock on doors in parts of my constituency.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: No, I know.\n&#xa0;Q40 &#xa0; \nPat Glass: Moving on, the \nOfsted\n report talked about a large-scale programme of reform within children’s services as a result of some of these high-profile cases.  Which areas of reform do you think are falling behind, where they lack decisiveness and pace, and why do you think that is?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: In terms of \nOfsted\n, you have probably seen we have changed our frameworks quite radically.  We are following the children now from the identification of concern to intervention to care and beyond through a single inspection framework, rather \nthan four.  We listened very closely to what directors of children’s services and chief executives were saying about the pressures they were under when they faced four, or sometimes five, inspections in short order.  We have brought that all together, so we have got eight or nine inspectors now once every three years looking at the child from the beginning to the end of care and beyond.  Although we have just started, I am sure that will be a big success.  That has been a great challenge for us.  The multi-agency inspection also is going to be a challenge for us in 2015.  You have probably seen that we have deferred that, because we were not ready.  The training for not only our inspectors but the inspectors from the other agencies certainly had not gone particularly well.  We had not tested out the thresholds of accountability, either, for the police or the probation service and how that contributed to a final judgment from \nOfsted\n.  Those have been big challenges for \nOfsted\n.  In terms of reform, we want to see the service doing better, and we hope that by more challenging and better frameworks, and by the improvement work that Debbie has just talked about, we will see improvement incrementally over the years.\n&#xa0;\nQ41 &#xa0; \nPat Glass: Within children’s services generally—not just within \nOfsted\n, but out there in local authorities—which are the areas that you feel are falling behind?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Parts of the country, or parts of the service?\nPat Glass: Parts of the service.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: We are concerned about children’s homes and the connection between the placing authority and children’s homes far away from that local authority.  How much connection does the placing authority have?  Are they monitoring it effectively?  That is a key part of our single framework inspection.  We are concerned about missing children and children who run away, particularly from children’s homes, and whether that is being effectively monitored.  Is there a single register held by the local authority that accords with what the police have, for example?  We are worried about whether our children’s home inspections are good enough.  I mentioned at the beginning that we have done a lot to weed out our poorest inspectors in terms of regulatory inspectors.  We think we have got a much better workforce there, and a better managed and better paid workforce, than ever before, but they have got to have the nous to look at what is happening in some of these children’s homes, not just in terms of the compliance culture.  Are they, for example, at the end of an inspection of a children’s home, particularly in a difficult area like a seaside resort, looking to see what is happening at the end of the day?  Are they knocking on neighbours’ doors and saying, “Have you noticed anything untoward here?  Are cars turning up at the end of the day?”  We hope that our children’s home inspections are going to be a lot more robust than they have ever been, because of the concerns we have about exploitation and the other things that have received such high-profile attention.\nPat Glass: The Committee would welcome that, because we too have real concerns about some of our children’s homes.  We have been on some visits recently and we have found that they are somewhat depressing places.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: They are depressing, yes.\nChair: We will return to them again a little later.\nDebbie Jones: Can I just add to what Sir Michael said there, Pat?  In addition to the work on children’s homes, which I am sure we will return to, one of the changes that Professor Munro was keen to see, and that we have translated into the new inspection framework through following the child, is a much clearer focus on the extent to which practitioners do or do not use their professional judgment.  That is an area that we are particularly concerned about.  I speak as a former director here.  It should never be enough just to tick the box and to follow the rule.  The assessment of risk is a complicated business, it is a sensitive business, and it requires practitioners to be alert to intelligence—soft intelligence as well as hard intelligence.  Therefore, the extent to which that is reflected in the way in which young people are dealt with, from entrance to the system to exit, is one that we are concerned about and that we will be looking at very rigorously.\n&#xa0;\nQ42 &#xa0; \nPat Glass: It is not just about how professionals use their skills, but also how far they are allowed to—whether their managers are simply about ticking boxes.  I speak to a lot of social workers who tell me they are not allowed to use their skills.  \nDebbie Jones: Indeed.  And how far they are supported and how far they are trained.  These go back to the earlier questions around support for social workers and why they only stay X number of years.  It is about professional training and support, manageable workloads, and also being listened to, heard and engaged.\n&#xa0;\nQ43 &#xa0; \nPat Glass: Can I ask you about safeguarding boards?  Sir Michael, you have called for the Government to carry out a review of the function and role of safeguarding boards.  What do you think has to change?  How has Government responded to your call?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Our biggest concern is that there is confusion as to what their role is, and the Government has a responsibility to define their role.  I made the assumption—apparently it was a wrong assumption—that they are responsible for holding the \ne\nxecutive to account.  That does not seem to be something that they would accept.  In terms of holding the executive to account, what do they do to investigate what the director of children’s services and the chief executive are saying?  How do they do it?  There is a lack of clarity there.  As I said, this is going to receive sharper focus when we move to multi-agency inspection in a year’s time.  Can the chief executive or the director of children’s services, for example, do something about a failing police service?  Should the safeguarding board sack the representative from the police on that board who is not doing something about a poor police service?  We are looking to Government to clarify this issue, because in a few months’ time we will be producing a report on our first findings of our inspections of the safeguarding boards.\n&#xa0;\nQ44 &#xa0; \nChair: And Government response?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Early days.\n&#xa0;\nQ45 &#xa0; \nChair: The business end of what we do is making recommendations in our reports, and, because of then being stuck in the limbo that you are stuck in, waiting to see what the Government says, we brought in a basic rule that Departments should respond within two months to every report produced by a Select Committee so their feet are held to the fire and, however adequate or inadequate you feel it, at least you get something back.  You can then chase \nthem up; if they try to send you a letter instead of a proper substantive response, you reject it and demand a proper response.  Do we need something like that for you?  \nSir Michael Wilshaw: If they do not respond, we will certainly chase that issue up, but we are looking to your Committee also to ask the relevant questions of the Secretary of State and his officials.\n&#xa0;\nQ46 &#xa0; \nChair: I am just wondering about a trigger.  It would be hard for us to recommend.  You could have a category of recommendation from \nOfsted\n, which you would treat seriously and not put in there unless you felt it was merited, but that would then trigger an expected response from Government within a certain timeframe, which is what we have.  I just wondered whether something similar might be useful if there is a danger of things being stuck in the long grass otherwise.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: I raised this issue before December.  I raised it with the Department and with the senior officials in the Department.  They say they are going to look at it.  We are awaiting a response.\nPat Glass: My experience of safeguarding boards is not wide, but they seem to me to be almost master classes in ticking boxes and not taking responsibility.  I certainly would support what you have to say about that.\n&#xa0;\nQ47 &#xa0; \nMr Ward: You have mentioned a couple of times the multi\n&#x2011;\nagency\n inspections and identified the fragmentation of the system as being the greatest barrier to the care, help and protection of children.  First of all, could you say a bit more on why that was suspended and what progress is being made with the accountability framework that you see as being necessary?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: I felt, and all my senior officials felt, that we were not ready for it—that we had not done enough training of our own inspectors for it—and certainly it was the feeling of the senior people in the other agencies that more work needed to be done on professional development and training.  That was the first issue.  The second issue was getting it right in terms of testing out these accountabilities of each agency in providing a one-word or one-sentence judgment on the efficacy of the local authority.\n&#xa0;\nQ48 &#xa0; \nMr Ward: Do you have a feel for what good would look like?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Certainly we would want to see the safeguarding boards doing well representing the different agencies, knowing exactly what they should do and knowing what is going wrong within a local authority before we go in and say what we say.  We want to see that each agency knew exactly how that local authority was doing and what support levels they were providing.  We would want local authorities to know exactly how they are responding to the approach from the different agencies as well, and how they are interacting with them.  \nDebbie Jones: Following on from the feedback that \nOfsted\n had from the sector, as Michael has said, we were very concerned that an early introduction of the multi-agency inspections would not necessarily result in fair and proportionate judgments.  Indeed, the discussion we have just had about LSCBs highlights that.  Where accountabilities are not clear, where you cannot say whether it is health professional, local authority, probation or police, and where you cannot have an impact, given that safeguarding is not one agency’s business—it is a joint business; it always has been—it would have been wrong at that stage.  The single inspection \nframework, in focusing on three key areas—protection, care and leadership—where inadequacy in any one of those will mean inadequacy overall, provides a more honest and straightforward look at what we are doing.  The review of the safeguarding children boards will, to pick up your point, Graham, highlight whether our concerns in \nOfsted\n are justified.  Therefore, the introduction of the multi-agency framework from 2015 in a targeted way, with the \nOfsted\n inspection as the spine, will provide a fairer and more proportionate system, but will also enable us to reinforce accountabilities.  By that time, we will also have had the feedback from something like 70 inspections, if not more.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: It has to be remembered that we are inspecting the local authority; we are not inspecting the police service or the health authority.  You could find a situation where the local authority is doing all that it possibly can to protect and support children, but the police service or the health authority are not doing a good job, and we need to provide an inspection judgment that says, “This local authority is doing its best, but this other agency is not”.  Is that agency being held to account, not just by the director of children’s services, who might be putting pressure on the police commander, but by the safeguarding board as well?\n&#xa0;\nQ49 &#xa0; \nMr Ward: One of the difficulties I found when I was on a children’s trust was that each of the participants had their own outcomes and outputs.  They were coming along and a co-ordinated approach was difficult when they said, “Well, actually, that is not how I am going to be judged”.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Yes.\nDebbie Jones: If I might just add to that, we are not in limbo at the moment.  We are in close communication with the other chief inspectors.  Sir Michael meets with the other chief inspectors regularly, and indeed you will probably be aware that there are inspections being organised in relation to the CQC, the police and probation in order to ensure that that precise accountability is followed through, because it cannot be followed through at the moment.  That is going to be important, and we are working closely.  \n&#xa0;\nQ50 &#xa0; \nMr Ward: And we are on target for 2015.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: We are on target.\nDebbie Jones: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ51 &#xa0; \nChair: I am trying to understand that last answer.  Have you been doing joint working with these other inspectors?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: On the framework for inspection, yes.\nDebbie Jones: We are doing joint working on the framework of inspection that will come in on target in 2015.  We are also working closely with them, because they are not just leaving their responsibilities during the present time; each agency has considered what it needs to do between now and 2015, particularly in those areas where they have concerns.\n&#xa0;\nQ52 &#xa0; \nChair: But they will not be joining with you formally in these multi-agency assessments, so there is still a political risk in some cases you could make the best judgments you \ncan on the information you have got, but get that wrong and then start to build up some hostility, with other agencies suggesting that you do not know what you are doing and you do not know what you are talking about.  That could cause reputational damage and— \nSir Michael Wilshaw: You are right to raise the issue of possible tensions.  There have been tensions already, and we have got to iron out those tensions.  That is why it is going to be a complex inspection framework.  We are in the lead; we are the lead inspectorate from 2015.  The police and the CQC are not; we are the lead inspectorate.  We have got to make sure, because our head is on the block on this one, that it goes well, that everyone knows what they should be doing and what their accountabilities are, and, most importantly, that we are confident that not only our inspectors are good enough, but the inspectors of the other agencies are good enough as well.\n&#xa0;\nQ53 &#xa0; \nChair: I am just trying to tease this out to check that it does not descend into a fiasco as we get the CQC and the police people all backing off going, “Oh, these \nOfsted\n people coming in with these unfounded judgments are making grand conclusions about agencies that they little understand and they have no expertise whatsoever in their teams.  In fact, I will give you an example of this particular team here.”  They may accurately be able to paint you looking pretty poor in terms of your understanding of policing or health, and they might not be wrong.  There is quite a lot of reputational risk in there as well as the risk of setting this whole agenda backwards, is there not, if you get it wrong?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Yes.\nDebbie Jones: There are a number of issues here, hopefully to mitigate some of your concerns, Graham.  First of all, I have referred already to the regular meetings that we have with the chief inspectors, in which we share our developments.  We will be publishing a report on all our work and their work in May, so that everyone is very clear about what is going to happen and when.  Most importantly, as we proceed with the single inspection framework and the review of the LSCBs, we will write to all other inspectorates where there are specific concerns.  I will be absolutely clear on that now.  \n&#xa0;\nQ54 &#xa0; \nChair: Prior to your coming out with—\nDebbie Jones: Absolutely.\n&#xa0;\nQ55 &#xa0; \nChair: It would be a disaster if different inspectors, even if it was privately, were saying, “Well actually, that analysis is wrong.  \nOfsted\n do not understand.”  The whole thing would collapse and be counterproductive.\nDebbie Jones: We have regular communication on future developments, both in relation to the multi-agency inspections and, indeed, to the inspections that the agencies are doing, but also, more importantly, where we have concerns now, we have two vehicles.  Those are the single inspection framework per se and the review of the LSCBs.  \n&#xa0;\nQ56 &#xa0; \nNeil Carmichael: Good morning.  I want to probe the issue of leadership and, by extension, the stability within the various organisations, because the two are linked.  I want to start off by noting Professor Eileen Munro, who was really encouraging social services in general to become more interested in judgment than box\n&#x2011;\nticking\n and so forth.  I was just wondering how \nOfsted\n were going to find it easy to measure how that is happening and encourage it to happen.  Could you just comment on that first?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: That has been the biggest change for our inspections over the last few years.  We have moved from that process-driven inspection, which was heavily criticised, to one where inspectors spend a much longer time in a local authority—eight or nine inspectors for a period of four weeks.  We talk to social workers; we talk to parents; we talk to children.  We look at more than 60 case files, to see what is happening in those cases, and then track them back to the visits to the homes, what the judgments are and whether there have been any re-referrals, for example, because of concerns about the organisation of the local authority, etc.  It is a much more hands\n&#x2011;\non, close-to-the-ground approach than ever before.  I am not saying \nevery one\n is going to be perfect, but it is better than it was.\n&#xa0;\nQ57 &#xa0; \nNeil Carmichael: But you are noticing a qualitative change, if you like.  \nSir Michael Wilshaw: Yes, absolutely.  Because we are doing it in a much more rigorous and robust manner, we are seeing real deficiencies on the ground, with only 40% of local authorities judged as good and better.\n&#xa0;\nQ58 &#xa0; \nNeil Carmichael: Do you think your approach to inspections is also being a catalyst for these changes?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Yes, I think so.  We are expecting managers to be managers, not just by sitting in offices and ticking boxes and being bureaucratic, but by getting out there and supporting their social workers, leading professional development and training, explaining what they have to do, going to the most difficult homes with their social workers, and raising morale and building confidence so that they stay in the job.  That is what we see in the best local authorities.  There is an issue of money, but where we see really good local authorities, we see high morale and real confidence in the management processes.\n&#xa0;\nQ59 &#xa0; \nNeil Carmichael: Turning to leadership for a moment, and specifically accountability, which we have just been touching on in the last few questions, are you satisfied that leadership across the territory we are talking about is suitably accountable, or are there areas where you think increased accountability is necessary?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: We have mentioned the safeguarding boards and our concerns about their accountability levels, and I do not want to say any more on that.  We will wait to see what Government says on this one and what our reports say when we have a significant number of inspections of LSCBs.  We have said in our report we are concerned about the volatility and the turnover of directors of children’s services.  We want really good people there who can manage children’s services across a range of functions.  That it is a system that needs really good leadership goes without saying.  I know Debbie is concerned—and she knows the history of this better than I do—that there is a real problem in attracting the best people into these more demanding jobs.\n&#xa0;\nQ60 &#xa0; \nNeil Carmichael: Has any analysis been done on the reasons why that should be—for example, pay and conditions or constantly getting hammered in the press because of issues that arise in other areas, not necessarily \nin \ntheir own?\nDebbie Jones: It is important that the Committee addresses the Association on the detail behind that particular point, Neil.  What I would say is that we have reported on a 30% \nturnover, which is the figure that was reported to us.  That reflects a level of organisational instability.  These are very challenging posts.  Earlier on in the questioning, you asked us about exit interviews and why people leave.  People leave for all sorts of different reasons, not just because of \nOfsted\n inspections.  The reality is, as in a lot of senior posts in the public sector, particularly where you are dealing with high-profile issues and high-profile cases, they are challenging.  We know that the same principles in relation to leadership apply at the top as they do in the middle and at the bottom—i.e. support proper training, issues of capacity.  \n&#xa0;\nQ61 &#xa0; \nChair: Can you say something more about the training?  The classic situation is that an education\nist\n comes up and becomes—like Sir Michael—in charge of social care.  What is the quality and take-up of training for people moving into one of these high-profile, highly-exposed positions?  \nDebbie Jones: As I said, Graham, it is going to be important that you speck to ADCS about that.  I can speak from my own experience, but from \nOfsted’s\n perspective, we now have had directors of children’s services for some years.  A lot of them will have grown through the system and will have managed both the schools side and the social-care side already.\n&#xa0;\nQ62 &#xa0; \nChair: So it is not an issue.\nDebbie Jones: I am not saying it is not an issue.\n&#xa0;\nQ63 &#xa0; \nChair: In which case, is it not part of \nOfsted’s\n role to check on the training and take-up of people in the key posts in leadership?  When you go in and inspect, I would have thought one of the fundamental questions is to find out the suitability of the person in charge to take on the whole range of responsibilities they have.\nDebbie Jones: What \nOfsted\n will be interested in is not just the training and qualifications that a DCS has, but the interface between the director, the chief executive, the corporate centre and the political leadership.  That is crucial.  Whether you have got an educationist at the top of social care or not, it is extremely important that you have got the level of expertise.  That is what we will be interested in.  In relation to the professional support that directors have, there is a vibrant association; there is also training and support that was provided to me as a director and is still being provided.  It is important the Committee do focus on that, as, indeed, do \nOfsted\n, but we will be looking at it as a whole.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: We will be providing some of that training, through our seminars and workshops, of good practice in local authorities that we see up and down the country in similar circumstances to ones where we see failure.  We are very hopeful that we will be able to support the professional development and training that already exists within ADCS.  The other big issue is this\n: i\nt is really up to the chief executive and the leader of the council—the corporate governance—to identify whether the leadership has the capacity to improve where we see underperformance and failure.  We cannot go around sacking a third of our directors of children’s services every year; that is ridiculous, even if there is a high-profile tragedy.  It is whether—and we can triangulate this with leaders of councils and chief executives from our reports—there is the capacity there to improve.\n&#xa0;\nQ64 &#xa0; \nNeil Carmichael: That is a really good point, because it is the ultimate leadership of the area in question—the council or whatever—that really matters here.  You have certainly \ngiven us a very strong steer as to what we should be doing next in terms of the Association, and I would certainly want to do that.  Thank you very much for that.  \nThe next question I want to talk about is how we get the right kind of people into the areas of most need.  Implicit throughout this session so far has been a focus on families that are in chaos and situations where children are being neglected, and they are in certain pockets of intense concern.  How do we get the right people directed towards those areas?  Have you got any thoughts on that?\nChair: I know you have touched on that already, but if you have anything else to say.\nDebbie Jones: Yes, I have.  I am quite happy to add to it.  Ensuring that you have the right staff, as I said earlier, is as much about support, training, development, clear links with the managers, etc.  We have made comment, as indeed has the sector, on the rate of temporary staff and whether or not, where there is failure, you tend to have higher levels of temporary staff, whether that is at senior level or, indeed, at practitioner level.  We certainly hear from social workers that what is important is those very issues of training, support and manageable workloads.  That has got to be key.  That is what we will be looking at through our inspection frameworks.  In the same way as it is challenging to secure directors into directors’ posts, it is very important that social workers are not put off from going into this extremely crucial area of work.  Social work is, quite rightly, a very proud profession.  It is something that I would hope that we can attract.  Through the Frontline programme, I know that we are seeing greater numbers of applications from graduates, but what they are experiencing is the need to have really good, sound professional training before they get into the field.  We look forward to Sir Martin \nNarey’s\n report in the same way as, I am sure, you do, because it is as much about the training before as it is about the training and support afterwards.\n&#xa0;\nQ65 &#xa0; \nNeil Carmichael: I have one last question about \nOfsted\n reports.  There has been some criticism, according to what I have just been reading, that one-liner grading, as opposed to a more narrative-orientated description situation, is a little bit off\n&#x2011;\nputting and contributes to a lack of stability.  What are your thoughts about that?  Do you think that there is scope for change there?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: I am sure Debbie will add to this, but we have searched our souls on this one and we have listened to what ADCS have said about it.  They want us to adopt a more narrative style, rather than a single-word judgment.  I think parents want to know whether their authority is a good one or not.  That is the issue.  We could easily obfuscate the issue by having a whole screed of narrative that does not tell us whether this is a good service or not.\n&#xa0;\nQ66 &#xa0; \nNeil Carmichael: That was a really interesting comment.  You said “whether the authority is a good one”.  Most people do think of this in terms of the authority or the council, or whatever.  In a sense, one of the things your inspections need to do is to work out how children’s services are being treated within the authority, the balance of emphasis that that authority places on children’s services, and its own analysis of the situation that it is dealing with.  It is not just a question of the territory that you are talking about, but its relationship towards all the others.  \nSir Michael Wilshaw: That is why our inspectors not only talk to the director of children’s services but to the chief executive and to the leader of the council—the corporate governance—to find out what priority they are giving it.  To come back to your first question, \non Birmingham, because we have said some tough things about Birmingham, corporate governance is doing something about it and injecting more money into the system.  \nDebbie Jones: Can I just add to that?  There will be ongoing debate about the single\n&#x2011;\nword\n judgments, particularly as we get to publication of our inspection reports.  It is important to say that there is a lengthy narrative\n, which \nsits alongside the judgments.  We owe it to the public to be very clear and very precise, but, equally, we owe it to the sector to ensure that, where we are making judgments, they are balanced by a strong narrative, which is there.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: And an easily understood narrative, I have to say, as well.  If I have been critical of anything at \nOfsted\n, it has been of the way we report, the language we use and the clarity of what we are trying to say.\nNeil Carmichael: Absolutely.  It has got to be clear for everybody to understand.  \nSir Michael Wilshaw: Yes.  Our reports have not been good enough on that.\n&#xa0;\nQ67 &#xa0; \nIan Mearns: One of the things that comes out of the discussion that you have just had with Neil is this issue of staff retention, recruitment and turnover within the profession, the number of people who are staying for relatively short periods of time within the profession, and a potential demographic time bomb within the profession, with people who are around about the age of 55 being a greater proportion of the profession.  Debbie, you talked about Frontline.  I have seen evidence that Frontline will provide less than one person of the calibre that you have talked about per local authority area or children’s services area.  It is not a panacea.  Are you picking up any particularly good examples of local authorities in challenging circumstances that are bucking the trends on all of those problems?\nDebbie Jones: The issue of where there are vacancies and why there are vacancies is complex, and we have to recognise that.  Bringing skilled practitioners into areas where there are problems to share good practice is something that we have been doing for a while now, through our improvement work and through the improvement work that is being done by the sector, but, at the same time, we are supporting capacity-building within those areas so they can do it for themselves.  Certainly our experience would be that it is much better if you can develop a stable workforce.  There are a number of authorities in challenging circumstances that have improved their stability rates—not just in \nLondon\n boroughs.  I referenced Frontline, but there is an increase in the numbers of skilled and newly\n \nqualified graduates coming into the profession.  Then, of course, there is a challenge for the profession about whether we pay enough, whether we support enough and whether we recognise enough.  That is something that is a debate not just for \nOfsted\n but also for the sector and, indeed, for Government and Ministers.  Michael has had plenty to say on that front as well.\n&#xa0;\nQ68 &#xa0; \nIan Mearns: In the circumstances and the instances you are talking about\n,\n where those improvements in workforce stability have taken place, have we also seen a commensurate improvement in the output for children?\nDebbie Jones: There is no question that where you are able to secure a stable workforce, our experience would be that young people can speak of having the same social worker taking them through their journey and travelling with them.  It makes a difference and it improves outcomes.  As I said earlier, it is not a straightforward formula, but it is certainly a priority for us and for the sector.  It absolutely has to be a priority for Ministers.  \n&#xa0;\nQ69 &#xa0; \nChair: Are you hoping the \nNarey\n Report will lead to improvement in the academic quality of the young people coming in?  It is not that you necessarily have to be a great academic to be a great social worker, but would it help if people with better qualifications and better degrees from better institutions were coming into social work?\nDebbie Jones: What I am hoping for from the \nNarey\n Report is that it has something to say not just about academic qualifications but also about the vocational skills that we are seeking to develop throughout this social care workforce.  We will presumably, Graham, come on to talk about children’s homes and the comments that we have made in relation to leadership there.  Those are really important.  Professional training is very definitely not just about academic qualifications, but if that is a reflection of the skills and abilities and the potential of the workforce, then certainly we will be looking at that.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: It is my understanding that salary levels are not bad.  Social workers start on about £27,000 or £28,000 a year, and a middle manager would be on £40,000 to £50,000.  I do not think they are bad salary levels.  More important is the status, image and workload.  \n&#xa0;\nQ70 &#xa0; \nChair: Do you have any thoughts on how that can be changed?  I know it is not exactly your job.  You have said today, Debbie, what a hard job it is.  I speak to a lot of social workers and they say it is a fantastic job; there is no better job, no more satisfying job and no more enjoyable and fulfilling job, and it is not all awful and not everyone is under the most immense caseloads.  It is actually quite a great job to have, and it is not that badly paid.  That message does not get out there, and parents do not think, “Oh, my daughter is getting three As at A-level; she must become a social worker.”\nSir Michael Wilshaw: That is absolutely right.  We need to talk about what a great job it is.  One of the reasons that we are getting better people into teaching now is that the image is changing, the status is changing, it is a political priority in Government, etc.  That needs to happen in social work.\nDebbie Jones: Dealing with our most vulnerable children should be a job that people want to do.  It is a high-profile job and it is a reasonably remunerated job, but it behoves all of us, whether in \nOfsted\n, the community, the media or whatever, to recognise where it works well as well as where it works badly.  As I said at the time of the launch of the social care annual report, if you do well in a school\n,\n you will see yourself written all over the newspapers.  Social care only ever appears in the media when things go wrong.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: The Government appointed recently a Chief Social Worker.  It would be her job to promote the profession.  \n&#xa0;\nQ71 &#xa0; \nPat Glass: Can I ask you about capacity within \nOfsted\n?  When we did our report on \nOfsted\n a few years ago, the two main areas of concern that came out were consistency across the piece and inspectors having a background in the area they were inspecting.  At the time, we were raising concerns about early years, SEN, etc, but when we carried out a recent evidence session on children’s residential homes, we were told that 50% of the inspectorate that came to inspect a home had no background at all in social care.  Do you think that is good enough?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: No.\n&#xa0;\nQ72 &#xa0; \nPat Glass: Do you have plans to change that?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: I have already intimated that we have done a lot of work to weed out our weakest performers.  We have raised salary levels for regulatory inspectors.  It is a decent salary now that the ones that we have kept on earn.  The oversight is now much better; we have created a middle tier of managing regulatory inspector and a lead regulatory inspector as well.  We have put a lot of money, effort and time into this issue of oversight.  We think that will deliver better outcomes in terms of inspection.  This whole issue of consistency of inspection is one that is on my desk all the time.  We are doing as much as possible within the regional structure—and we have put social care into the regions now—to really look very hard at whether the inspection process and the reports that are written are consistent.  \n&#xa0;\nQ73 &#xa0; \nPat Glass: And there is an emphasis on having specialists in inspection teams.  \nSir Michael Wilshaw: Absolutely.  We have done a lot of work.  In the last six months, we have appointed a National Director for Recruitment, who will work with the regional directors in recruiting the best people into \nOfsted\n and, when we get people, to train them up, through our management structures, to do a good job.\n&#xa0;\nQ74 &#xa0; \nPat Glass: What kind of training have inspectors had on the new framework?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: We have got policy teams made up of inspectors who write the frameworks.  These are experienced practitioners who write the frameworks.\n&#xa0;\nQ75 &#xa0; \nPat Glass: And you are confident that the workforce has the ability and willingness to change the way in which they inspect, in line with the new framework.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Yes, and you have got a management structure that ensures that happens.  \nDebbie Jones: There are a number of things that I want to add to what Sir Michael has said.  Sir Michael said at the start that we have increased capacity, both on the regulatory side and, indeed, on the social care inspectorate side.  In particular on the senior social care inspectorate side, we have increased capacity by over a third, which is really important.  As well as looking at the skills and expertise of the staff we have internally, we are recruiting more people external to \nOfsted\n, which is important as well.  That is not to belittle the skills that people have within the organisation, but it is to share some of that experience from outside, which is very important.  The changes that Sir Michael has referred to in salary structure and in the support structure that we now have on the regulatory side will ensure that we are recruiting more people from the sector into that side, which should hopefully mitigate some of the concerns that this Committee has had in the past.  \nSir Michael Wilshaw: I should add that we are spending quite a lot of money in a quite tight budget to update our IT facilities so that a regulatory inspector going twice a year into a children’s home can press a button and see what the legacy of the previous inspection is saying.  We are investing in a good IT infrastructure to support the inspection process, which was sadly lacking, I have to say.\nDebbie Jones: In the same wa\ny\n as we have raised the bar in relation to our expectations, qualifications, etc, on the regulatory side, we think it is important that is matched with what \nwe see in the sector in relation to the staff and managers of children’s homes.  We think that is really important, and we have said some very strong things about it.  \n&#xa0;\nQ76 &#xa0; \nPat Glass: In the new framework, there is a real emphasis on getting the young person’s voice. That can be a bit tricky where young people either are unable to give their views orally or simply do not want to.  What kind of training are you putting into making sure that you get the young person’s perspective and voice?\nDebbie Jones: The voice of young people, as you say, Pat, is a much bigger central focus of the inspection.  It is focused by the very fact that we are following the journey of the child.  We are looking at anything, as Sir Michael said, between 70 and 150 cases.  We will focus on young people whether they are in the child\n \nprotection system—and we will be commenting on that very strongly in our inspection reports—or the looked-after system or leaving care.  We are not just going to speak to those young people on the Children in Care Council.  Our inspectors are trained to work with young people.  The work of Roger Morgan, the Children’s Rights Director, has been very helpful in that respect, to ensure that we have the skills necessary, as well as the focus in the inspection framework, as he has pointed out.  \n&#xa0;\nQ77 &#xa0; \nPat Glass: A significant proportion of children in care are disabled, and many of them will not be able to speak.  Is it right down to that kind of level?  There is a real skill in getting the views of young people who cannot speak.\nDebbie Jones: I could not agree with you more, and it is a particular passion of mine.  If I am being completely honest, I think there will be additional work to be done in relation to that focus.  \n&#xa0;\nQ78 &#xa0; \nMr Raab: In the opening paragraphs of the social care annual report, it says we are seeing evidence that children are actually safer today than in the past, and there is some evidence for that provided in relation to child homicide rates and the fact that there is \nnot\n evidence of persistently poor performance within local authorities considered as a whole.  Why do you think the public perception is different from that?  Is it all the tabloid media, or is there something else going on?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Much of it is the tabloid-media stuff.  When there is a high-profile death in the most tragic circumstances that we all know about, people think that that is happening all over the country.  We know that not to be true.  These are issues that are being picked up by the press, and there is naturally public concern about it.  We have got to, at \nOfsted\n, address that issue.  We have talked a lot over the last hour about pressure on local authorities and on the leaders of local authorities.  That pressure not only comes from \nOfsted\n; it comes from these very high\n&#x2011;\nprofile\n tragic cases.  I suspect years ago there were these individual issues that did not receive the press coverage that they do today.\n&#xa0;\nQ79 &#xa0; \nMr Raab: When you look at the morale among professionals within the sector, presumably, if there has been the progress made that you have cited, that is reflected in morale.  Or do you find it being trumped by the media onslaught?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: We see when we inspect that morale is high where people on the ground feel well supported by leaders and middle managers in that local authority and are given the confidence to do what they have to do on a daily basis.  Poor morale comes about when people feel disconnected from the management and leadership of that service.\nDebbie Jones: If I could just add to what Sir Michael has said on the issues around the death rate, because there is a huge amount of interest in that.  The death rate is actually stable in relation to children.  It has been stable for many years.  We are becoming a lot more aware—and that is very much in the annual report—of the 1\n&#xa0;\nmillion children and young people who are affected by living in homes where alcohol abuse, drug abuse, mental health issues and domestic violence are prevalent.  Those are all the issues that we rehearsed earlier.  We think that that is where the focus needs to be, which is why, as I said earlier, our focus is so much on early help as well as the experience of children at the top end of the system.\n&#xa0;\nQ80 &#xa0; \nMr Raab: Just picking up on that, it is easy to think in the past of infamous child killers like the Moors murderers or something like that, but I wonder, beneath those headline figures, for example, of child mortality rates, whether you think there has been an increase or a change in the kind of wanton neglect by parents, reflecting the comments you made earlier.  Has that kind of child safety within the intimate circle of the family deteriorated?  \nSir Michael Wilshaw: I believe it has.  That is why I was determined in the speech I made and in the commentary in the annual report to say that, yes, \nOfsted\n has a part to play and leadership has a part to play, but families have got an awfully important part to play in ensuring that society becomes a better place.\n&#xa0;\nQ81 &#xa0; \nMr Raab: That is quite a desperate message, is it not?  Child safety has got better outside of the home in the last generation, but it has got worse inside the home.  That is effectively what you are saying.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Yes, that absolutely is what I am saying.  We may disagree on this one, \nDebbie, \nbut the fact that we have got 1\n&#xa0;\nmillion children in these circumstances is shocking.  When I first saw those statistics, I was quite appalled by them.  You might say there is a context to this and there is a historical issue in it and it has not got that much worse.  I believe it has got worse.  I am saying that not just in terms of the report we have written and the statistics we have seen, but from my experience of being somebody who has worked in the inner city and in deprived areas all my life.\nDebbie Jones: There are a number of things that I want to say.  The numbers do not say that they have got worse; however, you have to look beneath the numbers.  In the same way as post\n&#x2011;\nPeter\n Connelly we saw awareness raised and the numbers of referrals raised, public awareness is much greater.  \n&#xa0;\nQ82 &#xa0; \nMr Raab: Just to pick up on that, are you saying that there is no evidence that child homicide or assault by a parent or member of the family has got worse over the last 10 years or 20 years?\nDebbie Jones: There is no evidence that the numbers have increased.  It is important to pick up the point that you raised \nabout \nneglect.  We have got a report coming out in a month \non \nneglect.  Neglect is a complex area, but it is important to get underneath that, particularly when you relate that to the 1\n&#xa0;\nmillion or so young people that we were talking about earlier.\n&#xa0;\nQ83 &#xa0; \nMr Raab: Can I just try to drill down to what you are saying?  You are saying there may be fewer things like assault or overt serious-end crimes, but you are accepting the premise of Sir Michael’s point that the underlying perhaps sub-criminal neglect has got worse.  \nDebbie Jones: I am saying that we are learning more about it.  \nMr Raab: That sounds like a politician’s answer.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: I am saying it is worse.\n&#xa0;\nQ84 &#xa0; \nChair: Are there conditions that make it more likely?  For instance, the classic analysis would be to suggest that breakdown of the family, reduction in marriage and lack of commitment between couples has led to more single-parent families and more step-dads—permanent or otherwise—coming in and out.  Is there a correlation between family breakdown, however you define it, and neglect and abuse of children?  \nSir Michael Wilshaw: There is undoubtedly a correlation between all those issues that you have just raised and neglect and breakdown.\nChair: Siobhain is about to explode into saying something as well.  \n&#xa0;\nQ85 &#xa0; \nSiobhain McDonagh: Is it also about societal attitudes changing towards certain things?  When I was a child, domestic violence was something that was always there and people always knew about and nobody ever spoke about, but nobody took into account the effect that violence between a mum and a dad could have on the kids.  In my experience as an MP and a local councillor, only very recently have social services really taken into account the effect of domestic violence between a couple on the kids.  It was always seen as an issue between the parents.  Only in the last two years have I had experiences of women coming to me and saying, “They have told me I have got to get rid of my partner or they are not letting the kids come back”.  I have only heard that in the last two years of 25 years of public life.\nDebbie Jones: I would agree up to a point with what you are saying.  Awareness \nof\n domestic violence and its adverse impact on families and children has become much more real in recent years.  We will be looking at that in our inspections and we will be looking at the work of safeguarding boards \non \nall these issues.  It is not just a question of the increase in numbers, whether it is in alcohol abuse, domestic violence or mental health problems; it is a question of understanding the impact and the difference it makes to outcomes for children.\n&#xa0;\nQ86 &#xa0; \nSiobhain McDonagh: Yes, but domestic violence was an adult’s problem before; it has only recently become a children’s problem.\nDebbie Jones: Hence the interrelationship between community safety partnerships and LSCBs is going to be incredibly important.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: I talked about social taboos disappearing, and that is contributing to some of the things that we are seeing.  One of the biggest ones is this issue of being responsible for your child’s safety, welfare and happiness.  One of the big issues is the absent dad—the father who just walks away from his responsibilities.  Society has got to be a lot tougher on those fathers who do neglect their responsibilities and chase them down.  The Child Support Agency used to be a lot tougher with those dads who neglect their responsibilities.\nDebbie Jones: I think the Committee will be interested when we publish our report on neglect and the survey that we have done on neglect, because those issues \nassociated with \ndomestic violence, the professional recognition of the impact of neglect and the degree in the difference of approach, figure.  For example, if you have got a child who has had an injury, you can see the injury; neglect is more insidious, as you will know, and that impact takes much longer to spot.  We will be interested in that in relation to assessment of risk.  It has always been complex.\n&#xa0;\nQ87 &#xa0; \nPat Glass: Can I just explore that theme a little further?  How concerned are you about not just the families where the father leaves or there is domestic violence or children living in families where there is substance abuse, including alcohol, but those middle-class families where both parents are working and the children are left to their own devices and they have access to pornography?  I spent some time with the police recently rounding up kids on a Friday night who came from really nice homes.  They were 14\n&#x2011;\nyear\n&#x2011;\nold and 15-year-old girls who were completely intoxicated, and the parents were providing the booze.  How far does this go beyond what we would normally see as neglect in the home?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: You are right.  This is not just a class issue; this is an issue across society.  Again, as an ex-head\n \nteacher, I was always worried about those sorts of issues, of children from across the social spectrum staying out late into the evening drinking and having access to drugs.  Hopefully, those sorts of issues will not just be picked up by children’s services but also by the police and schools.  There needs to be, in a good system, regular communication between those people who engage with children.\n&#xa0;\nQ88 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: The social care annual report argues the external pressures of increasing caseloads and declining resources are not “insurmountable”.  What good practices have you seen in local authorities that are managing to cope?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: In a sense, we are rehearsing the arguments that we have already made.  Where you see, in a local authority, despite financial constraints, really good, committed leadership, supported by a good chief executive and a good children’s board, and that leadership is reflected down the command chain, social workers feel confident in what they are doing and we see successful outcomes.\n&#xa0;\nQ89 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: Can you describe what that looks like?  We talked about this earlier, but on a more detailed day-to-day basis, what would that look like?\nDebbie Jones: We list a couple of authorities in the report—Gateshead and \nDerby\n—that came out of intervention.  \nT\nhey targeted their resources where they were most needed.  That is the issue.  It is not about throwing money anywhere; it is about targeting resources where they are most needed—where they are needed on the front line—watching that caseloads are manageable, being very intelligent about where you look at your performance information, and listening to what young people tell you and what your practitioners tell you, as opposed to just skating along the surface.  These are all important issues.  \n&#xa0;\nQ90 &#xa0; \nChair: Is it the case that around half of children returned home from care end up coming back in again?  What is happening about that—assessing properly whether a child should go home and doing the work before they go home, not just when they go home, to support the family and to make sure the conditions are right?  If you stopped having half the children bouncing back again, you would save a fortune, save a load of time and reduce caseload, would you not?\nDebbie Jones: Yes.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: That is part of our inspection framework now.  We are looking at the whole issue of care leavers and whether there is a good enough plan to support them when they do leave care.\nDebbie Jones: Yes.  Comprehensive supported rehabilitation, well planned, would do a lot to mitigate \nthe outcome for \nsome of those young people who domino back into care.\n&#xa0;\nQ91 &#xa0; \nChair: As part of our residential children’s home inquiry, we have heard children are often sent a long way away from their home authority; they run away and no one comes to visit them—they do not do the post-runaway interview.  In the meantime, they are going to get returned, almost inevitably, to their family and no one is working with the family to address their deep-seated issues in order to facilitate such a return.  It is not exactly a surprise when they come home, get abused or neglected again, and bounce back into care, with vast costs, a lot of which could have been avoided.\nDebbie Jones: For children in children’s homes, the revised children’s homes framework that will be introduced in April, which we are consulting on now, includes a lot more focus on the experience of children who are missing, and that is where the focus has to be.  We are also concerned about the experiences of children who are in children’s homes away from home or foster homes.  We will be following those through the new inspection framework.  \nSir Michael Wilshaw: The outcomes for children in care are still miserable.  If we are going to do something about the cycle of despair, we need to try to improve the educational outcomes of children who are taken into care, particularly those in children’s homes.  It is a terrible state of affairs.\n&#xa0;\nQ92 &#xa0; \nChair: The analysis I gave, which you agreed with, sounds like a no-brainer.  What are the disincentives to do that?  \nIf y\nou are struggling as a leader of a council or a director of children’s services, you have got a limited budget and there is pressure like you would not believe, and yet you are allowing this ludicrously expensive boomeranging of the child backwards and forwards from care, when the evidence, it is suggested, is that if you intervened earlier and worked with the family, that is a cheaper and more effective route to protecting the child, even if your only interest was saving your budget and your job it would be a smarter thing to do.  Why on earth are they not doing it?\nDebbie Jones: Graham, that is why we are going to be focusing so heavily on early help.  That analysis is absolutely correct.  To intervene once they are in care is a lot more difficult.  However, as you will know, there are many young people for whom care is a positive solution and a positive outcome.  Indeed, in some of the places that we have seen—and I am sure my colleagues in the Association would want to say more on this—we have seen massive improvement in the achievements of young people in the care system; young people have gone to university and gone to college for whom their background is not a barrier.\n&#xa0;\nQ93 &#xa0; \nChair: You did not answer my specific question, which is: given that it is obvious, it is well-evidenced, and it offers enormous benefit to the authority, even putting aside the child, why is it not happening now?\nDebbie Jones: You need to address some of that to my director colleagues.  \nChair: I have not got them here; I have just got you here.  I want to know from you.  You are the inspector; you tell me.\nDebbie Jones: Because, as you will well know, Graham, it is not that straightforward.  Children who come into the care system are usually your most damaged, your most challenging and your most vulnerable.  We have a responsibility as \nOfsted\n to ensure that they are getting the absolute best.\n&#xa0;\nQ94 &#xa0; \nChair: The point is: if the local authority has got a child at a ludicrously expensive children’s home—the Minister told us it costs £4,000 a week on average; my maths tells me that is 200\n&#xa0;\ngrand a year—it does not want them to be there if it can help it.  You find out that half of the ones who return home end up going back into care, with all the expense around that process as well as, then, the cost of 200\n&#xa0;\ngrand a year for housing them, and it is cheaper and more effective to intervene with the family.  Yet we were told during our inquiry that no one is going in and working with the family to address whatever the problem was that led to neglect in the first place—it might be alcohol, drugs, an abusive relationship, or whatever.  I am trying to ask: why is that the case?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: There are two things there.  First of all, do social workers engage robustly with families and convey the hard messages to a bad family member?  No, they do not.  They have got to sharpen their act up there.  We want to see social workers—and directors of children’s services have got to communicate this message—conveying these tough messages and working with families more.  Secondly, in terms of care leavers, we have got to ensure—and we are, through the revised inspection framework—that there is a care\n&#x2011;\nleaving\n plan that is robust and that will lead to success.  You are quite right to say that it is not a hugely successful enterprise at the moment; too many children return to care.\n&#xa0;\nQ95 &#xa0; \nChair: I do not understand why.  If am a director of children’s services, why would I do that?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Because the wrong assessments have been made.\nBill Esterson: You can only ask the same question so many times.\nChair: Yes, that is true.\nDebbie Jones: Can I respond to that, Graham?\nChair: The fourth effort.\nDebbie Jones: I am going to try again.  The system reacts to child protection.  It has to.  The media would take us to the cleaners if we did not; you would take us to the cleaners if we did not.  It also has to invest in early help to prevent the children \nfrom \ncoming into the system.  It also has to work with those children who are in the system, to ensure that they do \ndo\n more to prevent them \nfrom \ngoing back into the system and leaving a\ngain, \nby the Staying Put schemes that are being developed in foster care and indeed are now being thought about in residential care.  All those things have to be done concurrently. \n&#xa0;\nQ96 &#xa0; \nBill Esterson: Just to try to get an answer to Graham’s point—\nChair: I thought you just told me it could only be asked so many times.\nBill Esterson: The question it has prompted \nfrom \nme is: there is a short-term financial imperative within every department, including children’s services and social services departments, and they may feel that the £200,000 a year for a residential placement can be avoided if they can get children back home.  Do you see evidence that that kind of approach is being adopted, which is a short-sighted measure given what then happens?\nDebbie Jones: What we see in good authorities and what good directors know is that if they invest in those early-intervention strategies and in those preventive strategies, they will invest to save—they will save money in the longer term.  However, they have to persuade their chief executives and their political leaders to retain that investment.  That is quite a challenge.  \nSir Michael Wilshaw: As I think the Secretary of State talks about in a couple of his speeches, there is also “optimism bias” among some, who think it is going to be better than it actually is going to be when these youngsters do return home.  We have to make sure that a realistic assessment is provided for children who return home where we probably know it is not going to work.\n&#xa0;\nQ97 &#xa0; \nIan Mearns: Going back to old experience—and I am sure that this still happens to a certain extent—when people from social services departments are interacting with families, there will be an expert, or a social worker, who goes in who is trying to deal with the problems that the parent has, and the fact that there are children within the family is not the problem they are there to deal with; they are there to deal with the parent’s alcoholism or their drug abuse, or the fact that there is domestic violence between the parents.  The fact that not putting the child into care might save £200,000 a year down the line does not come out of their adult social worker’s budget; it is not their budget.  We need to see a much more comprehensive and holistic view of the family from the perspective of social workers and social-work departments.  Or is it much better than that in a lot of places these days?\nDebbie Jones: What we are looking at is a joined-up approach.  You cannot go into a family and look just at the parents.  Going back to what Siobhain was saying about domestic violence, you have to look at the impact on children, and that is certainly what we will be doing in our inspections.  \n&#xa0;\nQ98 &#xa0; \nCraig Whittaker: Debbie, it was uplifting to hear you mention the fact that the Government are looking at the Staying Put agenda for those in residential care, but when the Secretary of State was here with us, when asked about the disparity between the two groups—residential and foster—he said that he was not prepared to look at it until he saw a marked improvement in residential homes.  He said that with an unspecified timeframe and an unspecified number of homes.  The statistics from \nOfsted\n, though, show a big improvement in residential homes.  Who is right?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Do I think our frameworks have been too generous?  Yes.  We need to have a framework for the inspection of children’s homes that is a lot more robust than they have been up to now.  You would expect to see in next year’s report some reduction in those statistics.  \nDebbie Jones: The problem with the previous framework is that it focused on compliance.  The new framework focuses very clearly on the experience of children.  What I would want to say—and this may anticipate a question you have got subsequently—is what is important to \nOfsted\n is that we need to have the right sticks as well as the right carrots to ensure that we can provide those levers of improvement to generate that improvement in quality of care.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: This terrible phrase “national minimum standards” has got in the way of effective inspection processes.  That is why certainly in my time here we have put pressure on Government to change all that—to get rid of this silly title of “national minimum standards” and go for “national quality standards”.  The Government have listened to that and they are changing national minimum standards into these more qualitative judgments.  \n&#xa0;\nQ99 &#xa0; \nCraig Whittaker: On the Government listening, have you heard anything about your request for allowing \nOfsted\n to inspect chains of homes?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: We have raised this as an issue and we look forward to the Government responding to that.\nDebbie Jones: We think that is really important, and we continue to put pressure on the Government.  They know that very clearly.  In the new market, where something like 75% of children’s homes are not in local authorities, we need to have the same levers for both and we also, we believe very strongly, need to have the capacity and levers to inspect the chains.\n&#xa0;\nQ100 &#xa0; \nIan Mearns: Moving on a bit, what powers does \nOfsted\n have with regards to closing children’s homes?  How many children’s homes has \nOfsted\n ordered to be closed, say, over the past three years?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Certainly over the last year, we have closed more homes than ever before and we have issued more compliance notices than ever before.  We have got those powers and we will use them.\n&#xa0;\nQ101 &#xa0; \nIan Mearns: I am not suggesting for one moment that the homes that we have been \nto\n should be closed, because an awful lot of them seem to be doing a good job, but how long do you think it is going to be before \nOfsted\n is saying to local authorities, “Look, unless there is a very good particular reason for the particular child, it is no longer acceptable for you, as a local authority, to be sending your kids 80 miles away”?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: That is a key issue in our inspection framework.  For any child who lives more than 20 miles away from their home, or from the local authority, we look and check what is happening.  Is there good liaison?  Is there good co-ordination between the local authority and the children’s home?  Are there good support systems in place?  Are they checking whether the child has gone missing or not?  That is a key plank of our new inspection framework.\nDebbie Jones: Yes.  The new inspection framework provides us with a great deal more levers, through following the young person.  Just to answer your previous question, 41 children’s homes were closed in the last year.  We will be looking very closely at those children who are placed away from home, but I would say to you from \nOfsted’s\n point of view what I said from an ADCS perspective: there are sometimes good reasons to place children away from home, such as safety and the degree of specialist support.  What is not a good reason is what I would always call the “four o’clock on a Friday” reason.  We will be testing those out and looking at the commissioning of placements, as well as the support that children receive.\n&#xa0;\nQ102 &#xa0; \nIan Mearns: Inherent within my question was particular reasons for particular children.  \nDebbie Jones: Absolutely.\nIan Mearns: The problem is we have come across far too many youngsters who, for no apparent reason apart from cost, it would seem, are placed far too far away from their home.  How realistic is it that \nOfsted\n will assess risks associated with the location of residential children’s homes?\nDebbie Jones: We do look at location; that is one of the things that we have made mention of and will look at.  We have got a survey coming out in the next month that looks at those children who have been placed a long way from home.  That will provide more information to the Committee.\n&#xa0;\nQ103 &#xa0; \nIan Mearns: Sometimes, through no fault of the people who are running the children’s home, the location \nof \na children’s home changes around it.  Do you think that \nOfsted\n will be looking at saying, “I am terribly sorry; this is not your fault, but the location has become unsafe”?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Debbie has mentioned the number of homes that have closed in the last year.  They will continue to close if inspectors believe that the location of a children’s home is in an unsafe area.  \n&#xa0;\nQ104 &#xa0; \nChair: How many of those 41 were fine, well-run establishments but in an area that suddenly had changed, and what were the particular changes that \nwere \ntriggered?\nDebbie Jones: Graham, I would have to get back to you on that.  What I know is that, because it focuses on children and young people and their experience in the home, what is happening around the home will be directly relevant to the new framework that will be introduced.  You asked earlier in the session about their training and support.  These are areas that we will want them to—\n&#xa0;\nQ105 &#xa0; \nChair: We were pretty shocked when we went down to \nMargate\n.  We had a presentation, and we saw layer after layer after layer: the crimes; the burglaries; the prisoner release; the sex-offenders release, all within a mile-across area with lots of children’s homes.  As one local MP said to me, “Everyone knows, if you want under\n-\nage sex, you go to that particular road”.  If that is what we are doing with the children who are in our care, that is a disgrace, and all the more power to your elbow to do something about it.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: If you are asking us whether we are looking at this, the answer is: absolutely.  That is why I have said that we will probably see more closures because of the locations of these institutions.  \nDebbie Jones: Equally, Graham, it is important that planning regulations need to be strengthened.  That point has been made by your colleagues.  \nIan Mearns: We have made that point repeatedly.\nChair: I do not have high hopes for that.  I have higher hopes of you than I have of planning change, but we will see. \n&#xa0;\nQ106 &#xa0; \nAlex Cunningham: I share that view.  I was telling the Secretary of State that I met a group of young people in the \nn\north\n-e\nast of \nEngland\n who lived, or live, in children’s homes.  One young girl told us about how she had run away and she had been returned to the home by the police, but nobody had taken any real interest in why she had run away; she was not properly interviewed or anything like that.  The Secretary of State says we have to get better, but what is your experience?  Do you know whether this is commonplace?  What is happening?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: It is one of the big issues now.  Again, I come back to the revisions to our inspection framework.  We will look at what happens when a child goes missing or runs away from a home, or there is a domestic situation, and we will want to see whether a review has been set up by the children’s home.  There should be a statutory review when that happens.  We recognise that often it does not happen.\nAlex Cunningham: Yes.  It would appear it happens in fewer than half the cases.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: That is right.  We will be very critical of both children’s homes and local authorities and the co-ordinating officers if that does not happen.\nDebbie Jones: We look at it in two ways.  \nThrough the inspection framework, we\n look at it through the experience of the child, but we will also look at it through the children’s homes inspection.  It is a big focus.\n&#xa0;\nQ107 &#xa0; \nAlex Cunningham: I am very pleased with that answer.  There was a survey I think by the Children’s Society—and it was mentioned at this \nn\north\n-e\nast event as well—that showed the vast majority of people in care would welcome having an independent visitor.  Yet, again, we find that a third or less have access to independent visitors.  What will you be doing to try to address that particular problem?\nDebbie Jones: The Children’s Rights Director has published \nfindings \nand done a fair bit of work in that arena.  In our inspection of children’s homes, whether or not their children and young people have access to independent visitors is a question that will be asked.  That is not a new issue, nor is it a new arrangement.  Independent-visitor schemes have been around for a very long time.  In our focus on children and young people, their experience of the independent-visitor scheme and, indeed, advocacy schemes in general is something that it is of interest to us.  We are strengthening our focus on the voice of young people.  \nChair: So in a year’s time, at this session, we will be able to hear there has been a significant percentage increase in the number of children who have such things thanks to your intervention.  That undertaking is very welcome.\n&#xa0;\nQ108 &#xa0; \nAlex Cunningham: Is this about a capacity issue, though—of appropriate people being available to support young people in this role?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: The big issue is: have we have got good enough people working in these children’s homes?  Have they got a social\n \nwork qualification?  They do not have to at the moment.  I found it quite shocking that three in 10 of the youngsters in children’s homes have reported to inspectors that they get little or no help with their school work.  That is \nnonsense.  We need to do something about the quality and qualifications of the people who work in these homes.\nDebbie Jones: Yes, but interestingly, the survey that we published in 2012 showed that children living in residential care were more likely to get those independent visitors than children living in other forms of family care.\n&#xa0;\nQ109 &#xa0; \nAlex Cunningham: Yes, but it is still lower than it should be.  Can I just ask you about one other thing?  I do not recollect anything in the report about social care and young carers.  I know they are not necessarily in care themselves, but they are on the radar of social workers.  I just wonder if you think \nOfsted\n should be taking a greater interest in young carers and inquire how they are being supported.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: That would mean a huge extension of our role.\nAlex Cunningham: It is a social care issue.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: It is a social care issue.  Is it \nOfsted’s\n role to look at this?  I am not sure.  Or is it the CQC’s role?  \nAlex Cunningham: My experience is that whilst some schools are very good and some social workers are very good, \nyoung carers \ndo not really get that universal support because nobody is asking the question.  \nDebbie Jones: What I would say is that where we pick up in our sample, whether it is 70 or 150, young people who are young carers—and we are likely to—we will comment on that.\n&#xa0;\nQ110 &#xa0; \nIan Mearns: From the other part of your inspectorate, though, Sir Michael—the schools inspectorate—undoubtedly, for a lot of young carers, the caring role that they have within the home for other siblings or for their parents or older relatives can often have a really dramatic and detrimental impact on their educational performance.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: Absolutely.\nDebbie Jones: Absolutely, but we have to recognise the capacity issue.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: The capacity of \nOfsted\n to inspect those issues.  But certainly, in terms of the pastoral function and welfare function of schools in particular—\nChair: We will leave that thought with you.  \n&#xa0;\nQ111 &#xa0; \nAlex Cunningham: Would you welcome that responsibility?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: If we were given sufficient resource and had time to plan for it.  \nChair: In the spirit of doing more with less, can I go to Craig?\n&#xa0;\nQ112 &#xa0; \nCraig Whittaker: I have two very quick questions for you.  As Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Adoption and Fostering, it is great to see the amount of adoptions rising, but our members say what your report says\n:\n the process is still far too long, too \ncomplex and too inhibitive.  Is the Government’s reform programme doing enough to tackle delays?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: It is one of the bright spots of our report that fostering and adoption is moving ahead apace and that targets and thresholds are having an impact \non\n speedy adoption and fostering.  You have got the figures there; it has been quite remarkable over the last year.  \nDebbie Jones: Yes, I have the figures.  The 15% increase in adoptions is to be welcomed.  As somebody who worked very closely with the \nDfE\n on the adoption\n \nreform programme in a previous life, we are reaping that benefit.  However, the issue of delays is an ongoing one.  It is complex.  The work of the family\n \ncourt reforms has a very clear part to play in that, as well as the need to focus on the experience of permanency planning for children over 10 and children with complex needs.  We will pick that up where those young people are part of our sample in our inspections, but what you have focused on there, Craig, is an ongoing issue that will require further debate and thought.  \n&#xa0;\nQ113 &#xa0; \nCraig Whittaker: Finally from me, the first time I ever heard of “adoption parties”, I was a bit horrified.  Last week, there was a programme on TV about them, and I am not quite sure whether I am still horrified or not.  Do they work, or are there better ways of matching parents with potential children to be adopted?\nSir Michael Wilshaw: I know very little about it.  It sounds a bit like speed dating, does it not?\nSiobhain McDonagh: It is exactly like speed dating.\nCraig Whittaker: That is exactly what it is.\nDebbie Jones: It would be wrong \nfor \nus to comment on the efficacy of any particular strategy.  I could speak to you as a social worker, but I am not going to in this respect.  From \nOfsted’s\n perspective, what we would say is that whatever means is used—whatever creative strategy is used—what is important is that the placements that are made and the matching that happens is of the right child to the right placement, and it lasts.  There is nothing worse than adoption\n \nplacement breakdown.\nSir Michael Wilshaw: My wife watched the programme and shortly before I came out this morning she said that it was one of the saddest programmes that she had seen—these children looking for prospective adoptive parents.\n&#xa0;\nChair: Can I thank you both very much indeed?  The fact that we have a separate report and the fact that we have spent the entire morning on the issues \nassociated with \nchildren’s social care rather than squeezing it in with education \nis a \ngood thing.  We in fact have additional questions \nabout \nolder children—16\n&#x2011;\nplus accommodation—which is something that we are planning to inquire further into; we are announcing that today.  Further to our residential children’s care report, which will be coming out shortly, we plan to look at 16\n&#x2011;\nplus accommodation and outcomes for looked-after children as well.  We may write to you and, if you were able to write back to us on that, we would duly publish those answers; that would be very helpful.  Thank you very much indeed for giving evidence to us this morning.\n&#xa0;\n              \nOral evidence: \nOfsted\n Social Care Annual Report 2012-13, HC 980\n              \n              \n2\n"
