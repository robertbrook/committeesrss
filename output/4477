defaultThis submission provides evidence of the 
defaultneed to focus on 
defaultchildren with 
defaultdisabilities
default in development
default, especially those facing triple discrimination due to their age, gender and disability. 
defaultIt provides evidence from Plan’s research and programmes in developing countries around disability, education and health in order to make recommendations for future ac
defaulttion. This submission calls for the UK government 
defaultto
default:

defaultDevelop

default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPlan is a global children’s charity. We work with children 
defaultin 48 of 
defaultthe world’s poorest countries 
defaultacross three continents 
defaultto help them build a better future. For 76 years we’ve been taking action and standing up for every child’s righ
defaultt to fulfil their pote
defaultntial by 
defaultgiving children a healthy start in life, includin
defaultg access to safe drinking water. Alongside
default securing the education of girls and boys, working with communities to pr
defaultepare for and survive disasters and 
defaultprotect
defaulting
default child
defaultren from abuse and exploitation
default. We are also inspiring 
defaultchildren to take a lead in decisions that affect their lives and enabling families to earn a living and plan for their children’s future.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPlan UK is a rights-based organisation and believes it is every child’s right to have a qual
defaultity education. This belief 
defaultreflects 
defaultthe statements articulated in Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which states that p
defaultersons with disabilities 
defaultshould not be 
defaultexcluded from the general education system on the basis of d
defaultisabi
defaultlity
default,
default and p
defaultersons with disabilities 
defaulthave the right to 
defaultaccess an inclusive, quality and free primary education and secondary education on an equal basis with others in the
default communities in which they live. 
defaultArticle 32 of the 
defaultConvention on the Rights of Pedefaultople with disabilities defaultcalls for 
defaultstates to ensure 
defaultthat international cooperation, including international development programmes, 
defaultare
default inclusive of and accessib
defaultle to persons with disabilities. This highlights the need for DFID to ensure a disability strategy is in place across their programmes. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChildren with disabilities are often at a double disadvantage, being marginali
defaults
defaulted and discriminated against because of
default both
default their age and their disability.
default Children are more vulnerable as they are not yet fully developed physically or cognitively. 
defaultGirls 
defaultand women 
defaultwith disabilities 
defaultin particular are at risk when 
defaultfactors such as gender and poverty 
defaultincrease 
defaulttheir
default vulnerabili
defaultty and marginali
defaults
defaultation.
default 
defaultThere is therefore a
default need for a specific focus on 
defaultboth 
defaultgirls and boys
default within a disability-inclusive development agenda.
default 
defaultNote that experiences of disadvantage are not homogeneous across all girls and boys with disabilities, but are 
defaultstrongly mediated by the type of disability
default. F
defaultor example, Plan research in Sierra Leone showed th
defaultat
default children with mobility impairments incurred due to war injuries suffered less discrimination than children
default with epilepsy or mental impairments.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPlan receives DFID funding through a 
defaultProgramme Partnership Arrangement (
defaultPPA
default)
default and for 
defaulta 
defaultGirls Education Challenge (GEC) fund project in Sierra Leone. 
defaultThe evidence and recommendations 
defaulton disability integration within DFID will be framed in relation the Girls
default Education Challenge Fund. Wider research from Plan programmes contributes towards the evidence used to support the recommendations. 
defaultPlan’s DFID funded 
defaultGEC
default programme in Sierra Leone focusses on reaching the most marginalised groups, including 
defaultchildren with
default disabilities
default. The need to reach out to these groups is clear. W
defaulte will work with 2,052 children with disabilities through partnering with Handicap International (HI), over the three years of the project. It is the largest programme HI have been involved in
default for children with disabilities in Sierra Leone. DFID has said repeatedly that they class the project as innovative due to this element on disability, which reflects the lack of other projects 
defaulteither 
defaultspecifically targeting 
defaultor mainstreaming 
defaultdisabled groups 
defaultin this way. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGlobally, 
defaultchildren with disabilities are
default more likely to experience violence and abuse
default than children without disabilities
default.
default 
defaultResearch conducted in 
defaultCameroon, Ethiopia, Senegal, Uganda and Zambia 
defaultby the African Child Policy Forum, found that the almost 1
default,
default000 young people with disabilities had universally experienced, at a minimum, sexual harassment and emotional violence during their childhood. 
defaultThe per
defaultpetrators of violence were often members of their extended family or their peers, making the home and school often unsafe spaces for children with disabilities
default.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultAfrican Child Policy Forum research found that 
defaultacross the entire sexual violence category,
default girls and boys with disabilities were equally likely to suffer
default sexual violence once or twice (28% of all cases), but girls were far more likely to suffer sexual violence more than 10 times (28%) than boys (16%).
default&#xa0;

defaultC
defaulthildren with disabilities are less 
defaultlikely to attend school
default,
default 
defaultPlan’s new 
defaultreport 
defaultInclude Us!
default, which 
defaultconducted research using data from Plan’s sponsored children, 
defaultc
defaultoncluded 
defaultthe following
default about the realities faced by children with disabilities in comparison to those without:
default  
defaultthey are 
defaultsubstant
defaultially less likely to attend school
default, will experience a poorer education when in school, and are 
defaultmuch more likely to have had a serious illness in the last 12 months, including malnutrit
defaultion. C
defaulthildren with disabilities who do attend school are generally 
defaultmore 
defaultlikely to be overage for their grade than their non disabled 
defaultpeers;
default 
default 
defaultresearch shows that this is often a precursor to drop out.
default 
default 
defaultWithin most countries, inclusion levels for children with disabilities in schooling were highest for those with vision or hearing impairments and lowest for those with learning, physical or communication impairments. This indicates that the level of exclus
defaultion can be linked to the type of impairment. 
defaultM
defaultore research
default is required to better determine and understand the relationships between type of impairment and school access.
default 
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPlan’s baseline
default research
default for the Girls Education Challenge Fund programme in 
defaultfive d
defaultistricts in 
defaultSierra Leone (to be published) found that
default girls with disabilities experience poorer
default educational outcomes
default, school attendance, and retention, than 
defaultthose without disabilities, further legitimizing the need to focus on 
defaultgirls 
defaultwith disabilities 
default in 
defaultand outside of 
defaulteducation.
default&#xa0;
default3.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA s
defaulttudy from Plan Nepal showed that children with disabilities face specific challenges in accessing health and education services, due to structural, physical and attitudinal barriers
default.
default 
defaultA Plan study from West Africa 
defaultin Togo, Sierra Leone, Niger and Guinea, 
defaultfound that stigma and discrimination against children with disabilities from parents, teachers, community members and policy-makers hinders their access to ed
defaultucation and protection services
default.
default 
defaultS
defaultimilar 
defaultfindings were m
defaultade through 
defaultresearch in Guatemala
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI
defaultt is also crucial to note that children with disabilities are more vulnerable in disaster
default 
defaultsituations
default, 
defaultand in these contexts are at increased risk of violations of their rights to
default 
defaultprotection, education and 
defaultparticipation.
default 
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccess
default to sexual and reproductive health services can be restricted for persons with disabilities. Disabled people are often assumed not to be sexually active
default,
default are not believed if they report sexual violence, and are often not appropriately involved in decisions about their sexual and reproductive health
default.
default 
defaultPeople with learning disabilities and difficulties can face additional or heightened risks: 
defaultsuch as
default, higher
default risks of sexual abuse, assault and rape
default,
default lower access to services, support, or redress, and forced sterilisation
default.
default D
defaultisabled children are also much more likely to suffer sexual violence and girls with disabilities are even more vulnerable.
default  Furthermore l
defaultack of access to sexual and 
defaultreproductive health
default services has greater impact upon girls and women.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor every woman who dies as a result of pregnancy related complications, some twenty others face serious or long-lasting consequences.
default Harmful practices such
default as 
defaultfemale genital mutilation (FGM), early and forced marriage
default, as well as poor sexual and reproductive health including high 
defaultand frequent fertility can result
default in disabilities including obstetric fistula and uterine prolapse.  
defaultCurrently an estimated 2 
defaultmillion women in Asia and Sub Saharan Africa live with untreated fistula.
default 
defaultA
defaultccording to a WHO multi-country study of 30,000 women on the obstetric effects of FGM, the relative risk of adverse maternal outcomes increased for women with FGM I, II or II as co
defaultmpared to women without FGM. Risks seem to be greater with more extensive FGM.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSexual Violencedefault: 
defaultThe risk of depression and anxiety
default is three to four times higher for those who have experienced 
defaultgender-based violence
default, and around a third of all survivors of 
defaultrape experience 
defaultPosttraumatic Stress Disorder
default.
default  Sexual violence can result in acute and chronic physical disabilities, for example 
defaultsevere pain during menstruation 
defaultor prolonged menstrual bleeding, as well as long term 
defaultgenital-anal trauma
default and
default sexually trans
defaultmitted infections
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPlan UK recognises the work DFID has done on disability in the last 10 years, DFID’s work has placed the issue on the global development agenda. 
defaultThis would be strengthened by a strategy 
defaultfor 
defaultthe integration of 
defaultdisability 
defaultissues 
defaultacross all its projects.
default DFID’s
default recent commitments on disability are welcomed by Plan UK as they are an important signal to developing country partners and other donors to pr
defaultioritise disabled people. Plan has seen this commitment through its GEC programme funding. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPlan’s GEC programme interventions focus on poor rural girls, within this group, girls with disabilities are more marginalised with 76% estimated to be out of scho
defaultol
default due to discrimination, stigma and a lack of inclusive education opportunities, adequately trained teachers or accessible facilities. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) approach involves the whole community to foster educational inclusion. Disab
defaultility will be mainstreamed through all interventions and accessibility needs addressed in terms of materials, communication and venue selection where relevant. It is assumed that 
defaultchildren with disabilities
default are even l
defaultess likely to reach the end of p
defaultrimary S
defaultchool and make the transition to 
defaultjunior secondary school
default, and therefore most of the direct support for disabled children with focus on their enrolling/re-enrolling in Primary.  
default&#xa0;
default5.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are early on in the programme but we have some lessons learnt already, including that working with children with disabilities in a rural setting is 
defaulta more 
defaultresource intensive exercise
default than anticipated
default. 
defaultChildren with disabilities
default are often 
defaulthidden by famil
defaulties, and to ensu
defaultre their specific needs are met requires specialist expertise and raising community awareness of  
defaultthe 
defaultrights
default of children with disabilities
default. 
default&#xa0;
default5.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCase Study:default 
defaultChildren with disabilitiesdefault pushed out of schooldefault. One 
defaultchild with disability 
defaultin Kailahun
default,
default Sierra Leone
default was a girl 
defaultwith albinism 
defaultwho had 
defaulta visual impairment
default. She was no longer in school. She had hoped to 
defaultpass junior secondary school three
default, and was determined to make it as far as the disability would allow. Then, she got pregnant. She told her 
defaultinterviewer, “Yes I have been mistreated sexually and physically and also insulted by my teachers and colleagues in school. When I decided to leave school it was because I was impregnated by some guys I didn't know. Because of my poor eyesight I can’t reme
defaultmber them, so they denied responsibility.” After she became pregnant the school refused to let her continue.
default&#xa0;default5.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultData: defaultThe 
defaultnumber 
defaultof 
defaultgirls with disabilities 
defaultreported in Plan’s baseline household survey 
defaultare 
defaultlikely to be much lower than 
defaultin reality
default. T
defaulthis reflect
defaults the lack of 
defaultdata available on 
defaultchildren with disabilities
default, due to their exclusion
default and the underreporting by community members due to stigma and lack of awareness. 
default&#xa0;
default5.7.

defaultAttitudesdefault:default defaultPlan’s 
defaultbaseline survey

defaultaround 
defaultnon disabled schoo
defaultl age 
defaultgirls’ 
defaultattitudes
default 
defaulton
default 
defaultthe
default education
default of children with disabilities
default. 
defaultA
default majority of girls believe it 
defaultis okay for children who have d
defaultisabilities 
defaultnot 
defaultto 
defaultgo to school
default. 23
default% of 
defaultgirls who have physical disabilities believe that it is okay for 
defaultgirls like themsel
defaultves 
defaultnot
default to
default get an education
default. This might indicate the way 
defaultchildren with disabilities 
default are treated in school,
default 
defaultif their colleagues do not believe it is important for them to be there, and more than that, are contributing to  perception of themselves as not worthy of 
defaultbeing at 
defaultschool.
default This also illustrates the wider community’s perceptions of the value and capabiliti
defaultes 
defaultof children with disabilities,
default much of the internalisation of these perceptions will start at a young age
default. And 
defaultdemonstrates the importance of home and family

default&#xa0;default5.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChildren with defaultdisabilities defaultfacedefault discrimination and abuse in school defaultNearly every single child with disability  interviewed in each district 
defaultidentified 
defaultverbal and physical harassment as  the main reason for lea
defaultving school. Many also said that they (or their parents) had brought the abuse to their teachers’ attention, but intervention (if any) had been ineffective. A 
defaultgirl with disability 
default in Moyamba noted “only my colleagues would disturb and mock me. I do report
default to the teachers so the teacher 
defaultin return will flog the people. M
defaulty colleagues laugh at me because I am unable to talk, so that made me drop out of school.” Some
default children with disabilities
default even described abuse from the teachers themselves
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOverall recommendation: defaultPlan 
defaultUK 
defaultis calling for DFID 
defaultto 
defaultdevelop an overarching disability inclusive development strategy
default, with focus areas including access to quality education, protection from violence and meaningful participation in decisions and 
defaultacross its work

defaultwith 
defaultchildren with disabilities 
defaultto focus on 
defaultthose most vulnerable 
defaultas a result of 
defaultintersecting inequalities incl
defaultuding gender and poverty.
default&#xa0;
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDisability strategy defaultPlan UK supports the recommendations made by the Global Campaign for Education and the Bond Disability and Development group for DFID to implement a twin-track approach to disability which would involve: 
defaultDevelopment of such a strategy must be done through a process of consultation with persons with disabilities, including children. 
default6.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnsure cdefaulthildren with disabilities defaulthave access defaultto defaulta defaultquality defaulteducation. defaultA quality education is one that is grounded in respect for human rights and gender equity, that is accessible to all children without discrimination, and one in which all children are encouraged to fulfil their 
defaultcapabilities.  It includes a learning environ
defaultment that is learner-friendly, safe and healthy for all children with mechanisms to prevent and respond to violence.  A quality education is accountable to children through the participation of children, families and communities in school governance and de
defaultcision –making. 
default&#xa0;
default6.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultActivities required to ensure this include 
defaulttraining
default for
default all
default teachers to ensure they can support the education of children with disabilities. 
defaultC
defaulturriculum adaptation and improved accessibility
default are also required
default, alongside raising public awar
defaulteness on the rights to quality education for all children
default and initiatives to challenge discrimination against children with disabilities within the school community
default.
default Children with disabilities should also have access to
default 
defaultearly childhood care and development default(ECCD), which 
defaulthas been 
defaultshown to provide immense benefits for children throughout life
default and to 
defaulthelp them 
defaultreach their full potential
default. Inclusive ECCD is also a critical pathway to education
default alongside the resources, both mat
defaulterial and capacity building needed to integrate inclusive education into all teacher training
default.
