default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMacmillan welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Health Select Committee’s inquiry on the management of long-term conditions.
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCancer is a debilitating disease and the effects of cancer can be felt a long time after treatment has ended. The National Cancer Survivorship Initiative (NCSI) is a partnership between the Department of Health and Macmillan Cancer Support, supported by NHS Improvement, which originated from the Cancer Reform Strategy (2007). As a result of work of the 
defaultNCSI,
default the long-term consequences of cancer and its treatment are now better understood. In addition, new approaches to meeting the needs of cancer survivors have been tested. 
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe NCSI’s work provides a strong evidence base for cancer to be considered as a long-term condition. As such, we were surprised that cancer was not included in the definition of long-term conditions set out by the Inquiry (although we note that the Committee cites a Department of Health 
default(DH) 
defaultdefinition). 
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur response to the Inquiry therefore begins with our rationale as to why cancer should be treated as a long-term condition. The rest of our response focuses on the importance of supporting people with long-term conditions 
defaultduring and 
defaultafter treatment has ended, and the importance of supporting people back into work.
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCancer is a long-term condition for those who are dealing with long-term physical and emotional effects from cancer and its treatment. We strongly encourage the Committee to consider cancer in its review of the definition of long-term conditions.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAround 1.8 million people in England are currently living with cancer. This number is increasing by 
defaultover 3% a year and the total figure will rise to over 3 million by 2030
default. 
defaultOne reason
default this figure is rising is that 
defaultmany more people with cancer are surviving, thanks to improved screening, earlier diagnosis and new treatments. Whilst it is extremely positive that more people with cancer are surviving, for many, the end of treatment is the start of poor physical or emotional health that can continue for years.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is 
defaultestimate
defaultd
default that around 20–
default25
default% of people treated for cancer 
defaultare currently experiencing a consequence of cancer 
defaultand its treatment 
defaultwhich has an adverse impact on the quality of their life.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe physical problems people with cancer develop as a consequence of cancer treatment vary according to whether they have received radiotherapy, chemotherapy or have undergone surgery. Some are worst in the first few months or years after treatment and may improve over time. However, other problems will not appear for years. In addition to these physical problems, emotional problems such as depression are common. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany
default cancer survivors live with other long-term conditions, either as independent co-morbidities, or caused by their cancer or treatment.
default For example, in the long term, people who have had chemotherapy may develop serious conditions such as osteopo
defaultrosis, heart disease and even
default sec
defaultond malignancies, such as 
defaultleukaemia
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe growing number of cancer survivors brings additional challenges in terms of understanding needs and how 
defaultNHS and social care services
default can best support them.
default 
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn England, 
defaultthe
default NCSI was launched in 2007, at a time when most of the focus in terms of improving cancer services was on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In contrast, one of the main aims of the NCSI was to develop services to support and enable cancer survivors to live as healthy and as good a quality of life for as long as possible.
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBefore the NCSI, there had been very little research on cancer survivors. However, we now know more about the needs of cancer survivors than ever before. In particular, we now have cancer survivorship figures at a population level, at a patient level and at a health service level. 
defaultData at the population level is vital to help with planning the levels of services needed at any point in the cancer care pathway.
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvidence shows that many of these cancer survivors have unmet needs, particularly at the end of treatment, whilst others are struggling with consequences of treatment that could be either avoided or managed. 
defaultImprovingdefault outcomes fordefault cancer survivorsdefault3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHigh quality cancer survivorship can improve outcomes in all domains of the NHS Outcomes Framework. However, it can also contribute to improved outcomes within the Public Health Outcomes Framework – for example, reducing people’s risk factors for developing other conditions – and the Social Care Outcomes Framework – for example, through promoting independence.
default3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe NCSI recently 
defaultpublished 
defaultLiving with and beyond cancer: taking actions to improve outcomes
default. This set
default out a framework for survivorship 
defaultoutlining the action needed at five key stages of the pathway
default:

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSupporting people with active and advanced disease
default3.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe document
default sets out what has been learnt on survivorship, including interventions to meet needs that have been tested and ready to spread across England. 
default3.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultU
defaultnderpinning the recommendations in the report is the need to 
defaultincrease understanding and 
defaultpromote a cul
defaulttural shift in professionals to
defaultwards shared decision making and supporting patient self management.
default3.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMacmillan encourages NHS England to take forward the 
defaultrecommendations outlined 
defaultin this report – aimed at commissioners and providers - to ensure that outcomes are improved for cancer survivors. 
defaultIt is vital that the new commissioning arrangements drive forward the redesign of aftercare to support survivorship.
defaultInformation and support from the point of diagnosisdefault3.10
default 
defaultAll patients and their 
defaultcarers
default with a long-term condition, regardless of its complexity, should be offered the opportunity and relevant information to help them develop a personalised self
default-
defaultmanagement plan with a trained professional or peer, which is integrated into the formal care planning process.
default3.11
default 
defaultEarly cancer rehabilitation is also important: it can prevent avoidable ill health and is more effective when provided early to avoid conditions becoming more complex and costly to treat later on.
default3.12
default 
defaultPeople with long-term conditions, including cancer, should also be offered support in considering work and education options at an early stage. This is discussed further in Section 4.
defaultPromoting recoverydefault3.13
default 
defaultPeople’s 
defaulthealth, 
defaultwellbeing 
defaultand overall quality of life 
defaultwill be greater if they get the personalised support that they need. 
default3.14
default 
defaultThe case for the “Recovery Package” is 
defaultset out 
defaultin 
defaultdetail in the NCSI report. The R
defaultecovery Package promotes: effecti
defaultve assessment and care planning
default, good communication through a “Treatment Summary” and offers education and support events (Health and Wellbeing Clinics) which inform patients about how to take care of themselves, what to look out for and who to contact if needed
default.
default 
defaultThese components are similar across long
default-
defaultterm conditions.
default3.15
default 
defaultProviding support and education to facilitate effective self-management where 
defaultdesired can have a number of benefits for the individual and the system. Individuals undergoing structured self-management programmes report improved health literacy and health behaviours, increased confidence in their ability to navigate the health system, better physical functioning and a greater understanding of the appropriate services available.
defaultManaging the consequences of treatmentdefault3.16
default 
defaultTreatment for cancer, although vastly improving 
defaultand expertly administered, 
defaultcan
default still 
defaulthave consequences that impact hugely on the ability of pe
defaultople to live meaningful lives. 
defaultThe recent 2
default012 
defaultDH
default 
defaultPatient Reported Outcomes Measures (
defaultPROMs
default)
default 
defaultsurvey highlighted some of these issues
default. For example, 
default38% of prostate cancer survivors reported urinary leakage and 58% reported impotence
default, and o
defaultne in five colorectal survivors reported difficulty in bowel control
default.
default3.17
default 
defaultFailure to manage the consequences of treatment can have a significant impact on patients and the system. Access to support for common health related problems caused by treatment should be routinely available and information
default should be
default given to people. Some services for intermediate or rare types of consequences may need to be 
defaultcommissioned through specialised commissioning. In all cases, some 
defaultkey principles should be followed: preventing or minimising consequences through healthier lifestyle choices and better treatment, informing patients of potential consequences, identifying patients at potential risk, assessing people through holistic needs assessments and supporting people through local care pathways. 
defaultSustaining recoverydefault3.18
default 
defaultPhysical activity has been proven to
default be impactful on the management 
defaultof long
default- 
defaultterm conditions associated with cancer and 
defaultits 
defaulttreatment
default, as well as reducing the possibility of recurrence of some cancers.
default 
defaultWe recommend that the DH ‘Let’s get Moving
default’ 
defaultpathway is routinely incorporated within cancer care pathways, and that ‘exercise on referral’ schemes criteria explicitly include cancer.
defaultRehabilitationdefault3.19
default 
defaultThe importance of rehabilitation 
defaultto the recovery of
default people with long-term conditions is increasingly well understood and supports the
default NCSI’s work.
default 
default3.20
default 
defaultAs more and more people survive and now live with cancer, early intervention and continuing access to rehabilitation can minimise the often predictable effects of lengthy treatment and the level of disability resulting from the disease itself. Closer integration between health and social care is also required to deliver excellent care and rehabilitation to people living with complex health needs. 
default3.21
default 
defaultWithout effective rehabilitation, at all stages of the care pathway, the benefit of treatment will be limited and the health outcomes will be diminished. 
default3.22
default 
defaultR
defaultehabilitation programmes are applicable across long-term conditions
default, and i
defaultt is important that 
defaultthey
default include vocational rehabilitation support (which is covered in more detail in section 4).
default 
defaultThe National Cancer Action Team recently published recommendations 
defaulton rehabilitation, including work, 
defaultfor commissioners and providers.
default 
default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCancer, like other long-term conditions, can affect many aspects of a person’s life, such as their ability to work.
default 
defaultIn the Mandate to NHS England, the Government made it clear that it expects progress in supporting people with long-term conditions, including cancer survivors, and in particular for them to remain in, or find work.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are 600,000 people of working age living with cancer in England
default. 
defaultAround 100,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed in people of working age each year in England
default. This means that, on average, there will be around 550 patients per provider per year
default for whom returning to work will be a consideration.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWork is an important part of helping people get back to normality after a cancer diagnosis and treatment. It has many other benefits, such as improving confidence and self-esteem, and it contributes to financial independence and material comfort. There is strong evidence to suggest that for people who experience ill health or disability, remaining in or returning to work can actually help promote recovery and rehabilitation, and lead to better 
defaultquality of life and 
defaulthealth outcomes.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSupporting people with cancer, and other long-term conditions, is also good for the economy. In 2008, Policy Exchange estimated that £5.3 billion in productivity was lost that year as a result of cancer survivors not returning
default 
defaultto work
default. As the number of people living with cancer is set to double over the next 20 years, this loss to th
defaulte economy is
default likely to increase.
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultR
defaultesearch show
defaults
default that the majority of people who are working when they are diagnosed with cancer want to return to work when they are ready and able to, or they need to for financial 
defaultreasons
default.
default 
defaultHowever, 
defaultthis can
default be difficult because people struggle with the consequences of cancer, such as fatigue and depression. 
defaultResearch also shows that people who have had a cancer diagnosis are 1.4 times more likely to be unemployed than those who have not.
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe main barriers that prevent people living with cancer remaining 
defaultin or returning to work are threefold: a lack of support from health professionals
default on working during cancer treatment or returning to work after treatment
default;
default a
default lack of support from employers; 
defaultand a lack of specialist vocational rehabilitation support.
default&#xa0;
defaultIncentivising the NHSdefault defaultto promote work as a positive health outcomedefault&#xa0;default4.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultM
defaultany people with cancer who are considering remaining at work, returning to their job or leaving it are given little or no information and advice from health professionals about the impact cancer can have on their working lives. 
defaultStatistically, o
defaultver half of people with cancer (
default60%
default) who were in work at the point of diagnosis were not informed by a health professional about the impact their cancer diagnosis might have on their working lives
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is essential that health professionals understand that work 
defaultcan
default help improve 
defaultan individual’s
default health and well-being, and that they have an important role 
defaultin helping people with long-term conditions, including cancer, make informed decisions about their working lives. Macmillan recommends that
default health professionals start routinely talking to patients about the impact of cancer treatment on their ability to work
default – in 
defaultparticular, 
defaultraising the issue of work early in the patient’s journey and signposting to further support where appropriate.
default 
defaultThe NCSI 
defaulthas
default produced guidance for health professionals on achieving positive health outcomes
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMacmillan 
defaultwants the
default 
defaultDH
default and NHS England 
defaultto pay
default greater attention to the role the NHS could 
defaultplay
default in helping more people get back to work.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.10
default 
defaultIt is also important that the health and social care systems work more effectively together. W
defaulte would 
defaultlike health and well
defaultbeing boards and joint strategic needs assessment
defaults
default to 
defaulthighlight and take action to address work support needs.
default&#xa0;
defaultSpecialist vdefaultocational defaultrdefaultehabilitationdefault supportdefault&#xa0;default4.11
default 
defaultAnother key barrier is the lack of specialist vocational rehabilitation services for people with complex problems who should be referred to a vocational rehabilitation service for specialist support. 
default&#xa0;
default4.12
default 
defaultHowever, t
defaulthere is 
defaulta sever
defaulte
default lack of appropriate vocational rehabilitation services in the UK
default for people with long-term conditions, including cancer
default. 
defaultMacmillan recently 
defaultpublished a report 
defaultMaking the shift: providing specialist work support to people with cancer 
defaulton the need to fill this gap in provision
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.13
default 
defaultA large government-funded review of vocational rehabilitation in the UK found that structured vocational rehabilitation interventions can be both beneficial to individuals and cost effective
default. However, since this review there has been little progress at a national level. In particular there is still a lack of capacity to deliver effective vocational rehabilitation for people with long-term conditions.
default&#xa0;
default4.14
default 
defaultCurrently, 
defaultNHS rehabilitation services, such as occupational therapists, tend to focus on hospital discharge only and 
defaultlack
default the capacity to prov
defaultide vocational rehabilitation.
default&#xa0;
defaultGovernment back-to-work programmes are more focused on supporting people on long-term benefits than people on sickness absence looking to return to work. Finally, occupational health (OH) service and private healthcare providers usually only provide vocational rehabilitation services to people working in large organisations and not all OH professionals are trained to provide advice on cancer.
default&#xa0;
default4.15
default 
defaultTo address the lack of specialis
defaultt
default vocational rehabilitation services in the UK, Macmillan, as part o
defaultf
default the NCSI, piloted a new model of vocational rehabilitation services for people with cancer. T
defaulthe evaluation of the pilots demonstrates that timely vocational rehabilitation interventions result in better work and health outcomes for people with cancer, and that they can be cost effective.
default Our work in this area also demonstrates that effective vocational rehabilitation for people with long-term conditions, including cancer, requires a combination of healthcare and workplace interventions.
default&#xa0;
default4.16
default 
defaultOur report makes a number of recommendations to 
defaultG
defaultovernments across the UK. In
default particular, we have called on G
defaultovernment
defaults to 
defaulttake responsibility for improving access to 
defaultand the availability of 
defaultvocational rehabilitation, and coordinating health and workplace support. 
defaultWe would like 
defaultthe
default 
defaultGovernment and NHS England
default 
defaultto 
defaultprovide more encouragement to NHS commissioners to invest in vocational rehabilitation support for p
defaulteople with long
default-
defaultterm conditions, including 
defaultcancer.
