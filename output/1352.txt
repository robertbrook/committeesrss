[[[ (WSC010)]]]Females make up 10% of the IOM3 membership but account for less than 3% of the Institute Fellows. The Women in Materials Steering Group was launched in May 2012 to raise the profile of women in IOM3, develop a network focussed on the needs and requirements of female members and have a dialogue with women members regarding mentoring, networking and education. The written evidence below is a summary of the responses to a an email sent out to all female Fellows in addition to recent attendees at the Inaugural Meeting organised by the Women in Materials Steering Group in April 2013.&#xa0;It is evident that positive changes have taken place in attitudes towards, and opportunities available, to women pursuing STEM careers. However prejudices remain and the ‘glass ceiling’ is perceived to still exist. Much of the problem still relates to the stereotyping of females at a young age, the lack of encouragement to study STEM subjects and the subsequent experience of working as a female in a male dominated field. For those with families the main obstacles are the compromise that has to be made when two individuals wish to pursue professional careers, the need for flexibility around childcare responsibilities and the cost of childcare. These could be addressed by the provision of affordable, conveniently placed childcare and flexible hour contracts. In all cases there is a strong need for transparency within promotion procedures and encouragement and support to enable females to climb the career ladder. The introduction of a mentoring scheme could help address this issue.&#xa0;The general consensus is that high achieving women often get overlooked for promotion. An observation is that women are less outwardly ambitious and less good at self-promotion than their male equivalents.  Often females will ‘’wait to be asked’’ as opposed to putting themselves forward in the belief that if they keep their heads down and do a good job, their ability will be noticed and promotion will follow. This can be interpreted wrongly as a lack of ambition or personal awareness of potential.&#xa0;The evidence is that visibility within the workplace can influence whether one is chosen for promotion. On this point, although technically the opportunities are equally open to men and women, and there are some very good women in senior roles, there is still a critical mass of managers who sub-consciously recruit those like themselves, which results in a series of management clones.&#xa0;&#xa0;If the manager is male, and works in a particular way or style, he will tend to promote those with a similar style that he recognises, rather than accepting that it would be possible do the job equally well with a different style. There is also the feeling of exclusion from certain areas within the workplace, eg the friendships between male colleagues and the accompanying bonhomie which can inhibit promotion opportunities if the female member of staff is not seen as ‘’one of the boys’’.&#xa0;&#xa0;Women can be more focussed than men on achieving a balance between their personal life and career and as a consequence are more often in a position of compromising one or both. The further up the ladder one rises the more “out of hours” socialising/networking is required. Women are poor at this and frequently have primary responsibility for children or elderly relatives - women prioritise these domestic responsibilities rather than networking&#xa0;It needs to be recognised that it is extremely difficult for two professionals to develop their careers equitably (i.e husband and wife) as both cannot necessarily relocate to take on new jobs/promotions. As the role of the female can often be seen as that of the main carer in a family situation, the female will be the one to compromise on promotion opportunities.&#xa0;The culture that ‘’employing women was a complete waste of time, since they will get married and leave just as they became useful’’ is still in evidence. This can be coupled with the male perception that ‘’all women behave in the same way as the most air-headed female they know’’.

[[[&#xa0;]]]Women are the child-bearers and parenthood can bring with it career limitations relating to the ability to travel abroad for work and less capacity to work long hours to meet impending deadlines, due to caring  commitments. This can compromise both work and family life. It is perceived that one of the key features an individual is judged on for promotion is flexibility and if they are tied to nursery/school hours, they cannot be as flexible as a person without those external commitments. If there is more than one child, the choice to stay at home is stacked even more in favour of not working due to the extremely high costs associated with child-care in the UK.&#xa0;Women can feel their career has stagnated since having children and can also feel that becoming a parent has put up further barriers to promotion based on the demands of the next career steps, e.g. international recognition if travel has been restricted. This can be seen as impacting on visibility and ultimately career progression which in turn can lead to disillusionment.&#xa0; Many women find that it is difficult to become a ‘returner’ and the longer they are out of professional employment the more difficult it becomes to return. Some may be the same age as their colleagues but they will not have the same level of experience. They do not have the same confidence as male counterparts and their honesty about their ability to return can be interpreted as a lack of confidence. For some women this situation is resolved by moving into other areas like HR where they perceive the demands to be less stressful.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Women are seen as leaving academia for a number of

[[[ ]]]reasons and their destinations are variable. For those who go into industry, to quote one respondent’’ There are clearly beneficial consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in a wide variety of different employment sectors. This generates wealth, growth and enhances skills in the broader UK economy. Although some graduates/PhDs will continue to be employed in technical roles using the technical skills directly, many will apply these skills to a broader business or public sector role which is also beneficial.’’An observation is that some females with a technical background move into marketing to take advantage of their creative skills. Others start up their own businesses or become selfemployed consultants offering specialist expertise but also giving them a more flexible approach to their working life.The Committee is directed to the following sources where data on PhD student destinations can be found http://www.vitae.ac.uk/CMS/files/upload/Vitae-WDRD-by-subject-Jun-09.pdf. Another report also lists a wide range of relevant data sources(http://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/career-choices-and-impact-on-graduates-report_tcm8-6388.pdf. &#xa0;University careers offices often hold destination data for graduates that could be examined.  One respondent decided not to study for a PhD after completing an MEng citing one factor as the predominance of male examples used within&#xa0;her first degree.&#xa0;&#xa0;Both parents undertaking joint responsibility for childcare is unusual. Traditionally it is still the husband who takes on the role of primary breadwinner and therefore the hours available for the woman to work need to fit around the timetable of first the child and secondly the husband – even when nursery care is available. The logistics of childcare provision and working hours can be difficult to balance. In general, it was felt that finding a job that fitted around childcare seriously restricted the hours available to work. As a consequence, women graduates often take on the role of teaching assistants, as the hours fit in with family life and school holidays. This can be seen as having a positive benefit in that this might be a way of influencing the next generation to at least embark on a STEM career.&#xa0;It was felt that the opportunity exists for reintroducing, to the workplace, STEM academics and graduates who are approaching the point where childcare responsibilities are diminishing. However many STEM graduates choose more locally available options as they lack confidence to return to the STEM area in which they previously worked. This is an issue for those returning to work after maternity leave as well as those who have been taking a career break whilst bringing up a family.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The problem of retaining females in STEM subject areas is seen as being related to the insecurity of short term contracts, the perception that future promotion opportunities would be biased against females and that they would not be treated fairly and as equals. The situation was seen as being further aggravated by the ‘two-body’ problem – ie the difficulty of two partners in a relationship seeking professional jobs in a similar geographic location; often compromise is needed and this tends to be made by the female.&#xa0;It was felt that guidelines on promotion opportunities should be transparent and visible forcing organisations to promote based on ability, not visibility. Women need to be made aware of career paths that are open to them and universities should evaluate all criteria for career progression to ensure they reflect women’s strengths and experiences. This could be facilitated by introducing CPD programmes so that where certain skill sets are required, these are identified early and training or other experience is built up as needed.One respondent emphasised that STEM careers are much wider than academic careers alone and that the higher education sector has a responsibility to ensure that graduates and PhDs regardless of gender are employable and consider broader options than academic careers alone. It was felt that gender stereotyping could be broken down by students at all stages from school onwards being made aware of the range of employment opportunities available and that schools and universities ensure that where possible they make women available at careers events.

[[[&#xa0;]]]The need for universities to promote family-friendly work practices to both male and female staff was recognised in addition to the need to develop a culture of flexible working. The latter would allow both flexi-time and the ability to work from home combined with term only contracts which would allow both parents to balance family commitments and work more easily.&#xa0;An overriding response was the plea for affordable childcare. There is little incentive to return to work if your entire salary is used to meet childcare costs &#xa0;There was also a suggestion that Universities could target more mature females.  It was felt that Universities tend to always target the young, and leave behind a large market of older people that they could tap into by promoting mature students, introducing flexibility in terms of study options and distance learning. The need for ‘one to one care’ of potential returners was identified as was the need to tailor courses to suit industry and career prospects.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Overall it was felt that this was a question to which it was difficult to respond.&#xa0;One suggestion was that there should be better careers advice from school and throughout subsequent employment. Based on the evidence that girls do better in STEM subjects when taught in single sex classes the possibility of single sex sixth forms was suggested. However as there appears to be more peer pressure against girls doing STEM subjects in mixed sex schools this may be too little too late.At University level the provision of more funding for longer-term fellowships was seen as the way forward. It should be emphasised that these would need to be advertised widely to raise awareness among all women in academia, and be open to both male and female applicants to prevent them being seen as a second-class option.&#xa0;The overriding request was for dedicated childcare facilities at academic institutions.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;
