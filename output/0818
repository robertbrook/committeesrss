Written evidence from defaultThe Work Foundationdefault (LTC 68)default&#xa0;default1. defaultWho we aredefault1.1 
defaultThe Work Foundation is the UK’s leading think tank specialising in labour markets and employment policy. We have a particular interest in how policy makers can help peopl
defaulte with long term conditions remain in the labour market, and have recently published reports focusing on long term co
defaultnditions such as schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, 
defaultcancer
default, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes
default and 
defaultmusculoskeletal 
defaultdisorders
default (MSDs)
default. 
default&#xa0;default2. defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;default3. defaultEmployment can be adefault beneficial outcome for people with a long term health conditiondefault&#xa0;
default3.1 
defaultEmployment rates for people with long term conditions are low, with many
default people being
default unable to
default either
default find or maintain employment. 
defaultIn addition, many people with long-term conditions leave the labour market prematurely as a result of their condition, though often avoidably. For example, people with MS leave work 18 years earlier than 
defaultthose without MS,
default 
defaultwhile u
defaultp to 40 per cent of people with rheumatoid arthritis leave work within 5 years of diagnosis. 
defaultThis is a serious issue
default, which a 
defaultcomprehensive review of the management of long-term conditions must consider.
default 
defaultEmployment
default can have an important positive 
defaulttherapeutic and economic impact 
defaulton the life of someone with a long term illness.
default 
defaultFor an individual, work can provide financial autonomy, self-respect, dignity, quality of life, and 
defaulta sense of 
defaultself-worth.
default 
defaultWhilst it should be recognised that in some cases employment is not a viable or health

default option for an individual with a long term condition, and 
defaultfor some it may worsen their condition, 
defaultthis is not universal
default, and should not be considered the norm. 
default. 
defaultFor many people
default employment has been shown to
default 
defaulthave a positive
default impact in terms
default of health
default. 
defaultFor example, o

default recent
default research on schizophrenia

defaultthat

default 
defaultWe believe that the NHS and the government need to do more to
default 
defaultaccount
default 
defaultfor 
defaultthe importance of employment in the lives of people with long term conditions. Although employment is a measured outcome in the National Outcomes Framework, it is not part of the Clinical Commissioning Groups Outcome Indicator Set (CCG OIS)
default.
default We recommend the
default Health C
defaultommittee investigate the feasibility and appropriateness of changing this, and look at ways to encourage 
defaulthealth care professionals to see employment as being within 
defaulttheir remit and as something that impacts on their patients. 
defaultUltimately, we have concluded that if work is not routinely regarded as an outcome of treatment then the incentives in the health system to promote job retention or return to work among people with long-term conditions will not be strong enough.

default.
default1. 
defaultAs the population ages, and medical innovations lead to higher survival rates, more people 
defaultof working age 
defaultwill have long term conditions. By 2030, approximately 21 million people of working-age will have at least one long-term health condition
default – as much as 
defaulthalf of the UK workforce.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultA rise in long-term conditions will result
default in a rise in co-morbidities - 
defaultwith people suffering from two or more conditions at the same time. It is common for people with a physical health condition to also suffer from some form of mental illness, and evidence suggests that there is an association between the two
default]
default, with co-morbidity increasing healthcare costs by approximately 45%
default. 
defaultThere is also evidence to suggest that co-morbidities are synergistic, and can interact with each other to make both conditions worse.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultMental health conditions
default are a particularly common form of co-morbidity
default.
default International
default studies have found that the 
defaultrate of mental health problems is
default higher in people with chronic physical conditions
default.
default 
defaultFor example, people with diabetes are 50% more likely to have some form of mental illness. It should also be noted that there is some evidence to suggest the reverse can be true as well- with mental health conditions exacerbating or worsening physical health conditions. 
defaultIn other words, the physical health of someone with a 
defaultco-morb
defaultid mental h
defaultealth condition is often worse than s
defaultomeone without
default.
default&#xa0;default5. Mental health and support in the communitydefault&#xa0;
default5.1 The recent Schizophrenia Audit found that a third of service users in England and Wales were not offered any form of psychological therapy, despite the evidence of such interventions 
defaulthelpinh
default 
defaulteith
default management of symptoms generally, as well as employment outcomes. This is particularly the case with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), which has been shown to help people with schizophrenia to return to and retain employment.
default 
defaultThe Schizophrenia Commission found that only 1 in 10 people with schizophrenia who could benefit from CBT were receiving the treatment, while our own research found qualitative evidence which suggested that either this kind of support was simply not available or that health care professionals were inconsistent in prescribing it, feeling that employment was not ‘their area’ or that whilst employment was a possibility for some patients, it would not be suitable for theirs 
default. Making employment an outcome in the CCG OIS would be an important step in changing this. Employment rates amongst people with schizophrenia are low- at approximately 8%. We believe that more could be done to improve this, and that, with the effective implementation of interventions known to be successful, this could rise to 25% within a decade. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2 We also found a lack of access to peer support workers in Community Mental Health Teams
default, despite the fact that they were the second most popular non-pharmaceutical intervention by practitioners, service users and their families
default. That this intervention, which is also
default 
defaultseen as having a positive influence on employment outcomes (for the service users and the peer support worker themselves) but again is often not available when wanted, and is not recommended in the NICE guidelines. Again, we would emphasise the importance of not focusing purely on the clinical aspect and symptom management of long term conditions. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3 Despite many of the people we interviewed as part of our research emphasising the importance of employment for them, they explained that their treatment was not personalised, with few clinicians asking what recovery meant for them.
default 
defaultThis often led to employment, an important issue for many people with a mental health conditions, being left off the table when it came to discussing treatment. We believe that recovery should be about more than simply symptom reduction, even in cases of severe mental illness, and should be about the whole person
default6. Effective interventions can combat unemployment and reduce the impact of long term conditionsdefault&#xa0;
default6.1 
defaultIntervening early has repeatedly been demonstrated as key to higher rates of recovery. This in turn leads to a quicker and easier return to the labour market. This is particularly true in cases of severe mental health such as psychosis, in which the first three years are a critical period
default. 
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default There is evidence to suggest that the Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) service model is particularly successful in prevent relapse and providing a useful intervention at this crucial stage. However, concern was raised by the healthcare experts we interviewed that the EIP model was being diluted due to funding and other pressures
default. We would argue that this is a false economy, given the long terms savings that EIP can provide in terms of employment outcomes, reduced suicide rate and a reduction in relapse and remission. In a report by the NHS Confederation it concluded that comprehensive implementation of EIP in England could save up to £40 million a year 
default. 
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default We would also encourage the committee to consider the strong evidence base for Individual Placement and Support (IPS) – a place then train model of employment support- which we believe to be one of the most effective methods of helping people with severe mental health conditions into employment
default. 
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default The Work Foundation welcomes the government’s response to the ‘Independent Review of Sickness Absence, and the
default 
defaultcreation of the Health and Work Assessment and Advisory Service (HWAAS). We believe that this service has the potential to make an important difference helping people to remain in work. This will lead to potentially better health outcomes, reducing long term costs to the NHS.
default&#xa0;
default6.5
default However, we were disappointed by the lack of reference to long term conditions and the recent response from Mr Hoban which stated that the service ‘will not be appropriate’ for people with long term conditions
default. As we have already argued, the government cannot afford to ignore this group. The government must ensure that people with long term conditions are given the support they need to remain in work. 
default&#xa0;default7. Medical innovations must be exploreddefault&#xa0;
default7.1 All clinical decisions affecting someone who wants to 
defaultwork
default need to be made through the 
defaultlens
default of work ads a possible clinical outcome. This includes decisions about use of medical technologies.
default 
defaultOur report on medical technology, ‘Adding Value: The economic and societal benefits of medical technology’ highlighted the conservatism in the NHS regarding the use of innovative medical technologies
default. Whilst the research looked at a number of different medical technologies, this research found that insulin pumps for people with diabetes were a particularly useful but under-utilized intervention. We found evidence to suggest that not only can insulin pumps have important clinical benefits, but that it has the potential to improve employment rates in this group
default. There was also evidence that insulin pumps reduced the likelihood of other co-morbidities such as blindness, limb loss and kidney failure from developing.
default&#xa0;
default7.2 We believe that this research clearly demonstrates a need to look at the long term impact of medical innovations such as insulin pumps when undertaking health technology assessments. Becoming too focused on short-term outcomes, not seeing the wider social policy picture, and failing to understand future benefits and cost-reduction, can lead to cultural conservatism when it comes to medical innovation. In a paper in December 2012, The Work Foundation – through its leadership of the Fit for Work Europe Coalition – examined the arguments for Health Technology Appraisal (HTA) taking a ‘societal’ perspective. This would allow NICE, for example, to consider wider societal and labour market outcomes when assessing the benefits of treatments and therapies. Although progress seems to be being made towards this goal in the current Value-based Pricing negotiations, we believe that ‘work as a clinical’ outcome for people with long-term conditions is more likely if HTA in the UK takes a wider societal perspective
default.
default&#xa0;default8. Conclusiondefault&#xa0;
default8.1 We welcome the Health committee’s decision to return to the subject of long term conditions, and look at the subject once again. This is a growing problem, for which the NHS and the UK at large must be prepared for. We urge the committee to bear in mind in their research the important role that employment plays in the live of people with long term conditions.
