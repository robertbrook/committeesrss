[[[Confederation of UK Coal Producers (COALPRO)]]]&#xa0;

[[[Background]]]The Confederation of UK Coal Producers (Coalpro) represents the coal industry within the United Kingdom, our members produce 95% of the coal mined in the UK from both deep and surface mines. The UK Coal Industry produced 16.3Mt in 2012 around 90% of which was sold into power stations in the UK. Coalpro is a member of the CBI Minerals Group.These sales would otherwise be replaced by imported coal as almost 50Mt was consumed by UK power stations in 2012. The industry employed just over 6,000 people to produce this output and although this has declined in 2013 following the closure of Maltby Colliery and Daw Mill Colliery and the collapse of two of the companies operating surface mines in Scotland we expect the figure to be well in excess of 4,500 direct employees by the early part of 2014 as some the operations in Scotland re-commence production. In addition to the power station market coal is an essential and affordable fuel for households which are off the gas grid (estimated to be 6 million homes) and of course is used by some key industries such as cement and sugar processing. One industry which has to use coal is steel-making as the carbon in the coal and the iron ore chemically bond in the blast furnace, in this case there is no alternative fuel and although the majority of the coal used in this process in the UK is imported there are some coals which are suitable in parts of the UK, notably North-East England and South Wales. Tata steel have a policy of preferring to purchase these coals when they are available, as they provide secure and local supplies with reduced costs of transportation both in fuel and emissions. The suitability depends on the characteristics of each individual coal seam in the mine and the mine must have other markets for the other coal seams it mines (principally power generation).

[[[Summary]]]

[[[Questions]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Coal mining in the UK contributes both financially and socially on a national and local level. Coal deposits are present in some of the more economically deprived areas of Scotland , Northern England and South Wales and the mines, whether surface or underground,  predominantly employ local labour. The cost of regenerating these areas after deep mine closure both in social and economic terms is well known to Government. In addition, local haulage and small engineering businesses depend on the coal mines, both surface and underground, for a large proportion of their turnover. A large proportion of rail freight traffic is from the transport of bulk materials, c35% in 2010 of all freight was the haulage of coal to power stations, UK produced coal accounts for about one third of this total. Track access fees for these movements make up a significant portion of Network Rail’s income.&#xa0;Case Study &#xa0;                            Kier Minerals Ltd Greenburn Surface Coal MineKier Minerals Ltd (part of Kier Group Plc)   currently own and operate a surface coal mine in the UK, the Greenburn Surface Mine, near New Cumnock in East Ayrshire. Reserves exist to continue until 2022.At the end of August 2013 the site has produced 5,492,000 tonnes of coal supplying English power stations by rail and contributing to an indigenous solution to UK energy security.&#xa0;The Greenburn operation currently employs 151 hourly paid individuals and additionally 48 sub-contractors are permanently employed giving a total of 199. Of this total 84 live within 10 miles of the site and 116 live within a 15 mile radius. &#xa0;Based on the above employment figures and using Scottish Government published multipliers, a further 160 

[[[indirect jobs]]] (plant hire, haulage equipment repair etc) are created, and a further 234 

[[[induced jobs]]] (jobs supported by direct and indirect employees spending wage).Source: (http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/Input-Output/Downloads/IO1998-2009latest&#xa0;These figure are in the context of significant unemployment of 10.9% (April 2012 to March 2013) for East Ayrshire which rises to 11.9% when considering males only, who are typically employed in mining. The wage bill in the last financial year was £5.73 million, the majority going into the local community within 15 miles of the site. Source: (https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038432129/report.aspxhttp://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html&#xa0;Kier have also contributed £1.54 million (end August 2013) into the local community trust which provides funding to local community projects and will continue to contribute on future production.  &#xa0;Kier Group plc has established a Non-Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Centre at Greenburn. To date the Centre has completed 116 vocational qualifications in level 2 Plant Operations plus 6 supervisors achieving level 3 awards. &#xa0;Further Example&#xa0;UK Coal Production Ltd operates a surface coal mine called Potland Burn near Ashington in Northumberland. The site commenced operations in 2010 and will extract 2.2 million tonnes of coal over its five year life, in 2012 the site employed 96 people of whom 82% live within 15 miles of the site. As part of a signed Legal Agreement the company has contributed £500,000 into a local community fund which is used to promote community benefits and amenities. &#xa0;All the coal from site is transported by rail to English Power Stations and has a much lower Carbon Footprint from both excavation and delivery than imported coal.&#xa0;&#xa0;The indigenous coal industry in the UK provides high quality jobs in rural or deprived areas, both directly employed in the mining operations but also in the supply chain and in particular the specialist equipment and plant required, and the maintenance and small engineering and repair sector. The coal industry employed over 6,000 people in 2012 and despite the closure of Maltby and Daw Mill Collieries in 2013 and the suspension of operations at the majority of sites in Scotland there are 4,100 employees at the end of August 2013 which we expect to increase to in excess of 4,500 during the next six months as operations in Scotland re-start. &#xa0;Supply chain jobs dependent on the coal mining sector are around 15,000.&#xa0;Mining consultants from UK based organisations are busy on coal and other mineral projects worldwide and particularly in India currently. &#xa0;&#xa0;The Consultancy services from the UK on mining projects are in high demand, and the fact that they are familiar with UK coal underground systems gives the competitive advantage that the deep reserves worked here give unique experience, compared with some other coal deposits worldwide.&#xa0;UK manufacturers were involved at the start of the mechanisation programme which changed the face of underground coal production in the 1960’s and 1970’s. The continuing development and improvements made to this equipment as reserves became deeper again enhances the design and supply reputation of UK based companies.&#xa0;&#xa0;In the coal sector, UK operations are all performed by UK based companies and very few have overseas interests. The presence of large mining companies in London offices does not encourage them to use UK based suppliers, and most mining equipment supply is now done by large global corporations, notwithstanding that, the engineering design for these products is maintained in the UK but some of the manufacturing has moved to China and USA.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[C]]]oalpro has no relevant information to enable it to make comment on this question.&#xa0;&#xa0;We believe the level of engagement with NGOs and communities in the UK is excellent at both a local and national level. Examples of the engagement are set out below:&#xa0;

[[[National Engagement - The UK Minerals Forum]]].The UK Minerals Forum was set up by the CBI Minerals Group in 2006 (of which Coalpro is a member) because there was a perceived need to draw together all key stakeholders, to debate and inform Government and the public on the prudent use, sustainable management and supply of UK minerals. The UKMF has a broad membership drawn from industry, regulators, NGOs and Government who sit as observers. It holds regular meetings and convenes working groups to research and report on critical issues. We believe the Forum is a good example of best practice in engagement between all stakeholders who have an interest in the UK based extractive industry.&#xa0;The Forum is submitting its own evidence to the Committee and further details can be viewed at: http://www.bgs.ac.uk/ukmf/home.html&#xa0;              

[[[Local E]]]

[[[ngagement]]]Engagement with local communities is enshrined within the land use planning legislation and the coal industry has for many years worked hard to be part or the local community rather than apart from it. In all cases the surface mined coal sites set up a Community Fund of which the local liaison group and the Parish Council decide the most appropriate use for the community adjacent to or affected by the mining operation. Site specific liaison groups normally include representatives of local residents, local elected officials and locally based NGOs. Further details on the statutory obligation to engage with local communities can be viewed at:

[[[&#xa0;]]]During any planning application and during site operations the mining companies work with bodies such as English Nature, English Heritage, RSPB, SEPA and Natural Resources Wales.&#xa0;&#xa0;After recent changes in both the deep mine and surface mine portfolio in England and Scotland, UK listed extractive companies with operations in the UK do not have coal mining interests outside these shores. The large London listed mining companies have no operations in the UK and thus have limited incentive to support the UK skills base. In its heyday, the UK underground coal industry was a key driver in providing the skills base for the extractive industries, but with its now virtual demise the number of mining and related training courses has dwindled to very few. Undergraduate degrees in Mining Engineering were offered at a number of Universities as recently as 20 years ago and graduates found employment worldwide.  The lack of a large indigenous industry also means there is reduced opportunity for students to gain practical experience or interest in mining operations.  The  recruitment of new Managers into the UK coal industry is difficult, and the path that formerly existed of gaining practical experience in the UK and then using those skills worldwide has disappeared.  &#xa0;The main mining related courses are now restricted to very few universities, such as Camborne School of Mines, part of the Exeter University and courses provided by Derby and Northumbria Universities  &#xa0;&#xa0;So far as Coalpro is aware there has been no contact to involve coal mining companies in discussion of the possibility of signing up to the EITI.&#xa0;The regulatory framework in the UK currently ensures that all payments made to local and central movement in the form of fees, business rates and other taxes and contributions to local infrastructure is done so in a fully transparent way, and the Group believes that there is no requirement for further regulation.&#xa0;It is noted from the press release dated 10th July 2013 posted on the EITI website that Business Minister Jo Swinson said …..“Under the EITI, extractives companies operating in the UK would report material payments to the UK government, totalling billions of pounds, who will also report the receipts it received. The payments of tax, licence fees and other receipts will be disclosed in reports conforming to the EITI standards.&#xa0;&#xa0;We seek urgent dialogue on the status of UK based extraction under EITI.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]Government should be aware that London listed extractive companies currently have global offices and operations, they might view any attempt by the UK to impose further regulation as restrictive and decide to centre their businesses elsewhere.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]If we wish to keep the core skills in coal mining and maintain our reputation as some of the best Mining Engineers at depth or the most efficient truck and shovel method surface miners then an Energy Policy has to be developed that allows coal-fired power stations to continue in operation until 2030. &#xa0;We believe there is too much focus on the short term in Government. There are long lead times, often at least ten years, to bring new mineral extraction operations on stream. They cannot be switched on and off, and once lost, the industry and its support infrastructure will be very difficult to get back. Energy minerals are vital to the UK’s energy intensive industries’ competitive position, the recent publicity around shale gas has led to the Government saying that indigenous resources help to insulate us from supply shortages and price volatility but the same thinking does not seem to apply to coal.&#xa0;We know that all fossil fuels require Carbon Capture and Storage as soon as practicable and are frustrated by the fact that it is now seven years since the UK’s first CCS competition was launched and so far we have not commenced any physical construction works and have spent very little of the promised £1bn for full scale demonstration of CCS.&#xa0;
