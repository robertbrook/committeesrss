"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by William Orchard, Orchard Partners London Ltd (HOT0067)&#xa0;My background in heavy and light electrical and mechanical engineering manufacturing of motors transformers switchgear turbines and generators coupled with my subsequent specialist area of heat network and heating system design and specification work led t\no my interest in utilizing reject heat from electricity generation and other low CO2 heat sources for the heating of buildings.  \n&#xa0;\nI \ninstigate\nd\n the Combined Heat and Power Association\n and \nadvised the Select Committee on Energy for their 1983 and 1986 reports. \n \nW\ne have \nworked with economists and other experts on more than six national energy studies and have carried out heat sector and CHP due diligence\n,\n acted for EBRD. carrying out due diligence for heat sector work and CHP and are thus familiar with a number of different models for analysing CHP and their defects.  \n&#xa0;\nOur most recent work \nwas \nan EU and EST grant aided research project \nto \noptimize \nheat ne\ntwork design to retrofitting our \ndomestic sector to heat networks\n.\n \n \nA \ndemonstration retrofit condensing d\nomestic district heat 500kW CHP inst\nallation for 423 flats in Lambeth was funded\n.  O\nur \noriginal intention wa\ns for it to be operated and actively manage\nd by UK Power Networks to \ndemonstrate voltage and power factor control as well as\n island mode operation\n,\n to partially secure local electricity supply under conditions of transmission failure.\n&#xa0;\nOur report sets out reasons why heat \nnetwork\ns\n \nwith \ntemperatur\nes\n of 75C flow and 30C return are likely to be \noptimal \nfor retrofitting the domestic sector for \nbase load operation where heat comes from steam turbine CHP\n.  We raise the temperature \n90C flow for supplies on the coldest days\n using \ndual fuel gas/oil fired eng\nine CHP installed to back up the 10GW of wind forecast for 2050.\n  The temperatures reflect current Danish practice and the heating system for the city of Odense where coal fired CHP is decarbonising domestic \nsector buildings\n with domestic gas boilers by co\nnnecting them to district heat.\n&#xa0;\nCan use of heat from power generation through combined heat and power CHP reduce emissions for the power sector?&#xa0;\nOn the 24\nth\n or August we submitted a letter to Ed Davey\n ref\n copied to Tim Yeo Committee Chairman, Phillip Lowe Director General for Energy at the European Commission, Professor David Mackay, and Dr Fatih Birol Chief Economist and Director of the International Energy agency\n expressing serious concerns about the \nana\nlytical methods used by the EU emission trading scheme EUETS adopted by the UK for Electricity Market Reform.\n&#xa0;\nA paper given to the International Association of Energy Economists which analyses EUETS, Dukes and CHPQA \nin detail was submitted with our\n letter\n.\n ref\n&#xa0;\nThe formulas signal a reduction in powe\nr emissions when \nwaste heat is used.\n&#xa0;\nThe formulas \nassume that this, now useful, \nrejec\nt heat has been generated in an\n “imaginary” boiler.\n&#xa0;\nThe imaginary fuel for the boiler is then deducted from the actual fue\nl being used for power generation to calculate lower emissions for electricity \nsector and their consumers\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe formula results in a \nserious \n“emissions” \nmarket distortion\n \ncontravening\n \nthe second law of thermody\nna\nmics.\n&#xa0;\nThis method was at one time used for \nthe UK statistics “Dukes” to calculate the fuel use\n for electricity generation from \nDrax when \nsome of the \nheat \nfrom condensing the steam that normally goes\n to\n the cooling towers, was \ndiverted to grow tomatoes,\n&#xa0;\nDukes retains elements of this methodology\n with its allocation of  \nany \nbenefit from CHP two thirds to the heat and one third to the electricity\n. I\nn practice no benefit\n arises for power production and \nelectricity consumers.\n&#xa0;\nDukes statistics \nare used as \ninput to other policy models such as Markal/T\nimes used by DECC\n.\n \nT\nhe Markal output \nmay be \nflaw\ned if the input is flawed. \n .\n&#xa0;\nEd Davey’s response\n \nexplains \nthat \nDECC sees no reason to calculate the fuel or the CO2 overhead for the respective heat and electrical products \nfrom \nCHP.\n&#xa0;\nIn our opinion such \ninformation is essential for any analysis or modelling of heat networks\n.  The following table \nprovide\ns\n information on the relative CO2 emissions from a selection of a sample of the heat sources we \nreview in our \npaper\n Ref 2 \npage 44\n.\n \nHeat supply options gross (higher) calorific value (CV) efficiency (eff)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSupplyDistribution losses&#xa0;\n DeliveredMethods of production and conversion.kg/CO2 per kWhAverage loss %CO2 Average loss kgkg/CO2per kWh Electricity from gas CCGT 48% (eff) gross CV 53.5% nett \nCV\n0.397100.0400.437Old gas boiler 75% (eff)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;0.255Piped heat from gas fired condensing 500 kWel CHP 34.7 % (el) (eff) 86% (eff) overall 48% CCGT counterfactual\n0.103100.0100.113Piped urban district heating from coal fired CHP equivalent COP \n12.7\n0.066200.0130.079Piped urban district heating from gas fired CCGT CHP equivalent COP 12\n0.033200.0070.040Piped heat from gas fired condensing 500 kWel CHP 34.7 % (el) (eff) 86% (eff) overall similar efficiency Peak Load plant counterfactual.\n0.001?200.0010.001Piped district heat from nuclear fired CHP equivalent COP 10\n0.001200.0000.001&#xa0;\nEUETS\n and EMR \nwould \nsignal \nCO2 emissions\n \noverhead \nfor heat from a CCGT\n CHP\n \na counter factual boiler of \n0.255 kg of CO2 per kWh\n. \n \nT\nhe actual CO2 \nemissions for the heat from \nCHP \nbased on its COP or Z factor of 12 will be \n0.040 kg of CO2 per kWh \nafter \nallowing \na \n20% loss of heat from the heat network.\n&#xa0;\nOur concern\ns\n \nare\n \nendorsed by\n \nArnaud Duvielguerbigny\n \nHead of Policy COGEN Europe\n \nwho \nwrites “\ncivil \nservants must first understand the flaws of the current system\n”\n. \n&#xa0;\nO\nur concerns \nare \nfurther endorsed \nin a recent \nreport from the EU Joint Research Centre in Petten\n \n&#xa0;\nOur response \nto Ed Davey \ndated the 16th of December \nRef \ncopied to \nthe committee include\ns poster identifying the relative merits of heat supply from CHP and insulation measures and the relative merits of heat from electric heat pumps as analysed today and by Energy Paper 35. \n&#xa0;\nThe EU Carnot method for analysing Renewable CHP.&#xa0;\nPage 16 to 18 Ref 2 explain \nhow \nthe \nEU Carnot \n“Exergy” \nmethod for \nthe analysis of renewable CHP disadvantages low temperature district heating by assuming it operates at 150C.\n&#xa0;\nWe \nfurther \nidentify an error in th\ne\n formula as when it allocates emissions the \ntotal emissions after allocatio\nn are greater than the \nactual \nemissions from the fuel input to the CHP.\n&#xa0;\nAnalysis of the formula for the EU CHP directive and thermodynamic superiority of heat from CHP compared to heat from electric heat pumps.&#xa0;\nWe analyse t\nhe EU directive which was formulated on the basis that CHP reduced electricity sector emissions hence the idea of good quality electricity from CHP and an incentive on the electricity production not the heat ill\nustrated in the following chart on Page 34 Re\nf 2                                       \n&#xa0;\nNote the actual primary energy savings for the heat sector are illustrated by the red triangles.\n&#xa0;\nThe EU directive signals \nthe savings by the blue line a combination of two different products where there are \nnot savings in the electricity sector only savings in the heat sector with the blue line showing the overall saving for the combined sectors.\n&#xa0;\nReject heat from electricity generation is a major energy resource always at a higher temperature than the enviro\nnment for its rejection in line with the second law.\n&#xa0;\nThis reject heat exceeds UK domestic gas \nenergy supply in quantity but \nnot in quality and exergy.\n Exergy allows the fundamental relative “value” of power and heat to be assessed and is an important conc\nept for optimal use of scarce fuel resources.\n&#xa0;\nCHP, a “Virtual heat pump” (ref \n &amp; ref \n) , can in practice decarbonize dwellings heated by gas retrofitted as at Odense in Denmark to the coal fired CHP and district heat \nwhere ten units of waste heat are up\ngraded using one unit of electricity.  The ten is directly\n comparable to coefficients of \nperformance for air source electric heat pumps of two to four driven by the plants electricity.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Coordination of Modelling of heat networks in DECC and the distributed CHP hub concept.&#xa0;\nWe have been researching where \ndomestic sector \nmodelling of heat networks is being \ndone within the \nDECC structure\n so our energy hub concept reviewed by Greg Barker can now be modelled.\n&#xa0;\nO\nur current information from Jon Saltmarsh \nScience and Innovation \nsee email exchanges, \nis not \ncurrently \nbeing done\n by his department\n or \nDr\n Roger Lampert and \nFern\nl\ne\ny\n \nSymons \nwho interface Ricardo-AEA for Dukes\n and other input on CHP\n. \nWe understand \nwork is\n \nalso \nbeing done by Jonathan Roberts \nfor the C\nhief \nEconomist\n.\n  \nOther work has been or is\n being done by various \nother \nconsultants \nsuch as ETI \nthe Climate Change Committee and their subcontractors.\n&#xa0;\nWe have found \nno consistent approach to the modelling of CHP \nand heat networks \nor its assumptions. \n \nWe fu\nrther found that contracts between DECC and external consultants meant that DECC officials do not have access to the internal workings\n and algorithms in \nmodels.  This applied to exchanges with officials in relation to work by \nRicardo-AEA\n for the department\n.\n Ref\n \n&#xa0;\nEffect of Real Rates of Return and lifetime assumptions on output from models.&#xa0;\nWe note\n \nRicardo-AEA use a 15% real rate of return for information feeding into the DECC Monte Carlo model.\n&#xa0;\nWe have noted Delta Energy use\n a 10% real rate of return to evaluate the heat infrastructure in their work for the Energy Networks Association and National Grid.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst one can identify anomalies in outputs from models\n such as a saving in the electricity sector with CHP or cost of he\nat from CHP heat network to consumers higher than cost of heat from gas boilers Delta Energy. One \ncannot\n g\nain access to \nmodel to \ncheck the assumptions that determine\n the results\n.\n \nOr \nwhether the modeller has cross subsidised electricity consumers from heat \nconsumers.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTo indicate how easy it can be to change the output of a model by changing lifetime and real rates of return the following table\n illustrates the effect by presenting the information in the form of an equivalent payback on the investment\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe w\nould as an example expect a low temperature heat network to have a lifetime of over 100 years and be assessed at the same rate of return as other infrastructure investments such as incremental insulation or investment in extension of gas and electricity in\nfrastructure or storage, funded by consumers.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOne can see that the \nRicardo-AEA\n 15% assumption will require the heat network to pay back with a lifetime of 60 years in 6.67 years for low CO2 heat supply.\nFor an insulation measure with a 60 year life \nevaluated at 3.5% for inclusion as a building regulation measure\n \nthe payback is 24.94 years.\nThe Delta Energy assumption of 10% requires a 9.97 year pay back on the heat network and a 7.6 year payback every time a new gas boiler is installed at the end of \nits 15 year lifetime.\n&#xa0;\nCurrently it appears \ndifferent models make different assumptions\n. \n \nW\ne have concentrated in this evidence on modelling areas where the boiler displacement \nmethod is \nused\n by modellers and the EU.\n&#xa0;\nThe Pathways modelling by DECC \nuses the correct power plant displacement method with an assumption of COP of 7 for heat from CHP and we note that the latest CIBSE guide AM12 also endorses this method of analysis.\n&#xa0;\nWe recommend that any modelling of the energy sector has a clear list of \ncosts and lifetimes for the elements that are modelled and where the model is dealing with CHP and its joint products a clear example of how the respective fuel and CO2 overheads for the two products have been calculated in the model.\n&#xa0;\nThe domestic sector heat load. The Low CO2 heat supply investment option networks to decarbonize domestic sector compared to investment in incremental fabric insulation. Low CO2 piped heat supply first better than fabric first due to large savings?&#xa0;Heat networks are the most\n common form of heat supply in the UK where water is the vehicle for carrying the heat from its source to its destination mainly to perform three heating functions. One to provide domestic hot water, two to heat the air we breathe the ventilation heat load\n, three to counteract heat loss through the fabric of the building the “fabric load”.\n&#xa0;\nOften the importance of the domestic hot water and ventilation loads are forgotten as well as the electric loads for dishwashing and laundry that can be met either from \ndistrict heat or electricity.\n&#xa0;Subject: RE: Percentage Savings and comparisons.\n&#xa0;\nDear William\n&#xa0;\nThis is a very informative way you have presented the calculation of the efficiency of CHP and insulation.\nIt also explains why the building insulation factories\n in e.g. Denmark do not like DH and CHP\nIt illustrates that there is a competition between the various methods to provide good indoor comfort.\nIt also illustrates why strong commercial interests in the electricity, gas and building material sector in gener\nal are against DH and CHP.\nThe consumers and their democratic elected representative are among the few who have interest in DH and CHP\n&#xa0;\nI have added some remarks to the calculation\n&#xa0;\nMed venlig hilsen\nAnders Dyrelund&#xa0;\nAnders remarks read as follows\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe \ndetailed spreadsheet has been supplied to the committee to illustrate why the low carbon heat sup\nply option offers such \nhigh savings compared to fabric insulation.\n&#xa0;\nThe relative impact of low CO2 heat supply and demand side measures is illustrated in a pap\ner to the solar trade association\n and its poster\n as well as results illustrated below from a retrofit for the future project.\n&#xa0;\nIn our paper we \npropose Modular Energy Hubs incorporating 500 kW-2000kW CHP, heat pumps, fuel and heat stores, with battery sto\nrage and exchange for Electric Vehicles. The Hubs optimize intermittent renewable electricity from wind and solar PV, minimizing electrical infrastructure investment for 2050.  Large scale solar thermal feeds the 75C flow 30C return heat networks.\n The conc\nept has been discussed with Greg Barker and we understand it will be modelled by DECC.\n&#xa0;\nWe suggest that when heat from fossil CHP has a lower CO2 footprint \ni.e.\n higher COP than electric heat pumps it should be treated as qualifying for the same incentives as heat from \n“renewab\nle” biomass and \nelectric he\nat pumps’\n&#xa0;\nThe paper submitted to Ed Davey explains that electric heat pumps \ncan \ngenerate higher CO\n2\n emissions t\nhan fossil CHP, where electricity for the heat pump is fossil-derived.\n \nAlso CO2 emissions when wood is burnt on a grate are larger than emissions from coal.  \nWhilst the sustainable element associated with the wood has to be considered current regulations b\ny treating its emissions as zero independent \nof the\n efficiency of the conversion of the wood to energy resulting in poor use of a scarce resource.  \n \n&#xa0;\nWRH Orchard December 2013\n&#xa0;\n Letter Edward Davey Secretary of State for Energy 24\nth\n August 2013\n IAEE conference \nPaper \nDuss\nel\ndorf\n \nEdward Davey Response\n 14\nth\n October 2013\n See document “OP relevant email correspondence heat sector CHP and Renewables 2008-2013 \n \nEuropean \nCommission Joint Research Centre Background Report on EU-27 District Heating and Cooling Potentials, Barriers, Best Practice and Measures of Promotion  Report EUR 25289 EN David Andrews, Anna Krook Riekkola Evangelos Tzimas Joana Serpa Johan Carlsson Nico \nPardo-Garcia Ioulia Papaioannou\n Letter Reply to Edward Davey dated 16\nth\n December 2013 \n \nProfessor Robert Lowe, UCL Energy Institute, London, WC1H 0NN Combined heat and power considered as a virtual steam cycle heat pump.
