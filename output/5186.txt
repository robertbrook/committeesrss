&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from the Law Commission (SLC0060)1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission recently completed a review of the legal framework governing level crossings. We published a report on 25 September 2013, together with a draft Bill and draft health and safety Regulations. We also published an analysis of consultation responses and an economic impact assessment. 1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Here we set out the background to this project, our major findings and a summary of our proposals. The full report and supporting documents may be found at: http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/publications/level-crossings.htm. 1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Law Commissions’ work is most relevant to the Transport Select Committee’s question: how should the legislation governing level crossings be updated? 1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We were asked by the Department for Transport and the Office of Rail Regulation to take on this project as part of our 10th Programme of law reform in 2008. The ORR had carried out a consultation in which stakeholders, including Network Rail and highways authorities, had strongly supported a review of the legislation on level crossings because the law is outdated, unclear, difficult to access and to understand. 1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A consultation paper was published in July 2010 and we consulted for four months, including meetings with a wide range of stakeholders and site visits to a variety of mainline and heritage railways and tramways. Policy continued to develop as a result of consultation. Both sets of Commissioners then approved the policy we had developed and gave permission to instruct Parliamentary counsel. Counsel drafted a Bill and Regulations under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. A final report was approved by both Commissions in the summer of 2013 and the report, draft Bill, draft Regulations, analysis of consultation responses and impact assessment were published in September 2013. 1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This project took longer than we expected for several reasons. The scale of the project was huge and wide-ranging, as is apparent from the size of the report. It involved intricate consideration of highway law and railway law, as well as land law, planning law, compulsory purchase, health and safety, criminal law and regulatory theory. The law in Scotland is fundamentally different from that in England and Wales in some places, for example in relation to rights of way. The project required close collaboration between the two Law Commissions. Each step of the project was peer-reviewed by both Commissions within different timetables. We also co-operated closely with a wide range of stakeholders. The end result was a 300-page report, containing over 100 recommendations. 1.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The terms of reference of the project were:“To review the law relating to level crossings, and make recommendations, with a view to providing a modern regulatory framework for level crossings and to simplify and modernise that law.”1.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The aims of the project were: 1.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is no reference in the terms of reference to safety. While a good regulatory system will facilitate safety improvements, we do not claim that our recommendations will directly, of themselves, improve safety. 1.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our findings and recommendations fall into three broad areas: safety and convenience; closure of level crossings and rights of way. Most of our recommendations are given effect in the draft Level Crossings Bill and draft Level Crossings Plans Regulations. In addition, there are some areas which we investigated, but did not make significant recommendations for law reform. These are considered in the final Part of the report and include: criminal offences; signs; planning law; barrow crossings and open crossings; and finally, the design of level crossings. 1.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We summarise our recommendations briefly here:  

[[[Findings]]]1.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We found that the legislation governing level crossings is complex and antiquated including:  1.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is not always easy to know which law is still in force and which takes precedence. 1.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, we found that the current procedures for changing protective arrangements at level crossings under level crossing orders is cumbersome and tends to lead to arrangements (barriers, lights and so on) remaining in place even when they are no longer the most suitable solution. This can compromise the convenience and efficiency of both the road and rail networks and inconvenience has a close relationship to safety. 1.15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We found that effective management of level crossings, and the efficiency of road and rail at the crossing, can be significantly affected by good (or poor) co-operation between the railway operator and the highway authority or private beneficiary of the crossing. 1.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We also found that the convenience of the railway tends to take precedence as railway operators are under no obligation to consider the convenience of non-rail users when deciding what arrangements are put in place. 1.17&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We considered the enforcing authorities and found that there is a lack of clarity as to when ORR is responsible for enforcement following road-rail incursions. This goes beyond level crossings and applies to railways more generally. 

[[[Recommendations]]]1.18&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We concluded that the regulation of level crossings could be simplified by removing other sources of regulation and leaving level crossings to be governed by the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, which already applies to the railways and to workplaces in general. 1.19&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We considered whether decisions should be restricted to the Secretary of State, as health and safety are reserved matters, but concluded that it was more appropriate for decisions about individual level crossings to be made at a more local level, balancing the local powers in respect of highways and roads with national oversight of safety. So we recommended that the decisions described below should be made by the Secretary of State in relation to England, Scottish Ministers in relation to Scotland and Welsh Ministers in relation to Wales. 1.20&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We propose four levels of regulation, with ORR as the enforcement authority.(1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; General duties under Part 1, HSWA 1974 including the duty on employers and self-employed persons to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that persons not in their employment are not exposed to risks to their health or safety. This includes duties volunteers on most railways, but we have also recommended the extension of these duties to heritage railways which are not employers. (2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Regulations made under HSWA 1974 (such as regulations empowering the Secretary of State to require a highway authority to take action near a level crossing, such as placing a sign or painting road markings). (3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Level crossing plans. Initially we didn’t think that any replacement was needed for level crossing orders, as the railway operators and other duty-holders are responsible for assessing risk and putting suitable arrangements in place which reduce risk so far as reasonably practicable. However, it was clear from consultation responses that those in the industry find it helpful to have a record of what has been decided. Level Crossing plans are agreed sets of arrangements for a particular crossing. They are optional, but once agreed, enforceable. We have drafted health and safety Regulations for making such plans, under HSWA 1974. A level crossing plan may be made in respect of any crossing, whether public or private, unlike level crossing orders which are only for highways or roads to which the public has access. (4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lastly, the Secretary of State, Scottish or Welsh Ministers have the power to issue a direction for the purposes of safety or convenience at a crossing. This is intended for use as a last resort or in exceptional circumstances.1.21&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Nothing in these recommendations changes the requirements on the railway operators to inspect level crossings, carry out risk assessments on a regular basis and put suitable arrangements in place in order to keep risk as low as reasonably practicable. 1.22&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In order to facilitate the effective management of level crossings, we also recommend: (1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; a statutory duty to co-operate;  and (2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; a statutory duty to consider the convenience of all users.1.23&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; These duties will be imposed upon railway operators and highway/traffic authorities. 1.24&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We also recommend that the delineation of the enforcement responsibilities of ORR and HSE should be clarified. 1.25&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We recommend that certain outdated or obsolete statutory provisions relating to level crossing safety should be disapplied. 1.26&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Closure]]] (Report Part 3)1.27&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Level crossings are difficult to close under the current law. 1.28&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A level crossing always poses a risk to safety and can be inconvenient to both road and rail as well. Network Rail and ORR are committed to closing level crossings where possible, but this must be balanced against the needs of communities in maintaining access across the railway. 1.29&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We recommend a new, more streamlined system for deciding whether it is in the public interest to close a level crossing with or without a replacement. 1.30&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The decision would be made by the Secretary of State, Scottish or Welsh Ministers who would be required to consider all relevant issues and decide whether the scheme as a whole was in the public interest. That would include:  (1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the safety of the public (2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the convenience of the public(3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the efficiency of the transport network (including the network of public paths)(4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the cost of maintaining the crossing(5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the need for the crossing and its significance for the local community (including the protection of heritage)(6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the costs and environmental impact of any works needed to replace the crossing or upgrade other crossings. 1.31&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We recommend a combined consent procedure, which provides for: the closure of the level crossing; the extinguishment of the rights of way across the railway; compensation; the diversion of any right of way; planning permission or other permissions required to build any replacement bridge or underpass; compulsory purchase powers and compensation for compulsory purchase. 1.32&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A closure decision would be subject to challenge to the High Court by way of statutory judicial review. 1.33&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, we have recommended health and safety regulations to enable highway authorities to be required to place signs, or paint lines or take other necessary action on the highway near a level crossing. 1.34&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lastly, there are areas of land law and the law of rights of way which are not entirely clear in relation to level crossings. Some level crossings were created by the grant of an easement (or servitude in Scotland) across the railway, others were created by model clauses from the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 in a special Act, and this has led to some confusion over how far the law of easements applies to these crossings. 1.35&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We recommend the clarification of certain issues, including: (1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It should not be possible to create a private right of way across the railway by prescription (long user). (2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It should not be possible to create a public right of way across the railway (dedicate a highway) impliedly. (3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Statutory rights of way should be treated in the same way as easements if the owner agrees to sell the right of way (and therefore close the level crossing permanently) to the railway operator. (4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In Scotland, some additional proposals have been made, including amendment to the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 to make it clear that access rights are not exercisable across the railway, but to empower Scottish Ministers to create new level crossings or subject private level crossings to access rights for the purposes of that Act. 1.36&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We provided a total net present value of between £717 million and £1,464 million, with £1,402 being the best estimate, over a 60 year period. This period reflects the life of the capital investment element of level crossing equipment. We have worked closely with key stakeholders, Network Rail and ORR in particular, to inform our view of the likely cost/benefit impact of our proposals. We have taken a conservative approach and have used figures that we considered likely to under-estimate benefits and over-estimate costs. Both the costs and benefits of a new safety regime are relatively modest when compared with the resource implications of a new closure procedure. 1.37&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The costs of the new safety regime are expected to be negligible and largely of an advisory and administrative nature commensurate with a co-operative relationship. The most significant benefit comes from savings from reduced delays and waiting times at level crossings following closure. We have also estimated reduced risk of catastrophic accidents/near misses. The safety benefits range from just under £1 million to about £36 million over 60 years. The low [£1 million] estimate reflects the possibility of there being no reduction in the probability of an incident as a result of our recommended reforms.1.38&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The costs of the new closure procedure are significant mainly as a result of construction costs of alternatives to level crossings, bridge or underpass. The costs and benefits of closure derive from the AXIAT model, designed by RSSB, which Network Rail will use in practice as a first hurdle before carrying out a full business case analysis of public vehicular level crossings. This model takes into account all relevant costs and benefits and produces a net figure. The net benefit estimates range from about £717 million to £1428 million over 60 years and includes operating and maintenance cost savings. Critically, achieving the maximum NPV value depends on access to sufficient funding in addition to law reform in order to facilitate level crossing closure.               1                            Level Crossings (2013) Law Com No 339; Scot Law Com No 234.               Level Crossings (2013) Law Com No 339; Scot Law Com No 234, Part 6.               Existing powers are discussed in para 3.5 of the Report.               S 68.               This is not a complete list of the recommendations we make on rights of way.
