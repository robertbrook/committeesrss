[[[ountries]]]. To date, we have provided lifesaving assistance such as shelter, food and protection to nearly 840,000 people in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt and Syria – over half a million of whom are children.&#xa0;We have focused our submission on the following points:&#xa0;

[[[1. ]]]

[[[Occupied Palestinian Territories:]]]The effectiveness of DFID’s programme in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, specifically: a) Aid effectiveness in Area C and b) Humanitarian space.&#xa0;

[[[2. ]]]

[[[Syria]]]

[[[n Civil War]]]

[[[:]]]The challenges faced by UN organisations and NGOs in gaining access to affected areas, and the implications of this for their work.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[a)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Aid effectiveness in Area C]]]&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Some of the biggest challenges to aid effectiveness and Save the Children’s ability to reach the most vulnerable take place in Area C, the 61 percent of the West Bank where Israel exercises full military control. &#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 150,000 Palestinians in 281 communities reside in the area, along with 325,000 Israeli settlers in 135 settlements and 100 outposts, which are in contravention of international law. The majority of Palestinians are low-income Bedouin or herders. &#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Donors, including the British government, have supported programming in Area C run by international agencies, such as Save the Children. However, agencies have not been able to respond adequately to needs on the ground due to constraints imposed by Israeli policies and practices. &#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Despite significant donor investment in Area C, deprivation has persisted. While Area C is the ripest area for development programming, with significant potential for the Palestinian economy, aid agencies have been forced to limit interventions to minimum humanitarian standards and at times have fallen short of meeting even this minimum.  &#xa0;1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Palestinian populations in Area C lack basic infrastructure and services. A 2009 Save the Children report found that the humanitarian crisis in Area C was comparable to that in Gaza: 79 percent of the surveyed households did not have enough nutritious food and dependency on aid had reached 84 percent.  &#xa0;1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Permit and planning r]]]

[[[egime: ]]]One of the structural drivers of extreme poverty in Area C is the permit and planning regime, which restricts Palestinian development to only one percent of the area. New structures, no matter how small, require permits, of which the large majority are denied or indefinitely delayed. &#xa0;1.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Aid agencies are also required to request permits, even for life-saving humanitarian interventions; however, many have stated that they will not request permits for their humanitarian work on the basis that the process ultimately prevents them from acting. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Demolitions:]]] In 2013, the Israeli army demolished a total of 663 structures in Area C and East Jerusalem, displacing 1,103 Palestinians, over half of whom were children. The majority of demolitions took place in the Jordan Valley region of the West Bank.&#xa0;1.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 122 of the total demolished structures in 2013 were funded by the donor community. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Master plans: ]]]Donors have chosen master plans as a means to engage constructively with the permit and planning regime in Area C so that Palestinian communities are allocated space for development of infrastructure and can eventually take on planning themselves.  &#xa0;1.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID has funded the development of master plans for a number of Area C communities. These plans are then submitted to the Israeli authorities for approval. It is assumed that once approved, construction will be allowed in designated areas. It has been five years since the first UK-funded master plans were submitted for approval. Out of the 96 plans funded by several European donors, including DFID, so far only 15 have received nominal approval, but with conditions that may be impossible to meet, such as linking public infrastructure networks to nearby illegal Israeli settlements. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Strategic planning for Area C by the Palestin]]]

[[[ian Authority]]]

[[[ (PA)]]]

[[[:]]] This is an alternative that has received support from DFID. This option is more promising as it envisages at its end point the transfer of responsibility for communities in Area C to PA jurisdiction, including for the PA to establish registration of land in Area C and to issue permits for construction, which donors would in turn recognize.  However, little diplomatic or political progress has been made in promoting this transfer of authority to the PA in Area C. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Humanitarian space]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Instances have been recorded where aid to communities affected by demolitions has been either prevented from reaching those communities or confiscated after delivery. &#xa0;1.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Israeli authorities have at times prevented access to beneficiaries, particularly to communities located in closed military zones. 5,000 Palestinians in 38 communities reside in areas that have been declared “firing zones”.  In these locations, physical access to communities is restricted. &#xa0;1.15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Given the inability of agencies to build infrastructure to support the sustainability of these communities, responses have been limited to stop-gap solutions, which are inadequate and fall short of meeting the needs of the population.  Unable to fulfil their mandate, aid agencies have been forced to scale-back programming substantially in Area C and some have even have had to withdraw completely. &#xa0;1.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; European donors, including DFID, recognise these operational difficulties and have maintained a dialogue with agencies on ways to overcome them. However, these efforts have fallen short of the concerted political action that is needed to ensure the integrity of humanitarian space in the OPT. &#xa0;1.17&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Gaza:]]] Israel’s blockade of Gaza has caused an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. The closure policy has had catastrophic consequences on the economy: unemployment rates have spiked (currently at 34.5 percent) and families have become impoverished.  Almost 80 percent of families are dependent on humanitarian aid.&#xa0;1.18&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The blockade has caused immense suffering to children and has led to poor health. Families are unable to buy nutritious food and are less able to produce nutritious food themselves. 10 percent of children suffer from stunting or chronic malnutrition. Most children in Gaza are affected by anaemia. &#xa0;1.19&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The almost complete ban on the importing of construction materials through Israeli-controlled crossings has prevented the construction of new schools. There is a shortage of 259 schools in Gaza. The shortage of schools has led to overcrowded classrooms, while schools have had to run double, and sometimes triple, shifts. &#xa0;1.20&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The blockade on Gaza limits the freedom of movement of Palestinians. Gaza residents seeking education or medical treatment outside have had their access prevented or severely restricted. One in 20 children referred for medical treatment outside Gaza in 2011 missed his or her appointment due to delays in receiving travel permits, three were denied permits and three died while waiting for a permit.&#xa0;1.21&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The water sector has been particularly devastated by the blockade. The UN estimates that Gaza may run out of water by 2016. The lack of capacity to treat Gaza’s sewage has exposed children to public health risks; there has been a noticeable increase in sanitation-related diseases in clinics serving refugees in the Gaza Strip. &#xa0;1.22&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since the Committee’s last inquiry into the region in 2008, little progress has been recorded and conditions on the ground have in fact worsened. Save the Children has seen little change in the British government’s resolve to press the Israeli government on these issues, in particular the development of Area C, protection of humanitarian space in the West Bank and Gaza, and free movement between both. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Save the Children is providing support to refugees and host communities, as well as non-Syrians fleeing the country, such as Palestinians and Iraqis. To date, we have provided lifesaving assistance such as shelter, food and protection to nearly 840,000 people in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt and Syria – over half a million of whom are children.&#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; On the threshold of its fourth year, since March 2011, the conflict in Syria continues to destroy lives and cast a shadow over the region’s future. Over a third of the population in Syria has been forced to leave their homes, and more than 2.3 million have sought protection in neighbouring countries. On average, 5,000 people flee Syria every single day. &#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since the beginning of the conflict, children have been the forgotten victims of Syria’s horrific war. Today, over 5 million children are in need of assistance, including over 1 million children who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. These children are at risk of becoming a “lost generation,” and must not be ignored.&#xa0;2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many donor governments, especially the United Kingdom, have been generous in providing financial support to help Syrian refugees; however, more is needed as the crisis continues to escalate. Last month, the UN launched an unprecedented appeal for $6.5 billion in 2014 to assist millions of people affected by Syria’s conflict – the largest humanitarian appeal ever. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[C]]]

[[[hild Protection:]]] Every day in Syria’s brutal war, children are being killed or injured.  They are also witnessing and experiencing atrocities that no one – much less a child – should ever see. One study of Syrian refugee children in Turkey found that two thirds of children interviewed had been in a distressing situation where they felt they were in grave danger, one child in three experienced battery, including being shot at, kicked or hit, and 75% of children interviewed had experienced the death of at least one loved one. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Recommendations]]]

[[[:]]]&#xa0;To help address the suffering of Syrian children and their families, DFID and other donors should scale up programmes that protect children from, and mitigate the effects of, exploitation, abuse and violence. To this end, we urge the UK government and other donors to ensure that: &#xa0;&#xa0;2.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Education:]]] Today, two-thirds of Syrian refugee children are out of school. That amounts to more than half a million refugee children; inside Syria out of 4.8 million children of school age, 2.2 million are not in school, and the numbers are rising daily.  While host countries are working to expand their national education systems, accommodating the large influx of new Syrian refugee students into the existing public school system has proven to be nearly impossible with existing resources. &#xa0;2.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lebanon and Jordan are facing particular strain – one in every four children in Lebanon today is from Syria. In Jordan, this figure is nearly one in ten. These numbers are expected to increase dramatically over the next year. Even when Syrian refugee children are able to enrol in public school, they face many challenges including isolation, differences in curriculum, and unfamiliar language. All of these factors contribute to high dropout rates.&#xa0;2.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Save the Children’s experience working in other conflict settings has shown that the longer children remain out of school, the less likely they are ever to go back. Save the Children is carrying out a massive “back to school” operation in Lebanon and Jordan targeting Syrian refugee children and youth in camps and host communities to ensure that children have access to learning opportunities.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Recommendations:]]]&#xa0;Long-term plans must be developed immediately to educate Syrian refugee children so that they can reach their full potential and have hope for a better future. DFID and other donors should do the following: &#xa0;2.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Coordinating support to countries hosting refugees across the Syrian border]]]

[[[: ]]]Until a political solution is found, many vulnerable Syrian children and families will continue to escape the conflict and seek sanctuary in neighbouring countries. It is therefore essential that neighbouring countries receive the support they need to keep their borders open. &#xa0;2.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Effective coordination mechanisms and common and comparable targeting criteria are needed across all countries in the region, and in all sectors, to ensure that the most vulnerable people in all affected communities are assisted and protected, regardless of whether they are registered or non-registered refugees, returnees, Palestinians, Roma or members of host communities. This should be accompanied by proactive outreach to ensure marginalised groups do not fall through the net.&#xa0;2.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Across the region, almost 80% of Syria’s refugees do not live in camps, but instead live with family or friends or in informal settlements. Special attention must be paid to these host communities to help them deal with the refugee influx and its resulting strain on community resources.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Access inside Syria: ]]]The UK Government has been helpful in consistently pushing for unfettered access and in providing increasingly flexible support for complex aid programmes in a very difficult operating environment.&#xa0;2.15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We welcome DFID’s strong engagement with the High-Level Group tasked with overseeing implementation of the UN Security Council’s Presidential Statement (PRST) on access and protection. DFID should continue to support the efforts of OCHA and others to collate evidence and data on access constraints, including for cross-border aid, in order to make the case as strongly as possible for unfettered access.&#xa0;2.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We hope that the UK will continue to argue the humanitarian case internationally, e.g. supporting a call for a UN resolution specifically on humanitarian access if it is concluded that the PRST has failed.&#xa0;2.17&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; So far, the UN has only assessed needs from Damascus, thus failing to present an accurate picture of needs and gaps in provision in non-Government-held areas. The not-yet published Syria Integrated Needs Assessment (SINA), led by UNOCHA, provides an in-depth analysis of the needs in the eight governorates of northern Syria and is therefore a very welcome milestone toward achieving a ‘whole of Syria’ picture. The SINA now needs a corresponding response plan, including associated costs, for donors to fund. &#xa0;2.18&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Save the Children is championing a 3-point plan to protect Syria’s children, which we urge the UK Government to endorse:&#xa0;1&#xa0; OCHA (2013), Area C of the West Bank: key humanitarian concerns http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_area_c_factsheet_January_2013_english.pdf World Bank (2013), Area C and the Future of the Palestinian Economy http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2013/10/07/palestinians-access-area-c-economic-recovery-sustainable-growth Save the Children (2009), Life on the Edge: the struggle to survive and the impact of forced displacement in high risk areas of the occupied Palestinian territory http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/English_Research_Report_with_Cover_low_res_1.pdf  UN OCHA (2009), Restricting Space: the planning regime applied by Israel in Area C of the West Bank http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/special_focus_area_c_demolitions_december_2009.pdf Figures provided to Save the Children by UN OCHA  Oxfam (2012), On the Brink: Israeli settlements and their impact on Palestinians in the Jordan Valley http://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/bp160-jordan-valley-settlements-050712-en_1.pdf Figures provided to Save the Children by UN OCHA UN OCHA (2013), The Gaza Strip: humanitarian impact of movement restrictions on people and goods http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_gaza_blockade_factsheet_july_2013_english.pdf ibid Save the Children &amp; Medical Aid for Palestinians (2012), Falling behind: the effect of the blockade on child health in Gaza http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/Gazas-Children-Falling-Behind.pdf Gisha (2013), Gaza Cheat Sheet http://www.gisha.org/content-moduls.asp?lang_id=en&amp;p_id=1232 Save the Children &amp; Medical Aid for Palestinians (2012), Falling behind: the effect of the blockade on child health in Gaza http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/Gazas-Children-Falling-Behind.pdf UN (2012) Gaza in 2020: a liveable place? http://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/press-releases/gaza-2020-liveable-place  Save the Children &amp; Medical Aid for Palestinians (2012), Falling behind: the effect of the blockade on child health in Gaza http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/Gazas-Children-Falling-Behind.pdf UNHCR (2014), http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php  UNHCR (2013), http://www.unhcr.org/522495669.html  UNICEF (2013), http://www.unicef.org/media/media_70225.html  This appeal includes $4.2 billion to meet the humanitarian needs of a projected total of 4.1 million refugees and 2.7 million people living in host communities.
