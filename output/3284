defaultWritten evidence from Royal College of Surgeons (PEX 0003)default&#xa0;
defaultIntroductiondefault1.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Royal College of Surgeons’ 
default(RCS) 
defaultprime responsibility is 
defaultto maintain and improve
default surgical standards to deliver high quality patient care. 
defaultIn t
defaulthis evidence to the Health Select Committee 
defaultwe 
defaulttherefore 
defaultfocus 
defaulton our concerns about where financially-driven decisions are undermining patient safety and the quality of care. We also set out 
defaultou
defaultr views on 
defaulthow to 
defaultmake
default cost-saving measures
default more transparent
default, and what the RCS is doing to support commissioners. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultReports show the
default NHS is generally performing well on certain measurable indicators despite the financial pressures facing the health
default service.
default2.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe RCS is realistic about the financial challenges facing the health service
default and we recognise tough decisions will need to be made about what the NHS can fund
default. While our role is to promote good standards of care, our members are keen to work wit
defaulth commissioners and providers to save money 
defaultwithout undermining patient care
default.
default2.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultNevertheless, we are 
defaultconcerned by
default factual and anecdotal evidence that commissioners are rationing clinical
defaultly
default necessary services. 
defaultThis is likely to increase as commissioners and providers look to achieve short-term savings 
defaultas budgets decrease and they exhaust 
defaultnon-recurrent and contractual savings. 
default2.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultData published exclusively on the RCS website shows wide variations across CCG areas i
defaultn the number of 
defaultage and sex standardised 
defaultprocedures being performed 
defaultper 100,000 population 
defaultfor some surgical interventions. For example, there is large variation in activ
defaultity volumes for tonsillectomies. This suggests 
defaultsome commissioners 
defaultand/or clinicians ma
defaulty be rationing services and others over-relying on surgical interventions. 
default2.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe RCS and the surgical speciality associations are playing their part to reduce 
defaultunexplained
default variations in services. We 
defaulthave published, 
defaultthrough a NICE accredited process
default and funde
defaultd by NHS England,
default surgical service commissioning guidance on our online commissioning centre
default which will cover 
default28
default areas. Our guidance
default provides advice on best practice referral procedures
default and broader commissioning support
default which is designed to
default help commissio
defaultners to 
defaultbetter understand local activity volumes
default and assess when surgical or non-surgical interventions may be more appropriate. 
defaultThis 
defaulthelps the NHS to seek value and 
defaultpatients t
defaulto be treated in the right place. 
default2.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCCGs are required by law to publish their poli
defaultcies on providing medicines, surgical procedures and other techniques and interventions. We are therefore concerned that many CCGs have still not published this information. We would like the Government and NHS England to remind CCGs that this is a legal r
defaultequirement. 
defaultThe RCS is also keen to 
defaultsee more transparency about education and training budgets. 
default2.7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultRecent reports from the National Audit Office and Monitor have made clear that redesigning services is essential for extracting large-scale savings from the system. 
defaultHowever, we caution against 
defaultfinancially driven service changes
default. Clinically-driven changes c
defaultan save money, but the priority should be 
defaulton improving patient care. We must not sacrifice safety 
defaultfor 
defaultsavings
default. 
default2.8.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Committee should clarify how the Government intends to fund the £3.8bn integrated care pilots and where in the system this money will come f
defaultrom.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default3.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important to acknowledge that, as the National Audit Office has set out
default, the NHS is generally performing well on certain measureable indicators (such as referral to treatment waiting times) despite the unpreced
defaultented financial pressures facing the health service. 
defaultSimilarly, the recent publication of surgical outcomes data shows the vast majority of surgeons in England are performing to high standards with few falling outside expected mortality rates. These achiev
defaultements should not be underestimated. 
default3.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDespite such successes, the College is aware of factual evidence and anecdotal information from our members which indicates 
defaultsome
default NHS commissioners are rationing clinically necessary services. 
defaultThere may also be misunder
defaultstanding from clinicians about when some surgical procedures are appropriate
default. 
defaultRestrictions on access to surgery can affect the outcomes of surgery and patient safety, with evidence that patients are less mobile and suffer more pain if their operation is d
defaultelayed or denied. For example:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThese findings are despite the fact that the Government has repeatedly said restrictions should be b
defaultased on clinical and not financial criteria:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA 2012
default National Audit Office 
default(NAO) 
defaultreport
default notes that NHS savings so far have been primarily generated through 
defaultshort-term 
defaultcontractual levers 
defaultapplied by the Department
default rather than savings extracted through redesigning services
default or preventing ill-health
default. 
defaultA more recent 
default2013 NAO report 
defaultalso 
defaulthighlights that a number of trusts and commissioners in 2012-13 received non-recurrent financial support to 
defaultal
defaultlow
default them to break-even.  
default4.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs 
defaultMPs
default will have noted, the Government’s recent comprehensive spending review proposed shifting further funding from the NHS to social care after 2015. Sir David Nicholson, Chief Executive of NHS England, has indicated that this t
defaultransfer of funds would mean ‘radical changes’ to hospitals as ‘there is nowhere else to take it from’
default. The Nuffield Trust have also indicated that the funding gap facing the NHS could grow to as much as £44-54 billion in 2021/22. 
default4.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultClearly the unprecedente
defaultd scale of the financial challenge facing both the NHS and social care 
defaultwill
default create significant challenges 
defaultthat
default will involve tough decisions about how best to use a decreasing budget. 
defaultGiven the current reliance on 
defaultcontractual and 
defaultnon-recurrent savings
default – and
default the difficulty in redesigning services ahead of an election – there is a danger that further rationing of clinically necessary services and treatments will take place in the near future as commissioners look for other short-term ways of saving money. 
default4.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default RCS strongly believes that p
defaultatients’ access to treatment should be driven by need based on clinical assessment, and must not be compromised by financial pressure. Most methods to restrict access to surgery use unproven and arbitrary thresholds which unfai
defaultrly deny patients some of the most successful operations which vastly improve quality of life. Efficiency must not lead to shortcuts on quality and patient safety.
default4.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe RCS and the surgical specialty associations are also playing their part to work alongsid
defaulte commissioners to reduce 
defaultunexplained
default variations in services. We have published – through a NICE accredited process – surgical service commissioning guidance on our online commissioning centre
default which has been funded by NHS England
default. This will eventually cov
defaulter approximately twenty eight surgical areas. Our guidance and broader commissioning support aim to improve the health and wellbeing of patients
default and
default reduce unexplained clinical variation of surgical services.
default4.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe guidance does not promote unnecessary surge
defaultry but looks to promote best 
defaultclinical 
defaultpractice
default and help patients to be treated in the right setting
default – thus seeking good care for patients and value for the NHS
default. 
defaultFor example, the guidance on tonsillectomy produced by the RCS and ENT UK only recommends 
defaultreferral if there have been 7 or more clinically significant, adequately treated sore throats in the preceding 12 months or 5 or more episodes in each of the preceding two years, or 3 or more in each of the preceding three years.
default Similarly, the guidance on
default foreskin conditions highlights the number of unnecessary referrals to secondary care. 
default4.7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultExamples of how commissioners can directly save money are also provided. For instance, our guidance on rectal bleeding highlights 
defaultclinically effective 
defaultdiagnostic tools 
defaultthat can save £390 per diagnosis. 
default4.8.
default&#xa0; 
defaultCommissioners should 
defaultcontinue to 
defaultreduce access to clinically unnecessary procedures. The ‘Clinical responses to the Downturn’
default report in 2010, which brought together NHS managers and clinicians, set out some areas for pot
defaultential savings. Many of our commissioning guidance documents also describe patient pathways where a non-surgical, rather than a surgical proc
defaultedure, may be more appropriate. This 
defaultaims to
default help commissioners to design appropriate care pathways and inform deci
defaultsions about 
defaultwhen
default procedures may have low clinical value. 
default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Health and Social Care Act 2012 requires clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and the NHS Commissioning Board ‘to have regard to’ NICE’s quality standards. These will set out aspirational but achievable areas for quality improvement in a defined care o
defaultr service 
defaultarea, including for obesity. However, they will not be mandatory and it remains to be seen how the legal duty to ‘have regard to’ will be interpreted locally. 
default5.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe support the Department of Health’s decision to require CCGs to publish their level 
defaultof compliance with NICE technology appraisals
default. However, it is important to note that NICE technology appraisals only cover a small proportion of the services provided by the NHS so rationing of clinically necessary services may still occur. For example, N
defaultICE guidance on bariatric surgery is not classified as a technology appraisal so there is therefore no legal requirement on the NHS to fund bariatric surgery despite its proven clinical effectiveness.
default5.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment legislation
default also requires CCGs to publish p
defaultolicies on providing medicines, medical devices, diagnostic techniques, surgical procedures, or other therapeutic interventions. This should 
defaulthelp to 
defaultimprove transparency around rationing decisions. However, while this was a legal requirement from 1 April, 
defaultwe are concerned that many CCGs have still not published this information. 
defaultWe would like the Government and NHS England to remind CCGs that this is a legal requirement.default 
default&#xa0;
default6.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
default2012 
defaultNAO report argued that ‘Service transformation is key to making future savings, but only limited action has been taken to date’. We agree that service transformation has been slow. To an extent, health service staff must take some responsibility for slow p
defaultrogress on reshaping services. Too many reconfigurations have failed to win the support of doctors, nurses or the public. Consultations have sometimes been a loaded tick-box exercise designed to secure token support, rather than engage in a genuine convers
defaultation with the public. We must ensure the public understands the substantial clinical benefits that can be achieved, while addressing natural concerns regarding the availability of emergency care and transportation issues. We also agree with the report’s r
defaultecommendation that the DH and the NHS Commissioning Board should work with the NHS to reduce barriers to transforming services. 
default6.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, as the College made clear in ‘
defaultR
defaulteshaping surgical services
default’
default – published earlier this year – 
defaultit is essential that any service change is based defaultprimarily defaulton clinical evidence, not purely financial motivesdefault especially where that may lead to a reduction in available services. 
defaultMany clinical
defaultly-driven service changes will improve outcomes and should help to reduce long-term costs.
default6.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a strong clinical case for reshaping some surgical services. Scientific and medical advancements mean it is no longer necessary or appropriate to deliver ce
defaultrtain operations or procedures in acute hospital settings. At the same time we know from the comprehensive evidence currently available that for many procedures and conditions concentrating specialist surgical services into fewer, larger centres of excelle
defaultnce can improve outcomes, and often save lives.  
default6.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs we get closer to an election in 2015 there is a danger that some service changes will be swept up in election campaigning. It is important for politicians to engage with the clinical case for reshaping s
defaultervices, as much as public concerns, and take leadership to support solutions that improve patient treatment and care. Once a decision has been made, it should be quickly implemented as delays will affect future planning of services. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSeven-day servicesdefault6.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe RCS strongly supports the need for seven-day services. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges will shortly be publishing a report from a taskforce, chaired by our President Professor Norman Williams, that will set out how to help achieve this. 
default6.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultMany cons
defaultultant surgeons already work at weekends, and many come in to see patients on whom they have operated in the previous week, but they cannot work effectively if the back-up services, such as pharmacy and physiotherapy are not there.
default&#xa0;
default We also need access 
defaultto 
defaultradiology and pathology services so that decisions on a patient’s care can be made at the right point. When a doctor does a ward round, they rely on the whole team behind them, including administration support. That support also extends in to the community
default, where we need to integrate with social care services so a patient can return home to be cared for when they no longer require a hospital bed.
default6.7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, all of this will cost the NHS money. While, in the long-term, some money might be saved through more ef
defaultficient use of facilities; better outcomes of care; and changes to the way services are provided, there are likely to be some short-term costs involved
default such as providing staff with time off in lieu
default. Increasingly, the NHS will need to have an honest convers
defaultation with the public about 
defaultwhat should be funded and it may be necessary to reshape services to ensure seven-day services can be delivered.
default&#xa0;
defaultFunding integrated caredefault6.8.
default&#xa0; 
defaultEarlier in the year, health minister Norman Lamb MP invited local areas to bid for 
defaulta slice of the proposed £3.8 billion funding to run integrated care pilots. 
default6.9.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is broad agreement in the health sector that integration between and within services needs to improve. However, given there is no proposed extra cash available, it is unclea
defaultr where the funding for these pilots will come 
defaultfrom
default and 
defaultwe encourage the Health Select Committee to seek clarification from the Governmentdefault. It would be unfortunate if a move designed to improve care for patients diverted money away from other 
defaultclinically 
defaultes
defaultsential care.
default&#xa0;
defaultTariff fundingdefault6.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are a number of examples of how financial incentives in the system can help to transform service
defaults and patient care
default. For instance, hospitals are now financially rewarded for treating patients within 48 hours of a hip fracture which has helped to promulgate best practice. 
default6.11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMonitor recently announced that the 2014/15 tariff will better link payment for hip and knee repla
defaultcements to outcomes, and encourage participation in the national joint registry. We believe this approach could be applied to further surgical areas.
default 
default6.12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAcross London
default,
default commissioners have used CQUIN payments to incentivise the roll out of enhanced recovery pr
defaultogrammes. These aim to improve a patient’s recovery after surgery through better pre and post operation planning and assessment, reducing the physical stress of the operation, and improving pain relief during and after operations. 
defaultThere is also some eviden
defaultce they reduce costs. For example, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust said they saved £44,000 over eleven months for providing better support for patients undergoing lung cancer surgery
default. 
defaultGiven the wealth of evidence in support of enhanced recovery prog
defaultrammes, t
defaulthe RCS believes similar local programmes should be rolled out
default through financial incentives. The NHS has sometimes been slow to adopt new innovations, and incentives – when used appropriately – 
defaultshould be used
default to 
defaulthelp 
defaultspread clinical best practice.
default&#xa0;
defaultMonitor’s proposals for orthopaedic and cardiac surgerydefault6.13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA recent report from Monitor ‘Closing the NHS funding gap’ set out a number of proposals to save money in the NHS. This included applying the ‘Aravind
default Eye Care’ approach in India to orthopaedic and cardiac surgery which Monitor claims would save the NHS £1.1 billion a year. 
default6.14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile we agree surgeons should look for ways to improve productivity and quality of care, this particular example needs to be trea
defaultted with some caution. 
defaultThe Aravind model uses less experienced doctors with fewer senior consultants having a holistic overview of the patient’s care. There are also questions about the arrangements for pre and post-
defaultoperative care. In many areas of surgery
default effective post-operative care is essential for improving the outcomes of the patient. 
default&#xa0;
default7.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultMuch of the debate on NHS funding has focused on the provision of services and treatments. However, 
defaultpolicy makers must
default not forget that t
defaulthe NHS also spends 
defaulta significant amount on the 
defaulteducation and training of current and future staff.
default Health Education England, for example, currently receives around £4.8bn a year. 
default7.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Council of Deans of Health has warned that any reductions are most likel
defaulty to impact on the continuing professional development (CPD) of healthcare staff. The NHS must guard against this: cutting back on training now will undermine the 
defaultquality of current and future care.
default7.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government’s response to the Future Forum’s report on
default developing the NHS workforce (June 2011) said they would ‘explore ways to provide greater transparency about the overall level of investment across the [education and training] system, including for continuing professional development’. Two years on from 
defaultthis report, it would be helpful if the Government clarified what steps they are taking to achieve this.
