[[[ Paul A Hartley]]]Points for consideration in no particular order:-&#xa0;The above points are all relevant to the Route 39 Free School in North Devon that is at present in temporary buildings and likely to be so for some time due to planning objections. Route 39 has failed to recruit their stated numbers and projected numbers for their second year are 50% of expected numbers.Â  &#xa0;I am not against the concept of free schools but the public money that is being wasted on free schools is a scandal. &#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
