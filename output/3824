[normal]Additional written evidence from Care Quality Commission (ACQ0020)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]This memorandum sets out additional evidence to the Health Select Committee from the Care Quality Commission following its Annual Accountability Hearing on 22 October 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Workforce[bold]As at 14 November 2013, CQC has 911 inspectors against an establishment of 955.  This figure excludes the additional 200 Bank Inspectors that we have brought in to support the inspection programme as we move from generic to specialist inspections.  There is no assumption that these Bank Inspectors will be used to carry out new style inspections; they are intended to help ensure that we can carry on our inspection programme, particularly in social care settings, through the transition process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our inspectors are currently in the process of moving from carrying out all types of inspection in the generalist model to specialist inspections and we are working through a redeployment process to ensure they are moved to work in sectors where they have experience.  All of the inspectors we now recruit are required to have a background in health or social care, and will carry out inspections appropriate to their background.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We will be rolling out the new style inspections by sector over the next three years.  A timetable for the roll out can be found at Annex 1.  As we develop and implement our new regulatory model, the Chief Inspectors are considering how many inspectors will be needed to be able carry out our inspection programme.  We will carry out external recruitment for inspectors where we cannot fill posts with existing inspection staff and expect to recruit inspectors throughout the roll-out period of our inspections, and will prioritise recruitment by sector.  We anticipate that the overall recruitment programme will take round 18 months to complete.  We will also be recruiting a significant number of associate staff, such as clinicians and other specialists, and experts by experience to support the new approach.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The overwhelming majority of new posts will be within the inspection workforce: this includes inspectors, inspection managers, planning and administrative support for the inspection teams and programme. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our modelling of CQC’s future workforce continues to be tested. Supporting the three inspection directorates (hospitals, adult social care, and primary medical services and integration) there will be 2 enabling directorates; strategy and intelligence and corporate services. Strategy and intelligence includes intelligence, engagement, strategy and planning and performance functions. The intelligence function will increase with the enhanced surveillance required to provide greater analytical support to the inspection directorates. Corporate services provide back office functions, IT, HR, finance and estates, governance, legal services and the national customer service centre, which makes up a significant proportion of the staff in that directorate. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have been given additional funding by the Department of Health to assist in the transition to the new model.  For 2013/14 this was £20m, and we will receive additional funding for the next two financial years.  Some of this additional funding will be spent on recruitment; we have not yet calculated the exact costs, but we will be happy to update the Committee on this at a later date.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Fit and Proper person test[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Fit and Proper Person Test for Directors will be introduced in regulations in 2014.  Draft regulations will be published in December 2013 which will set out the criteria for a fit and proper person test and an unfit person test.  All organisations providing regulated activities as defined in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 will be required to carry out these tests as part of the recruitment and appointment process for operational directors who have responsibility for the day to day running of the organisation.  It will not apply to secondary investors, lenders or private equity firms.  This applies equally to NHS, independent and voluntary providers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Confirmation that an organisation has undertaken the Fit and Proper Person Test for eligible members of staff will be required as part of the legal declaration the organisation must sign when applying to register with CQC.  Names of all directors will be collected as part of the application process.  Information about Directors/Board Members will build over time and CQC will be able to check their intelligence when a new organisation applies to register, to determine if any of the listed Directors have been associated with a provider whose registration had been previously cancelled or refused by CQC.  We are currently developing the detail of how we will assess and inspect individual and corporate accountability as part of the ‘well-led’ domain within the new regulatory approach.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Secretary of State has responsibility for appointing the Chairs of NHS Trusts and NHS Foundation Trusts.  It will be the responsibility of the Department of Health, supported by Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority to ensure that a Fit and Proper Peron Test is carried out during the course of their appointment.  CQC does not have any remit in the assurance of appointment of these people; however, if CQC were to become aware that there were circumstances which would bring into question whether the Chair of an organisation would meet the criteria as set out in regulations, we would work with Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority, both of whom have within their remit the ability to remove the Chair of an NHS Trust or Foundation Trust.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]GP Ratings[bold]GPs will be subject to new style inspections led by Professor Steve Field, Chief Inspector of General Practice, from April 2014.  We will introduce the Ofsted style rating for GPs from October 2014, with shadow ratings awarded for some inspections carried out between July and September 2014.  Several articles were published misquoting Nigel Sparrow’s speech at a conference as saying that there would not be performance ratings for GPs.  The article was originally published in Pulse who published a corrected article – unfortunately this correction was not picked up in other media, including the Health Service Journal. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Governance[bold]We have recently updated and strengthened our governance structures following the appointment of the new Chair and five additional non-executive directors.  This has included the introduction of a new Board committee, the Regulatory Governance and Values Committee (RGVC).  This Committee 
[normal]will strengthen the Board’s oversight of the risks associated with delivering the CQC’s regulatory responsibilities and ensure that its values are communicated and achieved across CQC. 
[normal]The RGVC will provide assurance to the Board that the systems, processes and accountabilities are in place to identify and manage the risks. It will assure the Board that the surveillance model is robust and make possible an effective inspection programme that provides public confidence in the work of the CQC. The RGVC will also be responsible for overseeing the operation of our internal whistle blowing arrangements and how we handle concerns raised by the public.  The Committee is chaired by one of our Non-Executive Board Members, Michael Mire, who has also been appointed as a Senior Independent Director; his responsibilities include meeting with other Non-Executive Board Members, to act as a sounding board for the Chair and to help to resolve significant issues.
