[normal]Written evidence submitted by Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM) (AMR0021)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The following paper was written by members of the public health advocacy group, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM). As an organisation, it is our aim to advocate for the maximal public health impact of pharmaceutical products in order to fulfil the universal human right to health. This includes challenging political, legal and economic barriers preventing access to essential medicines (particularly to individuals and communities in developing countries), while calling for the development of pharmaceutical agents which respond to unmet public health needs. This includes products for neglected and tropical diseases, as well as new antibiotics and incremental advances on existing medicines which the pharmaceutical industry has so far failed to deliver. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have focussed our submission on answering questions 3, 5 and 6 in the inquiries terms of reference as these most suited out expertise.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Executive summary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Pull - 
[normal]Foster R&amp;D via financial rewards, e.g. monetary prizes for delivering specific results
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Push - Reducing the cost of R&amp;D
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Lego-regulatory - similar to pull mechanisms, but use the market to determine reward size
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Hybrid - a mixture of pull/push mechanisms
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The proposals of The Consultative Expert Working Group on R&amp;D: Financing and Coordination (CEWG) (WHO, 2012) report are discussed below, including the pull mechanisms and cross-border initiatives endorsed by the report authors 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The CEWG was commissioned by the World Health Assembly in 2010 to look into methods to stimulate R&amp;D financing and coordination in sectors failed my traditional market forces. The CEWG report evaluated several proposals for reform in R&amp;D structures including tax breaks for companies and orphan drug legislation. Criticisms of these approaches are touched upon in other sections of this report. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Objectives
[normal]This proposal, endorsed by the CEWG report, sought negotiations under the WHO for a new treaty between member states for Health R&amp;D. As stated in the CEWG report the treaty seeks to promote “a sustainable model of medical innovation”. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To address this goal the elements of a proposed treaty would include the following:
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Coordination mechanisms - development of appropriate R&amp;D networks to facilitate the efficient transfer of knowledge
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Financing - ensuring a predictable funding source, mainly from a defined contribution from different governments. Criteria for financing should incorporate:
[normal](1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]R&amp;D incentives that further the de-linking of R&amp;D costs from the costs of the final products
[normal](2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]R&amp;D targeted at specific global health priority products such as antibiotics as well as the special health needs of currently neglected developing countries
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Management of R&amp;D outcomes, assets and intellectual property rights - ensuring the open sharing of knowledge and the products of R&amp;D to protect the public interest and encourage further innovation potential.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To produce sustainable financing for R&amp;D under the treaty, it is proposed that WHO member state governments contribute a fixed proportion of GDP. 
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The amount specified would be determined based on a country’s level of development and managed under a transparent system. 
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Supplementary financing from other sources would also be considered under the treaty. 
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To generate their respective contributions it is proposed member states use mandatory levies on certain products or other tax-based systems,
[normal](1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Examples cited including a financial transactions tax and smoking taxation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To guide and supervise the funding of R&amp;D proposals under the auspices of the treaty an R&amp;D architecture would be designed to guide priority setting and perform a research needs assessment.
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The components of a proposed global R&amp;D architecture are:
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Needs assessment - identify specific health problems at each population level and existing healthcare resources available in each needs domain. 
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Priority setting - areas of greatest need or in areas where current R&amp;D activity is low or non-existent prioritised with funding.
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]R&amp;D funding structure - determine the specific incentives used to fund R&amp;D. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Delinking is the main approach the treaty promotes with incentives
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The treaty is flexible in incentives used to fund R&amp;D, certain projects may benefit from targeted prize funds or grants whilst others may be better developed by socially responsible licensing policies. 
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Other guiding principles in addition to delinking include
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Funding should be provided for all aspects of R&amp;D, including the relevant clinical trials needed for formal market authorisation.
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Intellectual property management - treaty funded R&amp;D research outcomes should not be monopolized by IP patent protections. This is to encourage maximum further innovation efforts from each R&amp;D product. 
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Monitoring - a key principle is the development of coordinated R&amp;D efforts at each level of government and research. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK government should take steps to promote the adoption of the Global R&amp;D treaty under the WHO as part of its AMR strategy. The treaty addresses the structural problems that currently restrict the drug development pipeline including:
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Market failure - the current patent driven innovation system, as discussed in the introduction, fails to encourage R&amp;D into antibiotic agents
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Co-ordination - the Global R&amp;D treaty enshrines coordinated research approaches as one of the core principles in its recommendations. Other aspects of the treaty help foster coordinated R&amp;D approaches:
[normal](1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Intellectual property management - R&amp;D funded under the treaty will not be monopolised using patent incentives, this eases further research into newly developed therapeutic agents by follow-on research.
[normal](2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Monitoring systems - the treaty encourages review of R&amp;D funded projects 
[normal](3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Needs assessment and Priority-setting - by identifying key areas for research based on population level health needs the treaty encourages a focus on international health priorities such as AMR. 
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Affordability - The current paradigm drug development leads to expensive therapies being brought to market. Newer antibiotics will be widely used and pose significant financial burdens on existing healthcare systems. Adopting the Global R&amp;D treaty will reduce the costs of antibiotics developed by R&amp;D funded by the treaty.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Discussions promoting adoption of a global R&amp;D treaty have been ongoing for 14 years now with significant input from both governmental, private-sector and civil society actors (Kidell-Monroe and Helene Iversen et al., 2013). 
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An open-ended WHO meeting convened on November 2012 to follow up on the CEWG report recommendations drafted a resolution for the World Health Assembly to postpone discussion on the main report recommendations, specifically the R&amp;D treaty, until 2016. (Love, 2013)
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With debate postponed till 2016 it is imperative that the UK government reconsiders its position on the CEWG report in concordance with principles of Human Rights and in face of the previously acknowledged urgent and unaddressed problems in health both local and global. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Direct funding of grants/fellowships &amp; Translational research
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The NIHR put together an AMR themed call as a result of the Chief Medical Officers 2011 Annual Report
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It’s seen eight NIHR funding programmes put out calls for funding applications into research to collect data and develop solutions for key areas 1-3 in the governments AMR strategy. (NIHR 2013)
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However to tackle key area 4 would require the government to provide a major increase in direct funding of antibiotic research through the MRC to the UKCRC Translational Infection Research Initiative.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK already offers one of the most generous R&amp;D tax credit systems in the world
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]175% (under the SME scheme) or 130% (under the large company scheme) of qualifying expenditure on R&amp;D activities is deducted when calculating their profit for tax purposes (HMRC) cf. 13.5% in Belgium (WHO, 2010) 
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Providing tax credits to private sector companies can be a double edged sword in stimulating R&amp;D funding. 
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The criteria to qualify for the current tax credits require companies to be performing any R&amp;D with an aim to ‘advance science and technology’.
[normal]e)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This blanket use of tax credits has seen the cost to government increase from £89 million in 2000-2001 to £1.1 billion in 2010-2011, with the majority going to large companies.
[normal]f)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite this the number of innovative medicines coming to the market has been falling
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Pharmaceutical companies increasingly put their focus on developing ‘me-too’ drugs that offer little to no clinical benefit
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]rather than the tax credits stimulating innovation they often simply boosting the profits of companies engaging in the R&amp;D.
[normal]g)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In order to stimulate innovation tax credits need to be directed at areas of R&amp;D where the market is failing, ie. AMR, and their ability to make an appreciable improvement to an existing product needs to be more thoroughly proven. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A type of public-private partnership, the PDP is a virtual non-profit organisation which outsources activities to partners in the academic, NGO, public and private sectors, using funding and other contributions from public and in-kind private sources (Grace, 2010).
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Multiple avenues of innovation are pursued simultaneously, with a portfolio of pharmaceutical R&amp;D projects managed by the PDP and consulted on by an independent committee of scientific experts.
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Their main functions, then, are the following:
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Link expertise from different spheres;
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Provide public funding;
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Provide technical oversight;
[normal]iv)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Manage a portfolio of research projects.
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]They operate with the objective of developing health products of a specific type (e.g. drugs or vaccines) and, in some cases, for a specific disease area.
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This is a novel partnership model proposed by Rudolph Juliano (2013), in order to adapt the PDP model so that its benefits may be applied to R&amp;D outside of NTDs.
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The model he describes is as follows.
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Partners from the academic, NGO and biopharmaceutical sectors form a joint venture virtual organisation (a ‘Board of Directors’, as shown in Figure 1), responsible for the management of a portfolio of research projects (in the same vein as PDPs), which may be outsourced to contract research organisations (CROs). CROs may also be partners.
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A governmental funding body sets the research agenda (according to public health need), and invites applications for grant funding from different, competing NPDDCs.
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Applications will contain meticulous details as to the contributions of and division of labour between different partners, the share ownership and intellectual property arrangements concerning the resultant technology, as well as conventional research proposals concerning the line of inquiry to be pursued.
[normal]iv)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Contributions of partners need not necessarily be financial. Pharmaceutical companies, for example, could donate access to chemical databases or human resources on a 
[normal]pro bono
[normal] basis, while universities could offer faculty research time (Juliano, 2013).
[normal]v)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Grant funding will be allocated on the strength of these applications.
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Multiple NPDDCs may be recruited by government to pursue the same, or different, research goals in parallel.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The amount of new molecular entities developed per $billion spend on R&amp;D has declined during the last half decade. This is speculated to be for numerous reasons, one being an increase in regulatory costs
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Three lego-regulatory mechanisms are mentioned in the CMO’s report
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Expediting regulatory review
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Extending patent terms
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Adjusting pricing or reimbursement procedures
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A review of the current evidence of these three mechanisms shows that they have little potential for significant impact when addressing the market failures involved in development of novel antibiotics.
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Market-based interventions will only have success were the market is an appropriate mechanism for delivery, where the incentives of the market match the needs of society.
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Currently, pharmaceuticals are expensive because the price is linked to all preceding expenditure; are of consistently poor quality; and are not developed according to needs based priorities. 
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Considering the fact that pharmaceutical companies enter less profitable markets for strategic, rather than commercial concerns, brings into questions the efficacy of lego-regulatory mechanisms. (Moran, 2005)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Patents increase innovation only as measured by the number of patents issues. The effect of more stringent intellectual property laws has seen a dramatic increase in the number of patents issued. (Abrams, 2009)
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While patents and patent terms have increased, the number of effective new drugs being developed (a far better measure of innovation) has not increased. Of 961 new drugs licensed from 1999-2008 only 2% of these were found to give a significant therapeutic advantage.(Anon, 2012) 
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Specifically to antibiotics, while TRIPS has set 20 year patents as a global norm the number of new antibiotics has actually halved between the periods 1983-87 (16 antibiotics) and 1998-2002 (7 antibiotics) (Spellberg et al., 2004)
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Patent term extensions have been trialled in orphan drug legislation
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]More stringent criteria are required to assess Orphan medicinal product’s efficacy and cost/effectiveness to improve the clinical value and the affordability of products allowed onto the market (Joppi et al, 2013)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Burdensome regulatory processes may disincentivise otherwise willing pharmaceutical companies from developing drugs for small markets. 
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Reducing the regulatory requirements may reduce the cost of entering the market. 
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, minimum regulatory requirements must be met to secure efficacious new developments. 
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Reducing the regulatory requirements results in more unsafe drugs being approved (Olson, 2008) 
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]New regulatory measures should continue to be analysed
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The use of non-inferiority in clinical trials is a subject of fierce debate 
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Proving safety and efficacy should be the fundamental goal 
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In cases where no effective treatment exists it could be argued a relatively toxic treatment may be better than nothing.
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Adjusting the price government pays for branded antibiotics would increase potential revenues thereby incentivising R&amp;D
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Pricing procedures could bring an added benefit when they are linked in some way to the therapeutic or social value of the drug. 
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Such an approach would be technically complex and expensive
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the UK, the government are moving from the Pharmaceutical Price Referencing System (PPRS) to Value-Based Pricing 
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]PPRS is a voluntary agreement between the Department of Health and the pharmaceutical industry
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Under this agreement the industry has the freedom to set the price, but the government can regulate the amount of profit allowed to make through sales to the NHS.
[normal]e)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Value-Based Pricing will involve setting the price according to certain cost-effectiveness measurements such as cost per Quality Adjusted Life Years gained.
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There will be proposed cost-effectiveness thresholds for any given drug.
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The government has proposed setting higher thresholds
[normal](1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]for drugs treating diseases with a higher burden of illness (particularly those with unmet need);
[normal](2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]for drugs that demonstrate an increase in therapeutic effectiveness;
[normal](3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]for drugs that demonstrate a ‘wider societal benefit’ (Department of Health, 2010)
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Pharmaceutical companies will be free to propose a price, which NICE will then assess for cost-effectiveness. If the price is found to exceed cost-effectiveness, companies will be asked to provide robust evidence to justify a higher price.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Global R&amp;D treaty, if adopted, would produce a huge impact on public health and allow governmental actors to help tailor research agendas to the specific health needs of their populations and pressing global health concerns such as antimicrobial resistance. Signing onto a legal framework will ensure sustainable R&amp;D funding allied to public health needs and also improve the wider availability of the products of research.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Proposal
[normal]Advantages
[normal]Disadvantages
[normal]Global R&amp;D treaty
[normal]De-linking mechanism - the Global R&amp;D treaty offers an alternative financing approach that ‘de-links’ the cost of R&amp;D from the demands of profitability optimising the research agenda towards health need cf. economic need.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Co-ordination - the Global R&amp;D treaty enshrines coordinated research approaches as one of the core principles.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Intellectual property management - R&amp;D funded under the treaty will not be monopolised using patent incentives, this encourages innovation with follow-on research to further improve therapeutic efficacy of new medications developed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Needs assessment and Priority-setting - by identifying key areas for research based on population level health needs the treaty encourages a focus on international health priorities such as AMR. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Affordability - currently newly developed drug compounds are expensive when initially brought to market, adopting this approach will avoid this by facilitating at-cost pricing of newly developed therapeutic agents.
[normal]The Global R&amp;D treaty has not yet been implemented with further international support needed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Direct Funding / Grants
[normal]Government directed research agenda
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Funds basic (pre-clinical) research, most neglected by industry
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Attractive to SMEs due to limited R&amp;D funding resources
[normal]MRC is experienced in performing world class translational research 
[normal]Information asymmetry between funder and researcher - Research groups may have incentive to present research in the most positive light in order to maintain funding, and may lack motivation to continue development once push funding ends
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Tax Credits (as used currently in UK)
[normal]Reduces R&amp;D costs to industry
[normal]Expensive
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Doesn’t stimulate innovation
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Doesn’t allow government to direct research agenda
[normal]Product Development Partnerships
[normal]Harness the inputs of diverse entities, allowing the optimal utilisation of their respective resources and unleashing otherwise untapped potential, including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Unprecedented up-scaling and commercialisation of novel academic discoveries using the capital and experience of private sector actors;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Navigation of new and unfamiliar markets by private sector actors, with the aid of field-experienced NGOs;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The partnership model allows for the development of in-roads for the training of the next generation of human resources in pharmaceutical R&amp;D (Grace, 2010).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Virtual administrative structure keeps overheads low (Munos, 2006).
[normal]Project focus allows for rapid decision-making unfettered by conflicting business interests (Munos, 2006; Juliano, 2013).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Outsourcing tasks to Contract Research Organisations (CROs) bypasses the need for out-of-pocket expenditure 
[normal]on start-up capital, reducing costs (Hu et al, 2007).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Historically, PDPs have been able to operate on very small budgets compared with ‘big pharma’. For example, the cumulative spend by the Medicines for Malaria Venture between 2000 and 2005 was USD 100 million, 90% of which funded actual research (Munos, 2006).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Builds research capacity in developing countries (Juliano, 2013).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some PDPs offer private sector actors intellectual property over the results of their contributions in order to secure their input, with the opportunity of developing more commercial applications for new technologies (Pugatch et al, 2012). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The model has so far failed to demonstrate its sustainability, with the majority of projects coming from shelved pharmaceutical company projects (Munos, 2006).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Continued reliance on philanthropic funding is unsustainable (CEWG, 2012).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The PDP model has yet to be applied to an area other than neglected and tropical diseases (Munos, 2006).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Non-profit Drug Development Corporations (NPDDCs)
[normal]Corporate entities may be induced to join these partnerships with the prospect of different income streams in the form of government purchases, as well as royalties from licensing of products to manufacturers of generics.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Government may set the research agenda, encouraging drug development to meet public health needs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Financial reward for investment by government allows for the refilling of public coffers, contrasting with tax credits which constitute a one-way flow of public finances.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]NPDDC business model is in line with ethos of BIS’ Catapult initiative, in developing a deeper relationship between academia and industry.
[normal]Academic partners stand to make greater financial returns on the work that they contribute to commercially-viable 
[normal]knowledge.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Fostering a deep relationship between academia and industry allows for the development of graduate career prospects.
[normal]As yet untested as a business model
[normal]Extending Patent Terms
[normal]Monopoly power offered to pharmaceutical companies offers a financial reward for developing new pharmaceuticals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Patent term extensions would be relatively easy to implement, because patenting systems are already in place.
[normal]The patent system is liable to abuse, because it provides 
[normal]“an incentive to game the system by artificially creating monopolistic market conditions.”
[normal]  (Simoens, 2011)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The patent system is not proven as a way of increasing development of innovative and clinically effective new medicines.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reduces access to end product due to monopoly pricing. (Duerden, 2010)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Significant difficulties have been proposed when trying to apply patent term extensions to one class of drug only, without influencing other areas of R&amp;D. 
[normal](Kesselheim, 2010).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A significant potential confounding factor in establishing the affordability of new pricing procedures is the current market share of generics in the UK. Specifically for ‘infections’ medicine, the market share of generics is over 90%. Current expenditure on ‘infections’ pharmaceuticals is £273 million; this will rise significantly as new patented medicines are introduced. (Hawe, 2013)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Expedited Regulatory Review
[normal]Speeds up review process offering companies faster access to market
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reduces the cost of regulatory processes, making overall 
[normal]R&amp;D cheaper.
[normal]Can result in poorer quality/evidenced medicines. In particular applications a) do not always provide a comprehensive toxicity profile b) were inappropriately compared to placebo when better treatment was available c) used very small sample groups d) relied too much on surrogate end-points e) were of inadequate trial length f) were for pre-
[normal]existing drugs g) 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]when receiving conditional approval were not followed by appropriate review.
[normal] (Joppi et al. 2010)
[normal]Ineffective at stimulating R&amp;D for orphan drugs (63 products in ten years), for the majority of the 7,000 rare or orphan diseases, effective treatments have not been developed
[normal]. 
[normal](Joppi et al, 2010)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Effects limited to a few specific classes of drugs as “
[normal]orphan drug research investments in lucrative fields, such as oncology, to the detriment of other previously unaddressed or under-addressed rare diseases
[normal]”
[normal]. (Wellman-Labadie, 2010).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Price Adjustments / Reimbursement
[normal]NICE, has significant expertise in conducting cost-benefit analyses. 
[normal]A Value-Based Pricing Scheme is due to come into effect in 2014, modifying this to reward antibiotics wouldn’t be too difficult.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Raising the cost of the drug, would also reduce excessive consumption or prescription. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Value-based pricing could provide clear and transparent priorities, set by relevant stakeholders, to the pharmaceutical industry. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Calculating the cost of drugs R&amp;D costs is a difficult procedure, made even more difficult by a lack of transparency. Currently, drug R&amp;D costs are inflated at best, if not outright manipulated, with the true cost estimated to be around $60 million, rather than the industry supported $1.3billion figure.
[normal] (Light, 2011) (Light, 2012).
[normal]There is a lack of evidence on VBP, although it has been trialled in Sweden to no ill effect. 
[normal](Latif, 2013)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As long as negotiations are “confidential between the authorities and pharmaceutical companies, there is considerable scope for incentives, rewards and favouritism”. 
[normal](Kavanos, 2001)
[normal] This jeopardises the chances of optimal price setting.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The pharmaceutical industry is free to set the price of any given drug. This could provide a financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies to ‘game the system’ as they have a direct interest in securing the highest price possible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The setting of price thresholds for new drugs is effectively setting the priorities for what we as a society want. Poor threshold setting could 
[normal]result in marginalization of certain groups of society through either a lack of drugs, or the presence of prohibitively expensive ones.
