&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from Justice Across Borders[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Justice Across Borders[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]              
[normal]Justice Across Borders is an NGO founded in November 2012 to support British citizens who have been victims of serious crime in other EU countries.  In particular, 
[normal]we have campaigned for
[normal] the maximum involvement of the United Kingdom in EU police and justice measures, since we believe 
[normal]that 
[normal]these work overwhelmingly to the benefit of 
[normal]British 
[normal]victims of crime.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]Our submission to t
[normal]he House of Commons Justice
[normal] Committee is based on material already submitted to the House of
[normal] Lords Inquiry.  The present submission focuses on Question 1 which
[normal] reproduces 
[normal]similar
[normal] arguments and analysis
[normal] as our submissions to the House of Lords EU Committee of 11 September 2013 and to the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee today.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 1[bold]: [bold]D[bold]o you agree with the list of measures falling within the Ministry of Justice’s responsibility that the Government proposes the UK should seek to rejoin after exercise of the block opt-out? Do you consider that the UK should seek to rejoin measures which are not contained in the Government’s list, or, conversely, do you consider that the UK should not seek to rejoin measures which are contained in the Government’s list?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.
[normal]              
[normal]We welcome the Government’s decision to seek to rejoin the 35 measures specified in Command Paper 8671, although – as we argue below – we believe that there is a good case for adding to this list.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Other Measures which should be on the list[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]There appears to be a misconception that the 133 measures fall into two broad categories: the 35 on the Government’s list, and defunct or obsolete measures, with only a small number in between.   The Command Paper shows this is not true.  While the list of 35 represents those with the strongest case for inclusion, there is a good case for including a large number of other measures, for the following reasons:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]              
[normal]Coherence
[normal](b)
[normal]              
[normal]The risk of an operational gap
[normal](c)
[normal]              
[normal]Reputational risk to the UK and Benefit to t
[normal]he EU by raising standards
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Coherence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]his issue mainly arises in respect of Europol and to a lesser extent Schengen measures.  
[normal]These fall within the remit of the Home Affairs Committee and we have therefore covered this in a separate submission.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The risk of an operational gap[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]We consider that the Command Paper analysis shows the risk of an operational gap in respect of the following measures
[normal] falling under the Home Office
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](2) Joint Action 96/277/JHA of 22 April 1996 concerning a framework for the exchange of liaison magistrates[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](25) Council Act of 29 May 2000 establishing the Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union[bold]&#xa0;[bold](32) Council Act of 16 October 2001 establishing the Protocol to the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between Member States of the European Union[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](30) Council Decision 2001/419/JHA of 28 May 2001 on the transmission of samples of controlled substances[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](66) Council Decision 2005/671/JHA of 20 September 2005 on the exchange of information and cooperation concerning terrorist offences[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7.  
[normal]              
[normal]We consider also that an operational gap would result also from non-implementation and non-application of the following measure falling under the Ministry of Justice:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](88) Council Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions with a view to the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]Although the UK has not implemented this Decision, we believe that it would be useful in allowing EU citizens, including British citizens, subject to sanctions such as supervision orders, to move freely between EU Member States.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Reputational Risk to the UK and Benefit to the EU by raising standards[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]There remain a series of measures which, if the UK is not party to them, may not leave operational gaps but may cause reputational damage to the UK and loss of influence.   We have included in this section those measures which clearly benefit other Member States and the EU as a whole by raising standards.  By not affirming these measures, the UK is abandoning one of the main avenues for building the rule of law in these important areas. These include terrorism, confiscation of assets, fraud and corruption where for many years 
[normal]the UK has encouraged other EU Member States and accession countries to adopt precisely these measures.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]The titles of the measures are self-explanatory of their scop
[normal]e and therefore of the argument.  The following measures fall within the Home Office remit:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](1) (8) (12) Council Act of 26 July 1995 drawing up the Convention on the protection of the European Communities’ financial interests, and the Council Acts drawing up the First and Second Protocols.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](4) Joint Action 96/698/JHA on cooperation between customs authorities and business organizations in combating drug trafficking[bold]&#xa0;[bold](5) Joint Action 96/699/JHA concerning the exchange of information on the chemical profiling of drugs to facilitate improved cooperation between Member States in combating illicit drug trafficking[bold]&#xa0;[bold](17) Joint Action 98/699/JHA of 3 December 1998 on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime[bold]&#xa0;[bold](18) Council Framework Decision 2001/500/JHA of 26 June 2001 on the same subject[bold]&#xa0;[bold](54) Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA of 25 October 2004 laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of drug trafficking[bold]&#xa0;[bold](58) Council Framework Decision 2005/212/JHA of 24 February 2005 on Confiscation of Crime-Related Proceeds, Instrumentalities and Property[bold]&#xa0;[bold](33) Council Decision 2001/887/JHA of 6 December 2001 on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting[bold]&#xa0;[bold](39) (87) Council Framework Decisions 2002/475/JHA of 13 June 2002 and 2008/919/JHA of 28 November 2008 on combating terrorism[bold]&#xa0;[bold](43) Council Framework Decision 2002/946/JHA of 28 November 2002 on the strengthening of the penal framework to prevent the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence[bold]&#xa0;[bold](45) Council Decision 2002/996/JHA of 28 November 2002 establishing a mechanism for evaluating the legal systems and their implementation at national level in the fight against terrorism[bold]&#xa0;[bold](84) Council Framework Decision 2008/841/JHA of 24 October 2008 on the fight against organised crime[bold]&#xa0;[bold](98) Council Decision 2009/902/JHA of 30 November 2009 setting up a European Crime Prevention Network[bold]&#xa0;[bold](9) (49) Convention of 26 May 1997 on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of Member States, and its application to Gibraltar[bold]&#xa0;[bold]11. 
[normal]              
[normal]The following two measures in this category fall under the Ministry of Justice:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold](29) Council Framework Decision 2001/413/JHA of 28 May 2001 combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment[bold]&#xa0;[bold](47) Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA of 22 July 2003 on combating corruption in the private sector[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Jeremy Hill, Trustee, Justice Across Borders
