[normal]Written evidence submitted by John [bold]Mepham[bold] [FBB0056][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Apart from the obvious left wing bias of the BBC, (even its former employees say it),  which has been true since the 1960's and is contrary to its Charter, the chief feature that is deeply wrong with it, is its lack of British patriotism. It discriminates
[normal] against patriotism by editing it out of its reports
[normal];  it
[normal] fails to introduce the national anthem at night correctly; it banned a patriotic play about the Falklands War; it eradicated patriotic tunes; it never INITIATES patriotic feeling. So different to ot
[normal]her national broadcasters I've seen in other countries.
[normal]Please do something about this. 
[normal]Write  a
[normal] clause in its Charter that requires it to bolster Britain, back Britain, and BE patriotic. IMO the BBC's lukewarm attitude to Britain has been one of the cause
[normal]s of the rise of regional nationalism. It has harmed Britain deeply - there are ex 
[normal]staff who promote
[normal] the SNP, and yet it is supposed to be the British Broadcasting Corporation - why were such people employed in the first place?

[normal] about the biased BBC - it is a disgrace - http://biasedbbc.org/ 
[normal]They
[normal] can't all be wrong on this forum and they are not. Week after week BBC leftist bias is chronicled.
