[[[Q 37/38]]] 

[[[Breakdown of the 70 posts lost following the announcement in October 2012, between management and staff]]] A total of 73 post closures were announced by BBC WS in October 2012.  Of the 73 post closures, no ‘senior manager’ post closures were included (although senior manager posts were closed during the year as disclosed in the BBC WS Annual Review 2012/13), and eight grade 10 and 11 posts, which are normally manager grade posts, were closed. &#xa0;

[[[Q 44  Please confirm the BBCWS share of premises costs at New Broadcasting House]]] The World Service occupies 19.5% of Broadcasting House (incorporating old Broadcasting House, New Broadcasting House and the Peel Wing). In addition, other divisions occupying the building – News and Radio – have staff working on World Service output which takes up a further 3.9% of the space in Broadcasting House. The cost to be charged to World Service for this space (October forecast) is £20.8m.  &#xa0;
