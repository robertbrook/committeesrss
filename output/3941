defaultAFS0012default&#xa0;defaultWritten evidence submitted by Keith Hamiltondefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultI wish to object to the application for the opening of a Sikh 
defaultKhalsa
default Academy in 
defaultHollybush
default Hill, Stoke 
defaultPoges
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy 
defaultobjections are based on the following concerns:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe logic of the Academy being located in Stoke defaultPogesdefault.default&#xa0;default1.default The site is in a green belt area and the proposed alterations to the buildings and grounds would result in the erosion of the Green Belt. Additionally the site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt where there is a presumption against development, except 
defaultfor a specified list of categories. This development does not fall within those categories. Any permitted exception to these restrictions would indicate a relaxing of these checks and must therefore increase the risk of further intrusion into the Green Bel
defaultt by other developments.
default&#xa0;
default2default. 
defaultT
defaulthe area has very poor transport provision and this development must therefore result in a large increase in traffic in order to accommodate the transportation of 850 pupils plus possibly 100 staff on a twice daily basis
default, plus 
defaultevening and weekend activities.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.default Stoke 
defaultPoges
default is a small village numbering some 5000 residents. It is quite apparent that the vast majority of residents are totally opposed to the imposition of this school in the village.
default&#xa0;
default4.default The intention, it would seem, was to apply to open the school in Slough, Be
defaultrkshire, and approval was given 
defaultt
defaulto proceed. This scheme, in my opinion, was the logical decision since the school is intended for 
defaultpupils
default 
defaultresiding in 
defaultBerkshire and West London 
defaultBoroughs
default. There is no requirement for extra school places in the area of Stoke 
defaultPoges
default, and therefore it is an illogical decision to site the school in this village where it will provide no benefits to the community 
defaultwhatsosever
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.default The decision to apply for
default the school in Stoke 
defaultPoges
default and the subsequent decision to support that proposal seems to fly in the face of government’s efforts to control green house gases by reducing unnecessary travel by motor vehicles, when there ar
defaulte locations
default within
default Slough, Berkshir
defaulte and West London that could 
defaultaccomodate
default this school.
default&#xa0;
defaultConcerns regarding the flawed manner in which the Consultation was carried outdefault&#xa0;defaultThe consultation would h
defaulta
defaultve bordered on the farci
defaultcal if it were not for the fact that it consisted, for the most part, on 
defaultdeceit and subterfuge.
default&#xa0;
default1.default 
defaultT
defaulthe school was 
defaultpromoted 
defaulteverywhere but in South Bucks. A meeting arranged for parents of both Slough and West London was not offered to South Bucks residents.
default2.default The statutory 6 week public consultation started with a link 
defaultto an 
defaultonline form displayed on the 
defaultKhalsa
default Secondary Academy 
defaultFacebook
default. However, no notification was made to Stoke 
defaultPoges
default Parish Council or any local South Bucks Residents
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.default An Open Evening was held 
defaultat Pioneer House for both local residents and prospective pare
defaultnts with differing consultation forms for residents and prospective parents
default&#xa0;
default4.default defaultThe Sikhsangat.com website leaked possible consultation results before end date.
default&#xa0;
default5.default A Public Meeting 
defaultwas 
defaultset up in response to a request by Mr 
defaultKandola
default and SSET
default to have an opportunity to talk to residents and answer their questions. At the last minute both SSET and Mr. 
defaultKandola
default declined to participate.
default&#xa0;
default6.default Less than 36 hours before an SBDC Planning Committee meeting both the 
defaultDfE
default and the proposer advised SBDC that 
defaulttheir Planning Application would be withdrawn and they would rely on new Permitted Development rights.
default&#xa0;
default7. defaultMike 
defaultAppleyard
default, Deputy Leader And Cabinet Member for Education stated that there was no requirement 
defaultor need for a Secondary School and opposed the 
defaultlocation of the school.
default&#xa0;
default8.default Over 5000 named petitions from Stoke 
defaultPoges
default residents opposing the school
default was 
defaultpresented to  Downing Street and 
defaultDfE
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe question of democratic process.default&#xa0;defaultFrom the above factual summary I would have thought that there was 
defaultsufficient reason to take into account the very strong protests of the majority of the residents of Stoke 
defaultPoges
default, together with the statements of both Dominic Grieve MP and Mike 
defaultAppleyard
default, Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Education,
default that the School shou
defaultld not be located in Stoke 
defaultPoges
default and as a result refuse this
default proposal.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe live in a country that is a world leader in advocating the pursuit of democracy. However, I am bound to say that the word appears to be open to varying interpretations depending on 
defaultwho is advocating it. To me the word means that democracy is the legal exercise of the will of the people. In other words, where the people are consulted, a decision is made to act upon the wishes of the majority of those people. 
default&#xa0;
defaultUnfortunately, it would appear that in the case of the Sikh 
defaultKhalsa
default Academy application, the government is happy to pay lip service to the people by carrying out a consultation and then, regardless of the wishes of the people, carry out what they always int
defaultended to do. One cannot wonder whether the new Permitted Development rights are 
defaultnothing but 
defaulta cynical
default ploy 
defaultused by 
defaultgovernment, its aim being the express intention of
default circumvent
defaulting 
defaultthe normal rules of democracy.
default&#xa0;
defaultI am reminded of Chaucer’s words “One ear he
defaultard it, and at the other it went out”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Gradual Erosion of the Green Beltdefault&#xa0;
defaultFinally, recently on BBC Radio 4, it was interesting to hear that a number of respected Green
defaultOrganisations, which included those such as the Royal Society for the Protection of 
defaultBirds, have accused the Government of failing to ensure the protection of Green Belt areas by permitting intrusions into protected Green Belt areas throughout the country.
default Perhaps this does not bode well for the Green Belt in Stoke 
defaultPoges
default?
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat a brave New
default World we now live in!
