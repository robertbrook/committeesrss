[normal]Letter submitted by Defra[bold]Plastic bag charge carbon emissions analysis [bold]T
[normal]he Committee has asked if we c
[normal]ould
[normal] provide further information about the carbon emissions analysis
[normal] which we provided in our written evidence
[normal]. 
[normal]The Government has
[normal] not 
[normal]been using a 
[normal]carbon reduction argument as the main basis for the policy
[normal] to reduce the distribution of single-use plastic carrier bags
[normal] and increase the number of bags being reused by consumers. 
[normal]The main benefits of this policy are in terms of a reduction in litter on land and at sea.
[normal] I
[normal]n addition this
[normal] will also reduce the environmental
[normal],
[normal] resource 
[normal]and economic 
[normal]cost of their production
[normal], storage and transport
[normal].
[normal] Until this point in the process, therefore, we had not carried out a thorough review of the relevant carbon data. When we did so an error came to light in an estimate of the benefits carried out in 2012; this over-estimated the carbon impact significantly due to how the original 2006 Environment Agency figures were being used.
[normal]The analysis set out below therefore differs 
[normal]from that in our original evidence and we would like to take this opportunity to rectify the error.
[normal]T
[normal]he 2006 Environment Agency’s assessment of the life cycle environmental impacts of different carrier bags presents CO
[normal]2
[normal]e figures for each type of bag (single-use plastic bag, paper bag, bag for life, etc) based on a comparable ‘functional unit’, i.e. carrying one month’s shopping (483 items) home. For example 82 single-use bags are required to fulfil this function, with associated emissions of 1.57 kg CO
[normal]2
[normal]e, while 61 bags for life fulfil the same function with emissions of 1.39 kg CO
[normal]2
[normal]e (if each bag for life is re-used 5 times). 
[normal]The error was to 
[normal]use the CO
[normal]2
[normal]e figures associated with one month’s shopping as referring to individual bags (i.e. one single-use plastic bag was assigned emissions of 1.57kg CO
[normal]2
[normal]e), thus overstating the carbon impact of the charge by a factor of 82.
[normal]The estimates are calculated on an embedded emissions approach. 
[normal]This means that much of the emissions reduction occur outside of the UK
[normal] as most plastic bags are manufactured abroad
[normal]. 
[normal]I have attached a revised copy of the Defra 
[normal]written evidence
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]have 
[normal]set out the areas requiring amendment below. If possible 
[normal]we 
[normal]would also like to 
[normal]correct 
[normal]one of the statements 
[normal]given by 
[normal]the Minister, 
[normal]Dan 
[normal]Rogerson
[normal], during his 
[normal]oral evidence. 
[normal]Amendments[bold] (in bold)[bold]: [bold]EAC written evidence [bold]“
[normal]Paragraph 19. The charge in England is also expected to reduce the local environmental and biodiversity impact of littered bags. The indicative reduction in single-use plastic bag usage outlined would cause an associated fall in GHG emissions of around 
[normal]97,000-130,000[bold] tonnes
[normal] CO
[normal]2
[normal] equivalent (not taking into account impacts of plastic bags for life or bin liners).

[normal]Paragraph 26. The
[normal] 
[normal]Government
[normal] has calculated that even if customers of large retailers increase their paper bag use by 50% there would still be a negligible environmental impact in terms of carbon emissions (
[normal]3,500[bold] tonnes
[normal] CO
[normal]2
[normal] equivalent
[normal] 
[normal]representing less than 4% of the savings from plastic bags[bold]) due to the very low current levels of use
[normal].

[normal]We would expect also that we could reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
[normal]by
[normal] around 
[normal]97,000 -130,000[bold] tonnes of 
[normal]CO
[normal]2
[normal], 
[normal]which is equivalent to permanently taking 
[normal]32,000 – 43,000[bold] cars off the road.

[normal]I trust this information on our carbon emissions analysis is sufficient and answers any queries the Committee might have had.
