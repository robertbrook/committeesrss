[normal]Biodiversity Offsetting has formed one strand of an AHRC-funded project which I am leading at Dundee Law School (with Dr. Walters 
[normal]Nsoh
[normal]) on new approaches to conservation law and I am involved with several groups in responding to the DEFRA consultation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] As well as the policy considerations, there are important legal issues that have to be addressed in relation to the implementation of any scheme, e.g. ensuring the long-term security of an offset in the face of insolvency of key parties etc.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I thought that I should make three brief points and to highlight two articles which discuss some of the challenges in adopting this approach.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Any offsetting scheme based on balancing biodiversity units is making major assumptions over the equivalence of “units”, which is not without question on ethical grounds, and our ability to measure their value, which is not without question on scientific grounds.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This is not to say that an offsetting scheme should not proceed, but it should do so with an explicit recognition of the ethical choices made and of the limitations in assessing value and equivalence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In this area, the best should not be the enemy of the good; there are positive gains to be made by introducing offsets, but the weaknesses in the scheme should be recognised.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] At least part of any offset must be provided locally if the well-being aspect of connections with nature is to be treated seriously and the social pillar of sustainable development to be given weight.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It may be possible to split the amenity and the ecological value of a site being affected and at least the amenity element should be offset in the locality. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Offsets should be secured in perpetuity but with procedures to allow them to be altered or extinguished in the light of significantly changed circumstances (e.g. if they are no longer serving their biodiversity purpose).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This issue is discussed in detail in relation to the Law Commission’s consultation on Conservation Covenants (Consultation Paper No.211).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The proposal there to allow the covenant holder to cancel the covenant is too far-reaching.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] To allow a covenant entered today in order to secure long-term conservation gains (which may be part of a specific off-set or more general compromise as development takes place) to be freely abandoned in a decade’s time would leave the conservation objectives too vulnerable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In future, planning authorities will come under pressure to make land available for development of all sorts and whilst a conservation covenant should not sterilise the land for ever, it should not be possible for it to be simply set aside without any form
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] of external scrutiny.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There should be ways of amending or extinguishing a covenant where it is no longer serving a purpose, or its purposes can be better served in other (equally secure) ways, but this must be subject to scrutiny and control.
