[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Greystones[bold] Supported Housing Project[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Let us look at 
[normal]planned
[normal] changes within the Government Universal Credit Legislation that could prove catastrophic for the 42 residents presently residing at 
[normal]Greystones
[normal] Supported Housing Project in Tameside
[normal]. 100% of our residents claim at least one benefit due to long term 
[normal]and deeply entrenched substance misuse issues leading to various disabilities
[normal],
[normal] ranging from Korsakov’s Syndrome (short and long term memory loss)
[normal], Schizophrenia
[normal] and
[normal] Bipolar Disorder etc which through
[normal] dedication,
[normal] hard work, extensive knowledge and unlimited
[normal] patience manage to control. Should the status quo be either threatened or challenged this could for each 
[normal]Greystones
[normal] resident eventually lead
[normal] to a complete disenfranchisement from society which culminates in 
[normal]even more excessive substance misuse and even de
[normal]ath. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To the untrained eye that initial statement may seem 
[normal]a 
[normal]shockingly
[normal] overstated
[normal] doomsday
[normal] prediction of what lies ahead
[normal],
[normal] but our 26 years experience of working with this type of clientele allows us the 
[normal]foundation to 
[normal]safely predict
[normal] such an informed yet calamitous scenario.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our
[normal] Welfare Benefit
[normal]s
[normal] system seems to be the popular choice for successive British Governments
[normal] to use
[normal] as a political football throughout the years 
[normal]which
[normal] usually creates short term fiscal prudence followed by long 
[normal]term overspend and fraud.
[normal] It is well documented for instance that Housing Benefit
[normal] payments claimed by disabled, unemployed and even employed people is fundamental within a welfare state to preventing homelessness and the myriad problematic issues that ensu
[normal]e. 
[normal]State intervention funded by the British Taxpayer ensures everybody’s ability and right to keep a roof over their head
[normal],
[normal] which in turn is a sound footing for each and every individual
[normal] to then move on in society and hopefully lead a meaningful exi
[normal]stence a
[normal]nd become a contributo
[normal]ry
[normal] member of that said society. Various ways and means have been attempted over the years as to how this benefit is distributed to claimants, either personally or direct to the recipient landlord.
[normal] History proves that in straitened tim
[normal]es such as the present, direct payment to the claimant can and will be abused, and we at 
[normal]Greystones
[normal] can categorically state without fear of any contradiction that to a man rent will NOT be paid.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Debt problems created over time by substance misuse is predominantly why 
[normal]we at 
[normal]Greystones
[normal] as a business operate, why we are always full to capacity, and why we permanently have an extensive waiting list of the same. Our residents live from day to day, figh
[normal]ting the many demons that up until acceptance into our project proved to be an exacting foe they were unable to defeat. To a man they are safe in the knowledge that their individual vulnerability is unchallenged whilst staying with us, but equally, should 
[normal]the opportunity arise whereas extra finances are available the tight grip on life we are all striving for loosens extremely quick. The thought of returning to that abject existence before salvation holds no fear when under the influence of 
[normal]alcohol or drugs
[normal],
[normal] and the individual is soon inculcated back into a life they worked hard
[normal] in
[normal] try
[normal]ing to escape;
[normal] rough sleeping
[normal] again
[normal] becomes the norm and we all know the impact that has on 
[normal]each and ever
[normal]y community.
[normal] Soon non-compliance with the Benefit Agencies and eventual
[normal]ly no finances follows, usually leading to aggressive begging, shop theft and even mu
[normal]ggings: is this all part of the
[normal] present Government
[normal]’s master plan?
[normal] Remember! the evidence will be for all communities to witness, law and order will break down, and manipul
[normal]ating the figures won’t hide this fact.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Let me give you an example:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]S was a long term rough sleeper in Tameside, daily drinking up to 3 bottles of Sherry per day paid for with his benefits. He had no overheads as such, was regularly fed by 
[normal]passers by
[normal] who were used to seeing him day by day shuffling his ungainly gait along 
[normal]the pavements of our town. 3 bottles of Sherry was his limit of purchase but not ability to imbibe, if he had the wherewithal to purchase more then he would. We at 
[normal]Greystones
[normal] were asked to meet with S as many attempts had previously been made to place him 
[normal]within 
[normal]the
[normal] local
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]but 
[normal]without success, 
[normal]yet
[normal] he had made it known that he was now at an age wh
[normal]e
[normal]re living rough was taking its toll both physically and mentally. He came to stay
[normal],
[normal] actively engaging with our renowned alcohol reduction strategy, and planning to re-enter into mainstream society eventually.
[normal] 
[normal]Greystones
[normal] helped S with claiming his benefits entitlements
[normal] which with back-pay was a significant sum
[normal], Housing Benefit was paid di
[normal]rect to 
[normal]Greystones
[normal] and until all was in place management subsidised his stay to be reimbursed when he received his benefits in full. 
[normal]S, on receiving his significant sum then decided the pull of his itinerant lifestyle allied to the fact that he now held t
[normal]he funds for myriad bottles of sherry and drugs was to
[normal]o
[normal] strong and decided to leave us. He never paid back what he owed 
[normal]Greystones
[normal],
[normal] but thankfully Housing Benefit covered his rent whilst he was resident; rest assured he would have kept that as well given t
[normal]he opportunity. S is still to be seen 
[normal]ambling about the area,
[normal] poor in health, yet
[normal] returning back to the lifestyle he made such an effort to leave
[normal], proving
[normal] what a
[normal] difficult task that is and how alcohol and drugs is to some more important than life itself.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All residents at 
[normal]Greystones
[normal] pay a rent top-up fee alongside Housing Benefit during their 
[normal]stay, 
[normal]this fee is for meals, laundry, TV licence, 
[normal]utilities and council tax. Meals consist of breakfast and evening meal, endless hot drinks and sweet treats during th
[normal]e many workshops 
[normal]Greystones
[normal] organises
[normal] and a hot nourishing Sunday Lunch
[normal]. This payment is collected by management from the residents who are trusted to go to their bank or post office on benefits payment day. You will note that this is not a foolproof exerc
[normal]ise
[normal],
[normal] but is agreed upon 
[normal]to show our commitment to them and to treat each as an individual as part of the process in their rehabilitation. This methodology proves to be the most difficult and challenging exercise day in and day out, even though the resident
[normal]s realise it is value for money and also could impact on their licence agreement which 
[normal]could terminate their residency; they just do not want to pay.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As previously stated, returning to a lifestyle that 
[normal]may provide
[normal] instant gratification but no real long term life expectancy
[normal], or prospects,
[normal] holds no demons for 
[normal]long term ingrained substance 
[normal]misusers
[normal], maybe you as a Gove
[normal]rnment should bear that in mind and if it 
[normal]ain’t
[normal] broke then don’t fix it.
