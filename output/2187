defaultLet us look at 
defaultplanned
default changes within the Government Universal Credit Legislation that could prove catastrophic for the 42 residents presently residing at 
defaultGreystones
default Supported Housing Project in Tameside
default. 100% of our residents claim at least one benefit due to long term 
defaultand deeply entrenched substance misuse issues leading to various disabilities
default,
default ranging from Korsakov’s Syndrome (short and long term memory loss)
default, Schizophrenia
default and
default Bipolar Disorder etc which through
default dedication,
default hard work, extensive knowledge and unlimited
default patience manage to control. Should the status quo be either threatened or challenged this could for each 
defaultGreystones
default resident eventually lead
default to a complete disenfranchisement from society which culminates in 
defaulteven more excessive substance misuse and even de
defaultath. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo the untrained eye that initial statement may seem 
defaulta 
defaultshockingly
default overstated
default doomsday
default prediction of what lies ahead
default,
default but our 26 years experience of working with this type of clientele allows us the 
defaultfoundation to 
defaultsafely predict
default such an informed yet calamitous scenario.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur
default Welfare Benefit
defaults
default system seems to be the popular choice for successive British Governments
default to use
default as a political football throughout the years 
defaultwhich
default usually creates short term fiscal prudence followed by long 
defaultterm overspend and fraud.
default It is well documented for instance that Housing Benefit
default payments claimed by disabled, unemployed and even employed people is fundamental within a welfare state to preventing homelessness and the myriad problematic issues that ensu
defaulte. 
defaultState intervention funded by the British Taxpayer ensures everybody’s ability and right to keep a roof over their head
default,
default which in turn is a sound footing for each and every individual
default to then move on in society and hopefully lead a meaningful exi
defaultstence a
defaultnd become a contributo
defaultry
default member of that said society. Various ways and means have been attempted over the years as to how this benefit is distributed to claimants, either personally or direct to the recipient landlord.
default History proves that in straitened tim
defaultes such as the present, direct payment to the claimant can and will be abused, and we at 
defaultGreystones
default can categorically state without fear of any contradiction that to a man rent will NOT be paid.
default&#xa0;
defaultDebt problems created over time by substance misuse is predominantly why 
defaultwe at 
defaultGreystones
default as a business operate, why we are always full to capacity, and why we permanently have an extensive waiting list of the same. Our residents live from day to day, figh
defaultting the many demons that up until acceptance into our project proved to be an exacting foe they were unable to defeat. To a man they are safe in the knowledge that their individual vulnerability is unchallenged whilst staying with us, but equally, should 
defaultthe opportunity arise whereas extra finances are available the tight grip on life we are all striving for loosens extremely quick. The thought of returning to that abject existence before salvation holds no fear when under the influence of 
defaultalcohol or drugs
default,
default and the individual is soon inculcated back into a life they worked hard
default in
default try
defaulting to escape;
default rough sleeping
default again
default becomes the norm and we all know the impact that has on 
defaulteach and ever
defaulty community.
default Soon non-compliance with the Benefit Agencies and eventual
defaultly no finances follows, usually leading to aggressive begging, shop theft and even mu
defaultggings: is this all part of the
default present Government
default’s master plan?
default Remember! the evidence will be for all communities to witness, law and order will break down, and manipul
defaultating the figures won’t hide this fact.
default&#xa0;
defaultLet me give you an example:
default&#xa0;
defaultS was a long term rough sleeper in Tameside, daily drinking up to 3 bottles of Sherry per day paid for with his benefits. He had no overheads as such, was regularly fed by 
defaultpassers by
default who were used to seeing him day by day shuffling his ungainly gait along 
defaultthe pavements of our town. 3 bottles of Sherry was his limit of purchase but not ability to imbibe, if he had the wherewithal to purchase more then he would. We at 
defaultGreystones
default were asked to meet with S as many attempts had previously been made to place him 
defaultwithin 
defaultthe
default local
defaulte
default 
defaultbut 
defaultwithout success, 
defaultyet
default he had made it known that he was now at an age wh
defaulte
defaultre living rough was taking its toll both physically and mentally. He came to stay
default,
default actively engaging with our renowned alcohol reduction strategy, and planning to re-enter into mainstream society eventually.
default 
defaultGreystones
default helped S with claiming his benefits entitlements
default which with back-pay was a significant sum
default, Housing Benefit was paid di
defaultrect to 
defaultGreystones
default and until all was in place management subsidised his stay to be reimbursed when he received his benefits in full. 
defaultS, on receiving his significant sum then decided the pull of his itinerant lifestyle allied to the fact that he now held t
defaulthe funds for myriad bottles of sherry and drugs was to
defaulto
default strong and decided to leave us. He never paid back what he owed 
defaultGreystones
default,
default but thankfully Housing Benefit covered his rent whilst he was resident; rest assured he would have kept that as well given t
defaulthe opportunity. S is still to be seen 
defaultambling about the area,
default poor in health, yet
default returning back to the lifestyle he made such an effort to leave
default, proving
default what a
default difficult task that is and how alcohol and drugs is to some more important than life itself.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll residents at 
defaultGreystones
default pay a rent top-up fee alongside Housing Benefit during their 
defaultstay, 
defaultthis fee is for meals, laundry, TV licence, 
defaultutilities and council tax. Meals consist of breakfast and evening meal, endless hot drinks and sweet treats during th
defaulte many workshops 
defaultGreystones
default organises
default and a hot nourishing Sunday Lunch
default. This payment is collected by management from the residents who are trusted to go to their bank or post office on benefits payment day. You will note that this is not a foolproof exerc
defaultise
default,
default but is agreed upon 
defaultto show our commitment to them and to treat each as an individual as part of the process in their rehabilitation. This methodology proves to be the most difficult and challenging exercise day in and day out, even though the resident
defaults realise it is value for money and also could impact on their licence agreement which 
defaultcould terminate their residency; they just do not want to pay.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs previously stated, returning to a lifestyle that 
defaultmay provide
default instant gratification but no real long term life expectancy
default, or prospects,
default holds no demons for 
defaultlong term ingrained substance 
defaultmisusers
default, maybe you as a Gove
defaultrnment should bear that in mind and if it 
defaultain’t
default broke then don’t fix it.
