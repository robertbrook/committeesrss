"&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Valpak Ltd – Written evidence&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;Valpak Ltd is the UK’s largest compliance scheme operator with member schemes for the Packaging, WEEE and Waste Battery regulations. In addition, we provide recycling services and sustainable development consultancy. Valpak currently provides compliance and other services to over 3000 members and clients across the UK.\nWe wish to offer our expertise and experience in response to this consultation and have included below a general response to the call for evidence.\n&#xa0;\nGeneral Response&#xa0;We believe that the ‘power to \ndisapply\n legislation no longer of practical use’ should be extended to include ‘no longer of practical use or justifiable environmental benefit’. This addition would ensure that any legislation which would be considered under Clause 51 would not be in contradiction to furthering the UK’s environmental commitments. It is also considered that the terms ‘practical use’ and ‘justifiable environmental benefit’ should be defined, or that each application made under Clause 51 be subject to an Impact Assessment.\n&#xa0;\nFurther to the above, it would also be practical to define the qualification criteria of Clause 58 (1) ‘have regard to promoting economic growth’. It must be ensured that while promoting economic growth there is not a detrimental effect on any other aspects, and that any impact made is distributed evenly. Again, an Impact Assessment may be able to assess the necessary information in these instances.\n&#xa0;\nClause 54 (1) b) outlines that a Minster must consult with ‘such persons as the Minster considers appropriate’ when making on order under Clause 51. In order to ensure that this Clause would be used effectively we propose an addition to the wording to include ‘including, but not limited to, any regulating body affected by the legislation in question’. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
