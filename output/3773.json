"LGP 080\nSupplementary evidence from the North East Procurement Organisation&#xa0;\nAt the \nS\nelect \nC\nommittee hearing that I attended on the 4\nth\n November there was much discussion about the scale of savings that improved procurement processes might deliver. I have had a go at estimating these on the assumption that all LAs were able to perform to the best practice.\n&#xa0;\nIts\n worthwhile \nstarting by \nbreaking the numbers down for some closer analysis.\n&#xa0;\nAt the oral evidence session I said that it was difficult to know what could be saved without knowing what the starting point was.\n&#xa0;\nLocal Government external spend in 2011/12 was £58 billion (the number quoted by DCLG sourced from their publication “Local Government Financial Statistics England #23 2013”\n&#xa0;\nOf this sum £15.8billion was classified as “Education”. Most of this expense is directly controlled by schools themselves and will have little or no impact on local authority finances.\n&#xa0;\nThat leaves £42.2 billion. Spending reductions during this parliament will reduce this expense considerably and if it was to be reduced by \n3\n0% the remaining procurement spend could be £\n29.5\n billion.\n&#xa0;\nThere is an additional capital spend of £20 billion, mainly on construction. The priority for savings for councils must be revenue spending rather than capital to maximise the impact on services, council tax payers and employment.\n&#xa0;\nNEPO\n has conducted \nspend analysis for the North East authorities \nfor several years and has recently introduced a new Strategic Analysis System to improve the sophistication of our analysis capability. This system provides an analysis of spend by category which could be a useful basis for understanding local authority procurement spend as a whole and then the potential for savings.\n&#xa0;\nThe \n12 local authorities \nNorth East spent\n £2.6 billion\n on external goods and services\n in 2012/13\n and it breaks down as follows\n:\n&#xa0;\nPercentage of total spend\nCategory of spend\nComment\nPotential for revenue savings\n20%\nConstruction\nIf 14% could be saved as suggested by SCAPE that would deliver £1.2bn nationally but I would query the validity of the \nScape\n savings estimates. It is very difficult to validate savings on construction projects as each is different. Savings \nmethodologies themselves differ in this sector. The average covers the wider public sector not just Local Authorities. Projects are unique and depend on funding so a saving in one year will not be repeated in the next. The profile of construction spend in the North east is very much more towards many low value projects where savings will be difficult to achieve rather than the kind of major projects SCAPE are involved with. In any case savings in construction affect capital budgets rather than revenue and will have no impact on council running costs.\n&#xa0;\nNil revenue\n&#xa0;\n9% capital based on the regional construction frameworks\n20%\nSocial Care\nThe context in this category (including rising demand, squeezed budgets, changing policy) makes it extremely difficult to generate savings from procurement rather than demand management and policy changes\n&#xa0;\nLow\n4% \nEducation\nNot in scope\nNil\n5%\nPassenger transport, the arts, healthcare including public health and housing\nThe potential for improved procurement is limited or doesn’t exist.\n&#xa0;\nNil\n5%\nUtilities\nSuggesting a £2bn national spend. Despite the excellent progress made through collaboration through organisations such as NEPO we are unlikely to be able to do more than contain the rise in energy wholesale prices and distribution/policy charges and water costs\n&#xa0;\nLow\n50%\nThe rest\nA very wide range of products and services including professional services, ICT, facilities management, and \nenvironmental services may then be capable of further procurement improvement. That would be about half of £29.5 billion revenue spend i.e. £14.7 billion.\n5%\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe written and oral evidence submitted to the committee has demonstrated that savings though procurement are already being achieved. This makes further incremental savings in areas such as vehicles, waste, catering, stationery which have been a focus for procurement (including collaborative procurement) for years, much more difficult to achieve. In the North East at least 40% of our spend is with small and medium sized enterprises and the third sector indicating that spend is spread thinly across many suppliers and any significant aggregation into larger contracts would be very difficult for local businesses.\n&#xa0;\nSavings potential varies considerably across categories and even by contract\n making a blanket percentage difficult to arrive at\n. Councils need to make cashable savings which have a direct impact on reducing budgets which further reduces the potential when price and other savings may only help to get close to an already reduced budget. If we take a reasonable target of 5%\n of £14.7 billion\n that could deliver £\n0.74 billion\n.\n Capital savings of 9% on larger projects (half the total spend) could deliver non cashable benefits of £0.9 billion. \n&#xa0;\nThese numbers ar\ne therefore substantial but can\nnot be paraphrased as “billions” of potential savings.\n&#xa0;\nThe councils in the North East have already used their procurement teams to deliver these level of savings to contribute to overall existing budget reductions and any further inroads that might be made will surely only contribute towards \nhelping to survive \ndeeper cuts rather than taking more money out of the system.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n26 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
