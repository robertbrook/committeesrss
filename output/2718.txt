[[[John Harrison – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;I have been urged by the Comittee of YDGLA to write to you in support of two proposal to be made in connection with the Deregulation Bill:&#xa0;1. All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.&#xa0;2. When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate.&#xa0;I know the Yorkshire Dales in by gone times as a boy I walked and cycled the Green Lanes and my memories of those years are much treasured.  &#xa0;I am greatly concerned for our environmental heritage and have supported the work of the John Muir Trust, Scottish Natural Heritage, the National Trust for Scotland and Historic Scotland, the Field Studies Council and the National Parks of England, Wales and Scotland. I am now 80 and not so physically active as of yore. This letter is an appeal to the Government to protect our precious environment. I apologise for straining your eyesight.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;9 September 13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
