[normal]I write as a resident of a community in Stoke Poges, Bucks.  Although I use our case as an example, please consider this is being replicated all over the country at enormous cost to the taxpayer in general, and sometimes at enormous cost to individual councils that are not the correct councils/organisations to which these costs should fall.

[normal]Provision of school places in the wrong areas results in less choice for all in the area. Also provision of a local free school with a particular religious ethos means that local children not of that faith have reduced opportunity to go to a suitable school for them, be that the local grammar or non denominational school. The children's families are financially penalised if they choose to attend one of the other selective schools in the area (as they will no longer get free school transport because the preferred schools with places no longer represents the closest school).  
[normal]The DfE has clearly not thought through all the issues of how the council will be able to manage the constantly changing mix of schools in an area with excess places created where they are not needed.  Nor have DfE allowed for the extra traffic overall of moving children in some cases from far away (e.g., Southall to Stoke Poges is 15 miles) for children to come to a school simply because of a religious ethos.  This is barmy not just from a 'green' perspective but also it is detrimental for the children to travel so far to go to school.  If a school is needed for these regions then it should be placed where there is a need due to the location of the children, not in a random 'in the sticks' location.  Incidentally bussing children so far to attend a religious school in my view is nothing short of religious apartheid for children. 
[normal]The DfE has also run rough-shod over the planning laws, choosing to pull the application at the last moment to deny communities a democratic right to 'have a say' and instead invoking the one year change of use legislation.  Residents are justly furious with the DfE.  
[normal]Please can you ask the Education Secretary why a small village should have an unsuitable and unnecessary school foisted upon it?  This is not in the spirit of the legislation. 
[normal]Also please ask at what cost unwanted Free Schools are being forced upon communities.   In this case the DfE spent £700,000 over the odds to secure the site.  That is £700,000 more than any business was prepared to pay.

[normal]This is taxpayers money being used to support what is basically a vanity project for
