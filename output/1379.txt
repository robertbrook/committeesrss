[[[&#xa0;]]]This response is submitted on behalf of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, which manages the UKâ€™s magnetic confinement fusion programme at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. The Culham site has major scientific infrastructure (see paragraphs 1 to 3) and research closely linked with UK universities, international collaborators and industry. This is made possible by leveraging UK funding with more than 50% European funding. The UK Atomic Energy Authority would be very pleased to host a visit by the House Commons Select Committee, if that is thought to be helpful.
