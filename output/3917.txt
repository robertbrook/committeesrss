[[[Written evidence submitted by Professor Robert ]]]

[[[Beveridge]]]

[[[ [FBB0020]]]]&#xa0;Submission by Professor Robert Beveridge of the University of Sassari, Sardinia to the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee Review into the Future of the BBC.It may be useful for this submission to be read in conjunction with my oral and   written evidence to the House of Lords Communications Committee Inquiry into media plurality - before which I appeared on 29th October 2013.&#xa0;What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?For nearly one hundred years, the terms of reference for the BBC have been tenable and broad enough to allow for the Corporation to develop and meet with success the challenges of new technologies and changes in culture and society.There is and was no substantial reason for amending these –except perhaps for the  addition of a fourth term- connect- which can work on a number of levels, connecting with people and society, connecting as in online and digital technologies and connect as in enabling communities and individuals, regions and nations to connect with each other.The current charter was a step change in that it introduced a new set of public purposes. These have some merit in terms of trying to apply largely bureaucratic performance indicators and some measurement of what are – in the end- necessarily sets of qualitative judgments. 

[[[However, the trinity of educate, inform and entertain have t]]]

[[[he merits of being succinct, ]]]

[[[comprehensive and jargon free which is important for transparency and public accountability.]]]There have been many attempts at definitions of public service broadcasting and the UK has led the field in ensuring that some of the characteristics of public service have been and are maintained across terrestrial broadcasting in and for the UK.It is easier to say what is not PSB than what is per se as a very great variety of content can be designated as PSB and rightly so.In terms of news and current affairs, the cultural values of PSB, vital in and for a democracy, comprise, of course, impartiality, balance and accuracy although definitions of these will always be, in practice, both contentious and their achievement a matter of continual striving and aspiration.So it could be said that there is a minimum set of characteristics –as in news above- but also varying levels of performance in meeting PSB objectives. For example, the budgets for ITN news can be reduced and the on screen content less comprehensive as a result.In the end, what the BBC and PSB must do is not measure their success by profit but strive to “make the good popular and the popular good” as was stated by a previous BBC Director General.This means that attempts to make the BBC only operate within a market failure envelope are self-defeating as the competition provided by the BBC is and has been widely acknowledged to help other PSB providers such as channel 3 for example to meet that competitive challenge and broadcast better quality content.

[[[So the BBC should not withdraw from programming or service areas such as entertainment as they can also provide educational, economic, cultural and democratic benefits for society.]]]How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?The BBC submission to this consultation will provide a wealth of research calculated to demonstrate high levels of success. These will not, in fact be erroneous per se but will comprise an agenda and part not all of the picture.

[[[ ]]]

[[[There is clear and unambiguous evidence that the BBC and BBC Scotland have failed to address with success the purpose gaps which exist in relation to viewers and listeners in Scotland.]]]

[[[In the even that voters in Scotland do not opt for independence, there will be an even more pressing need for the BBC to find ways of closing these purpose gaps.]]]

[[[There is no excuse for continuing failure in this issue and this is d]]]

[[[Therefore, the time has come to take stronger measures to address this ]]]

[[[problem]]]

[[[ and the seeming reluctance of BBC Management to make more progress means ]]]

[[[that the BBC ]]]

[[[Trust and/or its successor and/or the new Charter need to find ways of ensuring success in this matter.]]](This problem is also one which affects ITV/ITN and OFCOM should also take measures to ensure improvements in this area on the part of its licensees.)

[[[Where the BBC has demonstrated excellence in performance is in the establishment of BBC Alba and its partnership with MG Alba. The programming which has resulted, audience size and appreciation data etc have all demonstrated that the BBC can achieve the best of public service broadcasting- and on a relatively small scale with small budgets.]]]

[[[There is a clear case for a substantial increase in the budgets and investment in BBC Alba and it is very much to be hoped that this will comprise one of the recommendations or results from this consultation.]]]The BBC Trust's Review and Assessment 2012, page 35, available at http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/pdf/2012-13/bbc-bbctrust-annualreport-review-and-assessment-2012-13.pdf Public Attitudes to Broadcasting in Scotland available at http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/01/21104900/0Are the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?The public purposes serve a purpose. They enable a framework for evidence based qualitative judgements although achieving them can more readily be said to be the responsibility of society as a whole rather than solely or primarily the BBC alone.

[[[Where they have failed, arguably, is in helping the BBC to become more innovative and find]]]

[[[ diversity of voice and content within and across the UK with the exception of the excellent contribution made by BBC Alba.]]]

[[[However, even this is shown on a dedicated digital channel rather than by incorporating perspectives and programming from the Gailhealtachd into mainstream news, channels etc and this represents a lost opportunity.]]]

[[[The comments above on Scotland and the BBC in relation to purpose gaps also demonstrate that it is one thing to have a purpose gap but another to ensure that the BBC addresses and closes it. Therefore there needs to be work on finding ways of ensuring that the BBC does properly meet these challenges rather than as at present and -year after year-  recognising them without dealing with them as has been the case with viewers and listeners in Scotland]]]Given that the support for the licence fee depends on every citizen being provided with some tangible return as well as seeing the manifold economic, cultural and democratic benefits enjoyed by society as a consequence of the BBC’s funding and organisational model, there is a case for amending the public purposes to enable the BBC to more formally rest on the justification of reach by and through its overall services rather than ratings.  Ratings will, in any case, change and diminish as a result of fragmentation of audiences etc but the ability of the BBC to establish and sustain national conversations and event broadcasting is unrivalled and needs to be supported as does the need for the Corporation to concentrate on quality in the face of pressures to adopt ‘fast food like’ content.Some programming takes time to win and audience and for the writers, performers etc  to hit their stride. Only Fools and Horses and Monty Python are only some of the examples which required a second series to achieve lift off.  The BBC must be secure enough to take risks and move away from marketing nostrums into more creative areas.What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have? 

[[[There is a strong case, which ]]]

[[[I]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[have]]]

[[[ been advocating for some time, for BBC 2 and 4 to merge]]]. This seems to be gaining momentum. The problem with this is that it can only be a recommendation to the BBC and /or the BBC Trust or its successor body else the BBC’s independence might be compromised. Therefore we cannot have politicians, government or even Parliament(s) interfering at that level of detail.The BBC should continue to operate at its current level of operations, taking into account public value tests for new services and value for money as appropriate but within the broad overall remit of the new charterShould the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? 

[[[There should be, as indicated above, increased investment in BBC Alba, perhaps by doubling its budget.]]]What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?The introduction of the WOCC: the window of creative competition has led to a range of problems, not least the Brand/Ross affair where the form of outsourcing etc could have been said to be at least a contributory factor albeit small in the extent to which the programming was in tune with BBC values and standardsThis leads, naturally to the question: When and how is a programme really a BBC programme? This impacts on levels of trust from viewers and listeners.What is clear is that in-house delivery rather than commissioning externally leads to the employment of staff who are much more imbued with the values and standards of the BBC and much less danger of lapses of judgement or taste or quality.It is therefore important that the WOCC is amended to ensure that there are higher guarantees of quotas for in house production.

[[[The danger thus far is that, via the WOCC, we have been saying a kind of back door privatisation of the BBC, to the detriment of the interests of the licence fee payer, the Corporation and its staff and society as a whole]]]How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?The BBC’s commercial activities have been the subject of well-founded criticism especially in relation to the acquisition and then the disposal of the Lonely Planet operation. I was on record as opposing this at the time and the range and substance of my concerns were, in due course, proven to be rightWhat role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?

[[[There is now a case for each licence fee payer to be given a unique pin code to allow them to access BBC services]]] while they are abroad on business or holiday or to enable them to download content television AND radio- for which they have already paid through the licence fee.This would put into practice the ‘your bbc’ rhetoric, - help to make a reality of DG Hall’s ambition for the BBC’s relationship with licence fee payers to move towards a different engagement with them as owners; to sign in and join in.It would also remove the irritation felt by some of needing to subscribe to or pay channels for repeat content – which they have already funded via the licence fee.This would also be a good stepping stone on the way towards a more personalised,        mobile technology driven BBC system of content delivery and distribution.How should the BBC be funded beyond 2016?

It is absolutely necessary for there to written judicial strength guarantees to protect the independence of the BBC&#xa0;

[[[The funding model of the licence fee has lasted for decades. There i]]]

[[[s no reason to change ]]]

[[[as it has been successful ]]]

[[[ but there is a clear need for inflation proofing and to remove the ability]]]

[[[(most recent evidence being the actions of the then DCMS Secretary of State Hunt) to interfere and try to bully the BBC in hurried late night deals etc]]]Is there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?

[[[ease also see comments on funding and the licence fee as above]]]What comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries? 

[[[The BBC remains the world benchmark for public service broadcasting and content and the ]]]

[[[UK government should welcome, cherish and support this achievement.]]]&#xa0;How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?The governance of the BBC remains a live issue for politics and regulation per se.Moreover, it is clear that the UK is moving towards an ever more federal-like polity with the Parliament in Edinburgh and Assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast having legitimate expectations of –at the very least- having an appropriate level of involvement in the accountability processes which the BBC –and (not incidentally) Channel 4, S4C, the Gaelic Media Service and not least OFCOM are required to meet.&#xa0;

[[[Broadcasting should no longer be a power reserved to Westminster.]]]

[[[There]]]

[[[ should be an amendment to the Scotland Act 1998 to allow for the BBC to have a measure of formal accountability to the Scottish Parliament, with the annual report of BBC Scotland presented  to the Parliament and subject to scrutiny and debate although Minister of the Scottish Government (or indeed the UK government) should be held accountable or presume to be responsible for the decisions and policies of what is an independent corporate body. ]]]

[[[Given the fact that the BBC World Service is now funded out of the licence fee and the profits of BBC Worldwide- the time has also come for the decisions on the prov]]]

[[[ision of content in other langua]]]

[[[ges etc to be a matter for the BBC and its governing body- advised rather than set by the UK government.]]]In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?

[[[There is a strong case for establishing the BBC Charter on a permanent rather than a ten year basis. ]]]

[[[It is impossible to imagine a UK without the BBC. Universities have Royal Charters which operate for centuries. Therefore we must ask why the BBC Charter is given only for ten years.]]]The answer would that the changing nature of technology and society and culture requires this kind of scrutiny at pre-determined intervals. But what is also clear is that opening up the debate every ten years leads to repeated arguments around the scale, scope and existence of the BBC with the many enemies of the Corporation attempting yet again to have the BBC privatised or diminished, in each case for their own ideological and/or economic interests.I have never forgotten attending one of the Burns seminars in 2005 when a participant attempted to open up the question of the very existence of the BBC as well as the licence fee and had to be told by Lord Burns that a previous seminar in the series had already addressed this issue.
