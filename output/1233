default good at exams. Coursework shows a much better overview of achievement, if done correctly. The whole of our education system is a mess and each government tweaks it this way and that, to score points(gaming); to be seen to be doing something, it is no good looking to other countries as they are DIFFERENT, we need to look at our own population, there needs to be real research into this and other issues and while I am glad to see you doing this the statement I quoted from you really does ring alarm bells about your attitudes. We should all have equal chances at any path whatever our background. We should have our strengths and weaknesses identified at the earliest opportunity. Finally you should work on changing the attitude to 'vocational' read second best. Vocational should be equally valued and this has to be addressed within education and in society generally
