"&#xa0;\nSubmission by Natural EnglandExecutive Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.              Introduction.1.1\n              \nNatural England is the \nGovernment’s statutory advis\ne\nr on the natural environment. Natural England’s purpose is to ensure that the natural environment is conserved, enhanced and managed for the benefit of present and future generations, thereby contributing to sustainable develop\nment.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nNatural England is responsible for delivering, on behalf of the \nDepartment for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n (Defra),\n \nEnvironmental Stewardship \nand other \nschemes which offer payments to farmers and \nother \nland m\nanagers in England for un\ndertaking\n land management\n practices\n,\n which\n go beyond \nminimal regulatory compliance\n,\n \nto protect and enhance the environment and wildlife. These schemes form part of the \ncurrent \nRural Development Programme for England (RDPE) (2007-20\n13\n).\n Natural England \ndelivers \nover 51,000 agri-environment agre\ne\nments, covering about 70% of English agricultural land, which provide over £400m support \neach year \nfor \nenvironmental\n land management\n by farmers and land managers\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nNatural England is \nalso \nDefra’s largest del\niverer of on-farm advice\n.\n Our advisers deliver around \n13,000 farm visits each year\n \nadvising on a range of environmental, ecological, agronomic and management issues,\n specialising\n in helping farmers access funding streams for environmental land management and assessing the outcomes they deliver. We deliver our advice through face to face visits; to groups; through farm walks, demonstrations, farmer meetings and conferences. In addi\ntion, we provide telephone support and on line services to farmers to support their delivery of our agri-environment\n programmes\n.\n \n \nAs well as delivering advice, we work closely with farmers to monitor the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes and the co\nntribution they make to environmental outcomes. These include the impacts on individual habitats and species; landscapes such as \nA\nreas of \nO\nutst\nanding \nN\natural \nB\neauty \n(A\nONBs\n) \nand National Parks\n;\n and \nS\nites of \nS\npecial \nS\ncientific \nI\nnterest (S\nSSIs\n)\n, our most impo\nrtant sites for biodiversity. \nFor example \nRDPE underpins 60% of our terrestrial SSSI’s managed under HLS and 67% of priority \nbiodiversity action plan (\nBAP\n)\n habitat\n.\n1.\n4\n              \nThe latest thinking on the design of future agri-environment schemes\n \nsignals a move away from the existing open-to-all entry level stewardship \n(ELS) \noffer which is currently taken up on \nthe majority of the 70% of agricultural land that is under agri-environment agreements\n,\n \n(\nwithin th\nis \n28\n% has HLS\n (\nin addition to \nELS) \nagreements or older E\nnvironmentally \nS\nensit\ni\nve \nA\nrea\n \n(ESA) \nor C\nountryside\n \nS\ntewardship\n \n(CS) \nagreements)\n to \na more focused approach designed to ac\nhieve \nmore concentrated \nand coordinated \nmanagement \nchange in \nspecific \nareas.\n  A highly targeted site-specific offer for high priority sites on farmed land (e\n.\ng\n.\n \nstatutory designations such as SSSI\ns), broadly \nanalogous\n to the existing higher level stewardship (HLS), is anticipated to remain.  \nA more widely available element support\ning simple one-off investments designed to deliver environmental benefits is also being explored\n by Defra\n. \nThe successor sch\neme is anticipated to launch du\nring 2\n015 with the first agreements st\narting \non the \n1\nst\n January 2016.\n \n1.5\n              \nT\nhe scale of the \nenvironmental challenge\n is significant\n.  Delivering the \nDepartment’s \nB\niodiversity 2020 strategy (including\n \nEU level \ncommitments under the H\nabi\ntats and Birds Directives) and requirements under the Water Framework Directive have \nrecently \nbeen \nestimated to co\nst approximately £1bn/yr\n.  \nSimilar estimates have also been generated by previous work\n.  \nThis \nrequirement \nis in excess of twice the funding available \nunder\n the current programme and\n,\n although some alternative funding sources exist\n,\n they are currently small scale\n.\n \nT\nhe future RDPE will remain the main source of funding to deliver these policy objectives for the \nforeseeable\n future.  \nConsequently there will be a need for clear \nand transparent \nprioritisation\n \nbetween \ndifferent policy obje\nctives \nand also scheme targeting processes that seek to exploit the maximum synergy \nacross the \ndelivery of policy objectives wherever possible.\n1.6\n              \nThe framework of EU legislation that will govern the future CAP is becoming clearer\n.  H\nowever, there are man\ny outstanding issues that will be significant considerations for implementation \nand \nwhich remain to be clarified as part of the Implementing Regulations and Delegated Acts.  Many domestic policy decisions that \nwill\n impact on the implementation of the futur\ne CAP also remain to be taken. Without this detail the scope to finalise implementation planning is limited at this stage.  It is also important to note that \nDefra \nis leading work to develop the new \ndigitalised CAP services \nto support delivery of the futur\ne CAP and \nhas yet to confirm the detailed \nrelease and \ndelivery arrangements for the future \nservice\n. \n \nI\nt is within this context that our evidence is provided.  \n2.              Fairness.2.1\n \n              \nUltimately f\nairness \ncan be considered at \nmany different scales and levels \nand \nis \na \nfunction of \npolicy decision\ns\n.\n  \nThroughout the whole process of negotiations, Defra Ministers have been at pains to stress that the CAP reform must be ‘fair’ for the environment, taxpayers\n and\n consumers, as well as farmers\n  The implementation of the r\neforms clearly must retain this broad perspective, balancing any conflicting pressures among these different actors to ensure the most effective attainment of explicit Government policy priorities. \nIn the context \nof future \nCAP\n \nimplementation two broad type\ns of issue arise: \n&#xa0;\n              \nModulation2.3\n              \nAny consideration of fairness \nin this context \nalso \nneeds to take into account the underlying distribution of Pillar 2 \nfunds between Member\n States.  This continues to be based on ‘historic’ patterns of spend pre-2000, rather than any objective criteria that reflect the need for spending to achieve defined policy objective\ns\n through Pillar 2 support,\n and results in an\n extremely low UK Pillar 2 \nallocation.  \nConversely\n,\n the UK Pillar 1 allocation is close to the EU average (although there are significant differences both within the UK and between \nEU countries\n and indeed, between the payment regions within England\n)\n.  \nThese distributional issues hav\ne been subject to extensive analysis\n. \n Therefore, a\nny transfer from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 needs to be considered in this context \n- \nas\n \nutilising\n \nthe \nfl\nexibility of EU-level regulation\n to better reflect domes\ntic circumstances and \npriorities\n.  \nA\n \nreduction\n in the level of modulation \nresulting in reduced Pillar 2 budgets \ncould effectively penalise \nthose already doing the right thing by the environment and their expectations regarding ongoing access to Pillar 2 funding.\n2.4\n              \nRegardless of the underlying positi\non t\nhere is n\no evidence that modulation during \nthe \ncurrent period has resulted in \nany \ncomp\netitive\n disadvantage\n,\n \nas a study for the European Commission has demonstrated\n.\n \n \nThere are many \nfactors, such as exchange rate\n fluctuations and national taxation polic\nies\n, \nwhich\n drive the relative competitiveness of farming in different countries.  \nFurthermore\n there is also good evidence that spending on Pillar 2 delivers both agronomic and economic benefits\n in addition to enviro\nnmental ones\n \n.\n  For example \n£1m of \nHLS\n expenditure generates \n2.3\n \nFTE \nadditional \njobs \nand \n£1\n.72m additional \nspending in the local economy\n (compared to no-scheme).  \nBased on anticipated annual scheme spend i\nn 2013 ES will sustain 778 jobs and \ngenerate \n£415m of spending in the local economy.\n  The majority of these \nincome and employment benefits are retained within the local economy (80%). \n               Environmental ambition of greening2.\n5\n              \nThe context for considering the most appropriate domestic implementation of\n the greening provisions can be usefully framed in the Government response to the EFRA Committee’s previous ‘Greening\n the CAP\n’ inquiry. In its response, the Government agreed with the Committee’s assertion that the Commission’s ‘one size fits all’ approach\n was too rigid and that it did not take into account variations in environmental circumstances or agronomic conditions\n.\n  \nThe response also allowed the Government to reaffirm its commitment to “ensure a better balance of benefits to costs from greening” and to continue to work to “secure greater flexibility in recognition of Member State’s agricultural and agronomic diversity\n” \n.\n2. \n6\n              \nThe \nprovisions for \ngreening\n,\n \nagreed \nas part of the consolidated legislative text\n,\n \nprovide\n considerable scope for a wide-range of implementation options from the basic practices through a range of spe\ncified ‘equivalent’ options or the alternative\n of a \nmore flexible \ncertification scheme\n approach\n.  \nIn this respect Defra negotiators deserve praise for securing the ability to use a more flexible national certification scheme approach as the sole route to farmers meeting their greening obligations. \nHow\never, \nit looks increasingly likely that the \nimplement\nation of\n greening in England \nwill be \nbased \nsolely \non the \nthree \nbasic greening practices.  \nOur analysis \nsuggests that\n,\n \nunder this scenario,\n the overwhelming majority of farms will have to do little, if anything, to comply with the b\nasic greening requirements\n and \nthat greening in this form is unlikely to deliver measurable environmental benefits.  We \nelaborate on the other potential implicatio\nns of such an implementation decision \nin \nSection\n&#xa0;\n4 of this submission\n. \n              Scheme Access during transition2.\n7\n              \nWe are doing all that we can to ensure that the transition from the current programme to the new one is as smooth as possible\n \nfor existing \nagreement holders\n,\n within the context of changing scheme rules and changing budgets\n.  \nTransition \npolicies\n,\n \nannounced\n by Defra \nin July\n,\n \naim to \nprovide \nsupport for \nnew agreements during 2014\n (\nsubject to \nthe \nfinal agreement of the necessary EU \nlegislation\n)\n. \nThese \nnew \nagreements \nwill be available for \nfarmers\n with old ESA or C\nS\n agreements \nthat are \ncoming\n to an end \n(\n2,808 \nsuch agreements e\nnd\n in 2\n014)\n;\n for \nfarmers \nwith Organic ELS agreements\n that e\nnd\n in 2014\n (\n170\n OELS agreements\n end in 2014\n); \nfor \nbrand \nnew \nO\nrgani\nc and Upland ELS applications\n;\n and for new HLS agreements that are \nnecessary \nto \naddress specific policy objectives \nbefore the start of the new \nRural Development \nProgramme (especially, but not exclusively, for the Water Framework Directive and for SSSIs). \nA\n \ndraft annual \nbudget of £30m has been set aside for \nthese\n 2014 agreements\n.\n T\nhe latest position is detailed on \nthe N\natural \nE\nngland\n \nwebsite\n.  \n2.\n8\n              \nUntil now, t\nhe agri-environment programme has operated with flexible\n,\n monthly start dates.  \nHowever, t\nhe\n new \np\nrogramme rules \nwill \nrequire a single \ncommon \nannual start date \nfor \nall new \nmulti-annual agri-environmen\nt commitments\n, \nto match the procedure adopted for \nSPS. G\niven that the \nsecondary \nEU \nlegislation\n (\nImplementing Regulation\ns and Delegated Acts\n)\n is\n unlikely to \nbe finalised before mid-2014\n \na\nnd that the \nnext \nR\nural \nD\nevelopment \nP\nrogramme is unlikel\ny to be approved by the \nEuropean \nCommission until mid-2014\n at the earliest\n, it is \nnot \ngoing to be \np\nracticable\n to establish new multi-annual agreements in time\n for a 1\nst\n January 2015 start.  \nNew multi-annual agreements under the future programme will not be available until 1\nst\n January 2016.  \nNo \nexisting \nhigher level (or \nESA or CS\n) agreements expire in 2015, so t\nhe\n new schem\ne\n will be ready when those agr\nee\nment\ns\n e\nxpire.  \n11,361\n E\nntry \nL\nevel \nS\ncheme \nagreements are due to expire during 2015\n, mostly in the later half of the year.\n  \nIt is important to remember that \nmulti-annual agreements are only one part of the \nfuture \nprogramme and \nthat, subject to programme approval\n and policy decisions\n, \nit should be possible\n \nto offer \npayments for capital works\n, \nadvice \nand \ntraining \nto support the\n \nde\nlivery of environmen\ntal objectives \n(\nand wider schemes supporting economic/social objectives\n) during 2015.\n \n              Future scheme targeting2.\n9\n              \nAn inevitable consequence of a move away \ntowards a more focused and targeted \nscheme \nis \nt\nhat agreements under the landscape scale element of the future scheme will be \nmore \nconcentrated in certain geographical areas (reflecting the policy objective being add\nressed)\n. \n \nA\ngreements under the site-specific element will \nlargely \nbe \nfocused on existing high value sites.  \nThis is a necessary consequence of improving the environmental effectiveness of the scheme. \nHowever, \nthe other elements \nof the Programme \nsuch as \nadv\nice\n, training and capital \nworks \nshould, subject to policy decisions, \nbe more universally available. \nFuture digital delivery2.1\n0\n              \nDefra ha\ns\n taken the decision that \naccess to \nall \nfuture \nCAP schemes\n will be through digital channels\n.  Natural England already \nha\ns\n extensive experience of operating a voluntary online application process for ELS\n,\n with 16,791 applications submitted via ELS online to\n \ndate\n. \n \nIn 2012/13\n,\n 42% of applications were submitted online\n and \n89% of customers providing feedback rated the overal\nl quality of ELS online as good or excellent\n.  \nHowever, a mandated digital approach raises further implementation issues which are yet to be resolved\n, including\n:\n3.              Bureaucracy What steps does the Government need to take to ensure the reformed CAP will be less bureaucratic than its predecessor and what might prevent this ambition from being achieved?\n3.1\n              \nIt is \ni\nmportant to \nnote that a\n \nnarrow \ncomparison of \nthe \npublic and private \nadministrative burden \nof different elem\nents of the CAP \nfails to recognise the value to society of the \npublic goods\n that are being delivered. \n \nThis is especially true for Pillar 2 \nwhere a\n narrow focus on simplification\n/reducing delivery cost\n risks being detrimental to the delivery of environmental outcomes.  \nOn this point w\ne note the \nuseful guiding principl\ne\n provided in\n the March 2011 Agriculture Council paper on simplification, which was\n roundly supported by the UK and around three-quarters of EU Member States\n.\n \nI\nt reads: \n“An acceptable justification for increased cost might include better targeting of funding towards th\ne provision of public goods, or a reduction in risk to EU funds – providing these benefits exceed the costs of achieving that”\n              Interface between Pillar 1 and Pillar 23.\n2\n              \nThe addition of gre\nening in Pillar 1 is almost certain to \nadd to, rather than reduce, \nthe overall level of complexity\n and administrative burden (for applicants and delivery bodies alike)\n.  From \na Pillar 2 \ndelivery body perspective this is likely \nto add complexity in the following ways:\n&#xa0;\n              \nPillar 23.\n3\n              \nThe design of the new environmenta\nl land management scheme is intended to\n \nb\noth improve environmental effectiveness and reduce \npublic and private administrative \nburden.\n  Specific design decisions \nthat address these issues \ninclude:\n3.\n4\n \n              \nN\natural \nE\nngland\n and Defra\n are adhering\n to\n the principles laid down by the Macdonald review by being open and transparent and \nwe \nare working very closely with customers and stakeholders on the design and development of the new \nenvironmental land management \nscheme. We have a \ncustomer panel which is made up of 12 ES agreement holders who have been nominated by NFU, CLA and TFA and we have consulted extensively with stakeholder\n organi\ns\nation\ns\n on the review of\n scheme \nmanagement \noptions\n.\n3.\n5\n              \nNatural England has already made \nsignificant improvements in delivery efficiency\n \nand customer focus \nduring the current programme and has also gained Customer Service Excellence (CSE) accreditation\n. Our current average customer satisfaction rating is 84%\n.\n  \nNatural England has considerably improved the way in which we offer HLS agreements to farmers over the past few years. We have gone from a reactive stance at the start of HLS in 2006, providing only broad-brush targeting advice, to a much more proactive ap\nproach.  We have published detailed advice on the HLS opportunities in local areas.  We now discuss opportunities for potential HLS agreements with farmers and agents at local “clinics” \nbefore\n they have to embark on detailed applications. This is followed-\nup with detailed, on-farm advice when the suggested HLS applications are taken forward.\n \n3.6\n              \nIn 2013/14 the RDPE \ndelivered \nby N\natural \nE\nngland\n will be £477m.  \nThe total staff cost which comes from our Grant in Aid for delivering this is approximately £9m (5\n49 FTE) without IT costs which are £10.2m.\n This represents less than 2% without IT costs and less than 4% when IT costs are included. \nImprovements in delivery efficiency since 2007/08 are presented in Table 1.\n \nUnit Costs £ per agreement2007/082012/13£ Reduction% Reduction from 07/08ELS - Excl  IT129\n71\n58\n45%ELS with IT\n556\n198\n358\n64%HLS - Excl IT2,400\n1,134\n1\n,\n266\n53%HLS with IT\n7\n,\n603\n2\n,\n609\n4\n,\n994\n66%Table 1.

that CAP delivers the best environmental benefits while supporting food production?4.1\n              \nWe fully appreciate the considerable delivery challenge and disallowance risk that implementing greening (in any form) by 2015 represents \nand that this favours an implementation based on the basic greening measures\n,\n \nat least in the short-term \n(see Defra’s \nforthcoming consultation)\n.  I\nndeed we face challenges handling the interface between existing agri-environment agreements and greening to ensure that there is no double funding\n between greening and agri-environment payments\n. \n \nHowever,\n \nsuch an \nimplementation of greening \nis unlikel\ny t\no generate measurable environmen\ntal benefits\n. \n \n \nIn this context \nit will be critical that implementation decisions across the whole of the future CAP represent the \nbest \noverall \nbalance between minimising the public an\nd private costs of delivery, minimising the risk of disallowance and maximising the \ndelivery of \nenvironmental \npublic goods\n for society from public funding.\n A comprehensive programme of environmental monitoring and evaluation of greening\n,\n to enable an accur\nate assessment of the environmental benefits \nof the policy\n,\n \nwill also be \nimportant.\n4.\n2\n              \nThe relationship between sustainability and agricultural production is sometimes referred to as a balance or trade-off\n: there is an assumption that actions taken to improve environmental performance decrease production and \nvice versa\n.  Sometimes this is the case, but often production is only increased in the short term or requires significant additional inputs.  Integrate\nd actions resulting in win-win outcomes are possible, enhancing both farming’s sustainability and its productivity.  In addition, the services provided by the natural environment are vital to production.  Sustainability, by definition, is a necessary pre-r\nequisite of ongoing agricultural productivity.\n Evidence demonstrates that the l\nonger-term sustainability of food production \nis inherently linked to the \nintegration of environmental \nand agronomic \npriorities\n. \n4.\n3\n              \nE\nxperience from current delivery has demons\ntrated that delivering \nthe majority of\n \nenvironmental \nobjectives \neffectively is inherently complex \nand that Pillar 2 is \ngenerally \nthe best tool for supporting this.  \nThere is no evidence that voluntary environmental land management agreements under Pillar 2 \nhave any significant \nnegative \nimpact on levels of food production or productivity\n \n– the majority of evidence indicates that \nthey\n actually contribute to sustainable \nproduction eg floristic margins \nsupporting\n pollinators\n.\n \n5.              Lessons learntWhat are the principal lessons the Government should learn from the implementation of the previous CAP?5.1\n              \nA r\nange of lessons learned reviews \nwere \nundertaken, principally of Pillar\n 1 implementation\n, following the \nprevious\n reform\n.\n \nThe delivery of activity under Pillar 2 of the CAP, especially Environmental Stewardship, has typically been less problematic.\n \n The mid-term evaluation (MTE) of the current rural development programme\n con\ncluded that “\nAxis 2 Measures \n[\nImproving the environment and countryside\n]\n have generally performed well, with outputs and results in line with targets and\n \nbroadly positive feedback from beneficiaries and stakeholders\n”\n.\n6.              Conclusion6.1\n              \nThe limited \ncore \nPillar 2 budget \nthat is likely to be \navailable in England \ncoupled with the scale of environmental need means that it will be important that \ndomestic \nimplementation decisions, such as \nthe transfer\n \nof funds \nfrom Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 and the design of greenin\ng in \nP\nillar 1, represent the \nbest \noverall \nbalance between \nminimising \nthe public and private costs of delivery\n, \nminimising the risk of disallowance\n and \nmaximising the \nenvironmental benefits for society\n from public funding\n. \n6.2\n              \nAgri-environment schemes in P\nillar 2 have a proven track record of delivering environmental benefits and help to support the long-term sustainability of agricultural systems.  However, even with the maximum \npermitted \nrate of transfer from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2\n \nand a future RDPE focused\n on the delivery of environmental objectives it will not be possible \nfor the future\n programme\n \nto satisfy all \nenvironmental policy objectives \nand there will be a need for clear and transparent\n prioritisation\n between objectives.\n6.3\n              \nNatural England has \noverseen the ongoing evolution and dev\nelopment of agri-environmen\nt schem\nes during the current programme. We have successfully delivered improvements to scheme design intended to improve environmental effectiveness alongside\n \nimproved customer satisfaction a\nnd significant \nefficiency savings\n.\n \n6.\n4\n              \nNatural England is working closely with D\nefra, the Rural Payments Agency, Forestry Commission, Environment Agency and stakeholders \nto ensure that the transition to and implementation of the future environmental land \nmanagement scheme under the next RDPE is a smooth as possible. \nWe are also working hard to simplify \nthe design of the scheme and simultaneously improve its environmental effectiveness.\n \n \nHowever, t\nhere remain considerable implementation challenges that can \nonly be \nfully \naddressed when \nthere is greater clarity about the \nEU\n legal framework and domestic policy decisions have been confirmed.\n&#xa0;October 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nNatural England Land Management Update July 2013 \nhttp://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/lmupdate12_tcm6-36362.pdf\n \nNatural England (2013) Advice to Defra, unpublished.\n Cao, Y., Elliott, J., McCracken, D., Rowe, K., Whitehead, J. and Wilson L. \n(2009) \nEs\ntimating the Scale of Future Environmental Land Management Requirements for the UK\n  http://www.snh.gov.uk/docs/A931060.pdf\n \n \nDefra press release, 28\nth\n June 2013.
