[normal]Part II[bold]The Committee has decided to carry out an inquiry into local government procurement and invites written submissions from interested parties. The central focus of the inquiry will be to assess the extent to which it is delivering good value for money and meeting the objectives of local authorities. The inquiry will highlight and examine good practice and initiatives within local authority procurement and elsewhere and explore how and to what extent local authorities can adopt and take advantage of them. To assist those making submissions the Committee has identified the following topics that it may cover, though the list is not exhaustive. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.[bold]              [bold]To what extent is local government procurement organised to deliver value for money and social, economic and environmental objectives, including stimulating the local economy? To what extent are local authorities achieving the involvement of local residents in delivering value for money? To what extent are local authorities able to develop long-term relationships with contractors?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]At an individual Council level, procurement organisational models vary widely from centralised “command and control” to fully de-centralised front line departmental models. HCC has moved to a “centre – led” model over recent years and focused on developing the 
[normal]right behaviours[bold] and collaborative internal working as being ultimately more important to outcomes than different structural models. This is particularly the case with regard to the broader aspects of commissioning, 
[normal]category management and contract / supplier relationship management[bold]. HCC is currently further strengthening its collective performance in these areas through creating dedicated improvement leads, assisted by external partners. Additional 
[normal]strategic capacity[bold] has been created to own and drive these improvements: key actions include the following: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]HCC also has a strong focus on supporting policy through procurement; this applies clearly to promoting local economic benefit. For example, management information is used to track and encourage SME and local spend; practical help is given to smaller suppliers in bid writing and understanding necessary processes; and removing barriers to access is on-going, for example recently adopting a much simpler pre-qualification process. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]At a cross – Council level, individual organisations are increasingly working together, as capacity is lost. HCC may be unusual in investing in procurement capacity during these difficult times. Demand for highly effective and 
[normal]commercially astute procurement resource[bold] has argu
[normal]ably never been higher,
[normal] as demand for higher and sustainable savings continues. This theme of capacity and collaboration is developed further in our response to Question 2. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]With regard to the extent to which HCC is involving residents in delivering value for money, this is well illustrated within our Adult Services area. Throughout the procurement lifecycle residents are engaged: PIN notices involve clients and carers in their preparation; consultation with clients occurs at both specification and tender question / evaluation setting stage; finally, monitoring and feedback from contracted services inform contract management and future service shaping.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]Regarding HCC’s ability to develop long-term relationships with contractors, our performance continues to strengthen. HCC’s learning, particularly in the property arena, of the benefits of creating a 
[normal]more collaborative and integrated supply chain[bold], rather than the more traditional fixed price lowest bid approach has delivered proven improved outcomes. OJEU constraints continue to hamper effective procurement in some areas: the UK feels more risk adverse compared with other European countries and arguably pays a heavy cost for this. Notwithstanding this, HCC is further improving its 
[normal]contract and supplier relationship management approach[bold], as part of the procurement capability improvement plan. This improvement is also likely to involve formal negotiation strategy planning for key existing contracts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]              
[normal]There is a balance to be found sometimes in local government between larger long term contracts and SME and local supplier support. HCC promotes a 
[normal]blended approach[bold], where smaller contracts are best served by SME and local suppliers. Larger and more specialist contracts tend to be procured from larger suppliers, who have the necessary capacity and skills. These are often procured via a collaborative framework. HCC also strongly encourages these larger suppliers to demonstrate their practical support of the local economy through their 
[normal]supply chain management leverage[bold], through using SME and local sub-contractors, as well as apprentices, wherever practicable. Following the 
[normal]independent capability review[bold], HCC are considering the benefits of reducing the relatively high number of suppliers that they currently employ, in a way that would still support the local economy. This would also enable HCC to be able to better contract manage by having a more manageable number of providers. This lead accountable provider model is likely to be initially explored in the social care arena. Any such model, if advanced, would have the requirement to develop and evidence local economic benefit through active 
[normal]supply chain management[bold]. Allied to these considerations is a move to increased outcome based commissioning including consideration of the “total cost of ownership” of service costs – home care may be a relevant spend category to explore the benefits and feasibility of this market shaping approach.       
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2. [bold]              [bold]Do authorities take sufficient advantage of collaborative and joint procurement opportunities, including those available from central government? In addition, the Committee would welcome information on PFI contracts and their operation with local government [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]Regarding the exploitation of collaborative and joint procurement opportunities, HCC believes that economic and capacity pressures are driving an increasing take up across the sector. This is welcome as the market has long rightly complained about the need for a consolidation of collaborative frameworks. In many cases, the right answer for a Council is to 
[normal]access an existing framework[bold], including one from central government rather than create a new one.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]HCC itself is passionate about joining forces with others to become a more informed and powerful client, wherever possible. HCC has a strong reputation for leading collaboration in construction and asset management, most recently through the NIEP; a copy of the programme outcomes is attached below:
[normal]http://www.niepbuiltenvironment.org.uk/NIEP%20Programme%20and%20Achievements.pdf
[normal]HCC are currently working to create a new cross – regional collaborative construction framework for Southern England. In relation to more corporate categories HCC also chairs the Central Buying Consortium (CBC). Finally, HCC has recently led and concluded the LGA National Procurement Strategy, this being informed by the development of both the Quick Wins and Big Wins Procurement Strategies, copies of which are attached below:

[normal]    
[normal]http://www.niepbuiltenvironment.org.uk/documents/PCSAWorkstream-QuickWinsStrategyOct2010.pdf
[normal]At a more local level, HCC has recently developed two innovative shared procurement arrangements: firstly, with Hampshire Constabulary and Hampshire Fire and Rescue Services for all common spend categories; and second, with Surrey CC and Reading BC for all property and assets related categories. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Regarding information on the operation of PFI contracts within local government, this is not a route generally taken by HCC. There is much widely available commentary on the potential pitfalls of such a route, particularly in the early days of its usage by the wider public sector. The only PFI usage by HCC has been for a street lighting contract awarded in 2010 to Scottish and Southern Energy. This is a 25 year, £120m PFI arrangement allowing replacements and upgrades to Hampshire’s 150,000 street lights and illuminated signs and bollards. Key project benefits include the investment in latest technology, more efficient use of energy, improved visibility and reduced light pollution at night and safer streets with reduced crime. This procurement route allowed HCC to secure the required funds for the programme, 
[normal]share risks[bold] appropriately and 
[normal]exploit technology[bold] to save energy and cut carbon emissions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold]              [bold]How can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives? More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies—locally and regionally. If not, how can deficiencies be addressed?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Approaches for individual Councils to access the required skills and capacity could take make forms, depending on their situation and perceived capability gap. HCC found that undertaking a 
[normal]regular independent capability review[bold] gave them an objective and structured view of their own skills and capability gaps. This then allowed HCC to plan its next stage of improvement; HCC see this as a vital and on-going improvement process. Once the capability gap(s) have been identified, the most appropriate route(s) to close the gap can be considered and actioned. For HCC for example, currently this has primarily taken the form of internal up-skilling a
[normal]nd targeted support from our private sector partner
[normal]. For Councils generally consideration of accessing the capacity of others may also be a sensible option. In many cases the existing infrastructure 
[normal](if effective) 
[normal]of regional procurement legacy hubs is ideal for this purpose. These hubs are well placed to develop programmes of work across multiple Councils bringing incremental benefit. The construction hubs are an excellent example of this, their open book tendering lending themselves to valuable cost comparisons. In addition, shared procurement arrangements across local 
[normal]Councils and public bodies can increasingly provide the required capacity.
[normal] 
[normal]Government should consider how it incentivises this behaviour[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]With regard to spend and market knowledge, existing spend data is generally at a reasonable level. Obviously this will vary across Councils. In HCC we are improving the coding of spend categories to improve our understanding; however, simply raising the visibility of common and category spend across departments has brought benefit, even without 100% accuracy. We are also exploring spend comparative modelling with other Councils. Increasingly HCC is focusing on forecasting future demand against cost predictions to inform our transformation programme. Market knowledge is clearly vital for effective sourcing strategies and capacity constraints can sometimes impede this. At HCC, one of the key 
[normal]improvement plans is developing the application of robust category planning[bold] – this will include a 
[normal]deep market review[bold], plus on-going market dialogue to maintain currency. In addition, this market knowledge can be supplemented by regional and national collaboration, sharing knowledge across Councils. Indeed, one of the primary recommendations from the National Procurement Strategy was the formation of individual Councils leading key spend categories and thereby raising collective market knowledge; the HCC led NIEP model illustrates how this has recently worked in the construction and asset management category for example.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]Understanding markets and their behaviour is a prerequisite for the design of future collaboration and management activity[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold]              [bold]To what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are tailored to product and supplier market places? More specifically, do local authorities maintain and operate effective client management functions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow the flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget reductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Risk management capability is still maturing in local government compared to the private sector. Arguably, the realities of public accountability and reputational risk act
[normal] to reduce
[normal] 
[normal]risk appetite[bold] across the wider public
[normal] sector. HCC are using their private sector partner
[normal] to help them increase commercial acumen across the organisation. The response to Question 1 referenced the risk aversion around OJEU. In order to improve risk management, HCC have developed risk assessments to formally analyse procurement risk, to ensure that all decisions are “risk aware” decisions. These assessments are also guided by a strong desire by HCC to be seen as an expert and trustworthy client by the market. Some of the required improvements in risk management are cultural and wider than the scope of procurement or any one Council. In order to respond to these broader issues, HCC is developing a Workforce Development Plan to help drive more commercial acumen across the organisation.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]With regard to the 
[normal]effectiveness of client management functions[bold], a known risk for Councils is the outsourcing of control together with the actual service. As fiscal pressures build, the temptation to “move a problem out” by outsourcing, without fully 
[normal]considering the intelligent client function can bring un-intended consequences. Equally, in a similar way to broader more integrated supplier services, “going up the supply chain” and carrying out some previously client functions can make good business sense. Residual departmental defensiveness around this “boundary” will inevitably be overtaken by financial pressures.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]Regarding the flexibility of contractual arrangements to support necessary change, newer contracts are much more flexible and encourage innovation and continuous improvement, sometimes supported with risk and reward mechanisms. Often, procurement staff play a pivotal role with having a “foot in both camps” – using their supplier relationships to deliver innovation and new ideas to their client organisations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]It is for senior management within Councils to ensure a framework exists to continually improve client side management[bold].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.[bold]              [bold]How is regularity and propriety of procurement secured and are the arrangements for detecting and addressing impropriety and fraud effective? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]HCC’s approach to securing regularity and propriety of procurement is secured through the following key controls: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]It is nationally recognised that fraud can occur at any point in the procurement process. The key areas of external fraudulent activity during the procurement stage can include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following the award of the contract, fraud can occur when contractors:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]The approach to effectively manage out impropriety and fraud centre on the following:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.[bold]              [bold]Is local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress? Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective? More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]HCC’s approach to providing transparency, audit controls, mechanisms for redress and accountability centre on the following controls
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]In terms of assurance on delivering broad value for money, HCC considers its procurement management approach, continuous improvement culture and controls highlighted in this submission as sound business “input” indicators. Ultimately, however, it is the delivery of outcomes for residents that are the best indicators of success, both in terms of customer satisfaction and Council Tax cost. HCC’s performance remains high in these key areas and it will strive hard to build on this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]By adopting this approach (and others) identified in this response, local authorities will have created a sustainable framework of issues to ensure value for money. Consistently challenging the framework and the issues ensures value for money is sustained. Capacity, competence, challenge and collaboration should be evident in any approach.[bold]     
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Part III[bold] – Recommended areas for further review and analysis[bold]&#xa0;[bold]A serious i
[normal]nquiry into local government procurement will bring forward a range of responses from commentators and local authorities
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Work locally and nationally would suggest that the following topics are also essential for success:
