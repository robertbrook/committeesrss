"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from esure Group plc (CMI0009)\n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;\nesure Group plc is a top 10 personal lines insurer providing private car insurance to over 1.3million UK customers through its core brands, esure and Sheilas’ Wheels, plus the smaller First Alternative brand. We are active members of the Association of Bri\ntish Insurers and represented on the A\nBI’s General Insurance Council\n. \n&#xa0;\nWe submitted a detailed response to the original call for evidence by the Transport Select Committee and this paper should be read in conjunction with that response. In addition, we \nalso responded to the Ministry of Justice Consultation regarding the cost and frequency of whiplash claims.\n&#xa0;\nAs a major UK motor insurer we experience first hand the challenges outlined by both the committee and the MOJ in dealing with fraudulent and exaggerated whiplash claims, the cost of which is a major consideration when setting premium levels for UK \nconsume\nr\ns. Whilst we take the view that some progress has been made in reducing the costs associated with whiplash claims, there remains more work to do\n,\n particularly around tackling fraud.\n&#xa0;\nWe note the concerns of the Transport Select Committee\n that there is a d\nesire for clarity around how some of the proposals made thus far\n will be taken forward\n. In addition, a\n further request has been made f\no\nr\n stakeholders to set out what more can be done to tackle the whiplash issue.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst we have reviewed and contributed to\n the response formulated by our trade body, the Association of British Insurers, this papers sets out our views on the \nkey\n issues arising from the debate for the consideration of the committee.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDiscussion&#xa0;\nWhy is Further Reform Needed?\n&#xa0;\nThe starting \npoint when considering the way ahead is to look at the original motivation for trying to reform and improve the compensation system for genuinely injured claimants. The statistics speak for themselves in that the UK\n population\n makes a disproportionately hi\ngher number of whiplash claims when compared to other\n \nEuropean\n countries.\n&#xa0;\nThe insurance industry has long campaigned for a system with more teeth to tackle spurious personal injury claims and Governm\nent has responded by making a number of\n changes to the f\nunding of personal injury claims. There can be no dispute that car insurance premiums have been falling over the last 12-months and the latest Confused.Com/Towers Watson Car Insurance Price Index points to a 13.9% reduction over this period.\n&#xa0;\nTherefore, it\n is clear that the ind\nustry has been delivering on its promise to offer\n lower premiums for UK \nconsumer\ns. This has been achieved despite increases in personal injury awards of\n over 20% in the last 18-months alone.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere is a clear need for further \nreform if the savings delivered for consumers are to be sustainable in the \nmedium term and we believe the following\n are key \nareas for Government to focus on\n.\n&#xa0;\nIncrease in the Small Claims Track\n&#xa0;\nWe share the committee’s apparent view that the MOJ has been \ntoo dismissive of the possibility of raising the Small Claims Track (SCT) limit given that such a small proportion of personal injury claims now fall to be dealt with under the SCT. The current limit has been in place since 1991 and the latest statistics s\nuggest that only 9% of PI claims are dealt with by the SCT.\n&#xa0;\nBy definition, the SCT is designed and intended for simple, straightforward low value disputes. It is our considered view that straightforward, genuine whiplash claims do not necessarily require \nthe assistance of a Lawyer and claimants should be given an alternative route to compensation. There is often scepticism when an insurer offers to deal with a claimant directly and we believe that the platform for the electronic handling of claims is alrea\ndy in place and that this, when coupled with standardised medico-legal re\nport\ns\n, will\n provide a solution that is fit for purpose and will deliver cost and efficiency benefits.\n The bulk of whiplash claims do not entail complex legal issues.\n&#xa0;\nWe strongly beli\neve that Government should look again at increasing the SCT to £5,000 and consider the solutions put forward by the industry that will address any concerns around access to justice. The solutions include:\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn improve\nd system of\n education so that the public\n have awareness and visibility around how to make a claim, should they ever need to do so.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe mandatory use by claimants and defendants of a software based damages calibration tool ensuring consistent and transparent levels of personal injury damages.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n option of staff to be employed by the Portal Co to process paper claims for those without access to the internet or a personal preference \nto deal in paper.\n&#xa0;\nWe believe that this is the biggest opportunity missed by the MOJ and we would urge the committee \nto probe deeper into the decision to defer any increase for the time being.\n&#xa0;\nTackling Fraud\n&#xa0;\nAs \nreferred to\n previously, we share the concerns of the industry that more assistance is need\ned\n in tackling the problem of fraud. The ABI is seeking \nto \nshare great\ner amounts of data with organisations such as \nthe Motor Accident Solicitors Society (\nMASS\n)\n,\n the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers\n \n(\nAPIL\n)\n,\n Motor Insurers Bureau\n \n(\nMIB\n)\n and the Law Society but this focus is very much on facilitating the detection of fraud.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA significant difficulty for compensators however is the way in which the Courts deal with fraudulent claims once they \nhave been identified and it is submitted that the Judgment in Summers v Fairclough Holmes (2012) highlights the barriers \nfaced by compensators. T\nhe Court concluded that\n the\n strike out of a claim on account\n of fraud\n is permissible but only at the conclusion\n of the claim in \n‘\nexceptional circumstances\n’\n by which point substantial legal costs have been incurred. The compensator rarely recovers such costs.\n&#xa0;\nWe would like to see the law reformed in the area of fraud in personal injury claims with the default posit\nion b\neing\n automatic strike out of a claim where exaggeration or fraud is proven. We urge Government to give approval to the Law Commission proposal to undertake further work in this area.\n&#xa0;\nProgressing Reform of Medico-legal Reporting\n&#xa0;\nWe fully support Gove\nrnment proposals to reform medico-legal reporting in low value claims. A perverse system has developed whereby those preparing the reports are financially incentivised for firstly making a diagnosis of whiplash \nand then arguably some will\n secure greater le\nvels of work by providing the lengthiest prognosis period. \n&#xa0;\nWe are very much of the view that medico-legal reform is one of the easier issues to tackle given the apparent large areas of agreement between the ABI and \nMASS\n, the Association of Medical Report\n Associations (AMRO) and the Forum of Insurance Lawyers\n (FOIL)\n. We strongly advocate engagement and collaboration between the parties in order to bring absolute financial independence between the medic and those instructing them. Improved training and a sy\nstem of accreditation is very much needed so that those compiling reports on whiplash actually understand the condition. Standardised instructions (including documentary evidence around the accident itself\n)\n, reporting and a system of audit/peer review are \nall essential elements of successful reform in our opinion.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst improving the quality and accuracy of medico-legal reports is of paramount importance, the cost of medico-legal reporting is also in need of urgent review. Whilst informal agreements are i\nn place in the form of the AMRO Agreement, there is general acknowledgment \nthat \nthe\n fees are not enforceable and the Courts regularly depart \nfrom these rates and award higher amounts. As with the level of legal costs payable to lawyers, the costs payable \nfor medico-legal report\ns are now at artificially high levels.\n Referral fees were previously paid within the current fee structure, so it is clear that excess cost remains within the system.\n We support an evaluation of the true costs involved in producing a\n medico-legal report and following consultation/agreement the level of fees payable should be fixed within the CPR.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst we accept entirely that your recent call for evidence touches upon other areas outside the scope of this response, we have concentra\nted on the key areas, which we believe will make a real demonstrable difference in tackling fraud, reducing\n frequency and containing costs.\n \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4\n&#xa0;\n"
