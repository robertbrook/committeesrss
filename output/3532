defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) is the
default national body which supports 
defaultPolice and Crime Commissioners (‘
defaultPCCs

default and other local policing bodies
default.  This document sets out the key views that have been expresse
defaultd by 
defaultPCCs 
defaultand their officers
default.  S

defaultwill no doubt be aware of some of the key background material to this Inquiry, including the Home Office proposals and consultation on crime outcome, the UK Statistics Authority consultation on aligning the Code of Practice, and recent HMIC Inspection repo
defaultrts on police crime recording – the most recent 
default‘The Crime Scene’ dating to January 2012.   This latter report in particular has guided some of the answers set out below in relation to the understanding of the accuracy of crime data.  We believe that HMIC 
defaultwill shortly start a Data Quality inspection, which will look again at crime recording data in forces and may provide some interesting insights into some of the questions posed by the Inquiry.

defaultConsistency and comparability
default 
defaulthas emerged as a key common is
defaultsue raised by the PCCs that responded.  
defaultThis is a complex area and there are anomalies caused in part by the system and in part by the nature of statistics.  In the case of the former, for instance, Anti-Social Behaviour incidents 
defaultdo not count as crimes un
defaultder the rules, and the lin
defaulte between ASB, public disorder and low level violence is often blurred
default.  There is also some local flexibility in how rules are applied
default (for instance the time during which a crime must be recorded), which can also cause some anomal
defaulties.   There are a number of caveats that apply to statistics and raw data no matter how accurate it is, such as the need to 
defaultinterpret and triangulat
defaulte 
defaultwith other evidence, before 
defaulti
defaultt can be coherently understood.
default  These issues are explored in more detail be
defaultlow in the context of the questions set out by the PASC.  
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultSpecific Pointsdefault&#xa0;
defaultQ1
default              
defaultAre crimes being recorded by the police when they should be? Are crimes being categorised correctly?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe general feeling which PCCs expressed
default, based on internal and external 
defaultchecks, was that
default crimes were being recorded and categorised correctly
default on the whole
default, within the
defaultir areas and within the
default limitations imposed by the system
default and the nature of statistics themselves.
default  However, human error and a number of the other issues addresse
defaultd at Q2 do lead to discrepancies, but as
default noted 
defaultat Q3
default, there are a number of checks and balances incorporated in the system already to try to ensure that recording and categorisation is accurate
default, although the nature of checks and balances can vary.  Taken t
defaultogether this means 
defaultthat there are some inconsistencies nationally and some dangers inherent in direct comparisons of raw data.
default   
defaultSome PCCs are also concerned that b
defaultudget cuts might impact on resources dedicated to quality control
default, and some PCCs feel that t
defaulthe whole system is too process based and does not taken enough account of victims’ views and needs, or allow for a common-sense approach
default.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2
default              
defaultWhat are the factors which can influence police mis-recording of crime?
default&#xa0;
defaultA number of factors have been suggested by PCCs.  One of the key issues identified is the short time slot allowed under the rules for officers to record an incident as a crime, which puts pressure on them 
defaultto make a judgement, 
defaultwithout sufficient time to con
defaultsider all the circumstances, and especially the victim’s wishes.
default&#xa0;
defaultOther factors suggested include human error,
default subjective interpretation, complexity of HO Counting Rules and
default lack of knowledge (particularly in relation to rarer types of crime
default, or recording 
defaultof multiple crimes arising from one incident
default),
default 
defaultthe bureaucracy of the process itself (which can result in short cuts being taken)
default, organisational culture (particularly around compliance issues, such as reluctance to challenge fellow officers), and level of
default scrutiny.  Several respondents also noted th
defaultat targets can encourage perverse incentives, but also noted that the trend generally both from Government and PCCs is to move away from targets which has helped the problem of ‘gaming’ to meet ‘quotas’.  But th
defaultere is still some feeling that the general pressure to show reduced rates of crime might still be leading to 
defaultsome down-grading of crime incidents to non-crime incidents, such as ASB. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3
default              
defaultAre the right checks in place to ensure that the systems for 
defaultrecording crime function effectively and accurately?
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are a significant number of quality control checks already in place, although the nature and depth of scrutiny can vary from force to force.  However, typically as a minimum, these would include i
defaultnternal audit, crime registrar, external checks, such as periodic HMIC inspection, 
defaulttriangulation with other data, 
defaultand a degree of oversight from force management board and PCC. 
default  
defaultMuch depends on the quality of the audit, although s
defaultome forces 
defaultalso 
defaultinclude a
defaultdditional checks, such as external audit, dip sampling of crime recording and categorisation examples, additional levels of internal control process, or
default 
defaultIT systems which 
defaultflag
default erroneous data.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultGreater transparency can also play a role in raising standards
default and 
defaulthighlighting areas of concern – although it should be noted that there remain concerns about the extent to which data is truly comparable, for reasons already noted, and whether comparison of this nature is desirable, given the more local focus of PCC
defaults.  Ultimately, it is for PCCs to hold the force to account (through the Chief Constable), and they will be concerned to ensure that crime recording meets local needs and expectations (see Q6 below).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4
default              
defaultHas enough been done to ensure the integrity of cri
defaultme data? What more should be done?
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a balanc
defaulte to be struck between accuracy
default and the cost of quality control mechanisms
default, and some PCCs raised concerns about whether existing checks are sustainable in the current financial climate.  
defaultThe anticipated 
defaultHMIC Data Quality Inspection should throw some interesting light on 
defaultwhat more could be done
default, and some PCC respondees suggested 
defaultthat new mobile technology may help, or perhaps more training
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, a 
defaultmore fundamental debate may be
default needed 
defaulta
defaultbout whether di
defaultscrepancies from place to place are 
defaultan inevitable consequence of greater local accountability
default and responsiveness to victims (
defaultprovided the differences 
defaultthis generates 
defaultare transparent
default, understood
default and accounted for
default)
default, or whether 
defaultconsistency and comparability ar
defaulte paramount, 
defaultwhich would involve 
defaultgreater ce
defaultntralisation
default, s
defaulttricter rules
default and probably higher costs flowing from the greater bureaucracy involved.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5
default              
defaultTo what extent can policy-makers have confidence in the statistics which result from the recording of crim
defaulte by police forces?
default&#xa0;
defaultMost PCCs 
defaultwho 
defaultresponded felt that some confidence could be place
defaultd
default in the data
default (given its limitations)
default, 
defaultand that it was a key factor in how they held the
defaultir
default force to account.  They acknowledge there are problems with comparability (for r
defaulteasons already discussed), but at least some PCCs felt that the key issues was whether it met the needs of local communities, not necessarily national policy makers.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThere was some feeling that the 
defaultreal question here was whether the public had confidence in the data, and whether something should be done to improve their perception of statistics.  
defaultThere was also some concern that there is anecdotal evidence that some crimes, including serious crimes a
defaultre not reported by the public and some thought is needed as to how communities can be encouraged to fully report crime.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6
default              
defaultShould recorded crime statistics be classified as National Statistics?
default&#xa0;
defaultThere were mixed feeling on this amongst the PCCs that 
defaultresponded.  Some thought they should as it would help with perceptions of independence, one thought this could only really work for long term trends, but others thought this should be substantially a local issue and the
defaultrefore not a National Statistic.

defaultAnnexdefault&#xa0;defaultTO APCC Submission to PASC Inquiry into Crime Statisticsdefault&#xa0;defaultIndividual Responses from PCCsdefault&#xa0;
defaultA.default              defaultDevon and Cornwalldefault&#xa0;
defaultPlease find below our responses to the questions posed by the above inquiry.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe fundamental dilemma highlighted here is the focus on accuracy rather than reliability. In answer to the questions posed (i.e. is the data accurate?) the response would be that most forces endeavour to meet the National Crime Recording Standards and the
default Home Office Counting Rules and adhere to high standards of ethical recording practices. However the more pertinent question seems to be whether data can be compared between forces with confidence (i.e. is the data reliable). The answer to this is almost c
defaultertainly not. There is a degree of flexibility in the system currently that whilst recording in accordance with the guidance set out in the National Crime Recording Standards and within agreed time frames there are significant differences in how the result
defaulting data is interpreted. For example with regard to when a crime is recorded, in Devon and Cornwall we direct record (as soon as an offence is disclosed it is recorded on the crime system and is not necessarily recorded first on the incident management sys
defaulttem). This means that if we subsequently discover that no offence was committed we have to provide evidence that no offence took place before we can no-crime. In terms of comparison to other forces this means that not only do we have a higher no-crime rate
default than might otherwise be expected but also that more offences remain on the record than might be the case for other forces who conduct some early investigation to corroborate the occurrence of an offence. In addition how each force interprets the NCRS can 
defaultvary slightly but significantly, for example the line between anti-social behaviour (a non-crime incident), public disorder (an offence against society) and low level violence (a victim-based crime) is very blurred. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultPolitics – an issue or offence that is high on the national or local political agenda may influence the tendency of either individuals or organisations to record an offence in a certain way. This is not to suggest that 
defaultfigures are deliberately manipulated but rather that there is a human tendency to want to conform. 
defaultScrutiny – whether local performance frameworks or HMIC inspections, scrutiny can influence compliance. In addition to the potential for perverse incentives
default through performance frameworks there is also potential for forces to adopt recording practices that are not necessarily compatible with other forces following an adverse inspection.
defaultHuman error – whether systematic as a result of competence or the result 
defaultof a distraction or an off-day the police crime recording system is heavily reliant on people, their abilities, attention and attitudes, and as such is vulnerable to associated limitations.
defaultOrganisational culture – an organisation that promotes integrity, 
defaultpersonal responsibility and has a sound supervision structure in place is likely to achieve a high level of compliance and to identify non-compliance issues earlier.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default&#xa0;
defaultAre the right checks in place to ensure that the systems for recording crime function
default effectively and accurately? 
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrent checks include internal force audits, external inspections, publication of data, the Crime Survey for England &amp; Wales and crime comparator systems. The Police &amp; Crime Commissioners have a role to play in monitoring t
defaultrends and holding forces to account where the information emerging from existing checks indicates an issue relating to recording. What seems to be missing is any means of identifying and accounting for the intrinsic differences in how forces record offence
defaults.
default&#xa0;
default Interestingly the questions posed do not address explicitly the recording of outcomes against offences, which potentially raises further issues.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default&#xa0;
defaultHas enough been done to ensure the integrity of crime data? What more should be done?
default&#xa0;
defaultA balanced app
defaultroach is needed to ensure that the data is as accurate and reliable as possible, and that limitations in the data are openly recognised and as far as possible accounted for without compromising operational delivery or imposing a significant financial burde
defaultn. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are a number of potential solutions to the issues raised. Perhaps the most extreme would be to consider centralising crime recording such that forces record and manage incidents from the incident log but a national or regional team would determ
defaultine whether the incident was a crime and record this appropriately. An even more robust recording framework, mandating the point of crime recording and outcomes might offer some solution however it runs the risk of becoming operationally unwieldy and unwor
defaultkable. A further alternative is to accept that there will always be difference and instead to identify a means of measuring more reliably, and accounting for, variability in compliance between forces.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo what extent can policy-makers have confidence i
defaultn the statistics which result from the recording of crime by police forces?
default&#xa0;
defaultThis question speaks more to how the data is used and interpreted than to either the accuracy or the reliability of the data. Police recorded data in isolation is often not the 
defaultbest data source and even police forces will use other available data sources including other partners and proxy data to identify and address policy issues. The confidence of policy-makers needs to be in the capability and competence of analysts to use the
default data appropriately, to recognise its limitations and to address these through other valid sources.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default&#xa0;
defaultShould recorded crime statistics be classified as National Statistics?
default&#xa0;
defaultIt isn’t entirely clear what this would deliver to address the issues raised. 
defaultIf this would add weight to forces to improve compliance or support a more robust recording framework then there might be some value.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultB.default              defaultDorsetdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Committee is interested in receiving responses to the following questions: 
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn my view yes to the first question. The NCRS has become more and more proscriptive, and Force Registrars and HMIC regularly audit the crimes. There is a gap between ASB reports and
default recording, but as these are not technically crimes, I think the Forces in general comply well. I know Dorset has, I scrutinise this closely, and HMIC have praised the Force in 2011. However, the cuts are reducing governance and oversight staff, so this co
defaultuld get worse.
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe second question is the same, once the call enters the system, various balances and checks exist to ensure categorisation is appropriate. One thing that does need sorting is the “72 hour rule” that most Forces adopt to serious sexual offe
defaultnce allegations. Research shows that what is reported at 3am on a Saturday night as a rape is often downgraded in the cold light of day, hence Forces adopting the 72 hour rule. I think this should be stopped, BUT it will lead to a massive increase in rape 
defaultallegations that, when scrutinised later, are actually indecent assaults. 
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack of knowledge of the hundreds of crime categories, and failure to embrace more than one offence. For exam
defaultple, an ex partner harassing a partner could be DA and harassment, but only one or the other would be recorded. Likewise with trafficking of humans, often the different offence in relation to CSE, forced labour or prostitution is recorded, not embracing th
defaulte bigger picture. I have dealt with a case where a constituent had her foot run over by an offender in a parking dispute. The police recorded this as an RTA, when it was in fact an assault. And RTA v Assault brings lots of issues for the victim, especially
default in relation to disclosure and compensation. 
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack of time, and lack of correct oversight, as the cuts bite, Crime Registrar staff and CMU supervisors are being cut
defaultYes, please see above
defaultI am happy the checks and 
defaultbalances are in place, but we cannot be complacent.
defaultPretty well, except for the overriding issue of – What happens if crime isn’t 
defaultbeing recorded. I remain convinced that lack of faith in police action and lack of faith in the 101 service leads a massive amount of crime being unreported.
defaultYes they should.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultC.default              defaultHumbersidedefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMany thanks for affording me the opportunity to submit written evidence in relation to your inquiry into crime statistics.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis inquiry is timely as Police and Crime 
defaultCommissioners are one-year into their roles in holding their Chief Constable to account for the delivery of policing on behalf of the public.  This inquiry must consider the impact of this significant development.  It should take into account the improveme
defaultnt in 
defaultlocal accountability, and the transparency, contextualisation and timeliness of information to the public by Police and Crime Commissioners, especially when compared to the time-lag in publishing national statistics which generally have little in the
default way of local context.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 1: Are crimes being recorded by the police when they should be? Are crimes being categorised correctly?default&#xa0;
defaultWe have all seen the continued reductions in recorded crime over the last several years and the ‘gap’ between recorded
default crime statistics and the crime survey results.  This ‘gap’ is arguably one of the reasons behind some of the dissatisfaction we hear from the public about published crime statistics.
default&#xa0;
defaultLocally, this ‘gap’ has been relatively small and consistent over the y
defaultears due to the ethical approach adopted locally, following the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) 
defaultto the letter
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat has 
defaultnot
default happened over this period is a proper and informed debate about the victims ‘needs’ and a more common-sense approach to re
defaultcording for certain crime categories.  For example, there is a tendency to ‘crime’ criminal damage or the more minor ‘violent’ incidents when the victim may merely want some form of restorative solution and does not feel a crime has been committed.  Police
default officers are not always afforded this kind of discretion and the NCRS rules sometimes take an element of this away from them.
default&#xa0;
defaultLocally, we have tended to take a risk-averse approach to the recording of crime.  This has arguably been a contributory factor 
defaultin our higher levels of crime when compared to our peers.  This makes comparison difficult, but also raises the question over whether it is possible or even necessary to have national comparative statistics, especially as the focus of Police and Crime Comm
defaultissioners is predominantly on local provision.  It also raises the question over whether a national standard for crime recording should continue to be viewed as achievable or even necessary.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe other thing we have to remember with recorded crime statisti
defaultcs is that whilst the ‘traditional’ crimes (burglary, vehicle crime, and so on) are falling, fraud is replacing such crimes as the offence of choice for an increasing number of offenders.  The clear message needs to be that whilst other reported crime decr
defaulteases, fraud in the 
defaultUK
default is growing.  We also know that a large volume of fraud remains unreported, due to a number of factors such as victimisation of vulnerable and hard to reach groups, and we do not know the full scale of the threat and its impact on our
default local communities.  By focusing on ‘traditional’ crime recording, we are also in fear of putting our resources 
defaultnot
default in the places where they are most needed and will reap the greatest benefit to victims and our communities.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt terms of the categorisation 
defaultof crimes, my biggest concern is in relation to elements of violent crime.  The category of violent crime 
defaultwithout injury
default can at times be a ‘catch all’.  Although it is right that we somehow capture minor assaults, as they could be an indicator of escalatin
defaultg activity by a person, whether we should ‘mix’ these incidents in with 
defaultall
default violent crime is questionable.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a further anomaly around violent crime.  Locally we are viewed as having one of the highest levels of recorded violent crime and yet a very
default low homicide level.  This undermines the validity of the data to some extent and an overall high rate of violent crime doesn’t display the local context, where we 
defaultdon’t
default have a culture of more serious and gun crime that you see in other areas of the countr
defaulty.  People make the incorrect assumption that they live in a violent place according to the statistics, whereas the reality is somewhat different in most parts of Humberside.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 2: What are the factors which can influence police mis-recording of cridefaultme?default&#xa0;
defaultFollowing on from Question 1, they key issue is the time-frame for criming.
default&#xa0;
defaultI believe we need to question whether the police are sometimes too quick to crime an incident before taking into account the victims wishes and feelings.  The NCRS rules have
default to some extent taken away the common-sense element of policing.  There is no doubt in my mind that recording rules are a necessity, but we need to look potentially at a ‘cooling off’ period for certain crime types and the ability for discretion by police 
defaultofficers to take what they consider to be an appropriate response (which might not include criming), whilst ultimately record what is right after taking such time and accounting for the victims needs.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe removal of the target culture has undoubtedly 
defaulthelped in reducing the possibility of ‘gaming’ by officers categorising crimes incorrectly, e.g. criming a dwelling burglary as a theft from dwelling when they may have reached their ‘quota’ of dwelling burglaries for the month.  This type of activity must
default be discouraged and the removal of a target culture helps in this respect.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, the over reliance on quantitative data combined with simplistic and inappropriate centrally set targets in the past has, in my opinion, 
defaultcorrupted policing and led to pdefaulterverse outcomes, devoid of common sense that has undermined public confidencedefault.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 3: Are the right checks in place to ensure that the systems for recording crime functions effectively and accurately?default&#xa0;
defaultThe Police and Crime Commissioners are there to
default hold their Chief Constable to account on behalf of the public.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe question we need to ask is whether public perception of crime recording reflects the reality.  It is important that systems are in place locally and that they are effective for local circ
defaultumstances.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn Humberside, as part of my Police and Crime Plan, I will be rolling out mobile technology to ensure officers are visible in our local neighbourhoods and in the places where they are most required.  We need to recognise the risks in rolling-ou
defaultt such technology, ensuring the correct impact on crime recording, consistency and the use of common-sense by officers to individual situations.
default&#xa0;
defaultI am aware of the work by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) around data integrity.  This relie
defaults on a limited sample and doesn’t fully take into account the work undertaken by local Crime Registrars in their audits, findings and learning points.  This local element to me is important to ensure that our systems locally are as effective and accurate a
defaults they can be.  We need to create an atmosphere where we do things right for the victim in the first instance and correct any issues quickly if things do not go as expected.
default&#xa0;
defaultI will give an example where it could be questioned whether crimes are being reco
defaultrded accurately.  Locally we have a high incidence of criminal damage (a crime) and a low incidence of anti-social behaviour (an incident).  It could be argued that we have taken a risk-averse approach to recording, hence the high-level of criminal damage.
default  Less risk-averse approaches could produce a more ‘balanced’ level of crimes and incidents.  Our approach indicates that we could be over-recording criminal damage, although our data integrity audits show that NCRS compliance is excellent, i.e. we’re 
defaultnot
default 
defaultover-recording.  But this raises two questions: (i) whether others are following a similar line and (ii) the comparability of figures between forces.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 4: Has enough been done to ensure the integrity of crime data? What more should be done?default&#xa0;
defaultSee an
defaultswer 3 above.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 5: To what extent can policy-makers have confidence in the statistics which result from the recording of crime by police forces?default&#xa0;
defaultIt is important for Police and Crime Commissioners to have confidence in their statistics locally in o
defaultrder to hold to account the Chief Constable on behalf of the public.  This is important for me at a local level.
default&#xa0;
defaultI am uncertain as to the level of confidence within other police forces and the ability for national policy-makers to have confidence in this 
defaultdata.  However, the duties of the Police and Crime Commissioner are clear, and if they are undertaken adequately then confidence in the data should be high.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 6: Should recorded crime statistics be classified as National Statistics?default&#xa0;
defaultIt is importan
defaultt that the statistics are accurate at a local level as part of my statutory duties.  The focus on local solutions through local statistics must be the way forward in the first instance.
default&#xa0;
defaultI believe that the National Statistics can be unrepresentative of the
default local picture.  In addition, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) now tend to produce quarterly figures which are devoid of context and tend to merely restate those figures presented to them in the first instance.  This is due in part to the risk-avers
defaulte nature of crime statistics publications.  However, the ONS has produced guidance on the publication of local data which is useful to follow.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe also need to bear in mind that we should all move away from the current culture of the recorded crime data be
defaulting seen as the ‘result’ which is then often used as the stick.  We need to move to a place where the figures are used as ‘guidance’, for what they tell us as part of an overall holistic assessment of performance.  This includes a mixture of local qualitat
defaultive as well as quantitative data.
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, we need to publish statistics with context and in a manner which incentivises people to reporting and/or forces to record.  The clearest examples are the increasing rates of sexual crime and domestic violence 
defaultthat are evident throughout many parts of the country at present.  Such rises are depicted by the media and others as failure, whereas what they actually demonstrate is success through partnership working and the increase in the confidence of victims to re
defaultport the crime by the variety of means we make available to them.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe more serious crimes tend to be grossly underreported and we must make all efforts to encourage reporting of such crimes.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default Generally police are recording crime when reported.
default&#xa0;
default The main area of current concern we have is over cybercrime.
default&#xa0;
default Fraud cybercrime has 
default&#xa0;
defaultbeen taken out of police crime statistics, leading to an impression of crime going down.
default&#xa0;
default But we know thi
defaults is a large growing area of criminality often going un-reported.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe need to ensure that Action Fraud data is included in crime statistics in the future.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default Setting targets on specific crime types can influence mis-recording – potentially lea
defaultding to mis-categorisation of crimes e.g. recording burglary as criminal damage in order to meet crime reduction or detection targets.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultGenerally the move by many PCCs away from targets should lead to more ethical behaviour and better integrity in crime r
defaultecording.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;defaultAs PCC for Thames Valley, I am reasonably assured that the Force (TVP) is recording crime in an appropriate and ethical manner.  The evidence for this is founded on two key sources. Firs
defaulttly, HMICs thematic review (late 2011) of TVPs crime and data quality.  This showed that the Force had the best 
defaultaccuracy rates for crime recording. Additionally, TVP was the only force in the country with 100% accuracy in relation to ‘No Crime’ decisions. 
defaultHMI concluded that ....
default‘The force has high standards when recording crimes and incidents in a consistent and accurate manner to correctly reflect the sequence of events as described by victims’.
default&#xa0;
defaultSecondly, an Internal Audit of TVP’s Performance Management 
defaultfunction was carried out in April 2013. The key controls for the collection and recording data were given full and/ or majority assurance.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultPressures to reduce crime rates could act as perverse incentives for some crimes to be downgraded, or, downgrading ASB related incidents (which are not captured in data returns to the Home Office). 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe move to Neighborhood Policing may have also led to m
defaultore low level crimes being dealt with informally and outside the formal crime recording system.
default&#xa0;
default3.default&#xa0;default  Are the right checks in place to ensure that the systems for recording crime function effectively and accurately? default&#xa0;defaultAs mentioned above, both HMIC and our 
defaultown OPCC Internal Audit Section undertake periodic reviews of the Force’s performance systems – this assurance informs our confidence of TVP’s crime recording systems.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, it would be short-sighted not to recognise some of the wider issues affecting 
defaultcrime recording systems. Anecdotal evidence across wider policing circles suggests that league tables and performance targets have created a culture of ‘Gaming’ – manipulating crime data to meet targets and measures.
default&#xa0;
defaultExternal checks need to better focus o
defaultn Police culture, particularly around high ethical standards to ensure practices are conducted in a consistent manner. Other key areas are the skills and training of staff, backed up with sound quality assurance processes.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultEarlier this year, the Kent PCC commissioned HMIC to examine Kent Police’s crime and resolution figures to ensure that local people had confidence in the accuracy of such figures. Findings from this i
defaultnspection found that the force had under recorded crime, and, that crime was not being resolved in accordance with national requirements.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere need to be further examples in which HMIC ‘name and shame’ Chief Constables/Forces where similar sharp practice
defaults may be happening elsewhere. Failure to tackle this issue may, at best, suggest not enough expertise within HMIC to shine a light on such practices; at worse, highlight a more cynical complicity in this type of culture.
default&#xa0;
default5. default&#xa0;defaultTo what extent can policy-makedefaultrs have confidence in the statistics which result from the recording of crime by police forces?default&#xa0;
defaultPolicy makers do have confidence in the statistics – they are able to triangulate quantitative and qualitative sources of data/information to create an informed picture. Statistics in isolation can be 
defaultmisleading and can be used incorrectly. Great care need
defaults to be used when quoting statistics to ensure the context is properly explained. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPerhaps the key question here is not whether policy-makers have confidence in the statistics, but ‘
defaultdo the public believe the statistics they are being told? (Difference bet
defaultween the perception of crime and the actual crime).
default&#xa0;
default6.default&#xa0;default Should recorded crime statistics be classified as National Statistics? default&#xa0;defaultYes, classifying crime statistics as National Statistics would go some way to demonstrate better independence and more effecti
defaultve governance and accountability (as displayed by the Home Office who transferred this function over to the ONS). 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, given all government departments are operating in a climate of challenging austerity measures, there is a counter-argument which questions what the true cost-benefits of ‘National Statistics’ are. Who benefits the most: policy makers and statistic
defaultians, or the public? Are the public interested - how can they be better engaged in such matters?   If you were a victim of crime, what would matter the most to you?
