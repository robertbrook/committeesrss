[normal]Written evidence from the RMT Union (TIC 09[bold]1[bold])[bold]Introduction[bold]The National Union of Rail, Maritime &amp; Transport Workers welcomes the opportunity to respond to the TRANSCOM request for written evidence on
[normal] passenger transport in isolated communities.
[normal]RMT is the largest of the UK rail unions, representing over 80,000 members, 
[normal]across all sectors of the transport industry
[normal]. 
[normal]Executive summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1[bold] 
[normal]RMT believes that the provision of transport services in isolated communities is necessary for 
[normal]e
[normal]nsuring both socia
[normal]l inclusion and economic growth and that 
[normal]Value for Money must include the cost and benefits to society as a whole.  Britain’s public transport
[normal] network has clearly defined economic, social and environmental objectives which cannot be viewed in isolation.
[normal]1.2[bold] 
[normal]RMT believes that isolated communities would be best served within an integrated, publically owned and publically run transport network. 
[normal]Over the course of this document RMT will highlight the current threats posed by government policy to passengers from isolated communities, using example
[normal]s
[normal] from the
[normal] maritime, bus
[normal] and rail industries.
[normal]2.1[bold] 
[normal]In terms o
[normal]f maritime transport in isolated communities, lifeline ferry services are the most appropriate example to use, in particular in relation to Scotland which, as 
[normal]an island nation
[normal],
[normal] is heavily dependent on the shipping industry, as indeed is the whole of the UK
[normal]. 
[normal]L
[normal]ifeline ferry services to the Northern Isles (Orkney and Shetland) and the numerous island communities living off the west coast of Scotland are an especially important passenger transport link for these isolated communities. 
[normal]2.2[bold] 
[normal]The provision and 
[normal]preservation of publicly owned and run Scottish ferry services has long been a campaigning issue for the RMT and predecessor union the National Union of Seamen. Despite the Scottish Government’s decision to 
[normal]privatise
[normal] ferry services to the Northern Isles by
[normal] awarding the 2012-18 contract to Serco, RMT remain hopeful that the larger contract for ferry services to islands of the west coast (Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services – CHFS) will stay in the public sector under Caledonian 
[normal]MacBrayne
[normal] when the 2016-22 contr
[normal]act is awarded.
[normal]2.3[bold] 
[normal]Indeed, EU legislation covering the procurement of state 
[normal]subsidised
[normal] public services, under which Scottish ferry services are required to be re-tendered 
[normal]mi
[normal]litates
[normal] against the interests of the isolated communities that depend upon these v
[normal]essels for contact with the mainland. 
[normal]T
[normal]his requirement not only 
[normal]destabilises
[normal] a lifeline public transport service but inherently 
[normal]favours
[normal] the 
[normal]private shipping industry which can afford to re-submit bids every 6 years whereas incumbent public sector operators
[normal] face a number of political and economic problems when bidding to continue running these services every 6 years.
[normal]2.4[bold] 
[normal]This is a devolved issue, given that Transport Scotland and the Scottish Government awards the contracts for Scottish ferry services but we
[normal] believe the Transport Select Committee should include the passenger transport needs of isolated island communities in Scotland in their deliberations. 
[normal]3.1[bold] 
[normal]RMT, with a large number of other concerned organisat
[normal]i
[normal]ons, wro
[normal]te to the Chancellor on 30 May 2013 to outline our opposition to future cuts to bus services.  This letter 
[normal]is attached.  It outlines th
[normal]e
[normal] fact 
[normal]that 
[normal]“
[normal]i
[normal]n terms of transport and social inclusion, b
[normal]uses offer great value for public money. Nearly 5 billion bus trips are made each year and bus commuters help generate over £64 billion of economic output. Every £1 of public investment in buses provides between £3 and £5 of wider benefits to local economi
[normal]es 
[normal]as well as
[normal] social and environmental well
[normal]-being. This is a 
[normal]return that is higher than for many transport infrastructure schemes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2[bold] 
[normal]“
[normal]Buses are essential for the quarter of UK households without a car. Over half of households on the lowest incomes fall
[normal] into this category and bus use rises as income falls. Young people need reliable and affordable bus services in order to take up opportunities in education and employment, whilst providing a vital lifeline to access public services. For disabled people, a
[normal]ccessible public transport is crucial in keeping people connected to the communities that their disability can often cut them off from. For people in rural areas, buses are often essential not just for work and education, but for independence. Buses are al
[normal]so important for leisure use, helping people gain access to and travel around the countryside more sustainably; they often also contribute to the overall visitor experience. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3[bold] 
[normal]“
[normal]The cuts to bus funding stand
[normal] in stark contrast to Government commitments t
[normal]o restore the economy and get people working. Evidence shows that many people who want to work are unable to take jobs, or are forced on to benefits, because of insufficient and expensive bus provision. A third of jobseekers say poor transport options are 
[normal]the biggest barrier to finding work. Local businesses depend on customers getting to the shops and services on the bus. High streets up and 
[normal]down the country will be damaged if bus services are cut, causing
[normal] 
[normal]unemployment and holding back economic recovery. R
[normal]edundancies in the bus industry, and the associated negative social and economic impacts, will also be felt as a result of bus cuts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4[bold] 
[normal]Bus services are essential to the objectives of a number of government departments. Spending on buses benefits Depart
[normal]ment of Work and Pensions, through reducin
[normal]g welfare spending by providing
[normal] jobseekers with access to employment, the Dep
[normal]artment of Health, through long-
[normal]term independence, access to healthcare
[normal] and the shift away from car use to other forms of transport such 
[normal]as walking that promote physical activity, the Department for Education through providing access to schools and colleges and of course transport and the wider economy. Because of this, we are calling on the Government to recognise the cross
[normal]‐
[normal]departmental benefits of bus spending and 
[normal]reinstate
[normal] support for BSOG and local authority grants via funding pooled from across relevant departments. This innovative solution would protect bus services and keep the wheels of the economy moving
[normal]”
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5[bold] 
[normal]Follo
[normal]wing the cuts over 
[normal]recent
[normal] years to the bus service operators grant (the only funding local bus services receive) l
[normal]ocal authority supported services declined by 10% in non-metropolit
[normal]an areas
[normal]. Evidence from our surveys of bus services suggests that commercia
[normal]l services are now also under severe pressure as the 
[normal]cut in the 
[normal]BSOG 
[normal]and local authority funding comes in.
[normal] 
[normal]4.1[bold] 
[normal]The UK’s privatised railway is failing society, the economy and the environment, whilst draining taxpayer
[normal]s’ money into the pockets of private shareholders. Common sense and expert railway knowledge have ceded to a misguided private-must-be
[normal]-
[normal]best ethos, leaving Britain with a fragmented dysfunctional railway system that other countries view with disbelief.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2[bold] 
[normal]Excessive costs in the UK rail industry have recently been highlighted by the McNulty Review. This study criticised waste from fragmentation and complexity in our railways, but ignored the obvious solution: simplify the system. Instead, the Review propose
[normal]s more fragmentation. Analysts have predicted the McNulty approach would lead to older trains, higher fares, 
[normal]and 
[normal]fewer ser
[normal]vices off-peak and at weekends. This would obviously lead to 
[normal]fewer 
[normal]and lower quality 
[normal]services to isolated 
[normal]communities. Large sums of m
[normal]oney would still be lost to inefficiencies 
[normal]caused by
[normal] complex contractual agreements between dozens of companies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3[bold] 
[normal]The costs associated with fragmentation and leakage of public money out of the railway translate into social costs. A portion of the publi
[normal]c monies allocated for investment to increase the railway’s capacity and to improve services has instead been diverted to provide private profit. That money could have been spent on
[normal] rebuilding and 
[normal]staffing 
[normal]run-down stations, and re-opening missing links to
[normal] make the railway work better
[normal] for isolated 
[normal]communities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4[bold] 
[normal]Leakage of money out of the privatised railway system has also reduced the amount that can be invested in rail improvements to stimulate economic activity and regeneration. This represents a 
[normal]lost opportunity. For example, there is evidence that towns that lack good transport links to their nearest main city are falling behind economically: research by the Centre for Cities showed that poor train services were resulting in a widening ‘wealth ga
[normal]p’ between such towns as Burnley and Blackburn and Manchester
[normal]. There are sizeable towns lacking rail links which could benefit
[normal] 
[normal]from reopening rail lines and stations to attract economic investment and offer residents access to more work opportunities
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Ac
[normal]cording to the 2010, national rail transport survey, commuting accounts for 63 % of all rail journeys.
[normal] 
[normal]Open Access
[normal]4.5[bold] 
[normal]Recent political discourse, accompanied by an Office of Rail Regulation consultation, has called for an increase in open access operations which the RMT believes would have a devastating impact on the 
[normal]rail network as a whole, but in particular by increasin
[normal]g fragmentation and severely disadvantaging isolated communities. As such, 
[normal]RMT is totally opposed to any increase in open access operations
[normal].
[normal]4.6[bold] 
[normal]RMT is concerned that the government’s intention to increase these kind of operations will see the systematic d
[normal]rain
[normal]ing
[normal] of public money from the rail network increase as operators choose only to operate services on a commercial basis, with no rega
[normal]rd to socially necessary routes serving isolated communities.
[normal]4.7[bold] 
[normal]In the past we have witnessed the withdrawal of open ac
[normal]cess operations when the ownership of a franchise holding train operating company has changed, such as in the case of the 
[normal]Wrexham
[normal] and 
[normal]Shropshire
[normal] Railway.
[normal]4.8[bold] 
[normal]Furthermore, 
[normal]RMT has noted the registration of open access companies on lines such as the East Coa
[normal]st mainline by operators who are also bidding for the franchise, clearly demonstrating that both the franchising and open access systems are open to abuse. 
[normal]4.9[bold] 
[normal]Open access operations are even 
[normal]more
[normal] 
[normal]un
[normal]stable than the current franchising system with no oblig
[normal]ation being placed on the operator to provide any services above the bare minimum commercial services. Not only does this lead to a neglect of the sections of the railway connecting towns and villages to larger cities, but it can also lead to overcrowding 
[normal]on intercity routes.
[normal]Dual focus franchises
[normal]4.10[bold] 
[normal]Isolated communities have faced a further threat from a concept known as a dual-focus franchise.
[normal]4.11[bold] 
[normal]This type of franchise model is divi
[normal]ding the franchised routes in
[normal]t
[normal]o 
[normal]two separate railways - 
[normal]one economically viable and one socially necessary. 
[normal]4.12[bold] 
[normal]RMT 
[normal]has noted proposals in re-franchising consultation papers which 
[normal]would increase
[normal] the fragmentation and the complexity of the railway. 
[normal]4.13[bold] 
[normal]For example, t
[normal]he proposal to subdivide the Scottish rail
[normal] network in terms of routes, fares, what is economically viable (profitable) and what is socially necessary (not profitable) in addition to creating entirely separate franchises for services such as the Caledonian Sleeper Services will be dis
[normal]astrous for Sc
[normal]otland’s railway, and in particular for isolated communities.
[normal]4.14[bold] 
[normal]Essentially
[normal] the dual focus concept 
[normal]means shifting most of the responsibility for the socially necessary routes from the train operator onto the taxpayer and passenger, leaving the franchise
[normal]e with the most profitable routes to exploit.
[normal]Staff and accessibility
[normal]4.15[bold] 
[normal]We have attached the additional evidence submitted to the Transport Committee by the RMT, TUC, ASLEF, TSSA and Unite which outlines the threat to jobs on the railway by the McNulty 
[normal]Value for Money study and also the impact of such cuts on passenger services, safety and accessibility.
[normal]4.16[bold] 
[normal]RMT believes that cutting staffing levels will create heightened problems on passenger services, safety and accessibility in isolated communities
[normal]. 
[normal]The problems of areas with poor transport links will be compounded if passengers are deterred from  using the railways due to safety fears over 
[normal]destaffed
[normal] trains, ticket offices and stations and concerns that they will  not be able to 
[normal]receive
[normal] accurate trave
[normal]l advice and be able to purchase the best value ticket. 
[normal] 
[normal]4.17[bold] 
[normal]Indeed the 
[normal]government
[normal] policy of 
[normal]reducing hours or closing ticket offices in Category D &amp; E 
[normal](smaller) 
[normal]stations, reducing platform staff and reducing on-train staff
[normal] can be seen as 
[normal]directly
[normal] discriminating against more isolated communities
[normal]4.18 [bold]It has been brought to the attention of RMT that First Great Western are now offering different ticket types, at different prices, on their website as from their ticket offices. RMT believes that this 
[normal]is a deliberate attempt to undermine the important role of ticket offices and that it will have a significant impact on passengers in isolated communities who may, in some instances, rely exclusively on their  local ticket office for transport information.
[normal] It sets a dangerous precedent for the entire industry, and RMT urges the Transport Committee to oppose this practice before it before endemic.
[normal] [bold]Rail devolution
[normal]4.18[bold] 
[normal]RMT notes that rail devolution/decentralisation has been proposed as a means of tacking tr
[normal]ansport issues in isolated 
[normal]communities
[normal].
[normal]4.19[bold] 
[normal]RMT welcomes the introduction of local democratic control where the intention is to genuinely increase democratic control of the network. It is on this basis that RMT campaigns for the railway to run in the 
[normal]interests of the travelling public as opposed to the interests of private profit. RMT believes that any increase in local democratic control must be appropriately resourced for it to be effective, and must be accompanied by national democratic control.
[normal]RMT
[normal] is concerned that devolution may be used as means in which to impose large scale cuts to staff and services, at arm’s length from central government in order to distract from the wider government agenda of imposing permanent austerity on Britain’s railway
[normal].
[normal] The lessons of devolution 
[normal]in the bus industry is that local authorities have either been forced to make cuts to bus services to enable the continuation of other public services or in a number of instances 
[normal]authorities
[normal] have made unenforced 
[normal]decisions
[normal] to buses in favour of road 
[normal]development
[normal] for cars.
[normal]Current government policy of 
[normal]forcing through staffing cuts and 
[normal]prioritising the interest of the private sector over that of communities will deepen the transport isolation of many communities
[normal]. Pr
[normal]oposals around devolving transport powers, rather than helping these communities could herald a new wave of cuts in public transport that will disproportionately impact on 
[normal] 
[normal]groups that already suffer isolation within communities such as the elderly, unempl
[normal]oyed and disabled. 
[normal]The Union would be available to discuss these issues through oral evidence to the Committee
