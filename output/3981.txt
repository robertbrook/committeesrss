[[[Written evidence submitted by Friends of Radio 3 [FBB0025]]]]&#xa0;Friends of Radio 3 (FoR3) is a listeners’ group founded in 2003 with the aim of raising with the BBC issues which concern like-minded Radio 3 listeners. We have a range of interests, including classical music, jazz, world music, drama, arts and discussion, but our common interest is in preserving serious specialised arts and music programming which we see as core to the BBC’s public service remit. We have dealt with BBC management, the Governors and the Trust over the past ten years. There are 700-800 registered FoR3 supporters. When the BBC closed its online Radio 3 messageboards in 2010 for cost-cutting reasons we set up The Radio 3 Forum as a replacement for interested members of the public. It currently has just over 1,400 registered members, only slightly (approximately 10%) overlapping with the FoR3 supporters. We invited forum members to contribute and discuss views on the Inquiry topics.We strongly support the concept of public service broadcasting and the continuance of an independent BBC as the main provider.

[[[Q1. What ]]]

[[[should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?]]]1.1              The purpose of a public service broadcaster should be to broadcast public service content, as defined by the Royal Charter and Agreement: it should not be formulated in terms of specific responsibilities. We note the House of Lords Communications Committee’s publication  ‘Public Service Broadcasting: short-term crisis, long-term future?’ (2009) which outlined various definitions of public service broadcasting which shared common features.1.2              A definition gaining support, the Committee said, was "content that the market does not sufficiently provide”. Possible examples of such content would be  “national and regional news, current affairs programmes, the arts, children's programming, programmes dealing with religion and other beliefs and UK content".  We support that interpretation of the core elements which we feel should form the basis of the BBC’s public service content. 1.3              The Committee also stated: “[N]either Ofcom's nor the BBC's set of objectives is sufficiently discriminating to distinguish between those programmes and services that merit public finance and special regulatory treatment and those that do not. Few programmes screened by any UK broadcaster would not satisfy at least one of the objectives.” We suggest alternative objectives (§3.3 below).1.4              The 2006 White Paper differentiated between the “worthy” and the entertaining. We accept the point that the “worthy” should not be the sole type of content, but the choice of word is unfortunate (= “all very well in its way, but…”): the informative and educational may well be entertaining, but that is not its primary purpose. It should be acknowledged that quality and distinctiveness alone do not give  BBC entertainment the right to be publicly funded: if that were the case, much commercial entertainment would also merit such funding.    

[[[Q2. How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?]]]2.1              It is impossible to take an overview of all services but, regarding Radio 3,  it seems to us, as listeners, that financial cuts have been disproportionate, to the detriment of some quality of content. This may not apply across the board where funding has been maintained, or even increased. 2.2              The Agreement §7, ‘Promoting education and learning’, states:In developing (and reviewing) the purpose remit for promoting education and learning, the Trust must, amongst other things, seek to ensure that the BBC—&#xa0;a) stimulates interest in, and knowledge of, a full range of subjects and issues through content that is accessible and can encourage either formal or informal learning; and&#xa0;b) provides specialist educational content and accompanying material to facilitate learning at all levels and for all ages.Here, a) and b) above are not either/or but both/and. If everything is ‘accessible’ to everyone, 

[[[all levels]]] are not catered for. The BBC has focused on making programming ‘accessible’, but people who seek to deepen their knowledge of their special areas of interest have not been well catered for. This, and the BBC’s indiscriminate use of ‘interactivity’ – inappropriate for specialist services and programmes – trivialise content and contribute to the frequently expressed impression that the corporation is ‘dumbing down’ in an attempt to make all programmes appealing to all audiences.2.3              There have been some complaints, which we would support, of BBC services copying commercial rivals,  contrary to §3.1.7 of the 2006 White Paper, and the Charter and Agreement. The Trust has been disinclined to respond.2.4              Freedom of Information: We have been dissatisfied with the BBC’s operation of its FOI derogation, nominally in respect of ‘journalism, art and literature’, but interpreted as anything connected, however loosely, with programme making and content. The dividing line between what was intended to fall, legitimately, outside the scope of the Act and the public interest in disclosure seems to be a matter of BBC convenience. The appeals procedure is in practice too cumbersome to offer a remedy. 2.5              We are concerned that, notwithstanding the cost-efficiency argument, submission of regular reports and audience satisfaction surveys, the outsourcing of BBC Audience Services and Complaints to a private agency results in a service too remote from the BBC to provide satisfactory responses.  &#xa0;

[[[Q3. Are the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?]]]              3.1              We prefer the concept of ‘Public Service Commitments’, the BBC providing specified content and services, not achieving vague, unquantifiable outcomes (“Sustaining citizenship &amp;c”)3.2              In particular, it should be clear that there is no implied obligation on the BBC to ‘deliver its purposes’ effectively by ‘reaching as many licence fee payers as possible’. This becomes a pretext to focus on boosting ratings which is not a healthy contribution to the market.3.3.              We sacrifice the admirable succinctness of the Public Purposes to offer these expanded Commitments:i) To deliver international, national and local news in an accurate, balanced and impartial way; to provide informed analysis and a plurality of views to promote an intelligent understanding of UK society and world affairs, both to UK and world audiences  (through the World Service). ii) To provide a broad range of mainstream entertainment, from the UK and the world, to serve all ages; to provide cultural and educational programming at all levels, including specialised programmes aimed at extending tastes and interests, and deepening knowledge and appreciation. iv) To recognise and provide for the needs and requirements of a demographically, culturally and geographically diverse public. v) To be mindful of the BBC's position in the ecology of UK broadcasting, not competing with what the commercial sector is already providing.vi) To be a leader in developing and using new technologies and new ways of delivering output for the benefit of the public.3.4              Service licences should then refine the special remits of each service.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q4. What scope, scale and remit should the ]]]

[[[BBC have?]]]4.1               The BBC Trust’s introduction to the Director-General’s 2010 Strategy Review asked the Executive where the BBC’s focus and scale could be reduced “if necessary”. 4.2               The Executive response was contained in the section entitled ‘Doing fewer things better’ which recommended prioritising some areas and recommending some service closures (some of which materialised, others did not, demonstrating the difficulty of cutting services which audiences value greatly). It may be that some services, for example Radio 2, can afford to become more focused and specialist at the risk of losing audience (as the Trust implied).4.3               The BBC is almost certainly larger than it needs to be, but this invites the question as to how large the BBC ‘needs to be’ to fulfil its mission. We would welcome a better balance between the content  areas: information, education and entertainment, both in terms of broadcast hours and of funding (see 5.3 below). &#xa0;

[[[Q5 Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater]]]

[[[ or lesser degree for particular audiences?]]]5.1               It appears to be accepted that the BBC should devote the largest part of its resources to the services and output which appeal to the largest number of people (this has been stated by the BBC Trust as “to protect the services that deliver the greatest value to large parts of the audience” – DQF proposals). 5.2              However, that leaves many other ‘minority’ audiences – demographic, cultural, ethnic – who enjoy the mainstream output to a much lesser degree, or possibly not at all. They will prefer content which – for a variety of  reasons – is not considered interesting, relevant or entertaining by the majority of the general public. Such audiences should be served adequately.5.3              We think that ‘fair’ and ‘appropriate’, having regard to what are considered core elements of public service broadcasting, are preferable to ‘proportionate’. In terms of television spend, 61% for BBC One, 22%  for BBC Two and 2.7% for BBC Four does not seem ‘fair’, ‘appropriate’ or even ‘proportionate’ for a public service broadcaster. BBC radio funding is similarly discrepant, the service licence spend of Radio 3 (the only one of the five network stations to have no digital only ‘sister’ station) being the lowest of the BBC network stations, to cover what is arguably the most varied and expensive remit in terms of specialist musics and speech/arts programmes.5.4              We object to the crude demographic argument that ‘older listeners’ are overserved or at least adequately served. We totally support special children’s services, but in terms of separate, differentiated services, younger audiences (children and young adults) are, by comparison, well served in terms of both services and funding (CBeebies, CBBC, BBC Three, Radio 1, Radio 1Xtra, plus to an extent, the Asian Network and 6 Music). Adult audiences are overwhelmingly treated as ‘general audiences’ and anything ‘new’ or ‘serious’ is treated at an intellectually elementary (‘accessible’) level e.g. Radio 3 is more concerned to introduce new listeners to classical music than to cater for its existing music audience.&#xa0;

[[[Q6 What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to provide?]]]6.1              Quality, value for money and creative opportunities are clearly considerations but this is not of immediate relevance to audiences. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q7. How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for ]]]

[[[licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?]]]7.1              It seems right that programmes which have been paid for by the licence fee payer should be marketed commercially in such a way as to provide a return which can be reinvested to fund further programming.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q.8  What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of delivering output?]]]8.1              The BBC has traditionally played a leading role in developing new technologies. We believe it to be in the licence fee payers’ interests that this should continue, delivering new opportunities to enjoy BBC content.8.2              The BBC should stay at the forefront and maintain an understanding of the possibilities that are being developed elsewhere.&#xa0;

[[[Q 9. How should the]]]

[[[ BBC be funded beyond 2016?]]]9.1              We discussed four main possibilities: a) advertising revenue  b) subscription     c)  TV licence fee  d) general taxation9.2              Advertising was rejected for three reasons. Firstly, audiences appreciate a service without advertising and already complain about the amount of BBC on-air promotion. Secondly, the commercial imperatives of advertising would inevitably increase the pressure on programme makers always to appeal to the largest possible audience, something we believe has already become detrimental to the BBC’s core public service broadcasting. Thirdly, we estimated that the amount of revenue needed to fund the BBC from advertising would begin to approach double the amount of advertising currently in evidence (in the region of £4bn p.a. for television). The appearance of a giant such as the BBC would have a colossal impact on the market.9.3              Subscription was not favoured because the detail was hard to guess: whether individual services would require a separate subscription, how they might be bundled,  how the orchestras and Proms would be funded (if added to a service like Radio 3 that would make it impossibly unattractive to subscribers).9.4              The licence fee has served the BBC well over the years but the inescapable fact is that it is an inherently regressive mechanism for raising funds, with the burden falling disproportionately on the poor/women who bear the brunt of prosecutions, fines and ultimately imprisonment if they cannot pay the fines.9.5              One considered benefit of the licence fee has been the link between the fee  paid and programmes watched, but this becomes a disadvantage as people increasingly use subscription services or commercial services only. The fee they pay is therefore linked to BBC services which they do not use.9.6              Funding the BBC from general taxation has appeal: it is fair because it is  income-related; the mechanism for calculating and collecting the tax from individuals already exists; it avoids the need for – and expense of – TV Licensing and its related responsibilities. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q10  Is there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?]]]10.1              Yes. Public service content should be considered a valuable ‘public good’, but it is expensive and should receive public funding.&#xa0;

[[[Q11 What comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries?]]]11.1              Comparisons as regards standards and range of content will depend on what is being compared. However, with overseas radio services now available online these are being increasingly accessed via the internet by Radio 3 music listeners who feel the BBC no longer serves their requirements. 11.2              Discussions on our public forum indicate that listeners are keen to recommend and to hear of recommended services.

[[[Q12]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?]]]12.1              The last government’s new model for the governance of the BBC  has been in operation for less than seven years. The Charter put in place a new framework by which the BBC, especially the BBC Executive, could be held to account in the interests of the licence fee payer, the BBC Trust being the sovereign body charged with protecting the interests of the public.12.2              Our own experience relates most closely to the way in which the new system of service licences and reviews (remits, content and editorial direction of the individual services) has been overseen by the Trust. 12.3              The Trust issues the service licences; approves updates, carries out service reviews and public consultations, and approves management strategies. At present the Trust seems both too remote to have sufficient knowledge and competence, and therefore too reliant on information from managers. That is a flaw of both the system and the individuals.12.4              There is notionally an official procedure for complaining about a Trust action or decision,  but in practice this consists of submitting the details to the Director of the Trust Unit for an oracular adjudication with no transparent procedure. Lord Grade has urged the appointment of a BBC ombudsman, a measure which we think should be investigated.

[[[Q13 ]]]

[[[In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together]]]

[[[, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?]]]13.1              In principle, the Charter and Agreement seem appropriate. Whether ten years is the appropriate length of time might depend how far it is immutable from one 10-year period to the next. It is in the interests of the BBC to have time to plan.13.2              The Secretary of State, for the Government, should also be bound by certain undertakings. The Agreement allows the Government to make significant changes during the life of each Charter. The 2006 Agreement, for example, states: “For the purposes of the World Service, the Foreign Secretary shall, in each year, pay to the BBC out of money provided by Parliament such sum as the Treasury may authorise.”  Yet the funding arrangements could be changed in 2010. There could also have been a change in the funding for the over-75s’ licence fee.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0; A public service for all: the BBC in the digital age, March 2006, §3.1.6: “Entertainment is a vital part of the BBC’s mission. The Government sees no conflict between the new arrangements and entertainment. In line with the view of the special Lords Select Committee on Charter Review, we do not subscribe to the idea that public service broadcasting should be confined to the “worthy”. Indeed, in most cases the BBC’s output will achieve its maximum impact only by entertaining its viewers and listeners.”&#xa0;&#xa0; “Jane Clancey, research account head for BBC audio and music, defended the commercial impact of the corporation's radio output. 

[[[She said the BBC's duty was to reach as many licence fee payers as possible]]].” http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a95062/local-commercial-radio-audiences-suffer.html#ixzz2lCR8aReS &#xa0; “Where if necessary could the BBC’s focus be narrowed and its scale reduced?                    “After a period of successful year-on-year efficiency savings across the whole BBC, there now needs to be some radical thinking about either reducing the number/reach of services or in clarifying their boundaries to focus on some clear priorities. […] How could the current scale of the BBC be reassessed?
