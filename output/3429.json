"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Staffordshire County Council (PEX 0031)In terms of the inquiry, we welcome the opportunity to present our views and responses to the core themes the committee is considering. \nStaffordshire County Council has transformed how it works \nin order \nto become focused on outcomes, using innovation, insight and smarter use of resources and \ncommissioning and \nprocurement to meet future challenges in the public sector. Integration is a sign\nificant part of this agenda. \nThis transformation is outlined in the council’s strategy entitled ‘Achieving Excellence’ which \nis \na single vision to establish a “connected Staffordshire, where everyone has the opportunity to prosper, be healthy and happy”. \nThis vision is matched by organisational values and behaviours, which are in turn expressed through three key outcomes:\nIn meeting these outcomes, the council is committed to challenging organisational assumptions and boundaries. We believe we have to work much more closely with partners, residents and communities to ensure the £7.5bill\nion spent by the public sector in Staffordshire each year is used to maximum effect. We believe that by emphasising partnerships and outcomes we can ensure that each public sector partner focuses on doing \nand delivering on \nwhat they do best\n, with the whole\n achieving more than the sum of the parts\n. \nOur vision involves looking at the fundamental role of the council and its partners in people’s lives now, and looking at how that role could develop in future years, when the impact of technology and societal ch\nange are considered. For Staffordshire \nC\nounty \nC\nouncil, our strategic strengths in developing an overview and insight of need within the county \nare \nmatched by our ability to commission the best provider\ns\n to deliver our outcomes. \nOur work has already been \nrecognised with a commended in the MJ Awards 2013 in the Integrated Care category, and the County Council is also heavily involved in various national projects such as the Year of Care Early Implementer, a national Going Further Faster site for Personal He\nalth Budgets\n,\n a CH Direct Payments in Care Homes Trailblazer site\n, and most recently \n. \nOur response:Broadly, we believe that the Nicholson Challenge represents a ‘make or break’ moment for the NHS to address the need to implement a much clearer approach to efficiency. We believe it is crucial that this is achieved to support the development of a m\nore integrated system between health and social care. \nHowever, we believe that there is a need to look beyond efficiencies to the role in which a change in priorities from acute to early intervention and prevention would contribute to the development of s\navings. We believe that \np\nrevention \nand early intervention \ncan\n manage need in a more proactive way\n than \nsimply \npushing for efficiencies, which although valuable do not address any strategic challenges\n. \nThe health and social care system needs to shift its mi\nndset from seeking to make the existing approach run more efficiently to instead designing a new system that delivers better outcomes at lower cost. \nFor example, instead of spending significant amounts of money on treating obesity and its related condition\ns, we will move our investment to supporting people to eat a healthy diet from an early age and to be active in their daily lives.\nThis relies upon s\ntrong \nlocal l\neadership and partnership working where we can better influence the spending across the entire\n system of health and wellbeing. This is about making every penny of our Public Health grant work efficiently and effectively as well as drawing on \nthe \nwider Staffordshire public sector\n’\ns resource.\nBut such a shift would need to reflect local priorities – \nas a ‘top-down’ national shift could undermine local strategic efforts and force another round of expensive transformations which local trusts and local councils \ncannot\n afford\n, in terms of both the cost involved and, perhaps more importantly, the distracti\non from addressing the challenges facing us all.\n  \nInstead, there is a need to recognise that the integration we need to achieve reflects what local people expect and assume. Whilst we do not have quantifiable evidence\n,\n there is little distinction between \nthe ‘out-patient’ ward and the care home for those concerned about an elderly relative, or the expectation of the person paying for their own care. \nWhat is needed is a careful review of the law to ensure that whilst integration can be pursued, it isn’t undermined by expectations on either the NHS or Local Government which prevent them fully (but equally) engaging/investing in the process. \nThe \nwider \ni\nssue of funding presents a variety of philosophical concepts that would, theoretically, draw together separate \nstreams of resource\n. For example it could be argued that one-off interventions (such as elective surgery) should be funded by the NHS, but all on\n-going care jointly funded (as the aim is to maintain people at the highest possible level of care). \nThis in turn would make notions such as \np\nooled \nbudgets make sense at a local level, where the population is 300k-500k. However the logic of means testing \nfor social care feels ever weaker, especially after the changes being brought in by the Care Bill.\n This would remove one of the major obstacles in the way of closer integration between health and social care.\nSo the issue is less of drawing together a meth\nod of combining current funds but focusing on how the funding and performance management systems need to operate to ensure that services focused on the individual perform accordingly. \nThe current problem as we see it is that everyone agrees in principle w\nith the concept of integration, but lack a collective acceptance  of what that concept will look like in reality. Thus no one is \nfully \naware of what they will lose or what demands will be placed on them from a shift towards integration\n, so the tendency is \nto expect the worst\n. When we completed \nthe Integrated Pioneers bid it was really clear that as organisations across Staffordshire \nand\n \nStoke we all were signed up to the principles of Integrated Care (person centred, seamless, co-ordinated care) but we hadn\n’t got a collective understanding of what that means for each partner\n’\ns services. At the heart of this is a need to ensure that Health &amp; Social Care funding, if brought together, needs to come via the Commissioners of Health &amp; Social Care, not the provider\ns. The focus on providers undermines an integrated model and approach and would require organisations such as NHS England to wean themselves off temporary solutions to systemic problems such as ‘winter pressures’\n.\n \nMoreover if funding is brought together i\nt will force organisations to work together that haven’t before, \nand \nit will push the integration agenda\n,\n meaning that we have to look at integrated ways to \nsecure\n \nimproved health and wellbeing outcomes. This would require a level of co-ordination and agre\nement that would far exceed the strategic capacity of organisations like the Health and Wellbeing Board, and additionally \nwould \npresent a quandary for previously powerful providers who would need to relinquish control. \nAs organisations we each have our ow\nn priorities and each organisation has their own financial challenges\n. W\nhat we need to consider is all of this as one health and social care economy and then prioritise. We need to agree one Performance Framework for our Integration Agenda.\n&#xa0;\n This may mean \nwe have a countywide approach with local implementation. The Integration Transformation Fund is introduced in 15/16 and there needs to be robust governance around the spending plans/commissioning intentions for this funding.\nSCC believes that the necessary\n funding shift required to ensure success with integration should move priorities as well as resources from acute\n services\n into the community, this means having smaller specialist acute services and much more local community provision offering choice for t\nhe individual.\nHowever, in terms of the wider impact of such a reprioritisation and the relationship of the individual to the state, we also need to consider the potential impact on primary care, General Practice and their role in terms of delivery of thes\ne integrated arrangements. What we cannot avoid is the need to align the delivery of primary care with our integrated approaches, but such an alignment would clearly present a challenge in terms of resources which primary care currently control and the nee\nd for a balance of total resources through the system. \nFurthermore is the impact of integrated arrangements on the provision and role of the voluntary and community sector. Currently we see the VCS as a means of reducing demand on statutory services but a\nn integrated system needs to ensure fair access and treatment, but this can’t compromise the wider integration of services which need to remain focused on the individual. \nWe fully recognise\n the difficulties and complexities associated with this issue. Nonetheless, we believe that the existing approach whereby theoretical allocations are calculated and then local areas are gradually moved towards them brings with it very significant disadvant\nages. On the one hand, areas that are well below their target may use this as an excuse not to address \ntheir financial challenges as robustly as they might. On the other hand, the slow pace of movement towards target allocations means that those areas abov\ne their target feel only limited urgency to make the additional savings and redesign required to prepare them for that reduction. Finally, the complexity of the formula and the potential for target allocations to change significantly depending on the relat\nive weighting of different elements can result in local areas feeling as though the budget assigned to them has been determined almost randomly, which again undermines ownership of the figures and of the actions required to address financial pressures. \nOur local experience, through the Mid-Staffordshire Inquiry alongside the Berwick and Keogh reviews has demonstrated the need for a step change in how we can organize and suppo\nrt local health institutions. \nStaffordshire County Cou\nncil has suggested that part of the solution is the reorganisation of services to align with local priorities – identified through both the CCGs and the local Health and Wellbeing Strategy. \nThis is bas\ned on the recognition that the traditional model of a small District General Hospital as a freestanding independent organisation is no longer sustainable and that the system needs to shift towards a network model, covering a larger footprint, with services\n deployed locally or centrally dependent upon demand and viability. This does require that quality of care be put before choice of provider.\nStaffordshire County Council is concerned \nthat the current pressures which the NHS are facing could undermine the wider need for strategic reform. In particular, the repackaging of resources \nto support transformation around the upcoming\n care bill, plus the £3.8bn set aside for integration could be at risk of these financial pressures meaning they are used to support \nexisting \nbudgets\n, rather than being used to facilitate transformation of care\n. \nThe spending review has progressively pushed local authorities into a narrow focus on those individuals with the highest levels of ne\ned, and within that on reducing the unit cost of care packages. This has the potential to push in precisely the wrong direction, as it squeezes out preventative work with those on the cusp of care, thereby resulting in a vicious circle. The changes are pus\nhing councils towards the classic model of an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff, rather than a fence at the top.\nIn Staffordshire, our bold integration of adult social care services with community health services through the Staffordshire &amp; Stoke on Tre\nnt Partnership NHS Trust is designed precisely to address this challenge, by creating efficiencies through bringing services together that offer opportunities for a focus on prevention and early intervention.\nWe recognize that local authorities have an impact on provision, but the task is as much to recognise the need for partnership\n and alignment to ensure that local priorities influence the plans rather than the unilateral decisions of local authorities. \nWithin Staffordshire our strategic approach can be summarised by the Health &amp; Wellbeing Strategy ‘Living Well in Staffordshire’. \nAligned with this is the County Councils ‘Achieving Excellence in Public Health’ which reflects the following priorities:\nA key part of this is the provision of m\nore effective informatio\nn and advice \nwhich \nwill be provided so that people are clearer about where to go to access services, and be supported to make good choices\nCitizens will be supported to stay safe from avoidable health problems, for example, through screening and vaccinatio\nn\nIt is clear that at a strategic level there is alignment on bringing together the approaches of both local council and the Health Economy, so within Staffordshire there is an obvious fit for integration approaches. But a wider consideration is the questi\non of addressing the needs of the individual and ensuring the right services are centred accordingly. Within SCC this approach leads to a challenge of formal boundaries either challenging them directly or ignoring them entirely. Such a concept takes integr\nation beyond a conceptual stage to a reality but the challenge remains how we can ensure that all partners focus on the individual\nO\nur own approach to integration c\nan be highlighted by the development of the Stoke-on-Trent &amp; Staffordshire Partnership \nNHS \nTrust\n (see appendix A)\n. Bringing together our social care and community health \nprovision \npresents the early insight, experience and framework for the development of \na wider integrated approach to health and social care.\n \nBroadly, there is a persistent expectation that \nh\nealth \nprovision is free at the point of access. \nWhereas the\n Social Care\n system\n is means tested and is provided once a person is assessed and meets the eligibility criteria.\n Such a divided system being drawn together risks eroding these boundaries; either challenging the universal concept of health care or dramatically altering the c\nurrent approach to social care a\ns summarised in the Care Bill. \nPractically, free healthcare is dictated on the basis of current NICE guidelines and wider value for money judgements. A simplistic response would be to apply such a guidelines to social care,\n but the extent to which this would undermine the principles contained with the Care Bill and more widely the Dilnott recommendations would need to judge as well as the overall complexity and risk that social care as a function would be less about services\n delivered for the individual, and more about a massive expansion of the NHS.    \nFurthermore this would require a significant change in practice and time to embed the culture changes required to make this a reality.\n&#xa0;\n There would need to be robust workforc\ne development plans, and considerations in terms of the skill mix of staff would need to be consider\ned\n, as the role of professionals would potentially change too.\n&#xa0;\n We are already looking at joint risk management tools to identify at risk groups, and starti\nng to embed a risk management approach.\nMore widely, the Care Bill talks about ‘portability’ \ndemonstrating that whilst integration remains intuitive and sensible it is complicated by the expectations placed on the local authority in terms of operational re\nquirements. Therefore the issue is as much the commitment of NHS through its approach to efficiencies, but also its wider strategic remit, to ensure that the savings made support the on-going integration of services. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\nAppendix A\nSTOKE-ON-TRENT &amp; STAFFORDSHIRE PARTNERSHIP NHS TRUST: The ageing population in Staffordshire – growing faster in Staffordshire compared to the national average - presents a variety of unprecedented health and social care challenges. The arrangements in pl\nace, Staffordshire County Council (SCC) knew had to change to build resilience into the system now and for the future, and so the Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire Partnership Trust was created, spearheaded by Director for People, Eric Robinson. This is the\n largest body of its kind in the UK with around 5,500 staff and a budget of £355 million (SCC transferring £153m and 1100 staff to the Trust). Taking an innovative and proactive approach to working across the sector with health partners, joining social car\ne and community health \nservices, we are leading the country in meeting the government agenda, working in partnership to help our local people become healthier, happier and more supported in and by their community. \nBenefits\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
