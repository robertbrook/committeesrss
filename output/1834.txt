[[[ortunity and technical barriers]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Turning an innovation into market opportunity can be difficult for a number of reasons. For example, customers are not always keen to be the first mover when it comes to buying a new and relatively unknown product. Another issue can be that sales people need to learn how to sell new products or services, and this can take time. These challenges in turning innovation into market opportunities are a particular issue given that manufacturers expect to use innovation to develop new markets. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Achieving better balanced growth – a role for R&amp;D]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;A1. As the UK came out of recession, a consensus emerged that we could not continue to grow in the same way we had done in the previous 15 years. A better balanced economy would be one where growth was based on innovation, investment and trade rather than consumption. At the time, forecasters were optimistic that this kind of growth could be achieved, but the recovery did not materialise as expected and business investment in particular remains well below its pre-recession average. &#xa0;A2. In 2012, EEF published The Route to Growth, our take on what an Industrial Strategy that would deliver better-balanced growth for the UK should look like. The central principle was that government should to take an economy-wide approach towards creating the climate and conditions that would enable businesses in all sectors to grow through investment and exporting.&#xa0;A3. The UK has significant strengths on which to build, including a diverse and innovative manufacturing base and strong science capabilities. An Industrial Strategy must seek to build on these strengths with a set of clear ambitions which lay out what government is looking to achieve.&#xa0;A4. EEF’s vision for the economy is based on achieving four key ambitions:&#xa0;A5. The first of the ambitions is particularly relevant as innovation and R&amp;D are necessary to develop new products and services which can drive sales and exports. In order to understand whether the economy was making progress against this ambition we set out two key metrics:&#xa0;&#xa0;A6. While R&amp;D expenditure is not a perfect measure of innovation, it is a valuable metric and it is measured by a range of international comparator countries. BERD is a key component of this. &#xa0;A7. The SME R&amp;D tax credit indicator is important as R&amp;D expenditure is concentrated in large businesses, and smaller companies face the most acute barriers to innovation.

[[[Progress has been made ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]A8. To date we have seen progress against both of these measures. BERD reached pre-recession levels after strong growth in 2011 and the number of SMEs claiming the R&amp;D tax credit increased by 49% between 2008/09 and 2011/12.&#xa0;A9. Recent improvements to the SME R&amp;D tax credit scheme and the relative stability of its provision through the tax regime will have played a part in the significant increase in the number of companies using the scheme in the past three years. The tax credit should encourage a virtuous circle of investment in R&amp;D and innovation, and the NAO’s report shows that over this same time period there has been a corresponding increase in SME expenditure on R&amp;D.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; For further information how policy could drive better-balanced growth, please see the Appendix.

In 2013, three quarters of companies said that speed to market was more important than it was in the past. Only 25% of companies said their performance was good or excellent when it came to speed of developing innovations, while 30% of companies thought their performance was poor. In EEF’s Innovation Monitor 2013, only 38% of companies rated their performance as good or excellent at turning innovations into market opportunity, though this is an improvement compared with our 2010 survey.
