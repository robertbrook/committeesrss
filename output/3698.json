"LGO15\nSubmission from Dr Pauline Ashbridge&#xa0;As a present\n complainant\n, I am currently awaiting the result of a Review by the LGO's new Assessment team of their decision \nnot\n to pass on my Complaint (and similar complaints by others) against a council to the LGO's Investigation team.\n&#xa0;\nThis perspective will, I hope, be \nuseful\n  As the Review result is not yet known, my comments cannot be unduly influenced by an adverse decision. Secondly, the July 2012 Report summary says: \"During this period of \ncha\nnge it is \nessentia\nl that the LGO \nkee\nps \na\n close eye on the \neff\nects of the\n \nchanges on those using its services \na\nnd on its staff.\"  As this Enquiry is reviewing these LGO\n \nchanges, comments by someone currently \"using its services\", will be relevant,  l hope.\n&#xa0;\nAs the committee  does not examine details of individual cases, I shall avoid these as much as possible. I am an historian and a retired lecturer in business management and public administration. l was one of 18 or 19 individuals \n(not\n an \norganisation\n, and \notherw\nise \nunk\nn\nown\n to each \noth\ner) who\n \nsubmitted similar  but separate complaints to the London Borough of Barnet about serious maladministration in the decision-making processes that \nl\ned to approval of an application to enclose \na five\n-ward multicultural area within \nan\n \nEru\nv\n religious boundary.\n Th\ne council  \nrejecte\nd the complaints and advised each person about the Ombudsman service.\n&#xa0;\nI have linked my remarks below to recent and present Enquiries into the LGO\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe new Assessment Unit\n structure is placing too much (almost unaccountable) power\n in the hands of individuals. \nTheir brief is to filter OUT (not \nfilter in). \nSuccess is measured by the\n proportion of cases re\njected at this first stage (as the LGO's statistics and commentaries show).\n&#xa0;\nMany cases must hav\ne been unreasonably rejected. \nI myself would have given up at this ea\nrly stage if it had not been fo\nr a number of exceptional factors:\n \nthe mass of hard evidence o\nf maladministration available i\nn the form\n of Planning Committee papers;\n \nF.o.l\n. access to objecti\nons submitted to the council; t\nhe availability on-line of a \nfilm of the Planning Committee meeting (fil\nming p\nermitted\n by the \ncouncil\n);  the repetition of\n \nunmistakable\n \nmaladministration in a \nneighboring\n similar \nEruv\n application three weeks later.\n&#xa0;\nAs a former journalist (newspaper reporter) as well as a retired lecturer in public administration, I was also in a position to \nun\nde\nrstand t\nhat commen\nts by members of the public as t\nhey left the council meeting- \"It's a done deal\n!\"; \"A travesty!\"- were justifie\nd.\n&#xa0;\nSu\nstained by these factors, and also by the knowledge that other (well-qualified) residents were similarly indignant at Barnet Council's maladministration, I have been able to persist d\nespite the Assessment Unit's ne\ngative targets. Many other compla\ninants will not have been so fortunate\n.\n&#xa0;The following are examples of \"filtering-out\" methods employed by the Assessment Unit \"investigator\" allocated to my case. I am calling him \"M\" the first letter of his surname): \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n\"M\" insisted \nthat he a\nlone was dealing with my case, and this was \nemphasised\n by several other staff in Coventry and at Millbank, London, to whom I spo\nke from time to time. \n\"M\" appeared to claim owner\nship of the case, and clearly ob\njected when (unusually) one person on the staf\nf passed on to him a substantiat\ned criticism \nI made.\n \"M\" would perhaps claim he was exercising legitimate \"independent \njudgment\n\" -however ill-informed that might be.\n I was able, probably because of\nmy past j\nournalistic experience, to pers\nist in contacting other people, but many complainants would hesitate to do this and would accept rejection of their viable case at a very early stage.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBoth of these \nstandard filtering-out grounds\n were combined by \"M\" as his reason for rejecting\n what \nwas potentially a major case of malad\nministration by a council, with\n indisputable evidence in\n the council's own published docu\nments. I \nwould ask to what extent, if any, he was req\nuired, as an \"investigator\" in the \nAssessment\n Unit, t\no examine the actual evidence? \nIs \nit simply a tick-box approach: \nfinding, metaphorically or actually, a box to tick, \nand t\nhen moving on to the next \ncase\n?\n(See also: \nLGO’s Progress Report, 1 Oct 2013: “We have introduced a clear template for our decision statements… format clearly identifies the evidence and any other consideration that we have relied on in reaching a decision.” Does that template support over-rapid “filtering” of cases?)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI recei\nved a standard letter fr\nom Dr. Jane Martin, Ombudsman, inviting me to an advisory Forum in Coventry, to include members of\n \nthe public who had used the service in the last six months.\n&#xa0;\nInterested persons had to send \"a short statement, of no more than 500 words, explaining why you\n wou\nld like to be involved and details of any other rel\nevant experience you have...\n Decisions on\n who will be appointed to the fo\nrum will be based solely upon the statement\".\n&#xa0;\nI did not respond \nbecause it seemed to me to be an\n ina\nppropriate invitation.\n People who were critical of the service might clearly wish to attend- but the choice of participants would be, it seems, in the hands of the \norganisation\n they wished to \ncriticise\n. A more informative and open\n met\nhod might\n \nbe a questionnaire sent\n \nafter\n completion of \neach\n \nc\nase: whether rejected or supporte\nd by \nthe\n LGO.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThese goals will only be \nrealisable\n if the summary statements are produced with demonstrable integrity and understanding.\n              \n\"M\" produced an unbalanced \"\nfinal\n decision statement\", as follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n11 November 2013\n"
