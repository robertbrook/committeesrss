[normal]Since the introduction of Part P of the Building Regulations the industry has made great inroads in raising 
[normal]awareness of the requirements. This has helped to increase the standard for electrical installation work within dwellings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Unfortunately the enforcement bodies have not played their part in educating the homeowner as to the requirements and making it more
[normal] difficult for the DIYâ€™ers and suchlike to operate. The scheme needs to be fully backed and promoted by 
[normal]the 
[normal]enforcement 
[normal]bodie
[normal]s and the industry.
[normal] The current situation with different schemes and registers causes confusion and if anything may encourage poten
[normal]tially rogue contractors to look bona fide.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In my view it is essential that the requirements of Part P are bought into the public domain and encouraged. They should also be publicised around the stockists of electrical installation materials so people und
[normal]erstand their own limitations in this respect and the risk they take by breaching the requirements.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As a business we test many hundreds of domestic installations annually and the 
[normal]issues we find during these inspections are quite 
[normal]frightening. The majority 
[normal]of these have been installed by the householder or a person claiming to be an electrician when they are clearly not competent for such works. This highlights the importance of having a scheme where all members are assessed to ensure they are and remain to 
[normal]be competent.
