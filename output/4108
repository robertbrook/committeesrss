defaultSince the introduction of Part P of the Building Regulations the industry has made great inroads in raising 
defaultawareness of the requirements. This has helped to increase the standard for electrical installation work within dwellings. 
default&#xa0;
defaultUnfortunately the enforcement bodies have not played their part in educating the homeowner as to the requirements and making it more
default difficult for the DIYâ€™ers and suchlike to operate. The scheme needs to be fully backed and promoted by 
defaultthe 
defaultenforcement 
defaultbodie
defaults and the industry.
default The current situation with different schemes and registers causes confusion and if anything may encourage poten
defaulttially rogue contractors to look bona fide.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn my view it is essential that the requirements of Part P are bought into the public domain and encouraged. They should also be publicised around the stockists of electrical installation materials so people und
defaulterstand their own limitations in this respect and the risk they take by breaching the requirements.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a business we test many hundreds of domestic installations annually and the 
defaultissues we find during these inspections are quite 
defaultfrightening. The majority 
defaultof these have been installed by the householder or a person claiming to be an electrician when they are clearly not competent for such works. This highlights the importance of having a scheme where all members are assessed to ensure they are and remain to 
defaultbe competent.
