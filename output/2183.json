"&#xa0;\nDorset Wildlife Trust – Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The draft Deregulation Bill – Possible new legislation on green lanes?&#xa0;\nI understand that the draft Deregulation Bill currently under consideration already includes clauses on Rights of Way.  \n&#xa0;\nA coalition of conservation organisations concerned with Green Lanes \nare calling on the Parliamentary Committee advising government on the final content of the Deregulation Bill to consider whether there should be additional rights of way clauses in the Bill designed to stop the damage being done to the countryside by off\n-\nroading\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn particular they would like to see clauses \nadded \nwhich would \ndowngrade existing unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) to restricted byway status\n, and \nprovide rights of appeal against refusals by highway authorities to make Traffic Regulation Orders excluding motor vehicles from \nunsurfaced\n lanes.\n&#xa0;\nDorset Wildlife Trust \nare\n very concerned about the damage done by the off-\nroading\n activities of 4X4 vehicles and trials bikes along a number of Green Lanes in the county.  Many of these lanes have a high wildlife value, being composed of unimproved grassland along the verges and hedgerows and banks with a rich grassland and woodland flora. These provide important feeding and breeding habitats for invertebrates, small mammals and birds.\n&#xa0;\nAbout 15 of these green lanes in Dorset are so important for wildlife that they have been recognised as \nSites of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCIs – otherwise known as \nLocal Wildlife Sites).  Of these we have evidence that at least four of them have been severely degraded in recent years by the activities of off-road vehicles.\n&#xa0;\nFor example:\nLeigh Droves SNCI\n.\n  \nThe latest SNCI survey describes part of this as “A long wooded drove with 2 adjoining tracks, \nincluding  \nsemi\n-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved and semi-improved neutral grassland and species-rich hedgerows\n with a number of notable plants\n. \n \nThe main track has been used as an off-road race-track by 4x4s and the central section is in a very poor state\n.\n  \nThe main track in compartment 3 is very churned up and much of the ground flora is in danger of being lost if use of this track by 4x4 continues.\n”\n&#xa0;\nCommon Lane SNCI\nOriginally described \nas  green\n lane with mature trees within the hedgerows on either side, and having a ground flora including Bluebell, Primrose, Wood Anemone, Wood Speedwell, Pignut and Bugle, amongst others.  \nThe most recent survey states “Common Lane consists of a hard surfaced track that has suffered very badly in the past by damage from off-road vehicles.  Much of the lane has had to be repaired by DCC Highways, but there is still one stretch of approx. 100m that is badly rutted and filled with \nwater,\n and awaiting repair”\n&#xa0;\nBoth the churned up mud from the \nvehicles,\n and the consequently required hard-surfacing by DCC have resulted in the loss of wildflowers along this green lane.\n&#xa0;\nThere are several similar examples to these.  I enclose a couple of photographs taken by a member of the public of one such lane, showing the state it was in during wet weather, following much 4X4 activity.\n&#xa0;\nThe historical status of these green lanes as “Byways Open to all Traffic” was intended to allow use by occasional horse-drawn carts or small tractors.  They were never designed to be used by the large modern vehicles with deeply tracked tyres which are deliberately raced up and down them to create a muddy ‘swamp’ as a part of the ‘sport’. \n&#xa0;\nAnything which can be incorporated into the proposed Bill which will restrict these activities on these important sites will be of huge benefit, not only to local people, most of whom wish to enjoy them for quiet recreation such as walking or horse riding, but also in protecting their considerable wildlife importance.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDr Sharron Abbott\nSNCI Manager\n&#xa0;\n11 August 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
