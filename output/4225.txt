National Rail Travel Survey was undertaken by the SRA and DfT, and comprises the London Area Travel Surveys conducted in 2001 with additional surveys outside London conducted in 2004 and 2005. http://assets.dft.gov.uk/statistics/series/rail/nrtsupdate.pdf DfT WebTAG Unit 3.154, Section 4.2. http://www.dft.gov.uk/webtag/documents/expert/pdf/u3_15_4-rail-passenge-demand-forecasting-120723.pdf   The National Passenger Survey is undertaken by Passenger Focus and comprises periodic surveys designed to collect information on satisfaction with rail services but also includes details such as journey purpose. http://www.passengerfocus.org.uk/research/national-passenger-survey-introduction Note that the proportions in the graph are generally higher than those actually used in the appraisal due to the use of annualisation factors to multiply different journey purposes to annual totals and take account of weekend and bank holiday travel.
