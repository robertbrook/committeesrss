[[[Written Evidence to the Joint Committee on the Draft Deregulation Bill, by the Green Lane ]]]

[[[Assocation]]]

[[[ (GLASS).]]]

[[[Summary of Key Issues.]]]•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[General:]]] We support the overall thrust of the Bill to be deregulatory but do not have the knowledge and experience to comment on the best way to achieve deregulation within the Parliamentary process. However we support the consensus approach used by the Stakeholder Working Group (SWG), which underpins part of the Bill.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We note that other bodies are trying to make use of the Bill to 

[[[add regulation]]] and implore the Committee to not allow this to happen.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whilst additional regulation may not be in itself a breach of human rights we think that additional regulation by opportunist additions at the last minute into this Bill would not be properly consulted on and examined by the governments own advisers and would be contrary to the rights of our members.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Public Highways and Rights of Way:  ]]]Our members are not to any great extent affected, positively or negatively by the current proposals in sections 12-18 of the Bill and the associated Schedules. However, we support the work and recommendations of the Stakeholder Working Group (SWG) on which we were represented LARA. •&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The proposals from the SWG were arrived at by a consensus approach. In fact it was an agreement within the SWG that only proposals agreed by all parties would be put forward and that they were intended to be a package of measures and not to be cherry picked.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We welcome this consensus approach and believe there is more to be achieved by continuing the work of the SWG.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We note that certain members of the SWG are submitting evidence that breaks ranks with the  SWG principles of consensus which we deplore and are at best disingenuous. •&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The SWG was set up to find alternatives to the Discovering Lost Ways Project. We think the current proposals are a step in the right direction and as such are supported but there is more to do. Implementing the existing proposals as set out in the Bill will confirm the consensus approach and enable to SWG to continue its work.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; GLASS have been active in assisting local authorities recording public rights and are aware of the excessive burden for the Definitive Map Modification Order (DMMO) process introduced in the 1981 Wildlife &amp; Countryside Act and believe the SWG has the ability to seek further deregulation of this process. •&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are also concerned that some groups/organisations are promoting a proposal that that all unsealed public roads and byways open to all traffic are administratively downgraded to restricted byway status.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We believe that there is no evidential case made for any of these proposals, and that they will introduce an additional layer of regulation and burden, and that any change in this area of law and practice should first go through a proper process of public consultation.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Countryside access organisation is an emotive topic and impacts on Land Owners, Local Authorities, and Rights of Way (ROW) user organisations.  Scotland has effectivly deregulated it ROW structure and Wales is consulting on similar proposals at this time.  Any restriction to access that is considered should be properly consulted on and examined by the governments own advisers in this area before making recommendations for change.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This submission is from The Green Lane Association Ltd which is the only national representative organisation for four wheel drive recreational motorists who use our now limited network of Byways Open to All Traffic, Unsealed Public Roads and other legal public higways around the UK.  We have a base line of over 700 members and a further 47,432  associates. •&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since 2006 we have attempted to continue recording Lost Ways but have encountered difficulties in pursuing the public’s rights.  The most arduous of these is the work required to justify DMMO claims at Public Inquiries (PI’s).  Objections to the DMMO process require the Planning Inspectorate (PIN’s) to become involved and many days of their time can be spent determining the facts of the case for correcting the Definitive Map and Statement (DMS). We would like to see this process further simplified and believe the SWG is the forum to seek further deregulation. 

[[[The Cost of Maintenance and Repair of Byways.]]]•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The standard of ‘good repair’ for BOATs and unsealed roads, and the cost of repair, is an issue that has been debated for many years. It is our experience (and that of horse-riders as regards bridleways, and walkers as regards footpaths) that highway authorities often put a price on maintenance and repair far in excess of what it costs in the ‘real world’. Where volunteers get involved, or local small contractors, perfectly good jobs are done at a small fraction of authority estimates. •&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; GLASS provides finance and volunteers to The Treadlightly Trust which is a UK charity set up to educate and inform stakeholders in public all purpose  rights of way.  Treadlightly has been able to repair many ROW for the cost of materials alone and with its association of trained Ambassadors and volunteer workforce has been able to show some significant improvements on unsurfaced routes around the UK.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Treadlightly Trust has commissioned costing information from such bodies as the Forestry Commision Wales.  Their maintenance and repair cost for the forestry tracks used by their heavy equipment and it is a fraction of the costs of Highway Authorities road maintenance cost.  This is in part due to the nature of the work done and the specification standards adopted by forestry officials.   •&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; GLASS requests your Committee to note that other bodies are proposing the downgrading of vehicular ways to Restricted Byways on the basis of excessive costs to repair. Their figures are greatly exaggerated. Most Highway Authorities have spent little or nothing on their byways in the last 50 years yet they remain usable by all parties. Ongoing maintenance cost is not in itself a reason for closure.•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We ask you to also note that Restricted Byways would still require maintenance as they are full width roads with their major users being agriculture and property access. Your Governments own investigation found that recreational use of byways is only about one third of the total so removing it would make little difference to cost of repair.We would be please to provide further more detailed evidence should you committee require it.14 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
