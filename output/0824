[normal]We are pleased that diabetes and severe mental health conditions are recognised as areas that need to be reviewed as part of this inquiry.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Janssen also believes that there are further conditions that should be considered within this enquiry, including psoriasis
[normal] and 
[normal]HIV
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As recognised by the inquiry, all long-term conditions 
[normal](LTCs) 
[normal]present a huge burden to the NHS and social care system accounting f
[normal]or 70% of health and care spend, affecting over 20 million people in England,
[normal] however equal recognition 
[normal]should be given 
[normal]to the impact 
[normal]of 
[normal]caring for someone with a LTC. Provisions for carers should be examined by the Health Committee as they play an integral role in delivering care and treatment to those affected. 
[normal]6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Integral to the management of all LTCs is the need for excellent patient information and support. In the advent of the 
[normal]recent 
[normal]NHS reforms
[normal],
[normal] it is crucial that attention is given to the provision of accurate, reputable advice on how to manage a LTC. This information can be used to empower a patient (or their carer) to take responsibility for their own condition and optimise their personal management.
[normal] 
[normal]7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is critical that patients have access to cost-effective innovation as part of an integrated pathway of care and that CCGs are measured, incentivised and rewarded for delivering excellence in the care of patients with LTCs. Uptake of new technologies that improve outcomes must be central to this in the new NHS.
[normal]Diabetes[bold]8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The scale of the challenge that diabetes presents in the UK should not be underestimated, with high, recorded prevalence of diabetes and associated co-morbidities across the country, as well as high estimations of undiagnosed populations. Early diagnosis, preventative treatment and multi-disciplinary team support of the patients will undoubtedly mean increased financ
[normal]ial pressure in the short-term; h
[normal]owever, leaving these patients undiagnosed until further
[normal] complications ensue
[normal] will result in a heavier
[normal] total
[normal] cost burden to 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS
[normal].
[normal]9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is fundamentally important to have clear
[normal] consistent
[normal] processes 
[normal]across all CCGs 
[normal]in place for early diagn
[normal]osis and management of diabetes, with plans which are
[normal] specific
[normal] and measurable
[normal]. Short-term investment in early detection, diagnosis and good management will lead not only 
[normal]to good practice, but also long-
[normal]term savings result
[normal]ing
[normal] from 
[normal]avoiding complications
[normal] and late identification of the disease.

[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]planning
[normal] of future 
[normal]services
[normal] in diabetes 
[normal]should include
[normal] 
[normal]performance 
[normal]reports 
[normal]measured 
[normal]against outcomes, 
[normal]with 
[normal]indicators and performance measures published regularly 
[normal]and made 
[normal]available
[normal] in 
[normal]the public domain. 
[normal]S
[normal]ignificant 
[normal]resource investment and supp
[normal]ort will be required to have an impact on the problems that occur due to diabetes
[normal]. 
[normal]Additionally, 
[normal]through working in innovative ways with partners
[normal],
[normal] both within NHS 
[normal]England
[normal] and outside, huge improvements can be achieved. 
[normal]Janssen 
[normal]is committed to providing solutions in diabetes and would be supportive 
[normal]of initiatives that address the 
[normal]challenge
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Janssen endorses the conclusions and recommendations outlined in the House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts report by the Department of Health, entitled 
[normal]The management of adult diabetes services in the NHS
[normal] (Seventeenth Report of Session 2012–13)
[normal] http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmpubacc/289/289.pdf
[normal]11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In summary, Janssen believe that d
[normal]iabetes care is too
[normal] often 
[normal]varied and inconsistent with unnecessary failings 
[normal]continuing to occur
[normal]. 
[normal]To prevent these instances from happening, better tr
[normal]aining and education for all healthcare professionals throughout the NHS should be introduced
[normal]. D
[normal]ue to the epidemic 
[normal]proportions of people affected by diabetes, it
[normal] is imperative that education
[normal] addresses how
[normal] diabetes should be observed and monitored in patients with multiple morbidities
[normal].
[normal]Schizophrenia[bold]12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For over 50 years, 
[normal]Janssen has continually invested in medicines to improve the lives of people with devastating and disabling mental health conditions. Although medicines have improved during this time, people with conditions such as schizophrenia and ADHD still face challenges in staying well and living long active lives. Compared with physical health conditions, mental illness is still seen as the ‘Cinderella’ of the health service. Janssen is committed 
[normal]to working with mental health and neurological services to continually challenge the current status quo to improve the lives of everyone involved.
[normal] 
[normal]13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Janssen is broadly aligned to the findings of the recent Schizophrenia Commission report entitled ‘The Abandoned Illness’ (
[normal]www.schizophreniacommission.org.uk
[normal]) and the 42 recommendations highlighted within it. While ensuring access to medicines
[normal] is
[normal] optimised for patients affected by schizophrenia, other aspects of care are integral to improving the treatment pathways and support for this patient group. 
[normal]In summary, Janssen supports the notion that people with schizophrenia need: 
[normal]14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As an organisation we are aligned to all the themes covered by the 
[normal]report from the Schizophrenia Commission
[normal] and believe that this should provide the foundation for the Inquiry to refer to and act upon. Key asks include: 
[normal]14.1
[normal]              
[normal]Improved provision for the genuine involvement of the patient and his/her carer in decisions relating to their treatment and care, wherever possible
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]Reduced 
[normal]inequality – both geographical inequity in the quality of care patients receive, but also versus investment for physical health conditions, not affected by the same taboos and stigma of schizophrenia and other serious mental illness

[normal]F
[normal]ollowing the publication of ‘The Abandoned Illness’ report
[normal], Janssen is particularly supportive of the following recommendations that would improve the treatment and care for this patient group: 
[normal]15.1 
[normal]We recommend that the Work Capability Assessment process is amended for people with schizophrenia and psychosis to require the Department for Work and Pensions to seek information from health professionals to guide decisions rather than requiring potentially vulnerable people to navigate complex systems in order to provide it themselves. The same principle should be built into plans relating to any qualifying assessment for the new Personal Independence Payment 
[normal](recommendation 8)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.2 
[normal]The Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Department of Health should regularly repeat the National Audit of Schizophrenia on prescribing and make public its results so that not only Mental Health Trusts and providers but also service users and carers can see the performance of local services. Clinical Commissioning Groups should only commission mental health providers who are signed up to the audit and who provide plans for improving practice in response to any outlier results 
[normal](recommendation 11)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.3 
[normal]All Clinical Commissioning Groups commission Early Intervention in Psychosis services
[normal] [bold]with sufficient resources to provide fidelity to the service model.
[normal] 
[normal]It is crucial that the NHS Commissioning Board holds local commissioners to account for this and we recommend that early intervention services are included in the NHS Commissioning Outcomes Framework 
[normal](recommendation 22)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.4 
[normal]Clinical Commissioning Groups explore the scope to commission integrated community
[normal] [bold]teams bringing together primary care and specialist staff to support people with mental illness in the community
[normal] [bold](recommendation 30)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.5 
[normal]All mental health providers should ensure that people with schizophrenia and psychosis (in hospital and the community) are aware of their
[normal] [bold]right to request a review of their medication
[normal] [bold]including, where appropriate, access to a specialist pharmacist, and are encouraged to exercise it in practice 
[normal](recommendation 33)
[normal]HIV[bold]16
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Chronic long-term condition management is becoming increasingly relevant to HIV care. 
[normal]With the continual advances in HIV medicine, the long-term care of patients is now a pertinent and urgent issue for the NHS. 
[normal]Clinicians are now experiencing an increasingly older population of HIV patients
[normal] who 
[normal]need to be able to manage their condition on a long-term basis. 
[normal]Care pathways and the management of HIV services need to adapt to cater for this patient cohort, 
[normal]despite the financial pressures of the NHS.
[normal] 
[normal]Treatment and support must be sustained and enhanced as new structures emerge within an evolving NHS. 
[normal]17
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Jan
[normal]ssen broadly supports the recently published 
[normal]BHIVA Standards of Care for People Living with HIV
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]www.bhiva.org/documents/Standards-of-care/BHIVAStandardsA4.pdf
[normal]). 
[normal]Specifically for the purposes of this response in relation to LTCs, Janssen endorses BHIVA’s recognition that as people with HIV live lo
[normal]nger, their health needs change
[normal] and both the numbers of co-morbidities and the complexity of prescribing for multiple health conditions increases. BHIVA’s standards (3 and 5) should be referred to by the Health Select 
[normal]Committee
[normal] to ensure that there is focus on the delivery of high-quality
[normal] 
[normal]outpatient and inpatient care for HIV services, ensuring that all people have equitable
[normal] 
[normal]access to high standards of care wherever they live.
[normal]18
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Monitoring and treatment for people with HIV infection needs to be in accordance with current national guidelines to maximise health and life expectancy and minimise morbidity and mortality. The combination of an ageing HIV cohort, longer duration of HIV infection and long-term antiretroviral therapy for HIV has resulted in a shift in HIV-associated pathology from ill-health associated with severe immunosuppression to non-AIDS co-morbidities such as neurological, heart, liver and renal disease and cancers.
[normal]19
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Primary care has an important role in the long-term management of HIV. Indeed, due to the increase in non-AIDS comorbidity and the complexity of HIV drug–drug interactions, lack of communication with GPs has been shown to be an important patient safety concern. Establishment of clear protocols and pathways for care between both primary and secondary care is essential for safe delivery of care, and regular communication is strongly recommended unless the patie
[normal]nt specifically refuses consent.
[normal]Psoriasis [bold]20
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For some patients, p
[normal]soriasis 
[normal]can result 
[normal]in profound
[normal] functional, psychological, and social morbidity, with consequent reduced levels of employment and income. Factors that contribute to this include symptoms related to the skin (for example, chronic itch, bleeding, scaling and nail involvement), problems related to treatments, psoriatic arthritis, and the effect of living with a highly visible, stigmatising skin disease. Even people with minimal involvement state that psoriasis has a major effect on their life. Several studies have also reported that people with psoriasis, particularly those with severe disease, may be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. 
[normal]21
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Self care is an essential part of 
[normal]a psoriasis patient’s
[normal] daily life
[normal] as well as receiving appropriate support from 
[normal]people involved in 
[normal]their
[normal] care. 
[normal]While psoriasis can be effectively managed with appropriate treatments, it is essential that patients sustain regular contact with their GP/specialist. 
[normal]22
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Janssen 
[normal]broadly 
[normal]supports the recent Clinical Guideline from NICE on the Management of P
[normal]soriasis (
[normal]http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13938/61190/61190.pdf
[normal]) particularly the recognition given to the need 
[normal]for psoriasis severity and impact on psychological and social wellbeing to be regularly assessed
[normal] by the healthcare professional, often in primary care
[normal]. The need for regular assessments for psoriatic arthritis (
[normal]PsA
[normal]) is also a key priority for implementation, with the guidance recommending that people with psoriasis be assessed for 
[normal]PsA
[normal] annually, and referred to a Rheumatologist as soon as it is suspected.
[normal]23
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Janssen also supports the Psoriasis Association’s view that, ‘
[normal]Psoriasis is a life-long condition and so patients should be managed effectively and holistically so as to lessen the negative impacts on quality of life and psychological well-being that can be associated with it
[normal]’
[normal]. 
[normal]24
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Janssen is committed to ensuring patients with psoriasis lead a life that is as normal as possible. We regularly seek feedback from healthcare professionals and patient organisations to determine what th
[normal]ey need
[normal]. As a result of this two-way dialogue, Janssen believes that k
[normal]ey priorities for 
[normal]the 
[normal]manag
[normal]ement of 
[normal]psoriasis as a long-term condition include:
[normal]24.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]P
[normal]ractical support and advice regardi
[normal]ng the use of topical therapies
[normal]: 
[normal]M
[normal]any patients currently are expected to just know how to apply their treatments effectively and to get the most satisfactory results from them. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.2
[normal]              
[normal]A
[normal] review four weeks after starting a new topical treatment in adults
[normal]: 
[normal]This
[normal] is standard practice for many long-term conditions to have a follow-up appointment when starting on new treatments and psoriasis should be no different. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.3
[normal]              
[normal]A
[normal] regular a
[normal]ssessment of the impact of psoriasis
[normal] on the patient
[normal]: 
[normal]Patients should be assessed on the 
[normal]impact 
[normal]that 
[normal]psoriasis
[normal] has on their 
[normal]physical, psy
[normal]chological and social wellbeing
[normal] and for this impact to be recorded and treated as effecti
[normal]vely as the skin manifestation.
