[normal]1) [bold]A p[bold]ublic understanding of what is meant by climate change amounts to what is aired by the broadcast media and what is written in newspapers. Our temperate climate tends to fool the public at large, especially the young, since they have no historical concept of how temperate climates work[bold], and that climates are ever changing[bold]. [bold]The impression is that[bold] public[bold] [bold]opinion has altered[bold] dramatically [bold]in recent years towards a more sceptic[bold]al[bold] society[bold].[bold] [bold]This is probably due[bold] [bold]to [bold]wide variability[bold] [bold]experienced in a typical[bold] [bold]U.K. climate,[bold] sometimes too hot and dry, sometimes too cold [bold]and wet [bold]with [bold]changeable seasonal [bold]precipitation[bold].[bold] While public opinion has changed, public service broadcasting ([bold]The [bold]BBC) has not[bold],[bold] and[bold] continues with [bold]a rather[bold] biased AGW[bold] agenda. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Analysis[bold] &amp; Commentary[bold]The question is does 
[normal]man-made 
[normal](
[normal]industrial
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]carbon dioxide 
[normal]together with natural inputs bring about
[normal] 
[normal]global warming or 
[normal]climate change
[normal]?
[normal] This 
[normal]is 
[normal]understood 
[normal]to be the case 
[normal]by 
[normal]many 
[normal]p
[normal]oliticians
[normal] 
[normal](

[normal]Anthropogenic Global Warming (

[normal]Firstly
[normal],
[normal] c
[normal]ontentious claims 
[normal]that
[normal] CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]is the major
[normal] cause for 
[normal]global 
[normal]climate 
[normal]change
[normal], 
[normal]is
[normal] based on 
[normal]historical 
[normal]laboratory
[normal] 
[normal]experiments (a closed system
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]carried out in
[normal] the mid-1800s
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]oday 
[normal]this assertion is 
[normal]hotly disputed 
[normal]by 
[normal]a very
[normal] large body
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]scientists commonly
[normal] referred to as 
[normal]climate 
[normal]sceptics
[normal]. The conclusion arrived 
[normal]at is 
[normal]that AGW
[normal] is a false 
[normal]hypothesis 
[normal]derived from
[normal] years
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]geophysical understanding of 
[normal]the 
[normal]scientific 
[normal]modus operandi
[normal], and 
[normal]scholarly interactions
[normal] with 
[normal]leading
[normal] scientists
[normal] in the field of climate physics. This 
[normal]also 
[normal]stems from observational evidence
[normal] 
[normal]that CO2 
[normal]is 
[normal]a 
[normal]minor 
[normal]heat radiating
[normal] trace gas
[normal] 
[normal]common to the 
[normal]atmosphere
[normal], 
[normal]yet 
[normal]curtailed by 
[normal]a 
[normal]relatively 
[normal]short 
[normal]residency time
[normal]s (
[normal]two to five
[normal] years
[normal]). Hence it
[normal] is highly
[normal] 
[normal]unlikely to affect global temperatures in the manner proposed
[normal]. Additionally
[normal] CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]comprises
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]negligible 
[normal]quantity 
[normal]of 
[normal]the 
[normal]molecular 
[normal]mass in
[normal] our atmosphere, and
[normal] currently amounts
[normal] to 
[normal]0.0396.8 
[normal]part
[normal]s
[normal] per million

[normal]ut
[normal] 
[normal]it 
[normal]is 
[normal]still 
[normal]alleged 
[normal]to 
[normal]constitute the
[normal] prime 
[normal]so-called ‘greenhouse g
[normal]as
[normal]’
[normal] (GHG)
[normal] thereby engendering
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]so-called 
[normal]global ‘greenhouse e
[normal]ffect
[normal]’
[normal] (GE)
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]said 
[normal]unequivocally 
[normal]to be 
[normal]responsible for climate change
[normal] 
[normal]regardless of its source
[normal] (industrial/natural)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With 
[normal]the quality of carbon dioxides 
[normal]forcing effect on climate warming (subscribed to by the AGW orthodoxy)
[normal],
[normal] it is 
[normal]neither challenged, nor
[normal] made clear
[normal], that atmospheric g
[normal]ases, especially CO
[normal]2
[normal] is calibrated
[normal] using a logarithmic scale.
[normal] This gas
[normal] does not absorb infra-red radiation over a linear range as many 
[normal]climate 
[normal]scientists mistakenly believe. 
[normal]Because CO
[normal]2
[normal] is
[normal] 
[normal]strongly logarithmic in 
[normal]magnitude 
[normal](a measurement that displays the value of a ph
[normal]ysical quantity using intervals
[normal] 
[normal]corresponding
[normal] 
[normal]to orders of scale
[normal]), the first 1.5
[normal]o
[normal]C of molecular CO
[normal]2
[normal] arises from the initial 20ppm. The next 1.5
[normal]o
[normal]C increase requires
[normal] 
[normal]a further 400ppm, and then 1
[normal]o
[normal]C for a further 1000ppm. The significance of this is that 
[normal]with current levels put at 
[normal]~
[normal]0.039
[normal]%
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] one 
[normal]100ppm increase will amount to ~0.1
[normal]o
[normal]C warming after 50 years and less so with each added 100ppm increment. Or put
[normal] 
[normal]another way,
[normal] 
[normal]assuming a rising rate of 2ppm per annum (IPCC), temperatures will rise at 0.1
[normal]o
[normal]C for every 50 years
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Furthermore CO
[normal]2
[normal] forcing can only be radiated over a tiny portion of the infra-red (IR) spec
[normal]trum, i.e. 
[normal]within a
[normal] 
[normal]15
[normal] 
[normal]micron bandwidth
[normal] only
[normal]. Gaseous H
[normal]2
[normal]O 
[normal](water vapour) 
[normal]on the other hand (~4% of all atmospheric gases) is measured similarly but over
[normal] 
[normal]almost the entire bandwidth
[normal] spectrum
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Therefore it is
[normal] unscientific
[normal], nay impossible that anthropogenic and natural carbon dioxide gases coalesced together (or separately) can b
[normal]e responsible for climate warming
[normal]. 
[normal]Not only is this gas insufficient of itself to account for a projected high degree of additional 
[normal]temperature escalation 
[normal](2.4 to 6.4
[normal]o
[normal]C) by the end of the twenty first century (AR4 2007, IPCC).
[normal] 
[normal]But even with the inclusion of more dominant GHGs 
[normal](H
[normal]2
[normal]O, CH
[normal]4
[normal]) 
[normal]that contribute mainly to the mass of our
[normal] atmosph
[normal]ere, 
[normal]such
[normal] large
[normal] increases in 
[normal]warming are 
[normal]seen to be unattainable. Given
[normal] the best climate scientists
[normal], they
[normal] can
[normal]not
[normal] predict 
[normal]future warming trends
[normal] with any accuracy
[normal] 
[normal]or
[normal] 
[normal]indeed 
[normal]the
[normal] amount of carbon dioxide 
[normal]that is said to contribute to it.
[normal] It is well understood
[normal] that atmospheric CO
[normal]2
[normal] follows 
[normal](is 
[normal]not 
[normal]responsible for) 
[normal]warming over historical
[normal] time-frames, 
[normal]but
[normal] 
[normal]acts 
[normal]in reverse 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]atmospheric 
[normal]carbon d
[normal]ioxide 
[normal]follow
[normal]s warming,
[normal] 
[normal]albeit 
[normal]somewhat belatedly over-time. (
[normal]h
[normal]undreds
[normal] of years). This
[normal] trend points to 
[normal]gradual rise
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]temperature following the last Ice Age ~10k years ago
[normal] and suggests we might be entering one of many interglacials 
[normal]during
[normal] the current Ice Age.
[normal] Interestingly researchers at Berkeley National Laboratory 
[normal](Jan 2012) 
[normal]have 
[normal]found that 
[normal]newly discovered so-called Cr
[normal]iegee biradicals molecules react to 
[normal]accelerate the formation of sulphate and nitrate in the atmosphere. 
[normal]It is suggested t
[normal]hese compounds will lead to aerosol formation and ultimately to cloud formation with the potential to cool the planet
[normal] rather than warm it
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, t
[normal]he
[normal] 
[normal]hottest 
[normal]climate ‘science’ innovation 
[normal]used by climate science institutions, 
[normal]is 
[normal]defined (guessed at) using specious modelling techniques 
[normal](
[normal]built-in projected 
[normal]undefined 
[normal]feedbacks)
[normal]. T
[normal]he end 
[normal]results
[normal] 
[normal]of which provide
[normal] nourishment 
[normal]for political consumption in IPCC reports
[normal]. It can be said 
[normal]that hitherto temperature ratios have not increased beyond 0.
[normal]7
[normal]o
[normal]C from ~
[normal]150
[normal] years
[normal] ago
[normal]. This is
[normal] 
[normal]as one would expect
[normal] given 
[normal]well 
[normal]researched 
[normal]observational data
[normal], although 
[normal]vested interests 
[normal]will state otherwise – mention 
[normal]‘
[normal]climate change
[normal]’ for funding research grants 
[normal]and yo
[normal]u are more than likely to get them
[normal]!
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2) [bold]Official p[bold]ronouncements [bold]should [bold]always [bold]be [bold]trusted in public discourse [bold]by[bold] Government departments [bold]([bold]‘[bold]the voices[bold]’[bold]) [bold]and must balance [bold]AGW rhetoric [bold]([bold]from [bold]strident [bold]pressure groups and pseudoscience institutions[bold])[bold] with [bold]balanced[bold] [bold]and [bold]clear [bold]directives[bold].[bold] Moreover they should act only on thorough scientific evidence, and not be duped by consensus [bold]or none evidential [bold]viewpoints.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Commentary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]T
[normal]endentious pseudoscience 
[normal]has been
[normal] 
[normal]laid bare 
[normal]by
[normal] the so-called ‘Hockey Stick’ diagram 
[normal]that first appeared in
[normal] 
[normal]science 
[normal]literature 
[normal]and
[normal] the
[normal] public 
[normal]media in 
[normal]2008
[normal] -
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]The Hockey Stick Illusion
[normal]’
[normal] (
[normal]2010
[normal]) and additional 
[normal]literature
[normal] opposing AGW issues
[normal]. 
[normal]This was followed 
[normal]a year later 
[normal]by the
[normal] 
[normal]‘Climategate affair’ 
[normal]that 
[normal]exposed 
[normal]the same 
[normal]institutions and so-called ‘climate scientists’
[normal] 
[normal]transgressing
[normal] 
[normal]their responsibilities to 
[normal]science ethics. T
[normal]he climategate 
[normal]revelation
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]were
[normal] a 
[normal]seminal moment
[normal] that
[normal] 
[normal]reinforced 
[normal]deep scepticism
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]science 
[normal]everywhere
[normal]. I
[normal]t became 
[normal]patently 
[normal]clear that 
[normal]not only were
[normal] 
[normal]some
[normal] 
[normal]science institutions
[normal] 
[normal]seen to be apostate to science principles, 
[normal]but that the 
[normal]‘
[normal]science
[normal]’
[normal] conducted was
[normal] 
[normal]corrupt to its
[normal] core
[normal].
[normal] Worse 
[normal]was 
[normal]to follow 
[normal]when
[normal] a committee tribunal
[normal] 
[normal]exonerated the protagoni
[normal]sts 
[normal]with
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]‘
[normal]pseudo-judicial
[normal]’ ruling
[normal] (
[normal]by a chairman
[normal] 
[normal]with AGW leanings
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]without due 
[normal]reference to the 
[normal]mendacious 
[normal]behaviour
[normal] employed
[normal] by the protagonists
[normal] themselves
[normal] 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]altering and obliterating
[normal] their ‘research’ 
[normal]and presenting it 
[normal]as 
[normal]authentic 
[normal]science. 
[normal]Moreover, 
[normal]our public broadcaster 
[normal]the BBC
[normal],
[normal] contrived 
[normal]by all means possible
[normal]’
[normal] to silence any 
[normal]opposition to these AGW ‘researchers’
[normal] and 
[normal]the 
[normal]shabby science
[normal] that followed from it.
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n 
[normal]fact 
[normal]the BBC went out of its way to 
[normal]commend 
[normal]this
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]dodgy data
[normal]’
[normal] based 
[normal]on 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]contrived 
[normal]Hockey Stick 
[normal]illustration
[normal] and without probing comment expected from a public broadcaster
[normal]. This was backed-up
[normal] 
[normal]with a documentary series 
[normal](
[normal]Earth: The 
[normal]Climate Wars, 
[normal]2010
[normal])
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]while 
[normal]elsewhere 
[normal]their medium 
[normal]persisted with (an unbalance
[normal]d
[normal]) AGW 
[normal]agenda
[normal] 
[normal]at every opportunity
[normal]. Indeed 
[normal]it could be 
[normal]said;
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]BBC legitimised 
[normal]the Hockey Stick
[normal] author (Prof Michael Mann) 
[normal]with 
[normal]prime-time 
[normal](celebrity ‘scientists’) in 
[normal]radio 
[normal]and TV 
[normal]appearances
[normal] 
[normal]that went essentially 
[normal]unchallen
[normal]ge
[normal]d in contravention of its 
[normal]editorial
[normal] standards
[normal] -
[normal] 
[normal]to this effect
[normal] 
[normal]underpinned by Royal Charter
[normal].
[normal] Not only is the U.K. a democracy underpinned 
[normal]by
[normal] 
[normal]fundamental right
[normal]s for detracting 
[normal]opinion
[normal]s, but 
[normal]the BBC 
[normal]funded by licence fee payers
[normal] has no 
[normal]mandate
[normal] 
[normal]to adopt partisan strategies
[normal] 
[normal]as to what
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in

[normal], 
[normal]is

[normal] 
[normal]correspondence with the BBC and BBC Trust, principally as a long term licence fee payer
[normal]/s, to remind the power-that-be, 
[normal]that in al
[normal]most every broadcast 
[normal](regardless)

[normal]via radio or television on
[normal] their pervasiveness to plug 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]AGW 
[normal]agenda
[normal] 
[normal]without balancing the topic with opposing viewpoints
[normal]. Th
[normal]eir response has been
[normal] in the
[normal] 
[normal]standard form:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘
[normal]The BBC has held a high-level seminar with
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]some of 
[normal]the best scientific experts[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]and has come to the view that the weight of evidence no longer justifies equal space being given to the opponents of the AGW consensus’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Or to be concise ‘The science is
[normal] settled
[normal]’
[normal] -
[normal] tough! 
[normal]Well needless to say
[normal],
[normal] as a practitio
[normal]n
[normal]er
[normal]

[normal] took place
[normal] 
[normal]with the 
[normal]C
[normal]orporation and 
[normal]Trust 
[normal]as to who these ‘best scientific experts’ might be. Disquieting 
[normal]to report both organisations
[normal] refused to name the scientists

[normal]involved 
[normal]despite
[normal] insistence that 
[normal]it was

[normal]PPE
[normal] 
[normal]qualifications
[normal] 
[normal]from 
[normal]the same red-brick university
[normal]. Moreover 
[normal]n
[normal]one 
[normal]has
[normal] 
[normal]ever 
[normal]been employed
[normal] outside 
[normal]of 
[normal]academia
[normal] or 
[normal]work
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]in the 
[normal]‘
[normal]real world
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he current 
[normal]Environment Secretary
[normal] is
[normal] seemingly
[normal] enacting a 
[normal]coalition 
[normal]initiative
[normal] 
[normal]clearly 
[normal]designed with 
[normal]energy
[normal] polic
[normal]ies 
[normal]that could
[normal] be 
[normal]rightly 
[normal]called 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]Green M
[normal]ix’- a
[normal] 
[normal]strategy 
[normal]clearly 
[normal]intent on
[normal] 
[normal]utilising 
[normal]a combination
[normal] of 
[normal]renewable
[normal] energy
[normal] resources
[normal],
[normal] such as
[normal] wind turbine
[normal], solar panel
[normal] and tidal 
[normal]surge
[normal]. Such
[normal] ‘green’
[normal] policies thus far have
[normal] cost/is costing m
[normal]illions of pounds of 
[normal]tax payer funding
[normal] by way
[normal] of 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment subsidies
[normal], 
[normal]no doubt
[normal] designed to appease the 
[normal]mino
[normal]rity (yet 
[normal]strident) 
[normal]green lobby. 
[normal]However it is well know
[normal]n
[normal] that m
[normal]anufacturing costs 
[normal]of wind turbines 
[normal]are 
[normal]extremely 
[normal]high while the U.K’s 
[normal]chaotic
[normal] variable
[normal] wind speeds 
[normal]make their use
[normal] largely inefficient
[normal] 
[normal]and costly to maintain
[normal] or replace
[normal]. T
[normal]he evi
[normal]dence/research points to a huge
[normal] i
[normal]mbalance
[normal] of ope
[normal]rating margins that is 
[normal]leading to 
[normal]rising energy prices
[normal] from 
[normal]an 
[normal]unworkable 
[normal]misguided
[normal] 
[normal]environment 
[normal]policy
[normal]. 
[normal]As for solar power in our 
[normal]changeable climate where 
[normal]winters are 
[normal]long, cold, dark and damp 
[normal]and 
[normal]when 
[normal]power is most needed, 
[normal]they 
[normal]are 
[normal]again 
[normal]singularly 
[normal]costly and 
[normal]inefficient
[normal] 
[normal]because 
[normal]insolation is highly variable
[normal]. 
[normal]And l
[normal]ike most renewable 
[normal]energy 
[normal]sources the
[normal] electricity generated is
[normal] unable to be stored
[normal] thereby 
[normal]de
[normal]limiting

[normal]to

[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]O
[normal]n the 
[normal]inevitable concern 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]utilising 
[normal]nuclear power
[normal],
[normal] well
[normal] 
[normal]this is 
[normal]one of th
[normal]e most 
[normal]proven 
[normal]and 
[normal]reliable 
[normal]sources of energy
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]albeit 
[normal]associated with 
[normal]initial 
[normal]high build
[normal], maintenance
[normal] 
[normal]and safety 
[normal]cost
[normal]s
[normal]. The conundrum still exists however;
[normal] ‘what is to be done
[normal] with nuclear waste?’ As for
[normal] 
[normal]safety issues
[normal] generally
[normal], well the industry as a whole tends to be 
[normal](
[normal]extremely
[normal])
[normal] safety conscious 
[normal]following Chernobyl (1986)
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]Fu

[normal] -

[normal]Sad to report a

[normal]U.K. 
[normal]nuclear p
[normal]ower programme
[normal] 
[normal]by necessity should
[normal] 
[normal]have
[normal] been addressed

[normal] years ago with a

[normal] fifty
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] perhaps 
[normal]a hundred years ahead

[normal]5) [bold]As [bold]alluded[bold] to elsewhere[bold],[bold] the Government[bold] [bold]appears [bold]not [bold]to [bold]seek [bold]or acquire[bold] [bold]sufficient [bold]expert[bold]ise in climate science[bold],[bold] yet [bold]continues to follow[bold] a[bold] [bold]green [bold]agenda[bold] [bold]leading[bold] to[bold] injudicious policies[bold]. When [bold]it deigned to invite a sceptical[bold] [bold]climate [bold]expert[bold] [bold]last year[bold] [bold](Prof Richard Lindzen[bold] - lecture House of Commons, [bold]Feb 2012)[bold], no [bold]parliamentary follow-up ensued. The [bold]forward-thinking[bold] [bold]blogosphere and [bold]some [bold]media outlets[bold] [bold]were[bold] [bold]enthusiastic [bold]and hopeful of a ra[bold]dical [bold]turn[bold]about[bold] on [bold]current [bold]policy[bold], but [bold]this [bold]authority on[bold] climate change [bold]science [bold]was again[bold] (House of Lords, Jan 2005) [bold]neglected or[bold] ignored.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Commentary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]A wealt
[normal]h of insight and knowledge on 
[normal]climate science has been ignored by 
[normal]politicians, the media, 
[normal]and 
[normal]especially 
[normal]AGW 
[normal]scientists following their own (CO
[normal]2
[normal]) agenda. V
[normal]ast amounts of 
[normal]new 
[normal]research by Earth scientists, astrophysicists, cosmologists, climatologists and other disciplines is today available from easily accessed websites and institutions. Much information is still being researched but what is available has been made accessible on the internet which attempts to address all known (and unknown) variables 
[normal]relating to climate science. In
[normal] 
[normal]just a few 
[normal]example
[normal]s
[normal], a well informed paper of climate modelling/residency times and AGW CO
[normal]2
[normal] on the origins and proficiency 
[normal]of GE global warming is available from 
[normal]Professor 
[normal]Segalstad (1997) together with impartial independent studies, such as website 
[normal]http://brneurosci.org/co2.html
[normal] 
[normal](click Global warming) 
[normal]which is highly informative. Such balanced studies from many Earth and climate physicists foretell of variable factors (too many to discuss here) that poin
[normal]t to warming and cooling episodes
[normal] over shorter time spans than was previously envisaged in addition to episodically longer periods of warming/cooling deduced from the geological record. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Further studies (
[normal]readily accessible) include the influence of Heinrich Events (sedimentary marine core data), D-O Cycles (ice core data), and Milankovic Cycles (Solar system planetary cycles). Solar insolation alone amounts to 99% of warming and radiativ
[normal]e forcing at the Earth’s interface where 
[normal]warming phase transition

[normal] 
[normal]from natural sinks 
[normal]to the
[normal] 
[normal]atmosphere in relatively short-term (hundreds 
[normal]of years) following temperature increases
[normal]. 
[normal]Simple experiments demonstrate that solar irradiance cycles 
[normal]and industrial
[normal] 
[normal]carbon 
[normal](fossil
[normal] fuels) 
[normal]contribute min
[normal]iscule amounts of 
[normal]life-giving 
[normal]CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]to the atmosphere. I
[normal]nsolation is the driving mechan
[normal]ism of all 
[normal]atmospheric heating 
[normal]captured 
[normal](to a greater extent)
[normal] by
[normal] a
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]Blanket Effect’
[normal] rather t
[normal]han (a 
[normal]misnomer
[normal]) ‘The
[normal] Greenhouse Effect
[normal]’.  Furthermore t
[normal]he atmosphere is an open system and does not have a ceiling
[normal], where all atmospheric heat is ultimately lost 
[normal](disseminated) 
[normal]to the vacuum 
[normal]of 
[normal]space
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]And h
[normal]aving researched the impact of 
[normal]atmospheric 
[normal]CO
[normal]2 
[normal]gases
[normal] 
[normal]for many years, there is no
[normal] 
[normal]scientific 
[normal]evidence 
[normal]whatsoever 
[normal]that carbon dioxide is 
[normal]uniquely responsible
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] inducing 
[normal]glob
[normal]al warming (
[normal]climate change
[normal]) – regardless that 
[normal]there 
[normal]i
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]correlation 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]nominal warming

[normal]in

[normal]GHGs (H

[normal], 
[normal]C
[normal]O2
[normal]) and a dilution in
[normal] 
[normal]others 
[normal](N, O, &amp; O
[normal]3)
[normal].
[normal] A c
[normal]orrelation 
[normal]with something else however 
[normal]cannot be regarded as science
[normal] 
[normal]fact as many 
[normal]might 
[normal]believe.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Indeed the 
[normal]CLOUD project
[normal] currently under investigation
[normal] at CERN relating to heavy electron bomba
[normal]rdment (muons) due to idiosyncratic variation in
[normal] solar flares 
[normal](
[normal]coronal mass ejections
[normal])
[normal] seems to offer a better understanding of 
[normal](
[normal]perhaps
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]short
[normal]er
[normal] term 
[normal]climate change
[normal] based on solar irradiance
[normal]. Current
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]known
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]climate 
[normal]influences
[normal] fail
[normal] to persuade many scientists (the sceptics) that CO
[normal]2
[normal] (a minor thermally reactive gas) is the prime 
[normal]driver of
[normal] global warming (
[normal]climate change
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6) [bold]Yes lessons can be learnt by[bold] public[bold] eng[bold]agement with climate policy,[bold] [bold]especially [bold]from other countries. E[bold]xample[bold]s have been provided in this [bold]testimony [bold]to the [bold]closed[bold] [bold]mindset of [bold]many[bold] [bold]politicians, [bold]some [bold]scientists[bold], [bold]and parts of [bold]the media and [bold]public[bold] alike. Countries [bold]such as India and China reject[bold] outr[bold]ight any global treaties on [bold]limiting [bold]atmospheric[bold] carbon[bold] dioxide[bold] emissions [bold]([bold]Bonn &amp; Copenhagen Climate Change Conferences[bold]), w[bold]hile other[bold] countries[bold] such as[bold] [bold]Canada[bold], Russia[bold] and Japan[bold] pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol [bold](1997) [bold]in 2011[bold],[bold] [bold]because their economies a[bold]re [bold]thought likely to stagnate under, what[bold] could be said,[bold] [bold]iniquitous and unrealistic carbon targets[bold] that science tells us can never be implemented.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Commentary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]India and China emphasise an
[normal] overriding priority of maintaining high economic growth 
[normal]rates to raise living standards. Their plans 
[normal]ident
[normal]ify measures that promote 
[normal]development objectives while also yielding co-benefits for address
[normal]ing climate change effectively if possible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Both agree 
[normal]national measures would be more successful with assistance from developed coun
[normal]tries, and pledge
[normal] that 
[normal]per c
[normal]apita greenhouse gas emissions 
[normal]will at no point exceed tha
[normal]t of developed countries even if 
[normal]pursue
[normal]d with development objectives.
[normal] In other words their
[normal] own economies
[normal] must come first,
[normal] 
[normal]with a tacit understanding that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels cannot be controlled
[normal] by the 
[normal]developed world, and anyway 
[normal]the 
[normal]AGW 
[normal]science is 
[normal]suspect and 
[normal]not proven.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I
[normal]n 2011 
[normal]Japan and Russia stated that they would not take on further Kyoto targets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Canadian government invoked Canada's legal right to formally withdra
[normal]w from the Kyoto Protocol in 
[normal]December 2011.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Canada was committed to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2012, but in 2009 emissions were 17% higher than in 1990
[normal], 
[normal]while warming remained static
[normal]. The Environment minister
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]cited Canada's liability to "enormous financial penalties" under the 
[normal]Kyoto 
[normal]treaty unless it withdrew.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]He also suggested that the recently signed
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Durban agreement
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]may provide an alternative way forward.
[normal] 
[normal]Canada's decision was strongly c
[normal]riticised by 
[normal]other ratifying countries
[normal].

[normal]N.B.[bold]On a topical 
[normal]but 
[normal]sad 
[normal]note following the 
[normal]dea
[normal]th of our former Prime Minister,
[normal] 
[normal]Baroness 
[normal]Lady Thatcher
[normal] (‘The P
[normal]olitician
[normal]’
[normal])
[normal], she
[normal] 
[normal]was greatly 
[normal]responsible 
[normal]during the 1980s for adopting an
[normal] 
[normal]AGW agenda. This course of action 
[normal]was 
[normal]t
[normal]aken-up by most developed 
[normal]countries b
[normal]ecause of her 
[normal]symbolic
[normal] 
[normal]status
[normal] 
[normal]in the world of politics
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]On further investigation 
[normal]however 
[normal]during

[normal]her retirement
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]Lady Thatcher
[normal] 
[normal](
