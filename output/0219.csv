defaultically reducing the market size

defaultas forensic budgets are cut further.

defaultDespite the proven value of using forensic services in the 
defaultdetection of 
defaultcrime 
defaultand the inherent cost efficiencies of using forensic analysis vs alternative policing measures
default,
default police and other law enforcement agencies continue to apply their own budget reductions to out-sourced services, including forensic services. 
defaultPrivate forensic suppliers will have their ability to conduct R&amp;D severely curtailed as
default a
default direct result of reduced profitability and also a reduced opportunity to recover initial R&amp;D investment in a rapidly shrinking market
default, removing
default incentive to make initial R&amp;D investment. 
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany sources of government funding to support R&amp;D have been terminated, leaving no or very little grant aid for the support of R&amp;D
default, especially in the forensics sector due to its rapidly shrinking size
default.
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs a consequence of 
defaultthe rapidly falling market size
default 
defaultFSP
default services are increasingly price
default sensitive, building pressure for
default further price reductions. 
defaultThe combined impact of falling market volumes and falling prices will inevitably have an adverse impact on resource available for on-going R&amp;D or other improvements to service
defaults
default developed by the private FSPs, whereas very little or no
default R&amp;D or similar improvements have been
default develo
defaultped by police in-house activity so far.
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs a consequence of the points raised above it is our conclusion that there is no
default national strategy for forensic science
default and, therefore, it cannot possibly be sufficient to 
defaultsupport either forensic science R&amp;D
default or the criminal justice system.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe implementation of the contracts to award previous FSS casework to KFS ran smoothly from our perspective. We have no knowledge of the budget to close the FSS and so have no opinion on this aspect.
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is our opinion, however, that whatever the costs of closing the FSS these will be recouped many times over by the more cost efficient delivery of the same services from private FSPs who are providing the same high quality service at 
defaultconsiderably
default lower prices than the FSS were using.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default3.1 
default              
defaultThe vast majority of outsourced police forensic services are procured via the Next Generation Forensic Framework Agreement. For private FSPs to secure approval to supply services via this procurement vehicle they must have secured the necessary accreditations for each forensic discipline they wish to provide. The accreditations are awarded and subsequently monitored by an independent accreditation service, UKAS, the same service that awarded and maintained similar accreditations to the FSS. 
defaultTherefore, the private FSPs provide services to the same 
defaultor higher 
defaultstandard
defaults
default as previously provided by the FSS, which are constantly reviewed and enhance
defaultd
default by UKAS, 
defaultThe Forensic Science Regulator and other stakeholders such as the National DNA Database Delivery Unit and NDNAD Strategy Board. 
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe same is not true of 
defaultsome small FSPs,
default individual forensic experts who continue to operate outside of ISO 17025 
defaultand some 
defaultin-house police forensic services, where individual police forces are able to provide their own forensic services without accreditation, or 
defaultat best with
default nominal accreditation but without the breadth of accreditation required for each forensic discipline, which is a mandatory requirement for private FSPs before they are eligible to tender for police forensic contracts.
default 
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo comply with accreditation requirements all operational staff must be thoroughly trained and 
defaultassessed as competent in each aspect of their area of expertise. This is a requirement 
defaultof 
defaultthe Forensic Science Regulator Codes of Practice and 
defaultConduct 
defaulta 
defaultcornerstone to achieving ISO 17025 accreditation
default.
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKFS did not use the FSS for any of its training requirements. As a consequence, it is KFS’ opinion that none of its own staff have suffered any detriment to their own training needs.
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultKFS offers training courses across the breadth of forensic disciplines 
defaultto
default police and other interested parties, on a similar basis to that previously provided by the FSS. It is thus KFS’s opinion that the CJS has not materially 
defaultsuffered from any loss of training service offered by the FSS, as the same service is available from KFS and we welcome the additional source of income any such service would generate.

default              
defaultThe F
defaultorensic 
defaultScience R
defaultegulator should set the standard for any particular service and then promulgate the minimum standard service provider
defaults
default must achieve pr
defaultior to providing services. The R
defaultegulator should thus 
defaultpromote forensic best practise and effectively set the standard for minimum service levels in the UK, thereby promoting the excellence of UK based forensic services to the world.
default4.2 
default              
defaultHaving
default established best practise the R
defaultegulator should 
defaultmonitor and ensure that the appropriate minimum standard for the provision of any forensic service is maintained. This requirement should be universally applied to all 
defaultproviders of forensic services.
default4.3
default              
defaultThe Forensic R
defaultegulator should act as the ultimate arbiter of disputes arising be
defaulttween FSPs and other CJS partners.
default4.4
default              
defaultThe R
defaultegulator should promote the UK FSPs to international 
defaultcriminal investigation services and their CJS.

default5.1 
default              
defaultDuring the last few years austerity measures
default have 
defaultgenerated
default pressure on police budgets
default causing 
defaultforces
default to be more selective on what they will submit 
defaultfor 
defaultforensic analysis
default. Police forces
default have
default also increased 
defaultpre-submission 
defaultscreening of evidence prior to submission for forensic analysis. Macro economic factors have thus had a substantial impact on market volumes. Over the same period pricing has become increasingly competitive as suppliers seek to grow or maintain their 
defaulttotal 
defaultsales 
defaultincome 
defaultagainst the backdrop of a 
defaultvery rapidly 
defaultdeclining market. The total market has thus reduced due to an overall reduction in volumes and also because of price reductions.
default5.2 
default              
defaultAs part of the FSS closure a significant proportion of police forensic activity previously outsourced was instead brought in-house, further substantially reducing the market size available to FSPs. The in-sourcing of previously outsourced service is the most destabilising factor for private FSPs, as the gradual decline in revenue from reducing volumes or falling prices is more manageable over time, whereas in-sourcing represents an immediate market reduction from which there is no recovery. 
defaultContinued police in-sourcing
default activity also undermines investor interest in the sector, increasing the perceived “risk” that the market will reduce further or disappear in-house entirely.
default At the very least, police in-sourcing increases price competition to the point that margins are potentially squeezed beyond an FSPs ability to generate sufficiently attractive investor returns.
default5.3 
default              
defaultKFS estimates the current police outsourced forensic market at circa £80m and very likely to fall further as a result of additional budget reductions for police, being disproportionately f
defaultocused on forensic expenditure.
default5.4 
default              
defaultThe market cannot be considered s
defaultt
defaultable until the persistent 
defaultreductions in police forensic spend and in-sourced activity have stab
defaulti
defaultlised.
default&#xa0;
default6. default&#xa0;defaultHow are forensic science services procured by police forces and could procurement processes be improved?default&#xa0;default6.1 
default              
defaultThe vast majority of forensic services for the police are procured using the Next Generation Forensic Framework Agreement. The national procurement process is managed by the 
defaultForensic Marketplace 
defaultManagement Team attached to the Home Office
default (formally Poli
defaultce Science and Forensics Unit, 
defaultNPIA)
default. The 
defaultFMM T
defaulteam assist regional police forces 
defaultin the implementation of their own tenders under the umbrella framework agreement.
default&#xa0;
default6.2 
default              
defaultThe closure of the FSS delayed the previous schedule for regional mini tenders
default using the framework agreement
default, resulting in the current round of tenders being truncated
default to ensure that they are all renewed within legal time frames. It would be better for future t
defaultenders to be phased so that there was a
default reasonable period for scaling up and
default/or
default scaling down during implementation of 
defaultcontract 
defaultawards.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default              
defaultSome police tenders remain outside the framework and are either made using a purchase order for low value purchases or a separate stand alone procurement process.
default We could not suggest how this process may be improved.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default7.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn leaving the FSS undoubtedly some of its scientists left the forensic science profession, by either retiring, taking up alternative careers or even leaving the country.
default7.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, the market for outsourced forensics has more than halved since the decision to close the FSS was made.
default In such circumstances there would have inevitably been a loss of intellectual wealth even if the FSS had remained open. Many of the scientists previously working at the FSS have since taken up roles within the private FSPs or police 
defaultforensic 
defaultfacilities. There remains in the remaining FSPs and police 
defaultforensic 
defaultlaboratories sufficient intellectual property to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of forensic science, especially as the volume of activity has halved since the FSS’s closure.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8. Are current arrangements for the FSS’s archives satisfactory? How could arrangements for the retention of case files and forensic materials in the UK be improved?default&#xa0;
default8.1 We are not privy to the detail of how the FSS’s archives are arranged. We are not best placed to suggest how such arrangements might be improved.

defaultDeclaration of Interestdefault by Key Forensic Services Ltd. Key Forensic Services Ltd is private UK owned company, offering a broad range of forensic services primarily to UK law enforcement agencies, and established as a direct competitor to the FSS. As such, Key Forensic Services is anticipating a more rapid uptake of FSS clients, which the company would otherwise have anticipated over a more protracted period via the scheduled Police procurement program.
