"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Ian Mckerron Begg, Badenyon, Glenbuchat, Aberdeenshire&#xa0;\nThe family of \nBegg\n moved into \nBadenyon\n, \nGlenbuchat\n in 1775 and were in continuous occupation of the property until 1956 when the last occupier of the property, John \nBegg\n, died.\n \nIn his will among other things, he left to George \nBegg\n, farme\nr Milton Bank, Aberdeenshire “\nAll my interest as land holder at \nBadenyon\n”\n \nIt is not known what this means. \n&#xa0;\nI am Ian \nMcKerron\n \nBegg\n a descendant of the \nBegg\n family from \nBadenyon\n and am in process of trying to find information on the land and buildings at \nBadenyon\n.\n \nI have several items from \nBadenyon\n which have come to me via my father who was a beneficiary in John \nBegg’s\n will.\n&#xa0;\nWe have no details but it is known that there was a court case in the earlier part of the 20\nth\n century when we believe that John \nBegg\n fought a case against the estate of \nGlenbuchat\n that had claimed ownership of \nBadenyon\n.\n \nDuring that case, John \nBegg’s\n file on the property at \nBadenyon\n, which had been deposited with a legal firm in Aberdeen, was lost when in the hands of that legal firm.\n \nThe ruling of the court is not known but the phrase used by John \nBegg\n in his will suggests that he lost his case.\n \nI am interested in trying to find out what happened.\n \nThere is a feeling that the estate\n \npossibly grabbed the land and buildings because ownership by the \nBegg\n family could not be formally established although they had “owned” \nBadenyon\n since 1775.\n&#xa0;\nTo this end I intend in the very near future to start my inquiry by getting in touch with the Registers of Scotland, hoping that decisions of the court, mentioned above, are lodged there.\n&#xa0;\nMy niece Norma \nBegg\n has uncovered an interesting but inconclusive letter written on precisely the subject of my submission. There is a snippet of information about \nBadenyon\n ownership.\n \n&#xa0;\nSomeone in Canada has taken time to transcribe letters between Harry \nBegg\n and the family in Scotland and post these online.\n \nIn one particular letter from Charles \nBegg\n to Harry, dated \"Milltown of \nTowie\n 13th July 1835\" it states: \"John \nBegg\n at \nBadenyon\n has renewed his lease for nine years and James at \nBlackhilder\n has taken his for nineteen. They are still divided on the score of immigration one bad season would send them all scampering over to your land of promise. \"\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.glenbuchatheritage.com/picture/number748.asp\n&#xa0;\nI wonder if the lease is for the land or both land and buildings?\n \nwhich leads to the question who built the house and \nsteading\n at \nBadenyon\n and when? and what was the legal position about building on the land at \nBadenyon\n?\n \nI wonder if the Court case, referred to earlier and held in the earlier part of the 20th Century could refer to this question?\n&#xa0;\nWhen the last owner of \nBadenyon\n died, I was in touch with the beneficiary Charles \nBegg\n asking if I could help to keep the house in good condition; but he would have none of it, I could put a caravan on the site, he said.\n \nAn interesting statement in itself.\n \nI had no wish to do so at the time for various reasons viz. Aesthetic, no need, and not enough money.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
