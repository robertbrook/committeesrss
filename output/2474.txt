[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Riverside is one of the largest housing association groups in the country, owning and managing over 53,000 properties across England and Scotland. The Riverside Group Limited is the main asset-owning association in the group. In addition to providing general needs accommodation, Riverside delivers supported housing through a sheltered and supported arm of the business, Riverside ECHG (RECHG), which provides services to more than 11,500 vulnerable clients with a diverse range of housing needs.

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Riverside welcomes the opportunity to submit views to the Work and Pensions Select Committee as part of the inquiry into support for housing costs in the reformed welfare system. Our evidence is presented in three sections:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; commentary on the early operational impact of welfare reform for our customers and Riverside as a social business;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; new evidence derived from recent research undertaken by Riverside and partners; and in the light of this experience and evidence: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; recommendations for practical changes which could reduce the negative impact of a number of welfare reform measures, whilst helping the Government meet its broader objectives.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although it is still relatively early to gauge the full impact of welfare reform on the livelihoods of tenants, a number of clear trends are beginning to emerge following the introduction of the under-occupation penalty. The NHF’s report; “The Bedroom Tax in Merseyside, 100 Days On” gives an account of the situation in the region, and much of this can be extrapolated to the north of England as a whole. More recently, the NHF have revealed results of a survey of 51 housing associations around England, finding that more than half (32,432) of residents affected by the bedroom tax have been unable to pay their rent between April and June. A quarter of those affected are in rent arrears for the first time.&#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This is reflected in Riverside’s direct experience. Over 6,000 Riverside tenants are affected by the under-occupation penalty, or over a third of working age claimants, with the overwhelming majority (98%) of those affected living in general needs properties. Tenants across the country are facing the penalty, including London and the South East, with over 45s and disabled tenants being over-represented. &#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Two years ago – as part of Housing Futures Network – we undertook a survey of tenants likely to be affected by the under-occupation penalty. It suggested that 25% were likely to seek to downsize, 83% were concerned about meeting the shortfall in their rent, with 35% considering it likely or very likely that they would go into rent arrears. Two years on, the real experience of tenants is echoing these early indicators of behavioural response. &#xa0;Housing Futures Network Survey, 2011&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Rent arrears are increasing and this is largely driven by tenants affected by the under-occupation penalty not meeting the shortfall in their rent. Nearly half (47%) of tenants affected by the under-occupation penalty are in arrears, around double the percentage of those unaffected. Whilst the majority of affected tenants have met some of the shortfall in their rent (77%), arrears are have risen by an average of £150,000 each month since April. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; despite Riverside having a general shortage of housing to help tenants who want to downsize, many are moving – 370 since the beginning of April. Whilst over half are moving to other affordable homes&#xa0;– either Riverside’s or other social landlords’ – at least a third may be moving into the high-rent private rented sector, far more than the Government has assumed in its forecasts. If this continues, by the end of the year over 1,100 tenants could have moved, close to 20% of those affected. And it is feared that it may be more, as some tenants find that they simply cannot afford to stay, particularly as energy costs rise with the advent of winter. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; in the year to the end of August (2013), there has been a 50% + rise in the number of empty properties, an increase of over 200. This has been fuelled by increased turnover and growing re-let times, which by the end of August had increased by 8.3 days or 28% compared to the full year figure for 2012/13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; there is little evidence of significant numbers of affected tenants moving into work. The rate of worklessness amongst Riverside’s working age tenants is high at around 60%, and qualitative research indicates that even where tenants have been successful in moving into work, it is often temporary and insecure.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; All of these have factors have a combined impact on the association’s bottom line, and ultimately our capacity to do other things. We have built a financial model to forecast the impact of welfare reform (including under-occupation penalty and the roll out of Universal Credit) on our income and expenditure, primarily through lost income (expressed as void rent loss and bad debt) and increased cash collection costs. Given the evidence we have to date, we forecast that in the worst case, the annual bottom line impact is likely to be £22m over 5 years. This will have a significant impact on our capacity to invest in other priority activities, such as the provision of new homes.

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are doing what we can to support tenants, and our 12-strong money advice team is bringing some benefits. On the basis of current experience, we project that over the year we may help tenants affected by the under-occupation penalty secure around £500,000 of extra income through discretionary housing payments and the maximisation of other benefits. From the beginning of March 2013 to the end of July we had successfully helped just under 300 tenants secure Discretionary Housing Payments, totalling nearly £49,000. However the majority of payments are short term, and will not necessarily be repeated. In addition Riverside’s employment support and affordable warmth programmes are helping boost the earning potential and disposable income of our tenants and residents. However, despite this positive activity, the net benefit to customers are dwarfed by the massive £4.53m our tenants will lose in housing benefit as a result of the under-occupation penalty alone.&#xa0;2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whilst landlord support is a really important element in helping tenants make the transition in the wake of welfare reform, in itself it is not the answer.&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition to monitoring the operational impact of welfare reform, we are undertaking a number of related research projects. &#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have conducted a sample survey of tenants, to explore money management, financial skills and spending habits in the lead up to the introduction of UC. The findings are alarming, and suggest that many of our tenants will not have the capacity to handle a welfare system based on on-line claims and monthly direct payments without significant support. In particular:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Almost half of Riverside tenants have no access to the internet, however 49% of tenants currently in receipt of housing benefit would not feel comfortable making an on-line claim, even with support – including 31% of those who already have access to the internet via their own computer&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although most tenants (84%) have bank accounts, the majority (74%) still like to manage their money through cash, with only 25% paying their rent through direct debit or a standing order, and nearly 50% retaining pre-paid utility meters, despite higher tariffs.&#xa0;3.3              In this context the Government’s ambition to roll out a successful ‘digital by default’ approach to UC, without the need for unsustainable levels of support and arrangements for exceptions, seems extremely ambitious.&#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In a separate piece of research, we are currently assessing the likely level of savings (to Government) generated by the under-occupation penalty, working with 3 other social landlords -  Affinity Sutton, Gentoo and Wigan and Leigh Housing - with support from the Centre for Housing Policy (University of York). Using the DWP’s own savings impact model, and re-running it with data drawn from ‘real’ experience across the four organisations since April, our initial findings indicate that the level of savings projected by DWP are likely to have been overstated to a significant extent, and possibly by as much as a third. Despite savings generation being one of the Government’s key objectives for the policy, and central to Parliamentary debates during the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill, our study confirms the DWP’s own assessment that “uncertainty about likely claimant and landlord responses to the introduction of the social sector size criteria [which] creates uncertainty about the benefit saving likely to be realised” (DWP 2012 p13). Our work also highlights significant deficiencies in the design of the model which are likely to have further overstated the level of savings generated through the implementation of the under-occupation penalty.&#xa0;3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This research compliments work being undertaken by the National Housing Federation, considering the indirect costs which should be taken into account in an overall assessment of the financial impact of the policy. These include potential extra net costs to tenants, landlords, local authorities and the voluntary sector, including:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The £65m increase in the Discretionary Housing Payments budget already set aside for 2013/14 – these should be netted off ‘claimed’ savings immediately;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The additional costs of fitting aids and adaptations for disabled tenants who chose to move;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The significant additional costs to housing associations facing rising rent arrears, re-let times, rent collection and tenant support costs, and in particular the impact on lost development capacity at a time when Government is trying to drive increased housing supply;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Additional indirect costs to other public services coping with the knock-on consequences of tenants moving or accumulating debt, for example homelessness, health and social services and advisory services.&#xa0;3.6              Whilst it is difficult to quantify these additional costs with accuracy, taken together with the reduced savings discussed in 3.4 above, we believe there is a powerful case for further scrutiny of the DWP’s £930m two year savings estimate, which has been presented as one of the central objectives of this policy.&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We support the overall need to reform the welfare benefit system to be fairer, encourage more people into work and take responsibility for managing their money.

[[[&#xa0;]]]However we believe that significant challenges are emerging which will mean that it is difficult for the Government to meet its wider welfare and housing objectives. We urge the Select Committee to consider the following practical changes:

[[[size criteria for social housing]]]

[[[ allowing one extra bedroom –]]]We recognise there is a need to free up properties to tackle the urgent issue of overcrowding in social housing. However, the response needs to be proportionate, and Government figures on overcrowding and under-occupation (through DCLG’s latest English Housing Survey) show that this objective could be met by changing the definition of under-occupation (for the purpose of calculating housing benefit/UC) to allow one extra bedroom. This would bring the DWP definition close to the definition used by DCLG and the social housing sector for many years. It would help claimants living in social housing to thrive, supporting payment for modest additional space to allow separate bedrooms for teenage children to study, couples who face illness and disability and separated parents with access to children. It would reduce the numbers facing reduced benefit by 75%, and focus on dealing with ‘problematic’ levels of under-occupation. It would also give landlords the capacity to deal with the significant numbers of elderly tenants (exempt from the penalty) who are under-occupying their homes and wish to move. A revised definition would reduce the need to rely on inconsistently delivered discretionary assistance (DHP), reduce the risk of tribunal challenge and end the need for an ever growing list of exemptions. It would introduce a standard which reflects the way low income households live in the 21st century. Furthermore, our research suggests that such a change may not result in the loss of savings anticipated by Government, and that the basis for the savings already claimed requires urgent re-examination.&#xa0;4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ ]]]Given the results of our recent tenant survey, and evidence emerging from the direct payment demonstration projects, we are very concerned about the extent of support that will be required to enable tenants to manage UC, and in particular the direct payment of the housing cost element. We fear that the sheer volume of claimants seeking payment exceptions, or being forced into ‘switchback’ arrangements because of accumulating arrears, will overwhelm the administration of UC. We recommend that tenants are given real choice and appropriate tools to manage their housing payments under UC, which reflect the way in which low income households manage money. We strongly commend the ‘Budgeting Portal’ proposal made by the Social Market Foundation, which would sit alongside the normal claims process under Universal Credit. The portal would enable claimants to manage their Universal Credit ‘at source’ through an online tool, and direct regular electronic payments to their landlord, child-care provider etc. without the need for the development of new, expensive banking products.

[[[ ]]]It would enable financial ownership and responsibility by claimants, whilst giving landlords increased rent certainty and a real incentive to support tenants develop their financial capacity and digital skills.&#xa0;4.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Give clarity about the position of vulnerable tenants living in supported housing under Universal Credit. ]]]Despite encouraging comments from Ministers, there is still uncertainty about the way in which housing cost support for vulnerable tenants living in supported housing will be dealt with following the introduction of UC. In particular urgent clarity is required on the definition of ‘exempt accommodation’ to ensure that support for all legitimate supported housing tenancies can be dealt with outside UC (for not-for-profit providers), including cases where support services are delivered by a third party. There also needs to be consultation on the details of any proposed options for the localisation of support for housing costs, ensuring it is based on a system of entitlement, rather than subject to the whim of local political priorities. This would provide greater protection for vulnerable households, and certainty for providers seeking to invest in much needed existing and new housing support services.
