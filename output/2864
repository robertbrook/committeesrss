[normal]Executive Summary[bold] [bold]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Over the past two years, Burma has experienced dramatic changes, from domestic political 
[normal]reforms to the removal of many international sanctions. While these changes have presented the country with a multitude of opportunities, there remain long-standing and evolving challenges to democratic and economic development. President U Thein Sein has laid out a strategy to support the livelihood and socio-economic needs of the Burma people through 
[normal]people-centred development 
[normal]and efforts to ensure that rural areas “see and enjoy those benefits”
[normal].
[normal] This will entail a long decentralization process that not only devolves power to local government and extends service delivery to previously self-governed areas, but also one that will empower the voice and inclusive participation of 
[normal]communities
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To support the country’s development and in line with national priorities, DFID should invest in the vital development areas of regional/state and local governance strengthening, civil society strengthening, natural resource management
[normal] (NRM)
[normal], health, and wealth creation utilizing an integrated approach. DFID should ensure that these programmatic interventions are complemented by regular population-level research and that civil society at all levels is engaged in 
[normal]genuine 
[normal]partnership. As a whole these efforts can address critical needs, alleviate poverty through livelihoods creation, develop capacity of local government, and begin to change communities understanding and expectations of accountable service provision establishing the foundations for a peaceful, democratic country from the bottom-up.

[normal]Introduction and Reason for Submitting Evidence  [bold]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Established in 1971 to formally unite development-oriented non-profits across the globe, Pact is an independent international non-profit corporation currently managing 58 projects in 21 countries ranging in size from under $100,000 up to $240 million, with funding from public 
[normal]and private donors. Pact develops the capacity of local leaders, civil society, citizens, and government institutions to increase people’s dignity, health, and commitment to stronger social and institutional support systems. Our work is grounded in the belief that local communities must be the driving force in ending poverty and injustice. To accomplish this, we design and implement our projects to maximize local ownership and to leverage existing systems and networks.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Since 1997, Pact has been supporting local communities in Burma to drive and lead their own process and efforts to achieve peace and development working with citizens, local government, and civil society. 
[normal] 
[normal]As the longest serving international NGO in Burma, Pact’s work covers a broad spectrum of interventions - health, livelihoods, local governance, civil society strengthening, water and sanitation, and women’s empowerment. Currently, Pact provides structured development assistance to more than 
[normal]one
[normal] million households in Burma. Pact is submitting evidence with respect to our extensive experience in the country and lessons learned.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Governance and Security[bold]Decentralization and Local Governance
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Burma’s process of decentralized governance offers numerous opportunities for DFID to provide assistance to “help create a better governed, more peaceful and prosperous Burma that uses its increased wealth to reduce poverty”
[normal].  Given that UNDP/UNDCF and World Bank are focusing on strengthening township level governance, future DFID governance programming should focus on 
[normal]governance
[normal] at the regional/state level and how this system is strongly linked with township and village tracts levels
[normal] integrated service delivery
[normal].  Targeted assistance in select regions and states focusing on transparent, effective governance and sound public financial management, which promotes an enabling environment for responsible investment, will contribute to more prosperous communities and 
[normal]increased
[normal] capacity of regional administrations to plan and implement development activities 
[normal]that
[normal] count the voice of their people.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As part of the response to Cyclone Nargis, many INGOs utilized community driven development (CDD) methodologies to empower 
[normal]urban wards
[normal] and village-tracts to make decisions and actively participate in their own development projects.
[normal] 
[normal] This resulted in 
[normal]a 
[normal]myriad 
[normal]of 
[normal]small
[normal]-
[normal]scale, cost-effective infrastructure and economic development initiatives that improved villagers’ lives and gave them confidence to participate in and lead their own development.  We recommend that by supporting CDD as a core implementation methodology, DFID will ensure community level actors will be prepared to actively participate in decision making and oversight of government investments in their urban wards or village tracts thus ensuring transparent, effective local governance and more effective community monitoring of increasing resources.
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendations:
[normal]3.3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Capacity development of local government at the regional/state level to improve local governance
[normal] (e.g. 
[normal]management, constituent consultation, access to information, social accountability, 
[normal]interaction 
[normal]with 
[normal]local
[normal] authorities, and national level advocacy for services
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]3.3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Support 
[normal]CDD
[normal] activities that strengthen local governance in urban wards and village tracts by empowering communities to lead development
[normal], promoting inclusive and equitable access to resources,
[normal] and increasing accountability of the government. 
[normal]3.3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Develop monitoring and evaluation frameworks that are able to measure changes in local governance 
[normal](e.g. 
[normal]participation, leadership, and access to services
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]Strengthening Civil Society
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There have been an increasing number of civil society organizations (CSOs) and growing space for civic participation in Burma. 
[normal]Yet, as a whole, civil society and its connections to donors and INGOs remain relatively nascent, and the level of civic participation differs by region. 
[normal] 
[normal]As a complement 
[normal]to the supply-side of governance, civil society from the community-level up to the national level plays a critical role in the demand side of governance.
[normal] 
[normal] DFID should seek to strengthen civil society
[normal] by targeting these multiple levels. Given the late opening up, INGOs and donors have
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the chance to do things differently
[normal],
[normal] in accordance to the Rome,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Istanbul, Paris, and Busan conversations on aid effectiveness and country ownership
[normal],
[normal] to strengthen civil society in a way that promotes a unique 
[normal]Burmese civil society
[normal] in partnership rather than dependency or co
[normal]-opted by external priorities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At the local level, civic participation has been 
[normal]limited
[normal]. Most village decisions are made by administrative officials or influential village elders. Women, youth, poor, and ethnic minorities are generally excluded from village institutions. DFID should support inclusive and participatory 
[normal]v
[normal]illage 
[normal]d
[normal]evelopment 
[normal]p
[normal]lanning processes that increase the voice of marginalized groups. 
[normal] 
[normal]These processes would not only improve the planning of service delivery, but also set new precedents for community planning that more accurately represent the interests of the entire community.
[normal] 
[normal] In addition, DFID should seek to mainstream principles of good governance into development sector interventions to begin 
[normal]changing
[normal] norms of accountable service provision. 
[normal] 
[normal]These efforts will have direct effects on local governance along with indirect positive effects towards promoting free and fair elections in 2015. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At the township and regional/state level, DFID should work to strengthen CSOs to enable them to take a strong
[normal]er
[normal] leadership role in their region’s development.
[normal] 
[normal] Many CSOs have weak, hierarchical organizational structures built around an inspirational leader and 
[normal]limited
[normal] experience engaging with regional authorities.
[normal] 
[normal] DFID’s programming across intervention areas should incorporate local partners and include capacity development components to begin the shift from INGO to LNGO provided services.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his support should 
[normal]also 
[normal]seek to integrate informal civil society in the border states that previously operated on the fringes and bring them into a more central role in the region’s development with increased linkages and positive influence on regional decision-making. 
[normal]T
[normal]his support should seek not only
[normal] to
[normal] develop organizational and technical capacities, but also over time 
[normal]higher level 
[normal]capacities 
[normal]in 
[normal]strategic planning, analysis
[normal], research, and advocacy.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At the national level, DFID should invest in efforts that encourage dialogue between civil society, government, business, and community and that strengthen inter-sectoral, inter-region, inter-ethnicity, and inter-religious connections. 
[normal] 
[normal]As civil society begins to take advantage of new found freedoms for participation and speech in the country, there will be a need to set norms of interaction and ways for collaboration that do not feel “externally” enforced, but are owned by the local actors through a process of facilitated goal identification that is inclusive of Burma’s diversity.  Some of the areas that civil society will need to work towards are developing capacity of research institutions/think tanks to improve data-driven, evidence-based approaches.
[normal] 
[normal] Also, 
[normal]civil society will need to increase their understanding of concepts of performance to understand what results they are working for and how to track progress.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendations:
[normal]3.8.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Support civil society strengthening at the local level to promote more inclusive and participatory village decision-making that would result in better development outcomes.
[normal]3.8.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Support civil society strengthening at the township
[normal]/
[normal]regional level by integrating capacity development into development interventions to develop effective, reliable, and influential partners. 
[normal]3.8.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Support the institutional development of civil society dialogue at the national level to promote an inclusive civil society. 
[normal]Natural Resource Management
[normal] and Land
[normal]3.9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Burma is rich in natural resources and is home to Southeast Asia’s largest remaining tropical forest. 
[normal] However, w
[normal]ith the opening
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]increased 
[normal]foreign investment and accelerated development are beginning to threaten the country’s biodiversity, natural resources, and watersheds, as well as the livelihoods of the people who depend on them. 
[normal] 
[normal]Shifting cultivation, timber harvesting, mining, and large infrastructure projects are already changing the face of the landscape and contributing to rising tensions between stakeholders over land, mineral
[normal]s
[normal] and other resources. There is a need for comprehensive land use planning, particularly a process that ensures the active participation of civil society.  Tied to that is an urgent need to address the inequities around current systems of land tenure and resource rights.
[normal] 
[normal] DFID should support the process of land reform and address the issue of landlessness as a driver of poverty.
[normal] 
[normal] Clear and equitable land policies are essential for Burma’s economic development and ability to attract foreign investment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.10.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendations
[normal]:
[normal]3.10.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Support the development of clear and equitable land use policies, particularly for women and vulnerable groups, by funding comprehensive land use planning and land reform. 
[normal]4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Millennium Development Goals - Health [bold]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Over the past few years, Burma has taken a series of steps to reform the health sector in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  Many in rural areas have experienced comparative improvements in the provision of health service delivery and availability.
[normal] 
[normal] Despite these highly needed reforms, many challenges to rural community health remain such as high maternal and child mortality rates due to preventable disease, malnutrition, acute respiratory infections (ARIs)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To support Maternal, Nutrition and Child Health (MNCH) should focus on Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) along with increasing community primary care initiatives.  HSS is of key importance to having serious impact in health. There remains a lack of available services in many areas along with long distances and quality concerns between those available services.  DFID should continue to support assistance towards this through the 
[normal]multi-donor trust fund 
[normal]mechanisms. 
[normal] This should include supporting additional funding for training and staffing rural medical centres and mid-wife training. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To complement HSS, DFID should also support strengthening of community primary care initiatives.  First, DFID should support the scale up of recommendations and provision of zinc for diarrhoea.  Often in rural areas only Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) are available. Second, exclusive breastfeeding numbers remain low at only 24
[normal]%
[normal].  More could be done to educate women and families on the benefits of this.  Third, the government should put a task shifting plan in place to move some of the responsibilities for treating the sick child to community workers.  Currently, community workers and volunteers are not permitted to distribute amoxicillin for pneumonia or ARIs.  This would save many children’s lives, especially in the first two years, when the most deaths occur due to pneumonia
[normal].  Finally, the testing and treating for uncomplicated malaria should be scaled up with community workers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to MNCH, DFID should increase support to sustainable health interventions that bridge gaps between primary, second, and tertiary care.
[normal] 
[normal] This focus should include both food security and nutrition support and access to community health financing. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Food security and nutrition are critical to maintaining health as families that are able to meet their nutritional needs are more resilient to health challenges.
[normal] 
[normal] To this end, DFID should intensify support to smallholders with a view to inculcating income generation and economic growth at the individual and community level.
[normal] 
[normal] This could be achieved through scaled up crop production and livestock diversification and intensification programs.  Other possibilities might include identifying and supporting collaboration with agribusiness at the intersection of economic growth and community strengthening in terms of health, livelihoods and income generation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID should also consider increasing investment to community health financing. Pact has found that community-managed funds can play a critical role in enabling communities to address health needs
[normal] and
[normal] build resilience to health-related 
[normal]emergencies
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]One of the main barriers to care is access to services due to lack of transportation over long distances.  
[normal]T
[normal]his lack of affordable transportation results in decreased Tuberculosis (TB) case detection rates and evolution of drug resistant strains of both TB and malaria when people do not seek testing and treatment.  In an effort to address this issue many current program models depend on continued funding for incentives paid to community health workers.
[normal] 
[normal] The sustainability of such approaches is questionable if the future burden for supporting these initiatives 
[normal]is
[normal] shifted to the Ministry of Health. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendations
[normal]:
[normal]4.7.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID should continue support to HSS through 
[normal]multi-donor trust fund mechanisms 
[normal]as it is critical to having health impact in the country. 
[normal]4.7.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID should intensify support to community primary care initiatives to improve outcomes in MNCH.    
[normal]4.7.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]DFID should focus on sustainable solutions to health by increasing support to food security and community health financing activities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Wealth Creation [bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite 
[normal]recent
[normal] economic growth, Burma remains one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia, with a per capita income of approximately $US832
[normal].  
[normal]N
[normal]early 26
[normal]% 
[normal]live in poverty, with an even higher percentage of those living in rural areas
[normal].  By creating wealth in rural areas, DFID will improve standards of living and help reduce urban poverty by creating attractive alternatives in rural areas. 
[normal] Key
[normal] challenges to wealth creation are access to financial services, savings, and rural private sector growth.  Addressing these challenges through a three pronged approach can be an effective tool in combatting poverty, improving livelihoods, and indirectly reducing the structural factors for conflict. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]First, access to financial services remains a challenge for the majority of people. Industry experts estimate the unmet demand for microcredit is as high as US $1 billion
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Through LIFT, DFID is investing in local 
[normal]microfinance institutions
[normal] and their capacity to deliver financial services.  This investment should continue, as it takes a myriad of different approaches to build a healthy microfinance sector, and strong local organizations will play an increasingly important role. DFID has 
[normal]also 
[normal]demonstrated, through its recent direct support of Pact Global Microfinance Fund (PGMF), that given the proper delivery mechanisms, a large number of rural poor may achieve access to financial services in a very short length of time.  DFID should continue to build on these models, supporting the nascent microfinance sector by scaling up investments in access to finance.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Second, savings are critical to building a household’s resilience to shocks and response to medical emergencies. One method would be to support MFIs. 
[normal] 
[normal]An additional method would be to support savings groups to reduce vulnerability by enabling people to use their own resources to smooth their consumption rates and reinvest in their basic needs after a shock.
[normal] 
[normal] This reduces vulnerability and improves household resilience. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Third, DFID should 
[normal]support
[normal] innovation and new business creation in small and medium enterprises in rural areas where economic opportunities remain limited. 
[normal] 
[normal]The provision of credit coupled with business development and entrepreneurship skills building enables people to make the most of their access to credit. 
[normal] 
[normal]As the overwhelming majority of rural livelihoods are in agriculture, key trainings could include value chain analysis, diversification of livelihoods, and financial management. 
[normal] 
[normal]Through improved business skills and an understanding of how to leverage markets, DFID can have a strong impact on rural livelihoods.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendations
[normal]:
[normal]5.5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Increase access to affordable financial services by increasing available capital to microfinance industry and supporting efforts to strengthen nascent microfinance providers. 
[normal]5.5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Strengthen economic resilience in rural areas by supporting the establishment of rural savings groups.
[normal]5.5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Support rural private sector growth in small and medium enterprises by increasing the availability of business development and entrepreneurship skills building.
