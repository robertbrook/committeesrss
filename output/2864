defaultExecutive Summarydefault default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOver the past two years, Burma has experienced dramatic changes, from domestic political 
defaultreforms to the removal of many international sanctions. While these changes have presented the country with a multitude of opportunities, there remain long-standing and evolving challenges to democratic and economic development. President U Thein Sein has laid out a strategy to support the livelihood and socio-economic needs of the Burma people through 
defaultpeople-centred development 
defaultand efforts to ensure that rural areas “see and enjoy those benefits”
default.
default This will entail a long decentralization process that not only devolves power to local government and extends service delivery to previously self-governed areas, but also one that will empower the voice and inclusive participation of 
defaultcommunities
default.  
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo support the country’s development and in line with national priorities, DFID should invest in the vital development areas of regional/state and local governance strengthening, civil society strengthening, natural resource management
default (NRM)
default, health, and wealth creation utilizing an integrated approach. DFID should ensure that these programmatic interventions are complemented by regular population-level research and that civil society at all levels is engaged in 
defaultgenuine 
defaultpartnership. As a whole these efforts can address critical needs, alleviate poverty through livelihoods creation, develop capacity of local government, and begin to change communities understanding and expectations of accountable service provision establishing the foundations for a peaceful, democratic country from the bottom-up.

defaultIntroduction and Reason for Submitting Evidence  default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEstablished in 1971 to formally unite development-oriented non-profits across the globe, Pact is an independent international non-profit corporation currently managing 58 projects in 21 countries ranging in size from under $100,000 up to $240 million, with funding from public 
defaultand private donors. Pact develops the capacity of local leaders, civil society, citizens, and government institutions to increase people’s dignity, health, and commitment to stronger social and institutional support systems. Our work is grounded in the belief that local communities must be the driving force in ending poverty and injustice. To accomplish this, we design and implement our projects to maximize local ownership and to leverage existing systems and networks.
default&#xa0;default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince 1997, Pact has been supporting local communities in Burma to drive and lead their own process and efforts to achieve peace and development working with citizens, local government, and civil society. 
default 
defaultAs the longest serving international NGO in Burma, Pact’s work covers a broad spectrum of interventions - health, livelihoods, local governance, civil society strengthening, water and sanitation, and women’s empowerment. Currently, Pact provides structured development assistance to more than 
defaultone
default million households in Burma. Pact is submitting evidence with respect to our extensive experience in the country and lessons learned.

defaultGovernance and SecuritydefaultDecentralization and Local Governance
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBurma’s process of decentralized governance offers numerous opportunities for DFID to provide assistance to “help create a better governed, more peaceful and prosperous Burma that uses its increased wealth to reduce poverty”
default.  Given that UNDP/UNDCF and World Bank are focusing on strengthening township level governance, future DFID governance programming should focus on 
defaultgovernance
default at the regional/state level and how this system is strongly linked with township and village tracts levels
default integrated service delivery
default.  Targeted assistance in select regions and states focusing on transparent, effective governance and sound public financial management, which promotes an enabling environment for responsible investment, will contribute to more prosperous communities and 
defaultincreased
default capacity of regional administrations to plan and implement development activities 
defaultthat
default count the voice of their people.
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs part of the response to Cyclone Nargis, many INGOs utilized community driven development (CDD) methodologies to empower 
defaulturban wards
default and village-tracts to make decisions and actively participate in their own development projects.
default 
default This resulted in 
defaulta 
defaultmyriad 
defaultof 
defaultsmall
default-
defaultscale, cost-effective infrastructure and economic development initiatives that improved villagers’ lives and gave them confidence to participate in and lead their own development.  We recommend that by supporting CDD as a core implementation methodology, DFID will ensure community level actors will be prepared to actively participate in decision making and oversight of government investments in their urban wards or village tracts thus ensuring transparent, effective local governance and more effective community monitoring of increasing resources.
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecommendations:
default3.3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCapacity development of local government at the regional/state level to improve local governance
default (e.g. 
defaultmanagement, constituent consultation, access to information, social accountability, 
defaultinteraction 
defaultwith 
defaultlocal
default authorities, and national level advocacy for services
default)
default. 
default3.3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSupport 
defaultCDD
default activities that strengthen local governance in urban wards and village tracts by empowering communities to lead development
default, promoting inclusive and equitable access to resources,
default and increasing accountability of the government. 
default3.3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDevelop monitoring and evaluation frameworks that are able to measure changes in local governance 
default(e.g. 
defaultparticipation, leadership, and access to services
default)
default. 
defaultStrengthening Civil Society
default3.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere have been an increasing number of civil society organizations (CSOs) and growing space for civic participation in Burma. 
defaultYet, as a whole, civil society and its connections to donors and INGOs remain relatively nascent, and the level of civic participation differs by region. 
default 
defaultAs a complement 
defaultto the supply-side of governance, civil society from the community-level up to the national level plays a critical role in the demand side of governance.
default 
default DFID should seek to strengthen civil society
default by targeting these multiple levels. Given the late opening up, INGOs and donors have
default&#xa0;
defaultthe chance to do things differently
default,
default in accordance to the Rome,
default&#xa0;
defaultIstanbul, Paris, and Busan conversations on aid effectiveness and country ownership
default,
default to strengthen civil society in a way that promotes a unique 
defaultBurmese civil society
default in partnership rather than dependency or co
default-opted by external priorities.
default&#xa0;
default3.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt the local level, civic participation has been 
defaultlimited
default. Most village decisions are made by administrative officials or influential village elders. Women, youth, poor, and ethnic minorities are generally excluded from village institutions. DFID should support inclusive and participatory

defaultp
defaultlanning processes that increase the voice of marginalized groups. 
default 
defaultThese processes would not only improve the planning of service delivery, but also set new precedents for community planning that more accurately represent the interests of the entire community.
default 
default In addition, DFID should seek to mainstream principles of good governance into development sector interventions to begin 
defaultchanging
default norms of accountable service provision. 
default 
defaultThese efforts will have direct effects on local governance along with indirect positive effects towards promoting free and fair elections in 2015. 
default&#xa0;
default3.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt the township and regional/state level, DFID should work to strengthen CSOs to enable them to take a strong
defaulter
default leadership role in their region’s development.
default 
default Many CSOs have weak, hierarchical organizational structures built around an inspirational leader and 
defaultlimited
default experience engaging with regional authorities.
default 
default DFID’s programming across intervention areas should incorporate local partners and include capacity development components to begin the shift from INGO to LNGO provided services.
default 
default

default 
default&#xa0;
default3.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt the national level, DFID should invest in efforts that encourage dialogue between civil society, government, business, and community and that strengthen inter-sectoral, inter-region, inter-ethnicity, and inter-religious connections. 
default 
defaultAs civil society begins to take advantage of new found freedoms for participation and speech in the country, there will be a need to set norms of interaction and ways for collaboration that do not feel “externally” enforced, but are owned by the local actors through a process of facilitated goal identification that is inclusive of Burma’s diversity.  Some of the areas that civil society will need to work towards are developing capacity of research institutions/think tanks to improve data-driven, evidence-based approaches.
default 
default Also, 
defaultcivil society will need to increase their understanding of concepts of performance to understand what results they are working for and how to track progress.  
default&#xa0;
default3.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecommendations:
default3.8.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSupport civil society strengthening at the local level to promote more inclusive and participatory village decision-making that would result in better development outcomes.
default3.8.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSupport civil society strengthening at the township
default/
defaultregional level by integrating capacity development into development interventions to develop effective, reliable, and influential partners. 
default3.8.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSupport the institutional development of civil society dialogue at the national level to promote an inclusive civil society. 
defaultNatural Resource Management
default and Land
default3.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBurma is rich in natural resources and is home to Southeast Asia’s largest remaining tropical forest. 
default However, w
defaultith the opening
default,
default 
defaultincreased 
defaultforeign investment and accelerated development are beginning to threaten the country’s biodiversity, natural resources, and watersheds, as well as the livelihoods of the people who depend on them. 
default 
defaultShifting cultivation, timber harvesting, mining, and large infrastructure projects are already changing the face of the landscape and contributing to rising tensions between stakeholders over land, mineral
defaults
default and other resources. There is a need for comprehensive land use planning, particularly a process that ensures the active participation of civil society.  Tied to that is an urgent need to address the inequities around current systems of land tenure and resource rights.
default 
default DFID should support the process of land reform and address the issue of landlessness as a driver of poverty.
default 
default Clear and equitable land policies are essential for Burma’s economic development and ability to attract foreign investment.
default&#xa0;
default3.10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultRecommendations
default:
default3.10.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSupport the development of clear and equitable land use policies, particularly for women and vulnerable groups, by funding comprehensive land use planning and land reform. 
default4.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMillennium Development Goals - Health default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOver the past few years, Burma has taken a series of steps to reform the health sector in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  Many in rural areas have experienced comparative improvements in the provision of health service delivery and availability.
default 
default Despite these highly needed reforms, many challenges to rural community health remain such as high maternal and child mortality rates due to preventable disease, malnutrition, acute respiratory infections (ARIs)
default. 
default&#xa0;default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo support Maternal, Nutrition and Child Health (MNCH) should focus on Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) along with increasing community primary care initiatives.  HSS is of key importance to having serious impact in health. There remains a lack of available services in many areas along with long distances and quality concerns between those available services.  DFID should continue to support assistance towards this through the 
defaultmulti-donor trust fund 
defaultmechanisms. 
default This should include supporting additional funding for training and staffing rural medical centres and mid-wife training. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo complement HSS, DFID should also support strengthening of community primary care initiatives.  First, DFID should support the scale up of recommendations and provision of zinc for diarrhoea.  Often in rural areas only Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) are available. Second, exclusive breastfeeding numbers remain low at only 24
default%
default.  More could be done to educate women and families on the benefits of this.  Third, the government should put a task shifting plan in place to move some of the responsibilities for treating the sick child to community workers.  Currently, community workers and volunteers are not permitted to distribute amoxicillin for pneumonia or ARIs.  This would save many children’s lives, especially in the first two years, when the most deaths occur due to pneumonia
default.  Finally, the testing and treating for uncomplicated malaria should be scaled up with community workers. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition to MNCH, DFID should increase support to sustainable health interventions that bridge gaps between primary, second, and tertiary care.
default 
default This focus should include both food security and nutrition support and access to community health financing. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFood security and nutrition are critical to maintaining health as families that are able to meet their nutritional needs are more resilient to health challenges.
default 
default To this end, DFID should intensify support to smallholders with a view to inculcating income generation and economic growth at the individual and community level.
default 
default This could be achieved through scaled up crop production and livestock diversification and intensification programs.  Other possibilities might include identifying and supporting collaboration with agribusiness at the intersection of economic growth and community strengthening in terms of health, livelihoods and income generation.
default&#xa0;
default4.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDFID should also consider increasing investment to community health financing. Pact has found that community-managed funds can play a critical role in enabling communities to address health needs
default and
default build resilience to health-related 
defaultemergencies
default. 
default 
defaultOne of the main barriers to care is access to services due to lack of transportation over long distances.  
defaultT
defaulthis lack of affordable transportation results in decreased Tuberculosis (TB) case detection rates and evolution of drug resistant strains of both TB and malaria when people do not seek testing and treatment.  In an effort to address this issue many current program models depend on continued funding for incentives paid to community health workers.
default 
default The sustainability of such approaches is questionable if the future burden for supporting these initiatives 
defaultis
default shifted to the Ministry of Health. 
default&#xa0;
default4.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecommendations
default:
default4.7.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDFID should continue support to HSS through 
defaultmulti-donor trust fund mechanisms 
defaultas it is critical to having health impact in the country. 
default4.7.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDFID should intensify support to community primary care initiatives to improve outcomes in MNCH.    
default4.7.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDFID should focus on sustainable solutions to health by increasing support to food security and community health financing activities.

defaultWealth Creation default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDespite 
defaultrecent
default economic growth, Burma remains one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia, with a per capita income of approximately $US832
default.  
defaultN
defaultearly 26
default% 
defaultlive in poverty, with an even higher percentage of those living in rural areas
default.  By creating wealth in rural areas, DFID will improve standards of living and help reduce urban poverty by creating attractive alternatives in rural areas. 
default Key
default challenges to wealth creation are access to financial services, savings, and rural private sector growth.  Addressing these challenges through a three pronged approach can be an effective tool in combatting poverty, improving livelihoods, and indirectly reducing the structural factors for conflict. 
default&#xa0;default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFirst, access to financial services remains a challenge for the majority of people. Industry experts estimate the unmet demand for microcredit is as high as US $1 billion
default. 
default 
defaultThrough LIFT, DFID is investing in local 
defaultmicrofinance institutions
default and their capacity to deliver financial services.  This investment should continue, as it takes a myriad of different approaches to build a healthy microfinance sector, and strong local organizations will play an increasingly important role. DFID has 
defaultalso 
defaultdemonstrated, through its recent direct support of Pact Global Microfinance Fund (PGMF), that given the proper delivery mechanisms, a large number of rural poor may achieve access to financial services in a very short length of time.  DFID should continue to build on these models, supporting the nascent microfinance sector by scaling up investments in access to finance.  
default&#xa0;default5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSecond, savings are critical to building a household’s resilience to shocks and response to medical emergencies. One method would be to support MFIs. 
default 
defaultAn additional method would be to support savings groups to reduce vulnerability by enabling people to use their own resources to smooth their consumption rates and reinvest in their basic needs after a shock.
default 
default This reduces vulnerability and improves household resilience. 
default&#xa0;default5.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThird, DFID should 
defaultsupport
default innovation and new business creation in small and medium enterprises in rural areas where economic opportunities remain limited. 
default 
defaultThe provision of credit coupled with business development and entrepreneurship skills building enables people to make the most of their access to credit. 
default 
defaultAs the overwhelming majority of rural livelihoods are in agriculture, key trainings could include value chain analysis, diversification of livelihoods, and financial management. 
default 
defaultThrough improved business skills and an understanding of how to leverage markets, DFID can have a strong impact on rural livelihoods.  
default&#xa0;default5.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecommendations
default:
default5.5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIncrease access to affordable financial services by increasing available capital to microfinance industry and supporting efforts to strengthen nascent microfinance providers. 
default5.5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultStrengthen economic resilience in rural areas by supporting the establishment of rural savings groups.
default5.5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSupport rural private sector growth in small and medium enterprises by increasing the availability of business development and entrepreneurship skills building.
