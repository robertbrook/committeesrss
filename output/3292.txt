[[[Written evidence from Daphne ]]]

[[[Havercroft]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]My name is Mrs Daphne Havercroft. I am a resident of South Gloucestershire. I have seven years experience as a member of the public participating in and observing public and patient involvement in local NHS service changes. I have also contributed to and observed local health authority scrutiny of these matters. I am a public member of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. I am providing this evidence in a personal capacity.&#xa0;

[[[Evidence]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]My reason for giving evidence to the Committee is that there is an assumption in the Open Public Services White Paper that people know better than politicians and that giving the people more control over services they receive will lead to better public services. This assumption needs to be thoroughly tested. Unless strong governance policies are in place at local level and audited to ensure that they truly deliver full openness and transparency, increased delegation of powers and responsibility to local level has the potential to do more harm than good.

[[[&#xa0;]]]I have answered some of the Committee’s consultation questions below and given examples as evidence to support the answers.&#xa0;

[[[To what extent is the Government’s public service reform programme]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[succeeding in:]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[a. Empowering citizens?]]]

[[[b. Improving public serv]]]

[[[ices?]]]

[[[c. Ensuring that public services are accountable to the people who use them, and to elected officials?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Currently citizens are not empowered and never will be unless organisations providing public services are seen to be truly accountable to the public. Currently local organisations providing public services have the freedom to avoid public accountability with impunity if they wish to do.&#xa0;

[[[What are the challenges and opportunities in moving power away]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[from Whitehall and into the hands of citi]]]

[[[zens?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The challenge is to genuinely move power into the hands of citizens. There is an assumption that all citizens want it. I am not convinced this is a correct assumption because empowerment carries responsibility which requires citizens to commit time to exercise their rights. Many may not be willing to allocate time to this. Consequently there is a risk that power will move to organisations and groups which claim to represent local interests and serve the public but in fact may not do so. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[How ]]]

[[[successful have the Government’s reforms been in opening up]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[public services ]]]

[[[to grassroots community groups, rather than to large]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[private or third sector organisations?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I have not seen any clear evidence of local success, rather the reverse. For example the Councils of Bristol, North Somerset, South Gloucestershire and Bath and North East Somerset have awarded contracts to run local Healthwatch to a third sector organisation which has a history of winning contracts with them. There is no publicly available information to explain the governance arrangements for local Healthwatch, including arrangements for patient and public participation in meetings and an explanation as to how the business of the meetings will be recorded and published. Over six months after it was established, no information is publicly available to show whether any grassroots community groups are part of Local Healthwatch.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[How does the Government ensure that public services develop the right kind of leadership as they become more ]]]

[[[open, more subject to scrutiny and more customer-focused?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]A considerable amount of documentation exists which describes good leadership practice – for example Nolan Standards, Code of Conduct for NHS Managers, Centre for Public Scrutiny Documents. There are many examples where these practices are not followed locally, to the detriment of openness, and public scrutiny and accountability. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]For example NHS Foundation Trusts can be completely unaccountable to local people if they choose to be.

[[[ ]]]In the case of the Foundation Trust of which I am a public member, it is impossible to contact the public and patient governors without going through the Trust. It is impossible to have meetings and conversations with public and patient governors without them being chaperoned by the Trust Board Secretary. The Trust Board Chair (as is the statutory role of all Foundation Trust Chairs) also chairs the Governors' Membership Council, thereby having the opportunity to control and influence its meeting agendas and discussions. Consequently the extent to which a Foundation Trust Board holds itself accountable to patients and the public depends entirely on the extent to which it chooses to do so. &#xa0;Another example is an organisation set up in Bristol, described as a dynamic collaboration between six NHS organisations serving the area, the city’s two universities and its local authority. It aims to generate significant health gain and improvements in service delivery in Bristol by integrating, promoting and developing Bristol's strengths in health services, research, innovation and education. It is inspired by the success of similar collaborations in the USA, Europe and East Asia. It aspires to closer working with patients, the public and communities. &#xa0;In response to an FOI request it said its Board meetings are held every two months, are not open to the public and the minutes are not published. It has significant opportunity to influence the health and wellbeing of local people, yet it is not constituted and governed in any way which would give citizens real empowerment and scrutiny of how well the partnership services the local population and the extent to which it provides value for public money. Citizens should have a say in the qualities required of people appointed to leadership roles. Where appropriate, applicants for the roles should be required to hold appropriate professional qualifications as a condition of appointment. To serve citizens properly, leaders must be appointed based not on who they know, but what they know and how well they perform as leaders. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[How realistic is it that “choice” can be exercised in public service]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[provision or should we be looking instead at greater control by users]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[so they can ensure that public services become more responsive to]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[changing needs?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]If users see evidence that providers of public services are open and accountable, they are less likely they are to demand more choice. However there is a long way to go before users have the control intended by Open Services White Paper. &#xa0;

[[[How do we make]]]

[[[ sure that all citizens are able to influence]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[public services?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Organisations which offer public services must be required to commit to delivering minimum standards of governance. Their success in meeting those standards must be externally and independently audited. &#xa0;Organisations must have policies in place to demonstrate that all citizens can influence their services. They must provide citizens with evidence that they follow these policies. The sort of behaviours used by some service providers try to obstruct citizens’ rights to influence services are as follows:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[What safeguards]]]

[[[ should be in place to deal with service providers]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[who fail to deliver services, or who deliver services of an insufficient]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[quality?]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]They should be served with improvement notices. If they fail to improve, sanctions should be applied, including contract termination if necessary. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[How do we ensure that best practice is]]]

[[[ shared so it can be replicated ]]]

[[[in the context of greater diversity of provision?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Define and agree what “best practice” means, then gather case studies

[[[ ]]]which demonstrate best practice which can be used as a resource for citizens, local public

[[[ ]]]service commissioners and providers. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[What progress has been made in setting up ]]]

[[[mutuals]]]

[[[ as an effective]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[way of delivering public services?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]It is assumed that they will act in the best interests of the public. There is a risk that they will not. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Summary ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The principle of giving more power to citizens good, but I am not convinced that the majority of citizens want it and have the time to devote to it. My experience is that the culture and leadership of some organisations which have responsibility for public services is nowhere near sufficiently developed to provide genuine transparency, openness and public accountability. Organisations such as mutuals, which are not subject to the FOIA, are taking over responsibility for services which were previously managed by public bodies which were subject to the FOIA. This is an obstacle to greater openness, transparency and public accountability. &#xa0;If services are decentralised at a faster rate than local providers develop strong leadership and commitment to public service values and accountability, the consequence for citizens will be that they will be disempowered and silenced.&#xa0;&#xa0; November 2013
