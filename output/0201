Written evidence submitted by Dr Christopher Maguire BA, MBA, PhD (FSS010)I was formerly employed by the Forensic Science Service (1981 – 2010) where latterly my position was that of Senior Forensic Consultant in the International Division.
&#xa0;
I am currently employed as a Reader in Forensic Science in the Northumbria University Centre for Forensic Science; my position is primarily a research post.  My current research interests include;
&#xa0;
&#xa0;
&#xa0;
&#xa0;
My research income has included a £285,000 contract with the Department of Public Safety, Canada to advise “A Feasible and Sustainable Model for Forensic Services Delivery in Canada”.  This work was completed in April 2012.
&#xa0;
These comments may, or may not, reflect those of my colleagues but I understand that a collective response may be submitted to you from the Northumbria University Centre for Forensic Science
&#xa0;
The following comments on some of the questions posed by the Science and Technology Committee are based on my own experiences and research and reflect my personal opinions.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I do not believe that the Government has any strategy for the provision of forensic science in England and Wales.  The delivery of forensic science has been simply driven by 
lowest 
perceived cost.  
&#xa0;
In the years 1997 – 2007 the forensic science providers 
(FSPs) 
were able to compete for work from police forces on a number of terms; service volumes, turn-round times, added-value services, research and innovation and price.  Individual pol
ice forces let contracts to FSP
s under Service Level Agreements, usually of three years duration.
  (This is still the way the Northeast police forces operate; they will be tendering for their forensic provision for the first time in March 2013)
The National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) established the National Forensic Procurement Project in 2007 to:
 “... formulate a strategy for future procurement of forensic analysis, to develop a standardized User Requirement, Specifications and Terms and Conditions and to subsequently undertake an EU procurement to select suppliers under a national (forensic) framework agreement (NFFA)”.
Note that the term used is 
‘forensic analysis’; 
indicating the desire to commoditize forensic science into a series of ‘tests’ and removing the concept of a ‘service provider’; downplaying the professionalism of the forensic scientists and the ‘value’ or ‘contribution’ the external FSPs could make to the CJS.
&#xa0;
The police forces were to 
“run mini-competitions within the framework on a regional basis” 
with the NPIA supporting the procurement process; defining the product to be delivered, the product volumes, the expected turnaround times and the quality standards to be met
.  There was no value placed on research and innovation or client/service provider partnerships.  Under this procurement process the only parameter on which the 
FSPs
 could compete was ‘Price’ and setting the NFFA under a regional basis meant that significant revenues could change hands as contracts were won and lost by 
FSPs
.
&#xa0;
An initial tender exercise was carried out by the NPIA in order to register 
FSPs
 as accredited suppliers, such that when forces or regions wanted to procure forensic science support, very little additional work would be required on behalf of the tendering authority or the FSPs.
  
 
FSS Ltd. commented to the Parliamentary Home Affairs Committee (2011):
&#xa0;
“In reality, the majority of the tenders that have taken place have selectively utilized parts of the framework, but have also introduced other bespoke elements, meaning each tender is a lengthy and relatively complicated process (and therefore also expensive) for all involved”. 
&#xa0;
And:
“Police take-up of innovation has ground to a halt and it seems that opportunities to introduce innovative solutions to criminal justice issues are not developed”.
&#xa0;
However, the police 
have 
realized significant savings in the commoditized product areas, as the competitive tendering model drove down the market price for these tests.  For example, in 2005 the price of a DNA database (CJ) analysis was about £40; by 2010 t
his had fallen to less than £20.  
&#xa0;
The introduction or the NPIA National Forensic Framework Agreement in 2007/08 created a significant barrier to new entrants.  FSPs had to respond to an initial tender exercise to be registered a suppliers under the NFFA procurement.  Without this accreditation a firm wishing to enter the market cannot compete for police business.  It is not clear to me how a new firm wishing to enter the forensic market can now obtain such accreditation.
&#xa0;
In its response to the Parliamentary Home Affairs Committee (2011) FSS Ltd. noted;
&#xa0;
“Rather than establishing and cementing a truly competitive, healthy market, the NFFA has contributed to its destabilization, introducing significant uncertainty for existing FSPs and introducing barriers for new entrants”.
&#xa0;
It is clear that the stability of the forensic market is now crucial to the Criminal Justice System of England and Wales.  In my opinion the forensic market needs significant government regulation and supervision such
 that the
 remaining forensic science suppliers can adequately recover their costs, compete to meet the changing market conditions and be incentivized to invest in research and development.
&#xa0;
In reality, following the closure of the FSS there has been little incentive for the forensic science suppliers to invest in significant primary research.   In my opinion the current FSPs undertake 
developmental research which is largely designed to minimize their internal costs and increase their competitive advantage.  
&#xa0;
I understand that one of the current suppliers purchased an advanced FSS DNA interpretation application in the aftermath of the FSS closure and has deployed this within its own organization.  I suggest that it would have been more beneficial for Criminal Justice System 
in
 England and Wales to have made the fruits of the (government funded) FSS R&amp;D programme available to 
all of the forensic science suppliers.
&#xa0;
Sir Bernard Silverman suggested that the R
esearch Councils (RCUK) and Technology Strategy Board (TSB) 
would make funding available to support university-based forensic science research.  I have to suggest that this was a naïve view.  In my experience it is extremely difficult to make the case for research funding for applied sciences to the Research Councils or to the major sources of charity funding.  Even forensic science researchers with particularly strong backgrounds (like Professor Peter Gill) have been forced to move abroad to obtain satisfactory research conditions.  As I state above
,
 I have 
obtained research funding
 from Canada and other colleagues have been successful in obtaining funding from the EU.
&#xa0;
I suggest you take note of the recent 
solicitation from the National Institute for Justice in the USA which will fund projects in ‘Applied Research and Development in 
Forensic Science for Criminal Justice Purposes
 (CFDA No. 16.560).  The solicitation states
&#xa0;
With this solicitation, NIJ seeks proposals for applied research and development projects that will: (1) increase knowledge or understanding necessary to guide forensic science policy and practice or (2) result in the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods that have the potential for forensic application. The intent of the Applied Research and Development in Forensic Science for Criminal Justice Purposes Program is to direct the findings of basic scientific research, research and development in broader scientific fields applicable to forensic science, and ongoing forensic science research toward the development of highly discriminating, accurate, reliable, cost-effective, and rapid methods for the identification, analysis, and interpretation of physical evidence for criminal justice purposes.
&#xa0;
If only the UK Government supported forensic science and R&amp;D in the same way.
&#xa0;
&#xa0;
In my opinion the closure of the FSS was anything but smooth.  The FSS needed to reinvent itself following a succession of years in which it failed to compete in a changing market and in which it continued to lose work to other suppliers.  The FSS 
underwent a
 significant programme of change involving realignment of services, laboratory closures and staff redundancies
 to try and maintain an appropriate position in the market.  
In December 2010 the government announced the closure of the FSS with effect from 31
st
 March 2012.  There was an expectation from the government, the police, ACPO and the National Policing Improvement Agency that the remaining suppliers would be willing to expand their operations to take up the service delivery contracts currently offered by FSS Ltd.  The timescales were incredibly short and, in my opinion these companies were under extreme pressure to take on this additional work.
In addition, the major police forces; including the Metropolitan Police (MPS), West Midlands Police and West Yorkshire Police continued to in-source significant proportions of their forensic science provision.  In this way the police became ‘suppliers’ as well as ‘purchasers’ of forensic science and became competitors to the traditional FSPs.   I also believe that by insourcing such work many of the 
real costs became hidden; there was a perception that services provided internally by the police would always be cheaper than those procured externally.
The issue as to whether this transition ran to budget is interesting.  Does the Government actually know how much the closure of FSS has 
cost?  The 
Rt
 Hon William Hague, Sec State for Foreign Affairs wrote to the European Commission in December 2011 stating that the closure of FSS required support of about £100 million.  I believe the costs are significantly higher and include:
&#xa0;
Support for operational losses 
              
£30 million
Staff exit costs
              
              
              
£55 million
Liabilities
              
              
              
              
£32 million
Support for transition process
              
£60 million
Loans written off 
              
              
              
£18 million
National Archive (10 years)
              
              
£20 million
Provision of lab in West 
Yorks
              
£21 million
Met Police forensic science 
              
£
              
60 million
 
&#xa0;
In addition the government admitted a pension shortfall provision of £20 million but, if it chose to wind up the FSS pension scheme it has a current liability of about £111 million.
&#xa0;
The actual costs of FSS closure must lie somewhere between £300 and £350 million if all of the costs of the police insourcing of forensic science activities formerly delivered by FSPs are taken into account.  The question is whether the closure of FSS warranted such expenditure.  A simple Net Present Value calculation shows that 
this level expenditure would have maintained FSS
 in perpetuity 
even if the government pumped in £1m per month.
&#xa0;
&#xa0;
In 2011 the overall spend by the police in all aspects of forensic science was approximately £450 million per year
.  Of this, the Police Sector was worth approximately £275 million and the remaining £175 million was available to the ‘external’ FSPs (termed the ‘Accessible Market’).
&#xa0;At that time ACPO anticipated that the ‘Accessible Market’ was set to shrink rapidly with the overall value estimated to fall to £110 million.  This market change was predicted for a number of reasons:
&#xa0;
&#xa0;
The timescales for this change were unclear; ACPO estimated 2014 but others predict this would happen much earlier; perhaps by 2011/12.  This was a significant issue for those forensic suppliers which the Government expected to pick up the 60 – 65% market share which became available as FSS Ltd. closed.  Was it ever good business sense for a profit-based, commercial FSP to take on the liabilities for staff and capital equipment in a market that was set to fall in value by 35% in the 2 – 3 years?  I suggest it was not and the reality is worse than that predicted.
&#xa0;
I estimate the current accessible forensic market is worth about £70 million
 and that few, if any, of the forensic science suppliers has a sustainable business
.  
&#xa0;
LGC state in their annual report 
and accounts of 2011 that:
&#xa0;
“All of the Group’s divisions saw growth in turnover except for Forensics which saw reduced submissions and casework, principally as a result of pressure on public spending”.
&#xa0;
Indeed, as a result of the downturn in their forensic business LGC have announced this week that there would be significant and immediate staff redundancies (200+ scientists and support staff) across the Forensic Division.  This is as a direct consequence of LGC losing Metropolitan Police work in DNA services and other work in the Northwest.
&#xa0;
As the current tenders in the Southwest and Southeast regions are intent on splitting work amongst forensic suppliers LGC faces the prospect of losing more work.  In March 2013 the Northeast police forces are tendering for forensic provision for the first time.  The work is currently provided by LGC but if the tender is awarded to another supplier the 50 (ex-FSS) staff at the Wakefield laboratory could also lose their jobs.
The condition of the forensic market in England and Wales is 
uncertain and extremely fragile.  LGC is owned by 
Bridgepoint
, a European venture capital group, and the other major forensic supplier Orchid Forensics is owned by 
LabCorps
, a USA-based, Life Sciences Company.  What would happen to the provision of forensic science in England and wales if either of these companies decided to withdraw from the forensic science market? 
&#xa0;
It has been difficult to find out what has happened to the former staff of FSS ltd but it is clear there has been a very significant loss of expertise from the profession.  
&#xa0;
About 120 staff in the Lambeth laboratory transferred to the Metropolitan Police and a further 25 staff were transferred to LGC in Wakefield from the Wetherby laboratory.  LGC recruited a further 25 staff for Wakefield and perhaps as many as 100 more across other sites.  It is difficult to know how many staff were taken on by other suppliers as FSS closed.  I estimate that less than 400 staff were taken on by the police or forensic science suppliers.  
&#xa0;
The recent announcement within LGC of further staff cuts is disastrous news for those staff and a further blow to the profession.
&#xa0;
A handful of scientists became academics in a variety of universities and a further 25 or so have set themselves up as independent consultants.  I estimate that the majority of the ex-FSS staff have left the forensic science profession, have retired or are not currently working.  Only two or three of the former FSS R&amp;D staff remain with mainstream forensic science suppliers.  This is a huge loss of intellectual wealth to the UK.  Indeed, I have been offered employment in the USA which I have accepted.
&#xa0;
International colleagues to whom I have spoken find it difficult to comprehend that the UK Government allowed the closure of one of the world’s most highly regarded forensic science agencies.  
&#xa0;
I would be happy to provide further information or comment to the Science and Technology Committee if required
