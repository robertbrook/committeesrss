The Department for International Development (D\nF\nID)'s policy to allocate funds to infrastructure, relief, and state-building in the OPTs is consistent with the current state in the OPTs. \nThe £86 million that the D\nF\nID allocates to state-building in the Palestinian territories is consistent with the great need to strengthen key infrastructure in the territories. According to the World Bank, the Palestinian territories experience one of the weakest economies in the Mi\nddle East North Africa region. GDP growth in the territories has decreased dramatically in the last few years, falling from 9 percent in 2008-2011 to 5.9 percent in 2012 and to 1.9 percent in the first half of 2013 (with negative growth of -0.1 percent in \nthe West Bank).\n According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate at the end of 2013 was at 23.7 percent. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMoreover, the quality of infrastructure including water and transportation are deteriorating, therefore limiting eco\nnomic growth.\n In a continued state of conflict with several Israeli restrictions on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the territories face impe\nding economic and state growth. Partially, r\nemoving Israeli restrictions would increase Palestinian GDP and \nfacilitate implementation of sustainable economic systems as well as advance establishment\n of civil, political, economic \nand social rights. \nHence, we maintain that infrastructure building in the OPTs, alongside advocacy in Israel and confidence-building cross border work are integral to building a stable and prosperous ME with a viable Palestinian state living peacefully next to a secure Israeli state.\n \nThe State of Our Youth - Young Israelis and Palestinians as Change Agents 3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe trend in Israel and the OP\nTs is such that \"young Israeli and Palestinian people today have no positive association with peace\" (Dalia Schniedlin, \nHa’aretz\n, April 2011\n).\n \nIn Israel and the OPTs, the younger generation is less inclined to support negotiations towards a real peaceful r\nesolution\n, since they \nhave come of age during four wars (the Second Intifada, the Second Lebanon War, Operation 'Cast Lead' and the recent Operation 'Pillar of \nDefence\n', both in the Gaza Strip). Direct interaction outside of the military context between th\ne two populations is almost non-existent. Furthermore, both Israelis and Palestinians mostly receive their information and form their opinions based on the polarized mainstream media coverage of the conflict and regional developments.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn the Israeli side,\n in contrast to roughly 70 percent of Israeli adults supporting negotiations, just over half of the Israeli youth surveyed (including Israeli Arabs) support negotiations (Peace Index surveys in Israel). This gap in support for renewing negotiations between\n the Palestinian Authority and Israel can be attributed to the formative role that media plays in shaping public opinion regarding key issues and groups. Israel's youth (between the ages of 13 and 18) represent the highest media consumption rates in Israel\ni society at over 90% in contrast to 60% of the general Israeli population. This striking figure signifies the dominant role the internet serves in the sharing and receiving of information among Israel's youth. Through the media's oversimplification of the\n \"other\" and of the conflict, the youth understand the current situation to be acceptable and irreversible. Consequently, we also witness a drastic increase in young Israeli Jews defining themselves as right-wing (from 48% in 1998 to 63% in 2010) with 46% \nof Israeli Jews preferring to maintain the status quo of the conflict rather than to advance the\n peace process (Friedrich Ebert, \nYouth in Israel, 2010). \n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimilarly, Palestinian youth exhibit parallel lack of trust and hope for a real resolution of the con\nflict and the establishment of a viable Palestinian state. While Palestinian youth comprise 27% of the total Palestinian population, a third of them are unemployed and lack democratic outlets to mobilize change in the conflict among their leaders (Study by\n Sharek Youth Forum, \n“\nThe Status of Youth in Palestine,\n”\n 2013). Nearly three quarters of youth from the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank are unaffiliated to any party and assert that no faction has proven trustworthy. Almost two-thirds of Pale\nstinian youth believe Israel's policies in the OPTs coupled with internal Palestinian politics will impede efforts to establish a Palestinian state (Reuters, April 2013). \n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecent regional developments, such as the Arab S\npring and riots in Syria, Egypt and\n Turkey, have demonstrated the power of young people mobilizing change in society. \nDue to the importance of youth in social and political transformation, Israeli and Palestinian youth are the prime target for peacebuilding work. \nAs young people tend to be \nreceptive and open-minded to competing ideas both through \nmeeting\n their peers \nand\n cultural/media exposure, we believe that the \nmost effective approach to conflict resolution is to facilitate positive interactions between Israeli and Palestinian youth. A re\ncent study \n(\nUniversity of Haifa\n, 2013)\n established a direct link between culture and tolerance, showing that young Israelis' opinions of Palestinians changed after watching plays on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Following the viewing, the percentage of\n students blaming the Palestinians for the stalemate dropped \nfrom 55% \nto 38\n%\n, the percentage of those holding negative feelings \ntowards Palestinians \ndecreased \nfrom 65% \nto 47\n%\n, and those supporting roadblocks fell \nfrom 78% \nto 60%.\n&#xa0;\nPart III: Introduction to Kids Creating Peace Approach and Impact&#xa0;7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe following evidence is to present the case for more support to dialogue and cross-border cooperation groups, as their work is essential to laying the building blocks for propelling forward a negotiated two-state\n solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n that will be supported by the majority of the public on both sides\n.\n&#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKCP \ndesigns cutting-edge programs geared at bringing together Palestinian and Israeli youth. \nAt the core of our approach, we tackle the conflict from a non-politicized angle, avoiding the collective nationalist and historical narratives. Rather we focus on the individual young person's journey to becoming more confident, acquiring non-violent comm\nunications skills, getting to know the \"other\" and recognizing both sides' legitimacy. \nOnce children and youth gain practical tools to deal with life’s challenges, and the moment they feel more confident they are able to come to terms with the \"other\" and \navoid prejudice. \nTo strengthen the individual youth, \nKCP\n \nworks holistically\n with schools, community organizations, and civic institutions at the \nlocal, \nregional and national levels. We offer education programs for personal and societal conflict management \nand resolution among youth in Israel and the OPTs. Our curricula are based on life skills\n, sensory and experiential methods tailored to engage\n, \nempower\n and motivate youth. \nOur programs incorporate leadership and dialogue training, inspiring the youth to ch\noose the path \nof\n \naffect\ning\n change within their communities\n. \nKCP places youth at the centre, viewing them as future leaders and important agents of change, with a clear “ripple effect.\n”\n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKCP's\n \nyouth \nparticipants embark on a personal and collective journey, \nexploring one another’s daily realities through weekly meetings, joint projects, and a bi-national 4-day summer camp in order to facilitate unprecedented cross-border dialogue. This program marked not only a shift among individual perceptions, but also pro\nmpted community involvement and enabled sustainable institutional impact. We offer a leadership, public speaking, and performing arts program for YCP graduates to further hone their leadership skills as well as to promote continued dedication to advocating\n for peace. Youth Creating Eco-Peace is a program that employs the concept of a “shared ground” into a “common ground” by uniting Israeli and Palestinian youth on environmental initiatives, working together to impact the land. We also offer the 'Game of Li\nfe,' a fun and interactive video curriculum that aims to achieve spiritual \nfulfilment\n (security, happiness, love, and confidence) by engaging hundreds of \nyouth\n throughout Israel and the OPTs in \na \npersonal empowering\n learning process\n. \nKCP's Strategic Model with Clear Multiplier Impact10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKCP programs both engage youth with the \"other\" and equip youth with the necessary conflict-resolution skills and decision-making processes to do so successfully. Furthermore, the programs foster a sense of \"oneness\" amongst t\nhe mixed Israeli and Palestinian groups by challenging them with a common end-project that places them as \"one\" group with a common cause \"against\" an outside force. Moreover, we believe that education is enhanced by strong role models, as evidenced by our\n committed and responsible teachers and instructors. The teachers \nand instructors come from within the community itself, are\n experienced and skilled in delivering \ndialogue and youth-\ncantered\n programs, and serve as role models for tolerance and cross-border\n dialogue. \n&#xa0;\n11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNot only do\nes\n KCP\n's multifaceted approach \nshift perceptions directly \namong \nprogram participation, but it establishes a long-lasting shift in \nbehaviours\n \nand yields outputs and actions that have institutional and public impact\n. KCP often leverages past program's youth graduates to serve as leaders and active in recruitment and management of the new groups of \nyoung Israeli and Palestinian participants\n, ensuring \neffective peer-to-peer interaction and providing \npowerful role models. These newly-cultivated youth leaders equipped with the necessary tools, then initiate and carry out creative peace educational campaigns and activities in their schools reaching thousands of additional youth. Through these leaders' work, we ensure the s\nustainable and longer-term impact of their work and their commitment beyond the program's period. Furthermore, our programs' outputs and tools ensure a broader sustainable impact, by utilizing online forums, new media campaigns, key messaging, visual brand\ning, and other creative means that frame peace in a fresh, young, and positive way that youth can relate to. KCP programs offer hands-on leadership of the youth empowering them as they demonstrate their power to act and affect others through concrete peace\n work in classes. Finally, throughout the program, parents, teachers, and stakeholders get involved; these influential community players such as teaching staff, elected officials from city councils, and representatives from the Ministry of Education gain e\nxposure to a positive model of bringing together Israeli and Palestinian youth uniting under a common goal to achieve a lasting peace in the region. \n&#xa0;\n12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt a cost of 1,200\n \nGBP per one \nparticipant – an \nIsraeli or Palestinian youth, for a year-long \nprogram com\nprised of two \nseparate preparatory work\n, seven \nbi-national meeting\ns\n, a joint 4-day camp, a joint hands-on arts\n or environmental project in bi-national teams, leadership development and further outreach in the youth's schools, vis-a-vis new media outlets an\nd \nwith the \nyouth's \nparents and educators, local and national stakeholders.  \nEvidence of Impact of KCP's Approach 13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2012-2013, KCP led the program Youth Creating Peace. This program brought 50 Israeli and Palestinian youth together through workshops, a f\nour-day summer camp, and joint \nart project, demonstrating impact on several levels: \n \n&#xa0;\n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2010, one of KCP's successful programs - \nSach Ten \nthat engaged \n24 Israeli (Jewish and Arab) and Palestinian youth, \nresulted in an actual jo\nint youth-drafted peace agreement that \nthe youth themselves presented to t\nhe French Parliament. \nPart IV: Recommendation15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKCP\n respectfully makes the recommendation to the British Government to supplement D\nF\nID's work in the OPTs and t\nhe Conflict Pool's advocacy work in Israel with direct cross-border programs engaging young Israelis and Palestinians in joint work on common interests and issues.\n&#xa0;\n16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecognizing that apathy and lack of hope,\n together with a void in policy, on both sides\n lay\n at the foundation of the current stagnation, KCP strives to serve as a model for cross-border \nprojects \nthat\n aim \nat\n reinvigorating the younger generation with forward-looking optimism and creative peace\n-\nbuilding goals.\n&#xa0;\n17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe maintain that an imperative stepping stone towards achieving a just and sustainable two-state solution is fostering inter-personal, direct \nrelations\n and cross-border \ncooperation in order to bring about change from the bottom-up and on a broader scale.  \nAs more people get involved and become pass\nionate about mobilizing change, \nthe \nleadership \nwill be motivated \nto \nprogress\n towards achieving peace. \nOnly if we reach wider and more diverse sectors in Israel and the OPTs in direct dialogue will we prepare the p\nublic opinion to accept the necessary concessions entailed in an agreement, \nreinvigorating the possibility \nof a sustainable peaceful ME\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n \n[object Object]\n \n[object Object]\n"
