[[[ Films [FBB0027]]]]&#xa0;The BBC is there to supply public service broadcasting, and in my opinion does this admirably.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;It is respected throughout the world.&#xa0;&#xa0; It is a difficult task to cover ‘Drama, Comedy, Arts, Sport, Current Affairs, Science, Natural History, News, and the public are fortunate that they have access to such a wide spectrum at such a small cost.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Television plays a great part in people’s lives, across all ages, particularly the older generation, the size of which is increasing.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Some programmes, such as Natural History, take a great deal of time and money, and brilliant talent, to make and deliver to the public, and most commercial companies wouldn’t bother as they would not consider it financially viable.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The BBC therefore offers programmes that others do not make.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Apart from the entertainment value, many programmes are great learning tools for the population, particularly the young.&#xa0;&#xa0; My own young grandsons are testimony to that.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The News is valued, and more importantly trusted.&#xa0;&#xa0; If ever there is a disaster, or big event in the world, viewers seem to naturally turn to the BBC News for their information.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;I believe that the Independent sector has added considerable value to the BBC, both as to the diversity and talent of their programmes, but also in recognising cost control, and their ability to obtain co-production value with other countries, and increase the export value of their programmes to the advantage of the BBC and the UK generally.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At the moment the Independent sector are guaranteed 25% of output (with certain exclusions), BBC in-house 50%, with 25% to be shared according to acceptance of ideas.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I believe it would be to the advantage of the BBC if the programme output was shared 50/50 between in-house and Independents, which would contribute not only creatively, but more importantly to the financial benefit of the BBC.&#xa0;I have recently been in America and watched a lot of their Network television with interest – and dismay.&#xa0; I dread the day when the standard of our British television would sink so low to please the common denominator.&#xa0;&#xa0;The BBC is unique in supplying programmes that cover so many viewers’ interests, some of them even niche viewing.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;Please let the BBC have the opportunity to continue with proper support, respect,&#xa0;and understanding of their achievements.&#xa0;BERYL VERTUE OBEProducer and Chairman, Hartswood Films&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
