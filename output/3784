[normal]Written evidence from Living Streets (CYS0037)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]Living Streets believes that safety for all road users and particularly the most vulnerable is of paramount importance. For a significant period of time the numbers of people killed and seriously injured on our roads was decreasing however
[normal] during 2011 there was an increase in both pedestrian and cyclist killed and serious
[normal]ly injured
[normal] casualties (KSIs). Whilst it is not fully understood why the increase in KSIs happened in 2011 it is important to take note that there has been a substantial increase in the number of cyclists which accounts to some degree for the increase in the number a
[normal]nd risk of further casualties. 
[normal]The increase in cycling fatalities 
[normal]continued
[normal] in 2012 by 10% whilst the numbers of pedestrians killed decreased by 7% compared to 2011 although the number seriously injured pedestrians increased by 2%
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Worryingly, this growth
[normal] in
[normal] the
[normal] popularity of cycling has not been backed by measures to create a safer cycling environment
[normal].
[normal] As a result some new cyclists are now too scared to cycle on our roads perhaps due to lack of infrastructure, anti-social motorised vehicle driver behaviou
[normal]r, traffic speeds or lack of confidence. Instead, they choose to cycle on the pavements causing great distress in particular to older or infirm pedestrians. In some cases, evidenced anecdotally by some of our supporters in London, pavement cycling can resu
[normal]lt in contributing to the isolation of some people as they may fear being hit by a cyclist whilst walking down their street which causes them to decide not to leave their home. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Living Stree
[normal]ts is extremely concerned by the 
[normal]recent spate of cycling and pedestrian fatalities in London which included three pedestrian fatalities in one day on Friday 16 November. 
[normal]Living Streets is supportive of efforts to encourage people to make active travel choi
[normal]ces such as walking and cycling and safety for vulnerable road users is paramount to encouraging people to make these choices. We share many of the same objectives as organisations that promote cycling including improving road safety, the environment, air 
[normal]quality and promoting a healthy lifestyle. Many of the barriers to cycling and potential solutions are often the same for walking such as slower speeds and better street design However, it is important to note that they remain different travel modes with 
[normal]d
[normal]istinctive needs and characteristics. We believe that both walking and cycling have a role to play in increasing active travel journeys and that walking should be the natural choice for shorter journeys and cycling for journeys of two miles or more.
