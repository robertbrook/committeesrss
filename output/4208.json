"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence from Network Rail (SLC 047)&#xa0;Network Rail welcomes the report of the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission, which was published after the deadline for written evidence to the Transport Select Committee inquiry into level crossings. Given the law \nin \nthis area\n is crucial to our operation and changes are rarely proposed\n we would like to comment on the proposed changes. \n&#xa0;\nImprovements&#xa0;\nNetwork Rail strongly welcomes the \nreview\n of the law around level crossings, in particular where greater clarity allows a clearer delineation of responsibilities and assists in closing crossings. \nHaving level crossings governed entirely under the Health and Safety at Work Act (1974) is logical and clarifies the law considerably.\n&#xa0;\nIn particular we welcome the reportâ€™s call for greater co-operation between rail and road authorities, something for which we have called for some time. \nClarity around the process of closing a crossing \nis \nhelpful\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe call for a review of offences is \nalso \nwelcome. Given the severe potential consequences of dangerous or reckless driving at level crossings, Network Rail has for a long time called for more severe penalties (paragraph 7.141). \n&#xa0;\nConcerns&#xa0;\nWe have some specific concerns about the report, largely concerning the relationship between safety and convenience. \nThe proposed requirement that ministers consider convenience of users when exercising their powers could be seen as establishing a trade-off between safety and convenience (paragraph 7.10). \n&#xa0;\nMore worrying\n \nis the recommendation (paragraph 7.20) that ministers can impose requirements necessary to ensure convenience of crossing users\n as well as their safety\n. While we would not expect this power to be used extensively \nit is a source of concern. \n&#xa0;\nThe closure process seems to have an extensive list of people whose objections could trigger an appeal. Given our experience of objections to\n our proposals to close\n crossings on safety grounds it seems likely that any proposed closure would be \nhighly \nlikely to trigger a hearing\n under this process\n (paragraph 7.57)\n.\n \nWe \ntherefore \ndoubt that this approach would speed up the process of closing a crossing, even \nwhere there were clear\n safety grounds\n for doing so\n.\n This is of serious concern to us given our commitment to pursue the closure of high risk crossings.\n&#xa0;\nThe proposal to give Scottish ministers the power to order the creation of a new crossing is of particular concern and goes entirely against our work to close crossings as the best way to improve safety\n (paragraphs 7.135-7.137). \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
