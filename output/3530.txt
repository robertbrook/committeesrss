[[[Inspectorate of ]]]

[[[Constabulary [CST0015]]]]&#xa0;Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the Public Administration Select Committee inquiry into crime statistics.&#xa0;HMIC is an independent body which inspects and reports on the efficiency and effectiveness of policing in England and Wales on behalf of the public. We conduct inspections on a range of issues – both on our own, and jointly with other inspectorates in the criminal justice system. &#xa0;Our written submission of evidence responds to the committee’s questions by providing background on the work already undertaken by HMIC in respect of police crime recording standards; and on our current and future work in this regard.&#xa0;

[[[Summary]]]&#xa0;An inspection of the integrity of police recorded crime is an important part of HMIC’s current inspection programme. The inspection will answer the question ’to what extent can police recorded crime information be trusted’ and we will publish a full report in autumn 2014. &#xa0;1.1 HMIC considers it of the utmost importance that police forces have high-quality data that allows them to establish where, when, and how often crime and anti-social behaviour (ASB) is happening. This ensures:&#xa0;HMIC has therefore undertaken a programme of work over a number of years to test aspects of whether crimes are being recorded by the police when they should be, and categorised correctly. Some of this work assessed accuracy in recording particular crimes, and some was concerned with particular aspects of the crime and incident reporting process. The number of forces inspected ranged from all 43 Home Office forces, to just one.

[[[(2012)]]]1.2 HMIC’s first report on crime data integrity, Crime Counts – A review of data quality for offences of the most serious violence, was published in October 2009. This was followed by The Crime Scene – A review of police crime and incident reports, which was published in January 2012. While the first of these focused solely on the data recorded in relation to serious violence, and the latter was much wider in scope, both examined how effective forces were in ensuring incident records which contained details of a recordable crime resulted in the correct creation of crime records.&#xa0;1.3 The Crime Scene considered the quality of crime and incident data, and the arrangements in place to ensure it was recorded and managed appropriately (i.e. in a way that complies with national guidelines). The inspection focused on the standards of incident report closure, and whether crimes were correctly recorded or not.  &#xa0;1.4 Based on examination of a small sample of crime and incident records in each of the 43 Home Office-funded forces, HMIC found that the majority of forces were correctly recording crimes based on the information available within an incident record. However, this conclusion masked a wide variation in the accuracy of force decisions in this regard: 18 forces correctly recorded crimes in 95% or more of cases; 15 forces did so in between 90 and 94% of cases; and 11 forces in between 86 and 89% of cases. This could mean forces that made poorer decisions were under-recording some crimes, which could have a corresponding impact on the accuracy of published crime statistics (although it should be noted that the size of the sample used in this inspection was too small to make any definite statements on this – it was used instead as an indicator of where there might be issues).  &#xa0;1.5 The supervision and justification for making a decision to declassify a recorded crime after it has been recorded as such (referred to as ‘no-criming’) was found to be subject to a marked overall improvement since this area was last examined. Perhaps as a result, the national average of correct decisions for violent offences was 84% – an improvement from 2009, when the average was 64% for the most serious violent offences.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Crime Recording in Kent (2013)]]]1.6 In February 2013, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Kent commissioned HMIC to conduct an inspection to determine whether the people of Kent can have confidence in the force’s crime figures. This inspection resulted in the publication of the HMIC report Crime recording in Kent – A report commissioned by the Police and Crime Commissioner for Kent  in June 2013.&#xa0;1.7 This inspection found that appreciably more needed to be done before the people of Kent could be confident that the crime and resolution figures published by the force were as accurate as they should be. HMIC found that the force had under-recorded approximately one in every ten crimes, and that it did not interpret the Home Office Counting Rules (HOCR) correctly, meaning crimes were not correctly recorded. It is important to note that the findings for Kent cannot be extrapolated to make judgments regarding the accuracy of crime recording in other forces, as the methodology was specific to the force area. &#xa0;1.8 While Kent Police had made improvements to the way it dealt with the declassification of recorded crimes (no-criming), and had reduced the total number of occasions where this occurred, we found that the decision to do so was still incorrect in more than 25% of the cases reviewed. It was of particular concern – and unacceptable – that this inaccuracy was evident in cases of rape, robbery and violence.&#xa0;1.9 HMIC is due to publish a report in January 2014 on the progress that has been made by Kent Police since publication of the 2013 report.&#xa0;

[[[HMIC’s 2013/14 crime data integ]]]

[[[rity programme]]]1.10 Crime Counts and The Crime Scene both examined only crime and incident records created as the result of a call made by a member of the public into force call centres. However, crimes are also reported to police forces through a number of other routes (such as through calls to control rooms, referrals to specialist investigation departments from other public bodies, or directly to officers). Therefore our crime data integrity programme for 2013/14 will review the integrity of the data recorded via each of these other routes, to give a more complete overview of crime recording. The outcome of this work (which is explained in more detail in paras 4.3-4.6 below) is expected to be published during autumn 2014.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1 None of HMIC’s reviews of crime data integrity has specifically examined the influences which may lead to the mis-recording of crime by the police. The reviews have, however, considered those influences which may positively contribute to the integrity of crime recording. 

[[[The Crime Scene ]]]

[[[(2012)]]]2.2 The 2012 HMIC report, The Crime Scene – A review of police crime and incident reports, found that forces which demonstrated good standards of data quality all had a clearly identified chief officer lead who acted as the force champion for such issues, and who actively promoted good crime and incident recording standards. HMIC found that the message such chief officers sent to their forces about the importance of maintaining high standards in this regard needed to be consistent, unequivocal, and practised. It also needed to be clearly understood by staff. 2.3 Other aspects which HMIC reported as being the most influential in maintaining standards in recording crime were: good governance and supervision; and knowledgeable staff – in particular, an objective force crime registrar with strong influence over local crime recording decisions, to ensure these were not unduly influenced by the pressure to achieve certain outcomes. We concluded that: “The final responsibility for HOCR compliance should not, therefore, be vested in the same individuals as are accountable for crime reduction and detection” (para 5.6).

[[[ing the Links – Rape investigation and prosecution (2012)]]]2.4 In this report (which was conducted jointly with HM Inspectorate of the Crown Prosecution Service), HMIC found that there were wide variations across forces in the number of rapes that remained on the system (and so were investigated) compared to those that were ‘no crimed’ (i.e. removed from the crime recording system because the police decide that a crime has not been committed). We stated that “in the past performance pressures may have influenced forces’ approaches to either the initial recording or subsequent levels of ‘no crimes’ for rape offending” (para 1.29), and advocated instead a regime that places equal emphasis on an analysis of rape crimes and associated intelligence as on low offending levels, which would act as an encouragement to retain crime records on the system. 

[[[HMIC’s 2013/14 crime data integrity programme]]]2.5 Our programme for 2013/14 will consider more widely the influences that may result in the mis-recording of crime.&#xa0;3.1 HMIC considers the role of the force crime registrar (FCR) to be central to ensuring force systems for recording crime are effective and accurate. This role is a requirement detailed in the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS), which states (in section 4.2):To ensure the NCRS is maintained within the force, and to provide greater consistency within and across forces, each force should appoint an FCR to act as final arbiter for the audit process; the interpretation of the counting rules; and for ensuring the outcome from investigations into those crimes is correctly recorded. The FCR must be outside operational line command and answerable to the chief officer with overall responsibility for the accuracy and integrity of crime recording processes. To ensure that the responsibilities of the post are effectively met, a deputy or other identified person should be appointed. &#xa0;The key tasks of an FCR are: &#xa0;&#xa0;There is full recognition that the FCR role and responsibilities continue to evolve over time.&#xa0;

[[[The Crime Scene ]]]

[[[(2012)]]]3.2 Our 2012 review found forces that finalised incidents well had a strong FCR, who acted as the final arbiter for disputes in respect of the interpretation of the counting rules and enjoyed clear, unequivocal chief officer support. Indeed, evidence from the review indicated that 34 of the 44 forces reviewed claimed to have sufficiently strong, independent FCRs, with clear chief officer support. However, HMIC found limited evidence of forces directly assessing whether their own crime quality audits provided confidence that their crime figures gave an accurate account of their performance, and few forces compare crime audits with crime performance in any meaningful way.&#xa0;3.3 In 2012, HMIC also reported that evidence strongly supports the notion that leadership, supervision and oversight help attain good crime and incident data quality. Strong and effective leadership is therefore a critical component in raising standards. Equally, where there is the slightest doubt as to the chief officer’s expectation in relation to crime and incident data quality, standards will inevitably slip.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1 HMIC recognises that there is still more to be done to secure the integrity of police-recorded crime data. The work of the Crime Statistics Advisory Committee (CSAC), as an independent advisor on matters related to the measurement of crime, and the collection and presentation of crime data, is welcomed. The rest of this answer focuses on what HMIC has done (and is doing) to ensure the integrity of this data. 4.2 Crime data and crime recording are complex areas of policing, and there continues to be a need for greater clarity and understanding. Therefore, HMIC has inspected police crime data integrity for a number of years. This has included inspections dedicated specifically to crime data, as well as integrating consideration of crime data accuracy within other formal inspection activity, such as HMIC inspections of the approach taken by police forces to dealing with anti-social behaviour. 

[[[HMIC’s 2013/14]]]

[[[ crime data integrity programme]]]4.3 HMIC has committed to inspecting crime data integrity again during 2013/14. Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary confirmed this commitment to the Home Affairs Select Committee in May 2013, and agreed to report on the issue in autumn 2014. 4.4 This inspection will include our assessment of the accuracy of crime recording through the various routes that crimes can be reported to the police (such as through calls to control rooms, referrals to specialist investigation departments from other public bodies or directly to officers). Our initial findings will be provided in an interim report (as requested by the Home Secretary), which will be published in spring 2014.4.5 The principal test for the inspection is to determine: To what extent can police recorded crime information be trusted? 4.6 The specific objectives of the inspection involve establishing:

[[[Monitoring of force performance]]]4.7 In addition to the formal crime data integrity programme, Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Constabulary (HMIs) routinely monitor the performance of police forces, including as regards the integrity of data. This helps to ensure that:•    emerging problems with the efficiency or effectiveness of individual forces are spotted quickly, and Chief Constables and local policing bodies are aware of those problems and are taking corrective action; and•    if problems with the efficiency or effectiveness of a force are enduring and there is a low prospect of their being resolved, those problems are raised formally with the local policing body, so that they can respond.4.8 Routine monitoring identifies potential issues for closer scrutiny. Some of these will be outside the control of the force and local policing body, or will already have been tackled; but some may be indicators of systemic or management failings in the force. The decision as to whether to follow up with the force and local policing body over any concerns rests with the HMI who leads on HMIC’s relationship with that force area. &#xa0;5.1 All HMIC’s work on crime data integrity is undertaken so that the level of confidence policy-makers, the police and the public should have in police crime data can be understood. 5.2 Our work in Kent, described earlier, sets out the extent to which confidence can be placed in the force’s crime data. The approach used to determine this will also be used in our 2013/14 inspection, which is due to be published in autumn 2014.&#xa0;&#xa0;6.1 This is not an issue on which HMIC has published or indeed holds a view. Our focus is instead on the effectiveness and efficiency of the systems and processes forces use to record crimes and ASB.&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0; Police and crime commissioners for police areas outside London; the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime for the Metropolitan Police Service; and the City of London Corporation for the City of London Police.

The Crime Scene – A review of police crime and incident reports, HMIC, London, January 2012. Available from www.hmic.gov.uk. We have chosen in the rest of this section to focus on the findings of the 2012 report, as the most recent (and therefore most likely to be relevant to your inquiry).  The Crime Scene – A review of police crime and incident reports, HMIC, London, January 2012, para 2.4. When a crime has been recorded, it can only be declassified (which is referred to as ‘no-crimed’) if the strict criteria set out in the HOCR apply. No-crimes account for approximately 3-4% of overall recorded crime. No-criming is an important part of the HOCR as it caters for situations where the original decision to record a crime clearly turns out to be wrong (for example, where someone reports to the police that their car has been stolen from a multi-storey car park, only to find it later on a different floor). While it is appropriate for some cases to be no-crimed, when this is done incorrectly it can mean that suspects may not be brought to justice and the force’s published crime figures will be inaccurate.
