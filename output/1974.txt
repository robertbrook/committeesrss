[[[Brief introduction]]]&#xa0;3.1              The Association of Play Industries (API)&#xa0;is the lead trade body within the play sector, representing the interests of the manufacturers, installers, designers and distributors of both outdoor and indoor play equipment and safety surfacing.  The API was founded in 1984 and currently has 75 members. The API Chair is Michael Hoenigmann, Managing Director of Proludic Ltd.&#xa0;www.api-play.org3.2              The API operates under the umbrella of the Federation of Sports and Play Associations (FSPA), the national trade body responsible for representing 18 Associations in the UK’s sport and play industries.  www.sportsandplay.com&#xa0;&#xa0;3.3              API members build 4000 playgrounds and play spaces annually and bid for hundreds of local authority contracts every year.  According to its membership, poor practice in local authority playground procurement is rife.  As a result, the API believes that current public sector procurement practice is failing to deliver value for money to the public purse.  This is the reason the API is submitting evidence.     &#xa0;

[[[Factual information]]]4.1              API members report that they are spending increasingly more time on long, drawn-out tenders that are not fit for purpose.  Play spaces and playgrounds are not commodities like paper clips – they are designed by experts and should be bespoke according to locality, the communities they serve, and the outcomes delivered to children.  Yet time after time, the procurement process is reduced to over-simplistic box-ticking.  Tighter, more streamlined practices would reduce costs for local authorities and contractors alike.&#xa0;4.2              API members regularly report tenders inviting submissions from over ten contractors.  While competition is healthy, the value for money represented is not clear.  One recent County Council tender for basic outdoor play equipment invited eight contractors to apply, each required to complete seven separate submission documents. 4.3              This is just one example of a local authority going through a procurement process for the sake of going through the process.  The notion that inviting large numbers of contractors to bid for work delivers value for money is false.  The resources used by play contractors on these wasteful processes would be better spent developing the next generation of innovative play equipment, particularly at a time when barriers to active play are rising.  No tender should invite more than three bidders to take part, then those taking part can focus on delivering the very best submission possible with genuine value for money built in.4.4              The API argues that this flawed procurement culture actually devalues play by encouraging less reputable companies to take part.  While products on a drawing can look alike, cut-price operators cut corners on quality, standards, materials and safety to deliver cheaper deals.  The rationale for the original tender – the provision of high quality play spaces that meet local need - is then obscured.  4.5              The API believes that playground procurement tenders should:4.6              One grey area of playground procurement is the role of children.  The API wholeheartedly supports their involvement from the earliest stages but believes that the delegation of the role of ultimate decision-maker to children is an abdication of responsibility and accountability by local authorities.  Asking children what they want in a playground will usually result in them choosing a swing, slide and roundabout because those are the pieces of play equipment that tend to come to mind instantly and that they are likely to be using currently.  By asking children what kind of experiences they would like to have in a playground, they will give a quite different and more imaginative response. 4.7              The API is currently sourcing examples of local authority playground procurement best practice, sourced from amongst its membership.  The Association will be happy to share these findings with the Committee.&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
