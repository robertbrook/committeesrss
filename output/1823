defaultMark Brown – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;defaultJOINT COMMITTEE ON THE DRAFT DEREGULATION BILLdefault&#xa0;defaultRe the specific question:
default&#xa0;
default"7. 
defaultHow
default does the provision in the draft Bill affect:
default&#xa0;
defaultiii. 
defaultthe
default environment, particularly in the management of waste?"
default&#xa0;
defaultThe draft Bill states in relation to Household waste: de-criminalisation:
default&#xa0;
default"127. Under section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (the “EPA”) a waste collection authority may by notice require occupiers of premises to present their household waste for collection in a specified way. Failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with such a requirement is an offence under section 46(6) of the EPA. Under section 47ZA of that Act, a fixed penalty may be offered as an alternative to prosecution. This clause amends the EPA."
default&#xa0;
defaultalso
default:
default&#xa0;
default"128. Subsection (2) amends section 46(6) of the EPA to remove the offence in relation to England. It will remain in relation to Wales and Scotland."
default&#xa0;
defaultalso
default:
default&#xa0;
default"442. Joint waste authorities (“JWAs”) were intended to integrate services across more than one local authority area to achieve efficiencies for member authorities and ensure quality of service for residents. However, the powers have never been used and there are no JWAs established under this legislation. The repeal of these provisions is a deregulatory measure which removes an unused layer of statutory regulation. Local authorities remain able to make their own arrangements amongst themselves without the need for this legislation, establishing more informal partnerships based on local needs."
default&#xa0;
defaultIn attempting to remove burden by imposing fixed penalties in place of legal recourse the Bill appears to add to regulation by proposing increasing the number of clauses in the Environmental Protection Act. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is difficult to understand how apparently increasing the burden on local authorities and their private sector partners to have recourse against offenders represents a reduction in bureaucracy and burden on business, if that is the intent of the Bill.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is also notable that the change does not apply to Wales and Scotland. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIf a measure is 'beneficial' how can it be argued that it is only worth implementing in England?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe removal of the provisions relating to joint waste authorities, whilst technically deregulation, in fact does nothing to benefit business if, as suggested, these provisions have never been used. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe act of removing unused regulation is in fact a form of bureaucracy. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt might be desirable to tidy up the s
defaulttatute book but this action its self consumes resource that could be better spent on meaningful change.
