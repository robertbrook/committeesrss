defaultCONSULTATION,  TRANSPORT SECTION,  QUESTION 43:  
defaultTo base a planning strategy on a vision where the majority of the county is rural, but “where the use of public transport for the journey to work and to school is considered socially necessary but 
defaultis not commercially viable, the local authority 
defaultmay
default provide revenue support for services”[Northumberland Economic Strategy p.23] is LUDICROUS.
defaultIn the Local Transport Plan 2011-2026 Strategy Document there are 17 principle elements of the new bus strategy, 
defaultbut 
defaultnone of them mention working with or involving the LOCAL BUSINESSES WHOSE EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS ARE USERS OF THE BUS SERVICE, and who might wish for more bus use in order to free up the oversubscribed car parking spaces for a larger number of customedefaultrs, and a better network of buses to attract more touristsdefault(e.g. Dutch tourists, 7% of whom expect to use public transport, our nearest neighbours on the ferry)
default              default              default&#xa0;default4)  defaultTo what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers taken into account in defaultdetermining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?default&#xa0;default              default4.1default              defaultMany special interest groups such as the elderly, frail and vulnerable, and to some extent, young people, are probably very much on the County Council’s radar, and quite a large p
defaultroportion of available resources are put into supporting the introduction and operation of community buses, but these are often only usable for people who are in a position to book in advance in quite small time-slots. 
defaultThedefaultsedefault, defaultand the excellent car-share s

defaultare not suitable for the growing number of people who are struggling to afford a car to get to work, or look for work, and who are increasingly expected to work unusual shifts or at short notice, or both default(zero hour

default Youth Parliament for 2 years running, and youngsters are readily in touch via social media.

default4.3default              defaultApparentlydefault no recognition that rural communities have a strong tradition and basis in cultural and family links, which needs to be supported by public transport default(especially in the absence of accessible computer services and tuition).
default&#xa0;defaultIt isn’t just about taking defaultpeople into town centres to access increasingly centralised services which have been withdrawn from rural areas.defaultIt is about allowing people to be able to continue seeing and supporting relatives and friends in neighbouring communities, get to family gravedefaults to tend them, recognising that sick people don’t just need medical services, but visitors as welldefault default(e.g. no Sunday services)

default, 
defaultfor
default 
defaultday-to-day service changesdefault, recognition from 
defaulte.g.
default Arriva, who say that we can use Facebook or Twitter, that an
default unusually high proportion of their passengers don’t have access
default to or knowledge of these, and 
defaultmany of the most essential journeys are outside of office hours. Arriva’s number for enquiries 
defaultis
default only open during office hours, with no

defaultThere are no information offices on the Thropton route outside of Newcastle.
default5.2default              defaultAccurately establishing the need.  
defaultPeople have had to give up going to places, make 
defaultunreliable or inefficient 
defaultad 
defaulthoc arrangements, or get a car when finances or environmental principles make it preferable that they did not.
defaultIf a new service is put in place, especially if it is not publicised, or has not been properly researched to make sure that it best fits peoples’ needs, it takes some time for people to find out about and transfer back to trusting and relying on public tra
defaultnsport.  If 
default, as usual 
defaultit has been a tr
defaultial period of only a
default year
default, there
default is not time to build up a base of new 
defaultand
default previous customers, and the service is then 
defaultirrevocably cut
default due to “lack of demand”.  (Many passengers have 
defaultconcluded
default that this
default is probably on

default6)  defaultHow effectively defaultdo Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities?  How could Community Transport be improved?default&#xa0;defaultSee section 4.1
default&#xa0;default7) defaultTo what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxi and other defaultdemand-responsive transport services?defaultThis discriminates against some of the groups who actually rely on the buses, who have not got enough money to run a car, so couldn’t afford a taxi either.
defaultMaybe more could be done to look into taxi-share schemes

defaulting
default that 
defaultavailable
default funds are drawn to the most used,
