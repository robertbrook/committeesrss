[normal]Summary[bold]Including
[normal]especially 
[normal]for
[normal] reaching 
[normal]potential[bold] passengers as well as existing ones, 
[normal]and those travel[bold]ling[bold] [bold]long[bold] distances [bold]to [bold]access the public transport network[bold] (see 3.5)
[normal]EVIDENCE BASE FOR THE NORTHUMBERLAND LOCAL TRANSPORT  PLAN 2011-[bold]2026 [bold]- a [bold]howl of anguish[bold] from passengers.  [bold]-[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]no publicity abo[bold]ut this questionnaire on any of the buses [bold](3.7.ii)
[normal]No recognition that rural [bold]communities have a strong tradition and basis in cultural and family links,[bold] needing[bold] to be supported by public transport. [bold]and for day-to-day service changes
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2)  [bold]A[bold] personal view of public transport policy and implementation from a regularly and long-used bus seat[bold]2.1[bold]              [bold]Being
[normal] a regular bus user on both 
[normal]urban and rural routes o
[normal]ver 
[normal]40 years, starting with schooldays travelling from Windyhaugh in the upper Coquet valley to Morpeth, Northumberland, and then 
[normal]working 
[normal]in various places 
[normal]from
[normal] East London 
[normal]to
[normal] mid Wales, Worcestershire 
[normal]to
[normal] Middlesbrough,
[normal] return
[normal]ing
[normal] to 
[normal]Northumberland 
[normal]regularly using public transport, I have had plenty of opportunity for comparison.  
[normal]2.2[bold]              [bold]For the last 9 years I have been in Northumberland, using the Thropton to Newcastle route for 
[normal]at least 
[normal]5 return journeys per week between Longframlington and Morpeth
[normal], 
[normal]mostly 
[normal]for work
[normal] or 
[normal]to connect to other destinations, so I have been able to observe all of the c
[normal]hanges on this route since 1971.
[normal]2.3[bold] [bold]              [bold]I 
[normal]am
[normal] submit
[normal]ting
[normal] this evidence because I have full awareness of how 
[normal]important [bold]the bus service is for 
[normal]we
[normal] passengers 
[normal]in all a[bold]spects of [bold]life[bold], and not just to access shops and basic services.  [bold]A
[normal]nyone 
[normal]not
[normal] a 
[normal]regular 
[normal]rural 
[normal]bus user 
[normal]has
[normal] no conception of this, 
[normal]as
[normal] is reflected 
[normal]by
[normal] policies and implementation 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]rural 
[normal]bus services 
[normal].
[normal]2.4[bold]              [bold]Also I think that the best 
[normal]hope
[normal] for rural 
[normal]public 
[normal]transport is to enable a proper 
[normal]network[bold] to be 
[normal]run profitably[bold], 
[normal]in recent
[normal] years
[normal] 
[normal]hindered by [bold]deteriorating[bold] communication with existing passengers and lack of contact with[bold] [bold]potential[bold] passengers[bold], largely 
[normal]because of 
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]constraints 
[normal]of funding structures
[normal].
[normal]2.5[bold]              [bold]P[bold]rofitable and appropriate running of public transport in rural areas is [bold]hindered by[bold] looking at the funding of each route in isolation, [bold]instead of examining it[bold] as part of an effective and usable public transport [bold]network[bold].[bold]2.6[bold]              [bold]S
[normal]ources:
[normal]              
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]3)[bold]  
[normal]How do government and local authorities identify demand for passenger tra[bold]nsport in isolated communities?[bold]3.1[bold]              [bold]Though 
[normal]there were 
[normal]surveys in previous decades, in the last nine years, despite making 
[normal]minimu,
[normal] five return journeys per week between Longframlington and Morpeth,  I 
[normal]have only 
[normal]seen one
[normal] County Council survey, in spring 2011, and 
[normal]one
[normal] done by a national 
[normal]organization
[normal], though I have heard that another 
[normal]was done
[normal] this spring driver 
[normal]about a specific
[normal] p
[normal]roposed change 
[normal]to
[normal] our timetable.
[normal]3.2[bold]              [bold]O
[normal]ur parish council has asked for people to notify them of their public transport ne
[normal]eds via our parish newsletter, as has 
[normal]Rothbury, Thropton,  and upper Coquetdale, but until very recently, Longhorsley, the other main vi
[normal]llage on our bus route did not have such a publication.
[normal]3.3[bold]              [bold]Our 
[normal]weekly, “Northumberland Gazette” cover
[normal]s
[normal] public transport
[normal],
[normal] publishing a paragraph or two during a  consultation, but usually at the very end of the consultation period.  Is this due to tardy di
[normal]ssemination of information by the County Council, or to editorial policy.? 
[normal]3.4[bold]              [bold]C
[normal]onsultation documents are quite complex, and so only really useable online.  
[normal]A
[normal]n unusually
[normal] high
[normal] proportion of 
[normal]bus passengers 
[normal]probably 
[normal]do
[normal]n’t have access to
[normal] computer
[normal]s
[normal], particularly in rural areas 
[normal]lacking in 
[normal]broadband 
[normal]and decent mobile phone 
[normal]signals
[normal], leaving 
[normal]paper documents available at libraries
[normal]. I
[normal]f people 
[normal]rely
[normal] on public transport, they
[normal] might only 
[normal]get
[normal] to the nearest place with a library one day a week for an hour or tw
[normal]o 
[normal]to 
[normal]do essential tasks, so would not 
[normal]have
[normal] time to peruse and respond to a consultation.
[normal]3.5[bold]              [bold]At a public meeting in Felton, I think in October 2011, 
[normal]about cutting 
[normal]bus services to Newton-on-the -Moor and Swarland, 
[normal]attended by 
[normal] councillors, council officers,
[normal] and Arriva
[normal] representatives 
[normal], it was stated that one of the main ways for determining passenger demand was counting the ticket numbers on services. 
[normal]L[bold]ocal users [bold]replied[bold] that [bold]this [bold]could only be [bold]done[bold] [bold]on services which existed, and it[bold] did nothing for people [bold]needing [bold]a bus service which currently didn’t exist, [bold]especially if they had [bold]to get a lift to the nearest bus route, often a [bold]great[bold] distance [bold]away[bold] 
[normal]Though  common practice in urban public transport surveys is  to ask people how far and how they travel to and f[bold]rom the service being surveyed, this is not done in Northumberland.[bold]Most regular passengers using 
[normal]weekly passes 
[normal]suspect
[normal] that they 
[normal]are
[normal] waved onto the bus without being counted
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]3.6[bold]              [bold]On regular drivers who know the route and passengers well.  
[normal]T
[normal]heir employers 
[normal]probably do
[normal]n
[normal]’
[normal]t make enough use of their local knowledge, and could run a better s
[normal]ervice if they did. I
[normal]t is
[normal] only because of these drivers’ 
[normal]personal dedication that this service operate
[normal]s
[normal] effectively.
[normal]              
[normal]3.7.i[bold]              [bold]I 
[normal]arrived back in Northumberland in 
[normal]time to see the five year Local Transport Plan 2006-2011 apparently voted in by the County Council befor
[normal]e the consultation period ended.
[normal] In autumn 2010, 
[normal]having discovered
[normal] the name of the Commercial Manager at Arriva
[normal],
[normal] I 
[normal]prepared
[normal] for the forthcoming 2011 Loc
[normal]al Transport Plan by giving out address cards with the Arriva manager’s name and head office address in Sunderland to anyone who I heard making a comment about the state of the bus service, 
[normal]hoping
[normal] that it might encourage the decision-makers to pay 
[normal]more
[normal] att
[normal]ention to our needs and experiences.  I was much surprised by the number of people who 
[normal]later 
[normal]told me that they had written letters, even those who had said “they won’t listen to us anyway”.  
[normal]Apparently 
[normal]the Arriva management also got a surprise.  
[normal]ii  [bold]              [bold]Later
[normal], questionnaires were distributed to passengers on the Rothbury and A1 routes in Northumberland, 
[normal]and 
[normal]collated 
[normal]in
[normal] the 
[normal]EVIDENCE BASE FOR THE NORTHUMBERLAND LOCAL TRANSPORT  2011-2026, giving [bold]the impression of a howl of anguish from passengers.  [bold]T[bold]here wa[bold]s no publicity about this questionnaire on any of the buses[bold], 
[normal]and it was mostly distributed by passengers who got further copies of it themselves
[normal], and distributed it to everyone they could either on the buses or door-to-door.  Even so, I later heard from ma
[normal]ny passengers who had still had no idea that a consultation was taking place.
[normal]iii  [bold]              [bold]Presusmably [bold] this was because, as a subsidised service, Arriva [bold]ran[bold] it under contract for the County Council, and [bold]it [bold] did not cover operating consultations or publicity.[bold]              [bold]I[bold]t is [bold]probably [bold]not in Arriva’s interests to [bold]facilitate[bold] a profitable and effective service if the[bold]y[bold] can get money by contracting to run a service [bold]for [bold] the County Council without invest[bold]ing [bold] in market rese[bold]arch or promotion.  [bold]F[bold]ew[bold] County Council resources availab[bold]le to [bold]do this.[bold]On 
[normal]“THE BOTTOM LINE” ON BBC RADIO 4 ON 19/11/11, I HEARD DAVID MARTIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ARRIVA UK 
[normal]appeared to say that
[normal]there was no money in running public transport services, but Arriva forecast healthy growth [bold]by[bold] get[bold]ting [bold] money [bold]for[bold] running services for councils.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]              [bold]3.8[bold]              [bold]Apparently
[normal] the 
[normal]RECENT QUESTIONNAIRE FOR THE FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR THE PROPOSED REINTRODUCTION OF REGULAR BUS SERVICES BETWEEN ALWINTON AND 
[normal]ALNWICK VIA ROTHBURY BY A NEW COMPANY
[normal], SPIRITBUSES OF ROTHBURY[bold], has [bold]uncovered[bold] a[bold] huge and desperate demand,[bold] exemplified 
[normal]by 
[normal]several of we potential passengers 
[normal]getting 
[normal]a supply of questionnaires and voluntarily distributed them on buses, and door-to-door.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.9[bold]              [bold]See
[normal] 
[normal]my submission
[normal] 
[normal]to the 
[normal]NORTHUMBERLAND CORE STRATEGY 2015-2030 PREFERRED 
[normal]OPTIONS
[normal]  
[normal]CONSULTATION,  TRANSPORT SECTION,  QUESTION 43:  
[normal]To base a planning strategy on a vision where the majority of the county is rural, but “where the use of public transport for the journey to work and to school is considered socially necessary but 
[normal]is not commercially viable, the local authority 
[normal]may
[normal] provide revenue support for services”[Northumberland Economic Strategy p.23] is LUDICROUS.
[normal]In the Local Transport Plan 2011-2026 Strategy Document there are 17 principle elements of the new bus strategy, 
[normal]but 
[normal]none of them mention working with or involving the LOCAL BUSINESSES WHOSE EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS ARE USERS OF THE BUS SERVICE, and who might wish for more bus use in order to free up the oversubscribed car parking spaces for a larger number of custome[bold]rs, and a better network of buses to attract more tourists[bold](e.g. Dutch tourists, 7% of whom expect to use public transport, our nearest neighbours on the ferry)
[normal]              [bold]              [bold]&#xa0;[bold]4)  [bold]To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers taken into account in [bold]determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]              [bold]4.1[bold]              [bold]Many special interest groups such as the elderly, frail and vulnerable, and to some extent, young people, are probably very much on the County Council’s radar, and quite a large p
[normal]roportion of available resources are put into supporting the introduction and operation of community buses, but these are often only usable for people who are in a position to book in advance in quite small time-slots. 
[normal]The[bold]se[bold], [bold]and the excellent car-share s
[normal]chemes implemented by the County Council, 
[normal]are not suitable for the growing number of people who are struggling to afford a car to get to work, or look for work, and who are increasingly expected to work unusual shifts or at short notice, or both [bold](zero hour
[normal]s contracts etc.), or who simply want to reduce global warming by using public transport 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.2[bold]              [bold]T
[normal]eenagers 
[normal]seem
[normal] to be the least informed about chan
[normal]ges to bus timetables etc.,
[normal] though public transport has been one of the main campaigning issues of the National
[normal] Youth Parliament for 2 years running, and youngsters are readily in touch via social media.  
[normal]Probably an effective route for communicating with them has not been established.
[normal]4.3[bold]              [bold]Apparently[bold] no recognition that rural communities have a strong tradition and basis in cultural and family links, which needs to be supported by public transport [bold](especially in the absence of accessible computer services and tuition).
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]It isn’t just about taking [bold]people into town centres to access increasingly centralised services which have been withdrawn from rural areas.[bold]It is about allowing people to be able to continue seeing and supporting relatives and friends in neighbouring communities, get to family grave[bold]s to tend them, recognising that sick people don’t just need medical services, but visitors as well[bold] [bold](e.g. no Sunday services)
[normal], allowing access to local meetings so that they are not excluded from democracy, [bold]and[bold] local cultural events and activities to maint[bold]ain the cohesion of the community [bold]For some people 
[normal]living
[normal] on their own, or whose partners are in hospital, 
[normal]their fellow passengers and 
[normal]the bus-drivers 
[normal]can be
[normal] the
[normal]ir most important 
[normal]source of company and support.  
[normal]Buses are a good and rare meeting place for 
[normal]different sections of the community who might not otherwise meet 
[normal]e.g. young and old, native and newcomer, people with and without children,
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5) [bold]What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to [bold]isolated communities?  How can these challenges be overcome?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1[bold]              [bold]Communicating[bold] with passengers and
[normal] potential[bold] passengers 
[normal](see section 3)
[normal]a
[normal]nd
[normal], 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]day-to-day service changes[bold], recognition from 
[normal]e.g.
[normal] Arriva, who say that we can use Facebook or Twitter, that an
[normal] unusually high proportion of their passengers don’t have access
[normal] to or knowledge of these, and 
[normal]many of the most essential journeys are outside of office hours. Arriva’s number for enquiries 
[normal]is
[normal] only open during office hours, with no 
[normal]n
[normal]umbers for 
[normal]“
[normal]local
[normal]” depo
[normal]ts. T
[normal]heir Facebook page 
[normal]is
[normal] only updated during office hours.
[normal]There are no information offices on the Thropton route outside of Newcastle.
[normal]5.2[bold]              [bold]Accurately establishing the need.  
[normal]People have had to give up going to places, make 
[normal]unreliable or inefficient 
[normal]ad 
[normal]hoc arrangements, or get a car when finances or environmental principles make it preferable that they did not.
[normal]If a new service is put in place, especially if it is not publicised, or has not been properly researched to make sure that it best fits peoples’ needs, it takes some time for people to find out about and transfer back to trusting and relying on public tra
[normal]nsport.  If 
[normal], as usual 
[normal]it has been a tr
[normal]ial period of only a
[normal] year
[normal], there
[normal] is not time to build up a base of new 
[normal]and
[normal] previous customers, and the service is then 
[normal]irrevocably cut
[normal] due to “lack of demand”.  (Many passengers have 
[normal]concluded
[normal] that this
[normal] is probably on
[normal]e of the main objective
[normal]s when designing “trial periods”).
[normal]e.g. the recent history of the Newton-on-the-Moor and Swarland bus service, which was 
[normal]no use for workers
[normal], and only catered for a small section of the community before it was cut altogether.
[normal]              
[normal]5.3[bold]              [bold]Rou
[normal]gh roads and reliability in winter – better integration 
[normal]with
[normal] highways dept
[normal]s
[normal] – ensur
[normal]ing better gritting times,
[normal] passing places, and parking
[normal] 
[normal]/dumping space
[normal]s
[normal] for snow so that cars aren’t parked on roads and buses can get through safely.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6)  [bold]How effectively [bold]do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities?  How could Community Transport be improved?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]See section 4.1
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7) [bold]To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxi and other [bold]demand-responsive transport services?[bold]This discriminates against some of the groups who actually rely on the buses, who have not got enough money to run a car, so couldn’t afford a taxi either.
[normal]Maybe more could be done to look into taxi-share schemes
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]8)  [bold]T[bold]he main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities?  How can these services be made more affordable?[bold]8.1[bold]              [bold]J
[normal]udging from a public meeting about the Wooler  to Newcastle bus service in March 2013, the County Council is oblig
[normal]ed to pay for the free journeys made by pensioners, but is given no funds 
[normal]for it, presumably 
[normal]mean
[normal]ing
[normal] that 
[normal]available
[normal] funds are drawn to the most used, 
[normal]but possibly less
[normal] socially essential routes, so that people on busy urban bus routes get much more value f
[normal]or money and use of their pensioners’ passes 
[normal]than people in rural areas can.
[normal], but free bus travel for 
[normal]all[bold] pensioners, whether rural or urban is essential – see section 4.
[normal]8.2[bold]              [bold]Do everything to make rural bus services more profitable, by effective market res
[normal]earch and promotion, 
[normal]see
[normal] section 3. 
[normal]8.3[bold]              [bold]Funding an area’s rural transport as a whole network, rather than looking at individual routes 
[normal]separately. This 
[normal]only results in constant cuts, 
[normal]rendering
[normal] the network useless for increasing number
[normal]s
[normal] of dedicated passengers, and necessitat
[normal]ing
[normal] larger subsidies for the remaining few.
[normal]8.4[bold]              [bold]W
[normal]e are all being exhorted to reduce emissions, 
[normal]but 
[normal]rural bus services 
[normal]are 
[normal]always being cut, despite more and more essential services and facilities being withdrawn from
[normal] rural areas and centralised, so needing people to make more and longer journeys –
[normal]include funding for rural public transport as part of any centralization proj[bold]ect or cost-benefit analysis?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;
