"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Understanding Risk Research Group, Cardiff University (CLC042)&#xa0;BACKGROUND&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat is the current state of public understanding of what is meant by climate change? How has this changed in recent yearS&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Which voices are trusted in public discourse on climate science and policy? What role should Government Departments, scientific advisers to Government and publicly funded scientists have in communicating climate science?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow could public understanding of what is meant by climate change be improved? What are the main barriers to this? Does the media have a positive role to play?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow important is public understanding in developing effective climate change policy?&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat evidence is there that public attitudes to climate science affects their engagement with energy policies or initiatives?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDoes the Government have sufficient expertise in social and behavioural sciences to understand the relationship between public understanding of climate science and the feasibility of relevant public policies?&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPrepared \non behalf of the \nUnderstanding Risk Research Group, Cardiff University – \nby \nProfessor Nick Pidgeon and Dr Adam Corner\n,\n with contributions \nalso \nfrom Dr Wouter Poortinga, Dr Stuart Capstick, Dr Christina Demski, Dr Catherine Butler, Dr Karen Parkhill\n, Dr Alexa Spence (\nNottingham University) \nand Dr Lorraine Whitmarsh.  \n \n \n&#xa0;\nInterest Statement\n: Professor Pidgeon currently serves as a member of the Chief Scientist’s Science Advisory Group (SAG) at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, and vice-Chair of the DEFRA/DECC Social Sciences Expert Panel (SSEP). \nDr Adam Corner, in addition to his role at Cardiff University, also works for the Climate Outreach &amp; Information Network charity (www.climateoutreach.org.uk). \nThe opinions here are, however, offered solely in relation to the authors’ professional academic positions at Cardiff.\n&#xa0;\nApril 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Details of the \nUnderstanding Risk\n research programme and a number of its key policy and survey reports may be found at: \nwww.understanding-risk.org\n However, the views in this submission represent those of the authors alone, and not of any of the listed funding agencies.\n \nPidgeon, N.F.
