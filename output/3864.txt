[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;The Public Law Project (PLP) is an independent legal charity that was set up in 1990 with the aims of increasing the accountability of public decision-makers; enhancing the quality of public decision-making; and improving access to justice. It carries out its aims through training, research, casework and policy work. PLP is widely recognised as a national centre of expertise in public law, and earlier in 2013 was awarded the Special Rule of Law Award by Halsbury’s Laws.&#xa0;PLP submitted a response to the consultation Judicial Review: Proposals for Further Reform. That response is available on our website at: http://www.publiclawproject.org.uk/resources/147/public-law-project-response-to-judicial-review-proposals-for-further-reform-consultation.&#xa0;This consultation is the third in the space of a year seeking to restrict access to judicial review. &#xa0;This document is intended to summarise our position, with particular focus on that which is informed by PLP's empirical research.&#xa0;

[[[Summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Government's proposals represent a politically motivated and cynical attack on access to justice. The reforms proposed will have the effect of making it more difficult and more expensive to challenge unlawful actions of public bodies. Their effect, indeed their intended effect, will be to insulate executive action from judicial scrutiny, thus weakening the rule of law. The impact assessments make no effort to distinguish between meritorious and unmeritorious claims – the intention is simply to reduce the number of challenges to Government. The constitutional significance of the proposed reforms is clear but unacknowledged.  &#xa0;

[[[Overarching Observations]]]&#xa0;(1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Misstatement of constitutional position&#xa0;The consultation paper makes reference to Parliament and the elected government being best placed to identify what is in the public interest (paragraph 24). This is a fundamental misunderstanding of our constitutional settlement. Under traditional constitutional theory Parliament is sovereign. This means that the executive must act in accordance with the will of Parliament, as expressed through statute. If the executive steps outside of the authority granted to it by legislation, it does so in contravention of Parliament’s will. When this happens, judicial review is the mechanism by which Parliament’s will is enforced: the courts ensure that the executive acts lawfully, in accordance with the powers granted to it by Parliament. If access to judicial review is restricted, the people's ability to ensure that the executive acts lawfully and thus preserve the sovereignty of Parliament is restricted.  It is plainly in the public interest for the executive to be required to act in accordance with the law. It is authoritarian governments that seek to suppress the means of legitimate challenge.  &#xa0;(2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Encroaching politicisation of the role of Lord Chancellor  &#xa0;The Lord Chancellor has a statutory duty to uphold the rule of law (Constitutional Reform Act 2005, s.17).  As the CRA 2005 recognises in section 1, the rule of law is a constitutional principle, and it is not political. Judicial review is the mechanism by which this principle is upheld. It is therefore both inapt and inappropriate for the Lord Chancellor to characterise judicial reviews, and the role of those bringing them, as political tools. Both the principle and the mechanism by which it is enforced must be kept above the vagaries of political cut and thrust. Nor should enforcement of the law be equated with red tape. Executive commentary such as that footnoted here is of deep concern.&#xa0;(3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Misleading data and lack of evidence&#xa0;In PLP’s response to Judicial Review: Proposals for Reform and Transforming Legal Aid: Delivering a more credible and efficient system we raised serious concerns about the lack of credible evidence base for the proposals contained therein. Those concerns remain, and are if anything intensified. The Government has employed misleading and inaccurate statistics to attempt to convince the public that there is a problem which must be solved. In the context of the constitutional significance of the proposals, and the unprecedented politicisation of judicial review referred to above, the lack of a reliable evidence base for the proposals is a cause for alarm.&#xa0;

[[[Standing]]]&#xa0;The proposal to change the rules on standing is an attempt to use restrictive procedural rules to restrict access to the courts. It runs contrary to decades of case law that emphasises the constitutional role of charities, NGOs, pressure groups and responsible citizens in bringing judicial reviews in the public interest. A chilling feature of the proposal is the unashamed admission that it is aimed at preventing meritorious challenges to executive decision-making (see paragraph 178 of the consultation paper, which acknowledges that these cases have a higher success rate than judicial reviews brought by individuals).&#xa0;Further the proposal fails to acknowledge the fundamental role played by judicial review in promoting proper decision-making. Leaving aside the obvious point that ‘proper decision-making’ is lawful decision making, independent research has shown the beneficial effect that judicial review can have on decision-makers.&#xa0;The proposal ignores the crucial importance of judicial review in enabling the court to carry out its constitutional duty to prevent abuses of State power. There is a public interest in the court’s role remaining unimpeded. It is for precisely this reason that the current rules on standing for judicial review are flexible.&#xa0;The current “sufficient interest” test (contained in s.31(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981) was introduced following a recommendation of the Law Commission that the older ‘person aggrieved’ test be replaced because the courts had been interpreting that test too narrowly. (Law Comm. Cmnd. 6407 (1976), para 48; Law Comm. Working Paper (no 40) (1971) pp 95-101). The Law Commission strongly felt that a broader and more flexible approach to standing was needed. The Law Commission subsequently recommended that those adversely affected by a decision ‘should normally be given standing as a matter of course’ and that the court should have ‘a broad discretion to allow ‘public interest and group challenges’ (Law Comm No 226, Para 5.22). The rules thus reflect a considered and evidence-based position. Nothing approaching this level of consideration or evidence is advanced in the consultation paper.&#xa0;The consultation fails to identify any evidence in support of the central assertion that judicial reviews are being used to seek publicity or otherwise hinder the process of proper decision-making. Both case studies used in the consultation paper (at pp. 6-7) relate to applications in which permission was granted. Indeed, in the free school example, the Defendant appears to have admitted breaching its statutory duties.&#xa0;The Government asserts that around 50 applicable claims are issued each year, with 20 being granted permission, 13 being heard at a final hearing and 6 being successful for the claimant (paragraph 78). These figures are based on a “manual analysis of case level information” which “due to uncertainties in recording and interpretation” is “largely illustrative” (footnote 38). These figures are insufficiently precise to make a cogent case for reform.&#xa0;By contrast, analysis by Public Law Project and the University of Essex concluded that challenges brought by NGOs in respect of wider public interest matters are few and far between. PLP’s database contains extensive details on 502 civil JR final hearing decisions heard in a 20 month period between July 2010 and February 2012.  In this sample, 77% of the claims were brought by individuals. The next largest group of claimants consists of corporations/legal persons (15%). A variety of interest groups and charities, were the claimants in 16 cases, comprising just 3% of the sample.&#xa0;Finally, it is far from clear what the Government's proposal would actually mean in practice. We set out in our consultation response the various pitfalls of seeking to draw any principled distinctions between categories of potential public interest litigant.  This was in the context of the Government's stated attempts to limit the role of NGOs and charities. However we are greatly concerned that the proposed restriction would - in addition to its effect on the work of NGOs - have the potential to prevent any individual claimants from challenging a policy or practice of wide application – however unlawful - to the extent that the policy or practice does not direct affect them. The current rules on standing have been developed to enable such challenges to be brought in the public interest. While under the proposed restricted test for standing, claimants might have standing to challenge a decision directly relating to them, it is doubtful, and at best worryingly unclear, whether they would also have standing to challenge wider, systemic practices.  

[[[Procedural Defects]]]&#xa0;The proposal to change the test that the court would apply in cases where claimants bring procedural challenges would not achieve the Government’s stated aim of preventing delay to “perfectly reasonable decisions or actions”. Where decisions or actions are “perfectly reasonable”, judicial review challenges will, in any event, be filtered out of the system at the permission stage. The only cases that would be caught by the proposal are those where the decision or action being challenged has been reached by an unlawful decision-making process. The proposed test would result in the court having to put itself in the shoes of the decision maker in considering whether the decision would be “highly likely” to have been the same but for the procedural defect. This is a role in which the court has no competence, and which is not conducive to good public decision-making. &#xa0;It is however in the public interest that decision-makers know when they have gone wrong – this will not happen if issues of remedy are dealt with at the permission stage without any judicial determination of the lawfulness of the procedure that has been followed. Further, the proposals would incentivise defendants to raise the “no difference” argument at the permission stage to avoid a full hearing: this would result in an increased need for oral permission hearings (which will be longer), lengthier pleadings, and more extensive case preparation, all of which will drive up costs for the parties and take up valuable court time. Front-loading costs at the permission stage would further aggravate the chilling effect on legally aided claimants’ representatives already anticipated if the Government’s legal aid proposals are implemented. Taken together, the increased uncertainty and costs at permission would inevitably impact on legally aided claimants’ representatives’ willingness and ability to act. This phenomenon is liable to be a serious impediment to access to justice. &#xa0;

[[[Costs – General]]]&#xa0;Judicial review is properly distinguishable from normal civil litigation in various ways, including the fundamental inequality of arms/power between the parties, differences in its purpose, and consequent differences in procedure. The courts have developed special costs rules to reflect these distinctions, which were amongst those considered in a major review of civil costs rules by Lord Justice Jackson, published in 2009. Putting forward a package of costs reforms across the civil regime, Jackson LJ made specific reference to the special case of judicial review, and the public interest in ensuring that the judicial review court could be accessed without disproportionate financial risk. He concluded that in judicial review cases the costs system needed rebalancing in favour of claimants, and made recommendations to that effect (the introduction of Qualified One Way Costs-Shifting (QUOCS)).&#xa0;The Government took forward those of Jackson LJ's recommendations that favoured defendants (abolishing recoverability of CFA success fees and ATE insurance premiums) but declined to introduce QUOCS for judicial review. The Government could point to no principled basis on which to justify its decision to do so. But now, having already rebalanced the costs system in favour of defendants (including itself) it asserts that it is necessary to go further still. There is simply no basis for it to do so.  &#xa0;The Government's proposals do nothing to address wasteful action on the part of defendants such as not responding or responding late to pre-action correspondence, failing to provide any or any adequate disclosure, or unjustifiably resisting permission or defending proceedings. Any genuine attempt to consider ‘rebalancing’ the costs of judicial review would address these issues.&#xa0;

[[[Protective Costs Orders]]]&#xa0;The proposal to limit the availability of protective costs orders (“PCOs”) is an attempt to use financial disincentives to prevent organisations acting in the public interest from accessing the courts. It will act as a complete bar to NGOs, charities and campaigning groups being able to bring judicial reviews in most cases, including those where the court considers that it is in the public interest for the organisation to bring the case. The proposal fails to produce any evidence of problems with the current practice of granting PCOs in accordance with the Corner House criteria.   &#xa0;Further joint research conducted by PLP and the University of Essex, reveals that during the 20 month period between July 2010 and February 2012 there were only seven cases decided by the Administrative Court at final hearing in which a PCO had been granted, of which four were environmental cases (and outwith these proposals – paragraph 156). This leaves only three PCOs out of 502 cases over a 20 months period. This plainly suggests that the Government’s assessment of the scale of the problem it perceives is exaggerated, and militates strongly against the proportionality of the proposal.&#xa0;

[[[Third Parties]]]&#xa0;The proposal to expose third parties to a costs risk will deter expert interventions in public interest cases from all but the most well-resourced parties (those representing well-resourced financial interests will continue to be able to bear the costs risk that interventions will attract if the proposal is implemented). The courts and our most senior judges have identified how helpful such interventions are and seeking to deter them from being made risks undermining the quality of judicial decision-making in relation to public interest issues.&#xa0;There is no evidence that third party interventions create a problem to be solved at all, or that they add much if at all to the overall costs of the case, or that the existing rules and practice are inadequate.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Costs Risk]]]&#xa0;The proposals to increase the costs risk for both claimants and their legal representatives, by restricting payment of legal aid in judicial review cases in which permission to apply for judicial review is not granted, by seeking to make claimants liable for all of the defendant’s costs where permission to apply for judicial review is refused, and by seeking to increase the circumstances in which the court is able to make wasted costs orders will have the effect of preventing meritorious cases from being brought, and will allow unfair, unlawful and unreasonable government decision-making to go unchallenged.&#xa0;The Government repeats its 'concern' that weak judicial reviews are being publicly funded. In our response to Transforming Legal Aid: Delivering a more credible and efficient system, PLP analysed the statistics on which the Government then relied in support of a proposal to cut funding for judicial review. Our analysis showed that this was concern was unfounded, with only 13% of legally aided cases ending at permission without benefit to the client. We said then, as we say now, that the figures do not support an assertion that publicly funded claimant lawyers are bringing weak cases.&#xa0;The proposal to increase the costs and risks to claimants and their representatives suffers from the same fundamental flaw as the Government’s past and present proposals for restricting legal aid payments to claimants’ representatives; namely, they proceed on the false basis (at paragraph 150) that it is claimants’ representatives that are best placed to assess prospects of success. In fact, it is invariably the defendant who is best placed to assess the merits of the vast majority of claims for judicial review because it is the defendant (not the claimant’s representative) that has access to all the relevant information about how a decision was reached. However in many cases there will be credible legal arguments on both sides, which require adjudication by the court. It simply does not follow that a claimant who fails to obtain permission has by definition acted improperly. It is merely illustrative of the uncertainty characteristic in public law, with the lack of any pre-issue disclosure. &#xa0;Under the present system, legally aided claimants must satisfy the LAA that their claims are sufficiently meritorious to attract funding. The weakness of the Government’s case is illustrated by the lack of confidence shown in the LAA to accurately merits test applications for judicial review. No reason is given why additional resources could not be diverted to the LAA to enable weak cases to be sifted out before they are issued (to the extent it is claimed that this does not happen already), with consequent saving of public funds. &#xa0;The modification the Government now proposes offers very little comfort – it does nothing to reduce the uncertainty over whether legal representatives will be paid – indeed it increases it - and is unlikely to benefit claimant lawyers in most cases. There is much scope for uncertainty about the manner in which the exhaustive criteria will be applied by the LAA and the discretion is likely to operate in a very narrow range of cases. The costs of attempting to secure payment – which are at risk for solicitors - will be disproportionate.&#xa0;

[[[Costs of Oral Hearings]]]&#xa0;The existing approach to costs is flexible and allows judges to do justice on a case by case basis. The current approach reflects the fact that attendance at an oral hearing is optional for a defendant, who will already have set out their opposition to the claim in detailed terms.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Wasted Costs Orders]]]&#xa0;The Government observes that Wasted Costs Orders (WCOs) against claimants’ legal representatives are rarely made (paragraph 147). It does not identify any cases where a WCO should have been made, but was not. It is unclear why there is a need for reform of the current system of WCOs and no evidence is provided to illuminate this. WCOs already penalise legal representatives for improper, negligent or unreasonable conduct, and the courts have made it clear that there are important public policy reasons why pursuing a weak case should never – for that reason – result in a WCO. The proposal will have a disproportionate and unfair impact on judicial review claimants of limited financial means.

[[[ ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Weak cases in judicial review proceedings are already liable to be dealt with by an award of costs against the losing party (not the representative) in the normal way, at the permission stage which identifies and filters out weak cases. A wider use of WCOs will be pursued by defendants against the legal representatives of claimants without financial resources, as defendants will not be able to recover costs from such claimants even if they obtain an order for costs against them. The result is therefore to discourage legal representatives from bringing judicial review claims on behalf of those of limited means. This is a matter of particular concern given the crucial role judicial review performs in safeguarding the fundamental rights of minorities, including those without financial resources.&#xa0;27 November 2013&#xa0;See: ‘Beware of Kite Flyers, (Lord Justice) Stephen Sedley, London Review of Books 12 September 2013 Vol. 35, No.17 pp 13 – 16 http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n17/stephen-sedley/beware-kite-flyers  &#xa0;‘The Judicial Review system is not a promotional tool for countless Left-wing campaigners’,  Article by the Lord Chancellor, Chris Grayling,  The Daily Mail, 6 September 2013 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2413135/CHRIS-GRAYLING-Judicial-review-promotional-tool-Left-wing-campaigners.html&#xa0;See the Prime Minister’s speech to the CBI on 19 November 2012 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/9687688/David-Cameron-CBI-speech-in-full.html&#xa0;See also ‘Debunking the Lord Chancellor’s misuse of Judicial Review statistics’ http://www.publiclawproject.org.uk/resources/127/debunking-the-lord-chancellors-misuse-of-judicial-review-statistics&#xa0;Judicial Review Litigation as an Incentive to Change in Local Authority Public Services in England and Wales, M.
