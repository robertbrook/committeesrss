[[[David Wolfe QC]]]&#xa0;

[[[Executive Summary:]]] I am a barrister with extensive practical expertise of academies and the law. My submission identifies some of the legal/governance issues arising from the process of establishing and operating different types of academies/free schools (including issues as to transparency, public participation and tendering).&#xa0;

[[[My background and this submission:]]]Since 1992, I have practised as a barrister specialising in, among other things, education law. I have also been a member of a Local Education Authority, a governor at five schools and a Further Education College, and a part time judge of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal.In the course of my practice as a lawyer I have advised and acted for (including in legal proceedings) a great many parents, parents’ groups, governing bodies, head teachers, unions, NGOs and local authorities on issues relating to school organisation/re-organisation and governance including, in particular (since 2005) in relation to academies and free schools. I am the author of the blog on academies/free schools and the law: www.acanofworms.org.uk which has been looked at by an average of over 1,000 people per week since I set it up in October 2011.What follows is my summary response on each of the points I understand to be under consideration by the Select Committee. I have only commented on those things on which I have direct relevant expertise based on my personal experience and focussed my points on legal/governance aspects. I would be very happy to elaborate as requested. I would be pleased to assist by giving oral evidence to the Committee.&#xa0;
