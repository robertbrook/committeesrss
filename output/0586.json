"Written evidence submitted by the National Oceanography Centre (ESA010)Declaration of interestsThe National Oceanography Centre (NOC)\n \nis a research centre wholly owned by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).\n \nNOC\n \nundertakes\n \nintegrated ocean research and technology development from the\n coast to the deep ocean. \nThe \nSatellite Oceanography group at NOC (NOC-SO) delivers \nfundamental global earth observation ocean \nresearch, \nand \nconsultancy and training in ocean remote sensing techniques to monitor the ocean, shelf seas and coastal regions\n. \nNOC-SO is actively engaged with the European Space Agency, wh\nich\n \nis a major funder of the\n NOC-SO activities in the form of contracts. \nNOC-SO has developed \nclose relationships with key stakeholders in the space sector\n, particularly in the UK \nwith companies such as SSTL and \nAstrium\n. NOC’s \nposition\n \nwithin\n academic research and \nits \nlong-term strategic outlook allows \nit\n to define and develop new satellite missions, sensors and Earth Observation products that address the needs of \noperational \nusers, enhance the international competitive advantage of the UK space industry and are of benefit to science\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.1 \nESA \nis\n a major funder of research and development (R&amp;D) in Earth Observation\n, mainly\n \nthrough\n contracts awarded \nafter\n open competitive tendering\n \nacross\n its member states\n. ESA’s tendered work is clearly \ntied\n \nto\n the overall scientific objectives outlined in ESA’s well publicized and regularly updated strategy, which accounts for latest technical advances and awareness of \nthe \nevolving needs of its users. \nContracts are \nclose\nly supervised\n by \nhighly qualified \ntechnical officers \nfrom ESA \nand \ncharacteri\ns\ned by a \nclear \nset of \ndeliverables\n to be produced \nwithin a \nusually \ntight schedule\n. \n1.2 \nDespite tough demands and relatively small budgets (typically &lt; 500KEuros), ESA R&amp;D contracts\n \nare \nprestigious and \nsought-after, as they \nproduce\n \nwell-focused \ncutting edge research \non\n \nt\nechnically challenging topics and p\nromote the development of\n new capability, \nwhich \nitself \noften \nlead\ns\n to further funding opportunities.\n \n1.3 \nESA is \nalso \none of very few\n funding \nbodies\n that will support all partners, academic and industrial\n alike\n, at 10\n0% \nfunding \nlevel. This promotes\n \nreal\n working \npartnerships\n and the development of long-term relationships between academia and industry. \nIt\n also \nprovides the means \nto collaborate with partners in other European coun\ntries by way of small project teams, \nwithout the heavy administrative burden imposed by current EU funding schemes\n (e.g. FP7)\n.\n2.1 \nNOC is not in a position to comment on the most effective governance between ESA, EU and UK. \n2.2 \nHowever, t\nhe “rapprochement” of ESA towards the EU \nthat is proposed by the European Commission \ndoes not\n \nseem \ndesirable\n, since it will \nundoubtedly \ndisrupt\n ESA’s ability to deliver \nas a “\nworld-class \norganization \nthat deserves credit for European successes in the space field over the last decades\n”, \na fact that is\n recognised by the Commission itself. \n2.3 \nWhile\n investments in ESA have led to major successes and the development of \na \nstrong, internationally competitive \nEuropean \nspace \nsector\n, the scientific \nand economic \nreturn\ns\n on \nthe \nlarge invest\nments made in EU science programs are arguably less clear. \nESA's funding of space R&amp;D shows \ndetailed understanding of the scientific drivers and industrial capability\n in Europe, leading to well-\nfocussed projects. In contrast, the\n EU funds mainly large projects, selected after grading by non-specialist anonymous peer-reviewers, \nwhere significant resources \nare\n diverted \naway from research to deal with the EU’s bureaucratic demands and unwieldy management tools\n.\n \n2.4 \nIn addition, whereas there are \nclear \nestablished channels for the UK to \nmake its voice heard\n within ESA, \nthe ways to influence the EU are \nmore opaque \nand drawn-out and may result in a loss of influence in decisions relevant to the interests of the UK space sector.\n&#xa0;\n3.1 \nNOC is not in a position to comment on the impact of changes to the Multi-Annual Financial Framework on ESA and \nsupport from \nHorizon 2020.\n3.2 \nProjects funded \nso far under\n the C\nommission's FP7 Space calls do not generally support new R&amp;D in the space sector but tend to exploit opportunities arising from previous investments by ESA. EU funded space projects are \nmainly concerned with \nfacilitating\n access to \nestablished \nEarth Observation (EO) \ndata\n products, or with the exploitation of existing EO products for \nsocietal \nand economic \nbenefits\n. \n3.3 There is no or little EU investment in designing/building new space instrumentation, developing new algorithms and products, or in validation and quality control of EO products. \nThe latter are \nareas of research that \nscore badly in \ncompetitive science \nassessment system\ns\n (including \nthose in\n the UK) and are \nthus \npredominantly funded by \nESA\n. \nYet, these \nactivities \nare\n essential \nto\n \nbridge\n the gap between two en\nd points - development of satellite missions and sensors on the one hand, \nand the downstream \nexploitation\n of established EO products \nfor\n environmental \nscience, operational monitoring and commercial services.\n&#xa0;\n4.1 \nNOC we\nlcomed\n the increased \nUK contribution to \nthe \nESA budget at the last ministerial meeting in 2012. This visible commitment by the UK to space \nsent a strong message across Europe and \nimmediately opened \nup \nnew opportunities for the UK to benefit from its investments in ESA. \n4.2 \nNOC also welcom\ned\n the establishment of the UK Space Agency \n(UKSA) \nas the means \nof providing\n national focus and coordination of space activities.\n \nT\nhere \nis\n, however, \nmuch room for improvement\n, in particular \nregarding\n UKSA\n’s\n detachment and inaccessibility from the UK space community. \nWhile w\ne recognize that UKSA is currentl\ny undergoing management changes, \nwe can only hope that these \nchanges \nwill address the shortcomings of its operations so far. The main issues with UKSA are as follows: \n4.2.1\n \nInsufficient\n scientific or technical \nawareness \nby UKSA \nrepresentatives \nattending important official meetings (e.g. \nESA \nPBEO\n and \nGMES\n ). \nThis contrasts with other European countries whose representatives have \nenough\n scientific understanding to \ngrasp\n the nature and relevance of issues being discussed.\n \n4.2.2\n \nP\noor communication with the UK space community of UK \nstrategic \ninterests\n and priorities\n. For example, little\n i\ns\n known\n \nabout\n the motivation \nfor\n \nthe UK\n’s\n increased contribution to ESA\n, or about which ESA programs \nare seen as \nUK high or low priorities.\n4.2.3\n \nN\no transparency about \nthe \ninteractions between UKSA and \nother \nUK \nagencies with interests in space and Earth Observation, \ne.g.\n NERC, N\national \nC\nentre for \nE\narth \nO\nbservation\n, \nCentre for Earth Observation Instrumentation, \nDEFRA, Met \nOffice, etc\n. These interactions are the main routes \nto ensure integration of space activities within the UK. \nYet there \nare no visible signs of their \neffectiv\neness, or even of their existence.\n An important example relates to the UK position of the funding of Jason-CS to ensure continuity of high-precision time series of sea level measurements from satellite altimeters.\n4.2.4\n \nIt\n i\ns important that \nthe respective responsibilities of \nUKSA and NERC to \nsupport \nresearch\n that bridges the gap between technology development\n,\n science \nadvance and \nexploitation\n are clarified\n. \nThe UK\n need\ns\n to avoid the situation where \nacademics \nwho engage with the private sector to develop and validate new \nmissions, \nsensors a\nnd products are\n seen by NERC as\n falling under\n the remit of UKSA, and by UKSA as\n \nfalling \nunder \nthe remit of NERC. \nThe\n ambiguity about \nwho funds \nsuch important\n \ninter-disciplinary research is likely to originate from \ntight\n \nbudgetary \nconditions\n both in \nNERC and UKSA.\n4.2.5\n With the exception of the \nsmall but \nvery successful Centre for Earth Observation Instrumentation, there \nhas been little opportunity \nin the UK in recent years \nfor open competitive tendering \nfor\n research relating \nspecifically \nto space and Eart\nh Observation. The Harwell ISIC\n and \nSpace Catapult \ninitiatives \nare likely to \npresent such opportunities in future but it remains unclear \n(after more than 2 years since they were set up) \nhow academic and industrial \nplayers \ncan best\n engage with these, \nand what \nform these \nopportunities \nwill take.\n&#xa0;\n5.1 \nThe UK geo-return within ESA is now close to 1,\n meaning that we receive most of our investments into ESA back in the form of contracts. This is\n a substantial improvement from the situation just a few years ago. \n5.2 \nWith \nlimited\n UK funding for Earth Observation in recent years, ESA has provided a lifeline for many Earth Observation scientists in the UK\n and contributed to the development of long-term partnerships between UK academia and industry\n. Participation in ESA programs \ncontributed to \nnew scientific and industrial capability in the UK space sector, which now gives the UK a competitive edge in \nrelation to\n new opportunities within ESA (e.g. Earth Explorer 9) and elsewhere (e.g. \nS\nSTL’s\n \ninvolvement in the \nNASA CYGNSS\n and NSPO\n/NOAA\n FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 missions\n). \n&#xa0;\n6.1 \nNOC is not in a position to comment on \nthe resilience of the UK space-based infrastructure\n, or the threat to space debris or solar activity\n.\n&#xa0;\nApril 2013 \n \nwww.noc.ac.uk\n \nwww.nerc.ac.uk\n PBEO = ESA \nEarth Observation \nProgramme\n Board \n \nGMES = Global Monitoring for Environment and Security\n \nISIC = International Space Innovation Centre\n \nSSTL = Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd\n \nNSPO = National Space \nOrganisation\n of Taiwan\n \nNOAA – National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration USA\n"
