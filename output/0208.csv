Written evidence submitted by King’s College London, Forensic Science Unit (FSS017)1. Does the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the UK and is it sufficient to support forensic science R&amp;D and criminal justice?
The launch of the Technology Strategy Board - Forensic Science Special Interest Group (SIG) last November 
may 
prove to be an effective support for forensic science R&amp;D. 
Fundamental science research is supported by the research councils but development of potentially useful techniques for forensic science is not. Forensic tests need to be field deployable and must perform robustly under a range of ambient environmental conditions. This adds a significant extra research effort to bring a laboratory-based 
protype
 to market for forensic applications. For example techniques widely used in cell biology such as the labelling of specific cell surface markers, cannot easily be transferred to the forensic environment where the target molecules may be on any kind of surface, may already be contaminated, where non-specific binding cannot be simply washed away, and where the labels need to be human specific. This also applies to forensic genetic research where techniques that have been introduced in medicine cannot simply be translated into a forensic tool where the material required to be analysed may be many thousand fold less and no more is available.   All this requires a long lead in time from ‘proof of concept’ to a validated and marketable technique; at present there are no avenues of funding for this.  Private forensic companies engage in this in small ways, but generally only with the view to get themselves ahead of the market.
2. Did the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget?

3. What impacts have the FSS’s closure had on (
i
) the criminal justice system and (ii) forensic science R&amp;D and training? In particular, have the appropriate quality standards and accreditation been rigorously maintained? (please provide evidence/examples)
(
i
) A significant slowing down of the process due to difficulties in accessing the case information. This situation should be temporary as the cases get dealt with. Often the casework is done by several different providers, increasing the costs when the case comes to court.  The private sector appears not to have embraced the ethos of forensic casework. A philosophy of high throughput and maximum profit does not sit well in a system that requires a flexibility of approach depending on circumstances (e.g. recent contamination issues at LGC). 
Toxicology laboratories: expertise and support in the UK has diminished to an extent where research and development in important emerging areas is suffering greatly. The UK was once a world leader in toxicology and it contributes significantly in several other industries such as healthcare, environmental protection and drug discovery.
(ii)   The research carried out by the FSS prior to its closure was directed at the FSS as a business and not shared with the community as a whole. This meant that the government was, in reality, funding research for a private company, albeit a large one. In our experience the FSS was unwilling to enter into research partnerships or share information with academia, and those that do, do it in a partisan way.  The closure of the FSS and the opening up of funding opportunities to the university sector has the potential to greatly improve forensic science research and innovation, if that happens.  Quality has not necessarily been maintained.  It will take time for all provision to be accredited and the role of the Forensic Regulator in driving forward accreditation for all is vital here, but this will take time.
4. What should be role of the Forensic Science Regulator?
The Forensic Science Regulator should be responsible for ensuring that organisations and individuals are fit for purpose through the accreditation process, and providing a role in maintaining the quality and standards of forensic provision. Once the accreditation process for all forensic providers and individual practitioners has been formalised the regulator should continue to maintain a presence as a regulatory body (
