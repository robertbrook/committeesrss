[normal]1 Influence and [bold]a[bold]ttraction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1 The UK’s 
[normal]Soft Power, how we win the support and good will of other nations, is becoming increasingly critical to our international success. China, Turkey, Russia, the Gulf States and other rising economies are all developing soft power strategies and investing in cultural institutes, scholarship programmes and international broadcasting. 
[normal]The reputation and trust on which soft power is built are essential to a country’s success as the certainties of the 20th century’s Cold War gives way to a more fluid, volatile world. 
[normal]By sharing the UK’s most attractive assets - the English language, our arts and education and how we live and our values – the British Council builds trust and ensures that the UK remains one of the most attractive places on earth. Our success rests on our approach, we engage with people around the world, sharing our culture and focusing on reciprocity, taking the best of the UK to the world but also helping to bring the rest of the world to the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2 A modern, entrepreneurial public service[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1 While remaining true to the mission set out in our Royal Charter, how the British Council delivers that mission has changed significantly in recent years. In common with our other great cultural institutions and universities, the British Council must earn income, innovate, partner and be entrepreneurial in pursuit of its mission. Our mixed economy model is successfully building trust and increasing the UK’s reputation around the world at a fraction of the cost to the public purse of our overseas competitors. Nevertheless public funding remains critical to our success, ensuring the sustainability of our global operating platform, providing the space to innovate, take creative risks and invest long term in a way that would not be possible in a purely commercial model. Government grant is also essential to ensuring coherence between the British Council’s activities and the UK’s foreign policy objectives. Without it we could not be active in strategically important places for the UK, like fragile and post-conflict states in South Asia and Africa, where the opportunities to generate our own income are limited. A wholly commercial approach would lead to a different range of programmes focusing on those areas that others were willing to fund or buy rather than the areas of greatest importance to the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 As the Committee are aware over the course of the Spending Review period our Government grant is falling. The £171.5 million grant-in-aid received in 2012–13 was five per cent less than the previous year. By 2015 grant will have fallen to £153 million, less than 20 per cent of our annual turnover, compared with 27 per cent in 2010. In the face of such pressures we have made significant efficiency savings with reductions in permanent UK staff, a reduced office footprint, lighter models of operation in some countries and investment in new ways of working such as digital cultural relations to engage more people around the world in more cost effective ways. As a result despite the decline in our grant we have successfully grown our income, last year we achieved a 6% (£42 million) increase in total income. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 In 2012-13 the income from teaching and exams was £398m, fully 50% of our income. The surpluses generated by our work in English and other paid services are reinvested in other activities, for example earlier this year we were able to increase investment in our arts work by £14 million over the next two years. However, there are limits to how much we can rely on self-generated income to compensate for reductions in Government grant. The bulk of our work is undertaken on a cost recovery basis, the surplus generated from services like teaching that can be reinvested in our other activities is just 5%. Hence to generate a surplus to match £50 million in grant, we would need to generate £1 billion in revenue. To put that into context in 2012-13 our total turnover, including grant, was £781 million.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 Reductions in the overall grant have been accompanied by an increasing proportion of the public funding we receive being ring-fenced for ODA spending. Over the Spending Review period, the proportion of our grant ring-fenced for ODA spend will rise to 66% resulting in the grant expenditure in developed countries falling by 55% (from 
[normal]£49.7 million [bold]to
[normal] [bold]just
[normal] £22.4 million[bold]). The pressure on grant income in the developed world is now so acute that we are required to take further difficult decisions regarding our future presence in some countries. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5 The digital revolution has seen a dramatic increase in the importance of people-to-people contacts for the UK’s influence and attraction. Social media, 24 hour broadcasting and mobile applications have revolutionised the way people communicate. The explosion in people-to-people contacts is a truly global phenomenon with significant implications for the UK’s soft power. It presents new opportunities and challenges to how the UK Government and institutions like the British Council build trust and reputation. Young people researching study options will search on the internet; they will watch videos and use social media to find out about Britain, they will access learning opportunities online, often in preference to face-to face engagement. Many of our operations in Europe where we do not teach English have a small number of staff working in back office premises. We believe the revolution in how people engage with each other and access information and services has brought us to the point where the impact for the UK’s influence and attraction of a very small, permanent physical presence is now less than can be delivered by a flexible platform focused around a vibrant, engaging and easily accessed digital offer, coupled with a project-based approach to face to face engagement. Major events like our Apeldoorn Conference and other arts and education programmes can be run from regional hubs, with staff deployed and workspace engaged on a temporary basis for individual projects and programmes like a major design festival or higher education study fair. In light 
[normal]of the further planned cuts to our core grant we believe adopting a more flexible delivery platform offers a sustainable and cost effective model for continuing to build trust for the UK in Europe in the medium and longer term.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3 The importance of the English language[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1 The promotion of English has been core to the British Council’s mission since our foundation. Our research has found English to be the UK’s most attractive soft power asset. The value of English to the UK cannot be overstated; it is the international language of the world and gives the UK and other Anglophone countries a very real edge in international affairs. Proficiency in English is a valued skill globally. The trust generated through learning and practicing speaking our language is of immense benefit to the influence and reputation of the UK. English is an extremely attractive soft power asset in its own right but it is also vital to the accessibility of other key cultural assets. It is the gateway to our education, culture and values. English plays a triple role for the British Council. It is the single most important asset we have for building trust and reputation; it increases the accessibility of our arts and education and fosters understanding of our ways of living; and it provides makes a critical and growing contribution to our annual turnover. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4 Education[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1 The UK’s education institutions are highly regarded internationally and are an essential element of our soft power offer. Our schools and universities attract international students through the quality of the educational experience on offer. Education is not just important for reputation and trust; it is major contributor to the UK economy. BIS estimates that in 2011 the value of education exports to the UK was £17.5 billion with the UK the second most popular destination for international students with 13% of the international market. The UK’s research base in the sciences and engineering depends on the income from international students taking Masters courses. The British Council supports the UK’s educational institutions internationally, promoting opportunities to study in the UK. However, the successful expansion of the UK international higher education market is vulnerable to the consequences of changes in visa requirements. The UK is the second most popular destination for Indian nationals looking to study overseas. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency a total of 39,090 students from India were studying in the UK in 2010-11 but in 2011-12 the number of students fell to 29,900, a fall of 23.5%. The reduction is a direct result of recent developments in visa policies. To ensure our universities continue to attract the brightest and best what we now need is stability in the visa regime, a system in constant flux will deter prospective students. At present students cannot be sure that the rules will not be changed in the middle of their studies with potentially very significant implications for their career plans.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5 Cultural Seasons[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1 Building on the enormous success of our 
[normal]UKNow
[normal] season in China, which attracted over 4 million visitors and saw UK arts events take place in 29 Chinese cities during 2012, we are developing a series of major cultural seasons in Russia, India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey, Qatar and South Africa. These are showcasing the best of British arts and culture and supporting the presentation of work by international artists across venues in 
[normal]the UK. Transform, our four-year programme of cultural exchange and collaboration between the UK and Brazil is one of our most ambitious programmes yet and brings together partners including the ICA, the Roundhouse, the Southbank Centre and the V&amp;A. The cultural seasons approach targets the places that are strategically important to the UK’s prosperity and showcases the soft power assets that will hold the strongest appeal to that place to build bridges, challenge preconceptions and develop further opportunities for the UK. Over the course of the Season politicians, businesses and other partners have countless opportunities to engage – wraparound activities on education, the creative industries, for networking and to explore commercial opportunities are built into the programme.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6 Beyond 2012-13[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1 By continuing to share the UK's most attractive assets, the English language, our vibrant arts and education and our values with people around the world, we will build upon the successes of the past year and reach more people around the world. In doing so, we will build the trust that is essential to the UK’s prosperity, security and international standing. We are developing an exciting programme of activities with schools for the Commonwealth Games that will engage millions of young people in the UK and overseas. We are also looking forward to exciting arts seasons with the UK-Russia Year of Culture, the continuation of the four year Transform season in Brazil and Connect ZA which is bringing together young UK and South African artists. We will continue to bear down on our costs and seek opportunities to increase the income we earn for ourselves to provide the best possible value for money for UK taxpayers. Our approach in the developed world will by necessity have to change. We will continue to be ambitious and innovate, looking to partner with world leading businesses like BP and HSBC to increase our impact and developing our work with governments to deliver
[normal]high quality teaching in classrooms in emerging economies.
