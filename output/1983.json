"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Department for Transport (SLC 006)&#xa0;1  Are current safety measures at level crossings adequate? How should they be improved?&#xa0;1.  \nThe UK has one of the best level cross\ning safety records in Europe\n.\n  \nExcluding suicides and suspected suicides, there were nine fatalities during 2012/13 (four pedestrians and five road vehicle occupants).  Although this is a slight rise from 2011/12, which saw the lowest number of fatalities \n(5) and harm\n in the last 10 years, it is still well below the 10-year average and perpetuates an overall \ntrend towards \nimprovement in safety performance.  \n      \n \n&#xa0;\n2.  \nR\nail \nindustry opera\ntional errors or other process\n \nissues \nonly account for a small percen\ntage of level crossing incidents.\n  \nUnfortunately, misuse \nremains \na serious issue. \n \nThe vast majority of incidents at level crossings arise from the behaviou\nr of road users and pedestrians\n, either accidental or deliberate,\n and \nit is \nthese groups \nwhich \ncarry\n the highest risks as a result of their actions\n.  As well as the potential risks to\n themselves\n, misuse by road users and pedestrians\n also transfer\ns\n risks to train passengers as well as substantial costs from damage and delays to the rail industry.\n  \nThe bes\nt way to reduce risk at level crossings \nis\n to ensure \nthey \nare used safely and that \nany \ninst\nructions\n \ndisplayed \nare \nfollowed\n.  \nNetwork Rail has an on-going programme of public campaigns (see below\n)\n aimed at raising awareness of the risks of level crossing misuse. \n&#xa0;3.  \nThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch has investigated \n41 \nlevel crossing accidents and incidents\n,\n \nincluding \npublication of \na specific report on the use of automated open level crossi\nngs\n,\n \nto ascertain if safety improvements are necessary\n.  \nThe majority \nof recommendations have resulted \nin \nimp\nlementation by industry\n and progress is monitored by the O\nffice of \nR\nail \nR\neg\nulation\n.\n  \nWhile it is unfortunate that \nsuch investigations \nare sometimes necessary they are \nnevertheless \na positive illustration of the industry safety framework and “lessons learned” systems in action.\n  The Rail Accident Investigation Branch will be submitting its own more detailed submission to the Committee.  \n&#xa0;\n4.  \nThe Department notes that it now receives significantly more representations on convenience issues, particularly those for road users and communities in which busy crossings are situated, than on safety\n matters\n.\n    \n&#xa0;2  In addition to bridges and underpasses what other cost-effective measures can be introduced to replace or improve safety at level crossings?&#xa0;5.  \nFor a variety of reasons there may be limited options for replacing or improving safety at level crossings, but if it proves impossible to cl\nose a level \ncrossing\n, \nexamples of \nother cost-effective measures to\n drive safety improvements might\n include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.  \nThe Department notes that \nNetw\nork Rail is already either rolling out such measures across the network\n,\n or \nin the case of \nsome \nphysical works, \nis trialling their install\nation at a number of locations.  Network Rail, in consultation with the local highway au\nthority, \nare\n best placed to id\nentify the costs, benefits and appropriate business cases of taking action for their respective networks\n at any given location.  \n \n&#xa0;\n3  How should expenditure on improving safety at level crossings be prioritised in relation to other demands on the rail budget?&#xa0;\n7.  \nThe Department considers that the most effective way to \nimprove\n \nsafety at level crossings is to \nensure that \nring-fenced \nfunding\n is\n made available to Network Rail\n for this purpose and \nto \ndirect resources at those level crossings with the highes\nt risk factors\n.  \n&#xa0;\n8.  \nIn\n \nour July 2012 rail investment strategy, which \nset the \nstrategic objectives for \nrail for\n 2014 - 19), the Secretary of State \nincluded explicit notice of \nhis wish \nfor the industry to “\n…reduce the risk of accidents at level crossings…\n” and \n“\n…\nto make ring-fenced funding for this purpose\n”\n.     \n&#xa0;\n9.  \nThe Office of Rail Regulation\n, \nin its \nDraft Determination\n, \nhas made provision for a \n£67\n million\n \nfund to enable Network Rail\n to deliver a plan to maximise the reduction in risks of accidents at level crossings over and above meeting its existing legal obligations in this respect.  \nT\nhe \nO\nffice of \nR\nail \nR\negulation\n will publ\nish its\n final Determination on 31 October 2013.  \n&#xa0;\n10.  \nThe\n Department understands that a \nlevel crossing fund \ncomprising an additional £10 million \nwill \nalso \nbe made available by \nScottish Ministers \nto support Network Rail, local a\nuthorities and other local stakeholders in facilitating the closure of level crossings in Scotland.\n&#xa0;\n11.  \nWith funding from the Department, and as part of \nthe RSSB\n (formerly the Rail Safety &amp; Standards Board) rail industry research programme, Network Rail \nhas also participated in a project to extend existing industry risk management models to level crossings.  The resulting All Level Crossings Risk Model (“ALCRM”) has further improved Network Rail’s ability to manage the risk to level crossing users, passen\ngers and rail staff by targeting those crossings with the highest risk for remedial measures.  The ALCRM\n, in conjunction with further risk recognition and assessment work,\n will be \nan important element\n in identifying those\n level crossings where funding will\n provide the most substantial safety improvements\n \nover 2014-19\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4  Is Network Rail giving sufficient priority to improving safety at level crossings?&#xa0;\n12.  \nNetwork Rail\n has\n \na policy\n to avoid new level crossings being built due to the associated safety and convenience issues\n and to close existing level crossings \nso far as is reasonably practicable.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n13.  \nHowever, it would not be proportionate, or practical, to remove all existing cr\nossings\n and \nNetwork Rail has \nput in place a significant program\nme\n of 19 projects designed to enhance level crossing risk management \nand reduce level crossing risk.  \nNetwork Rail has also set itself challenging \ntargets for\n reducing level crossing risk by 25\n% by the end of \nMarch 2014 \nand a further 50% by \nMarch 2019\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1\n4\n.  \nThe Department believes that these \ntargets and initiatives, together with the \nring-fenced funding Network Rail is likely to receive fo\nr 2014-19\n, mean that\n \nit will be able to give \nsufficient priority \nto impr\noving safety at level crossings.  \n&#xa0;5  Is Government policy and regulatory action by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety at level crossings adequate? What more should the Government and ORR do?&#xa0;1\n5\n.  \nThe\n Department will consider any recommendations the Committee makes in this area in due course.\n&#xa0;6  How should the legislation governing level crossings be updated?&#xa0;1\n6\n.  \nThe Department recognises that the \ncurrent law on level crossings is \nantiquated, \ncomple\nx an\nd inaccessible\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nFor this reason the Department, in collaboration with the \nO\nffice of \nR\nail \nR\negulation, \nput forward a proposal to the Law Commission for\n&#xa0;\na \ncomprehensive \nreview of level crossing legislation.\n&#xa0;\n In June 2008, the Law Commission announced tha\nt this review would take place \nas part of its 10th programme of law reform.\n&#xa0;\n \nFollowing public consultation, t\nhe \nLaw \nCommission expects to publish \nits recommendations\n later in 2013\n.\n&#xa0;\n1\n7\n.  \nThe Department, together with the Office of Rail Regulation, will \nneed to consider the Law Commission’s proposals in detail before responding.\n&#xa0;\n7  How should public awareness of safety at level crossings be improved?&#xa0;1\n8\n.  \nIn addition to making physical and other changes to level crossings in order to make them safer, \nNe\ntwork Rail is \nalready\n doing a great deal to improve public awareness of safety at level crossings.  \n&#xa0;\n1\n9\n.  \nExamples of this\n work include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n20\n.  \nThe Department believes that Network Rail’s strategy provides comprehensive coverage but wou\nld welcome the Committee’s recommendations\n on how public awareness could be further impr\noved.  \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Investigation Into The Safety Of Automatic Open Level Crossings On Network Rail’s Managed Infrastructure, Rail Accident Investigation Branch, Report 12/2011, July 2011.  \nAvai\nlable from \nwww.raib.gov.uk/cms_resources.cfm?file=/110728_R122011_AOCLs_Class_Inv.pdf\n.\n   \n The High Level Output Specification (2012): Railways Act 2005 Statement, available from \nwww.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/3641/railways-act-2005.pdf\n.\n Periodic Review 2013: Draft Determination of Network Rail’s Output and Funding for 2014-19, available from \nwww.rail-reg.gov.uk/pr13/PDF/pr13-draft-determination.pdf\n. \n"
