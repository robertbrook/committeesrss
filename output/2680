[normal]Code for sustainable homes and the energy efficiency standard for zero-carbon homes consultation: summary of responses
[normal] (November 2010): 
[normal]www.gov.uk/government/consultations/code-for-sustainable-homes-and-the-energy-efficiency-standard-for-zero-carbon-homes
[normal] Based on 50% of the 320 local councils in England adopting a study, and CSEs experience of studies costing an average of £25,000 adding on £5,000 for local councils own staff time. 2012 NHBC research suggests approximately half of local councils have adopted a local renewable energy target:

[normal] Technical guides to the 
[normal]CfSH
[normal] were produced every year between 2006-2010. In addition to this consultation on the Technical Housing Standards Review, Government ran consultations in 2007 and 2010-11. Details of these can be found here: 
[normal]www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/greenerbuildings/sustainablehomes/consultations
[normal] Such as Element Energy 2013 study on ‘Costs of building to the Code for Sustainable Homes’, which drew learning from 5 local authorities who have implemented

[normal] The Merton Rule was the first local planning policy to set a requirement for renewable energy generation in new buildings, developed by Merton Borough Council in 2003. The rule required any new residential development of more than 10 units, or any commercial building over 1,000m
[normal]2
[normal], to generate at least 10% of its energy needs from on-site renewable energy equipment:
