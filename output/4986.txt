[[[Submission by The Captive Animals’ Protection Society, UK]]]

[[[Executive Summary]]]The EFRA Committee has asked for evidence regarding three specific points of interest, as follows:This submission seeks to provide comment with regard to the second and third points only as our organisation does not hold information on the extent of the trade in primates as pets in the UK. It is, however, understood that evidence with regard to the extent of the trade will be submitted by other respondents to this inquiry.Our organisation strongly advocates a complete ban on the trade in, and keeping of, non-human primates privately based on the firm belief that the complex welfare needs of non-human primates cannot be met in private hands.

[[[the Captive Animals’ Protection Society:]]]

[[[ ]]]Founded in 1957, the Captive Animals’ Protection Society (CAPS) is one of the UK’s longest-running charities working to protect animals. Working alongside campaign partners, CAPS has supported the call for a ban on the keeping of primates as pets for a number of years. Members of the CAPS team have long-term experience working with rescued primates as well as with primate conservation organisations worldwide.

[[[Evidence to support a ban on the trade in, and keeping of,]]]

[[[ non-human primates privately]]]Our organisation maintains that:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In light of all of the above, we believe that the trade in, and keeping of, primates privately must be prohibited. It is recognised that this prohibition might be introduced using a number of different mechanisms, which would need to be considered upon their own merits in due course. Whilst it is recognised that some private keepers may differentiate themselves from “pet owners” by virtue of their experience in keeping these animals, we reject any suggestion that exceptions should be made for those keepers in the case that prohibition is brought forward. This assertion is made on the basis that, if primates are inherently unsuited to being kept privately, the experience of the keepers in question is irrelevant. Given that there are estimated to be between 3,006 to 9,017 primates held in private hands at present, it is accepted that a “grandfather clause” may be necessary in the case that any prohibition is brought forward. This may be necessary in order to accommodate those who keep primates privately in standards that are currently deemed to be acceptable in law so as to avoid criminalising the operation of legitimate sanctuaries, seeing licensed zoos being inundated with primates or seeing individual primates euthanized in large numbers. The way in which any grandfather clause might operate, much like the mechanism for introducing any ban, is something which should be considered on its merits in due course.It is recognised that the introduction on a ban on the keeping of primates privately will present some obstacles and complications but we firmly believe that this should not be used as a reason to take no action on this matter. The UK prides itself on being a nation of animal lovers but continuing to allow the keeping of animals with such complex physical, social, emotional and behavioural needs in private hands is to undermine our reputation as a leader in animal welfare protection. Finally, it should be recognised that there are a number of expert organisations in the UK which are willing and able to work with Government in the development and delivery of any ban in the interests of reaching the best possible outcome for the animals involved.January 2014 &#xa0; ICM Research 2013 (Documentation available upon request) RSPCA 2013 (http://www.rspca.org.uk/allaboutanimals/pets/other/primates)
