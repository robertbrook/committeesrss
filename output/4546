[normal]Introduction[bold]The Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment 
[normal](
[normal]http://www.lse.ac.uk/grantham
[normal]) and the Centre for Climate 
[normal]Change Economics and Policy (
[normal]http://www.cccep.ac.uk
[normal]) welcome
[normal] th
[normal]e
[normal] opportunity to respond to this 
[normal]call for evidence by the Energy and Climate 
[normal]Change
[normal] Committee on the “
[normal]IPCC 5
[normal]th
[normal] Assessment Review”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This response draws on
[normal] a number of Grantham Research Ins
[normal]titute publications, including ‘
[normal]Recent and future chang
[normal]es in the global and UK climate’
[normal] by Bob Ward and Naomi Hicks, and a policy briefing note 
[normal]on ‘T
[normal]he UK Climate Change Act
[normal]’
[normal] by Bob Ward, Samuela Bassi and Dimitri Zengheli
[normal]s
[normal] of the Grantham Research Institute
[normal], alongside expert reports from a number of relevant
[normal] organisations
[normal] including the Committee on Climate Change and the Met Office. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Response to select questions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Q1. [bold]How robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical [bold]Science Basis report? Have the IPCC adequately addresses criticisms of previous reports? How much scope is there to question the report’s conclusions?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1. 
[normal]We note that, 
[normal]at the time of the Select Committee’s inquiry, the IPCC has only published a version of
[normal] working group I’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report that has not been fully copy edited. Although the main findings of the report are unlikely to be different in the final version of the report, which is due for publication in January 2014, ther
[normal]e may be some 
[normal]small but significant changes to the text, for instance with respect to carbon emissions budgets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Working group I’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report
[normal] is the most comprehens
[normal]ive 
[normal]review
[normal] of the 
[normal]evidence for the 
[normal]physical 
[normal]science basi
[normal]s of climate change that has ever been written. It has been prepared 
[normal]by 259 scientific experts from 
[normal]universities and research institutes in 39 countries, who have
[normal] reviewed all of the available 
[normal]evidence and research, including thousands of scientific papers
[normal]. More tha
[normal]n 9000 individual 
[normal]scientific pape
[normal]rs are cited within the report. 
[normal]It is also one of the most rigorously reviewed scientific docume
[normal]nts in history, with more than 
[normal]50,000 comments made during a review process for earlier dr
[normal]afts that was made open to 
[normal]all 
[normal]experts around the world.
[normal] 
[normal]The report has been written for the 195 member governments of the IPCC, and represents the most authoritative assessment of the state of knowledge about
[normal] the physical science basis of 
[normal]climate change. It should also inform decis
[normal]ion-making at
[normal] local, regional, national and 
[normal]international level.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. While working group I’s contribution to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report shows increases in knowledge and understanding about the physical science basis for climate change since the publi
[normal]cation in 2007 of the Fourth Assessment Report, the fundamental conclusions are the same: the Earth is 
[normal]warming primarily due to human activities, and there is a high likelihood of a rise in global average 
[normal]surface 
[normal]temperature of much more than 2˚C, and othe
[normal]r very significant changes in the global climate, by the end of this century if annual emissions of greenhouse gases are not sharply reduced.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. The contribution of working group I of the Fifth Assessment Report is the most authoritative report on the 
[normal]physical science basis of climate change that has ever been published. However, in some minor respects, it is already out of date by virtue of the fact that no papers that were accepted after 15 March 2013 for publication have been considered. This is part
[normal]icularly important, for instance, in relation to the so-called recent slowdown in the rise of global average surface temperature.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]. It should also be noted that the contribution of working group I to previous IPCC assessment reports may have under-estimated the pace at which climate change is occurring. Brysse 
[normal]et al.
[normal] (2012) concluded 
[normal]that 
[normal]“
[normal]at least some of the key attributes of globa
[normal]l warming from increased atmospheric greenhouse gases have been under-predicted, particularly in IPCC assessments of the physical science, by Working Group I”
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. It is a matter of some concern that the contribution of working group I to the Fifth Assessm
[normal]ent Report intentionally omitted any explicit consideration of the overall consequences of a rise in global average surface temperature of more than 2˚C, which all governments have agreed s
[normal]hould be avoided. This omission
[normal] is perhaps the biggest shortcoming 
[normal]of working group I’s contribution to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. 
[normal]Following the discovery in 2010 of a small but significant mistake in the contribution of working group II to the Fourth Assessment Report, the IPCC invited the InterAcademy Council
[normal] (IAC) to review its processes and procedures The report of the IAC’s review, published in 2010, did not make any specific criticisms of the contribution of working group I, but made a number of recommendations for improving the preparation of assessment r
[normal]eports. Many of these recommendations were implemented during the compilation of working group I’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal]. T
[normal]he IPCC sought to allow any interested individuals or organisations to participate in the review of early d
[normal]rafts of working group I’s contribution, including a number of so-called climate change ‘sceptics’
[normal]. 
[normal]One of these ‘sceptics’, 
[normal]Alex Rawls, 
[normal]published a draft of working group I’s contribution, in clear breach of the agreem
[normal]ent undertaken by all reviewers, and 
[normal]attempted to misrepresent its contents (see Ward, 2012). The other contributions to the Fifth Assessment Report have also suffered similar breaches in what appears to be a concerted effort by climate change ‘sceptics’ to subvert and undermine the IPCC proc
[normal]ess.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. 
[normal]There was also a co-ordinated effort by the Global Warming Policy Foundation and its supporters to mislead the public and policy-makers through inaccurate articles 
[normal]criticising
[normal] the contribution of working group I after the Summary for Policymakers 
[normal]was published on 27 September. Some of the most blatant efforts are described in Ward (2013a). We note that possibly the most egregious article was produced by Rt Hon Peter Lilley MP, who is a member of the Select Committee and Vice-Chairman of Tethys Petr
[normal]oleum, for ‘City A.M.’ (Ward 2013b). Mr Lilley not only misrepresented the content of the Summary for Policymakers, but also provided a false portrayal of the IPCC and its processes.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q2. To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate [bold]scientists?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]10
[normal]. There is a clear scientific consensus that the Earth is warming due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. There are four main ways in which this consensus manifests itself
[normal] (Ward &amp; Hicks, 2013)
[normal].
[normal] First, t
[normal]he 259
[normal] authors of 
[normal]the contribution of
[normal] 
[normal]IPCC 
[normal]working group I 
[normal]to the Fifth Assessment Report 
[normal]have assessed all of the available research and 
[normal] 
[normal]evidence and concluded that it is 95 per cent probable that most of the war
[normal]ming since 1950 is 
[normal]due to human activities.
[normal] Seco
[normal]nd, a
[normal]nalyses of peer-reviewed journal papers (e.g. Oreskes, 2004; Powell, 2012; Cook et al., 2013)
[normal] 
[normal]show that less than 1 per cent disagree that human activities are th
[normal]e major contributor to climate 
[normal]change.
[normal] Third, s
[normal]urveys (e.g. Doran &amp; Zimmerman, 2009) show
[normal] that more than 97 per cent of climate researchers who are publishing scientific papers agree that human activity is a sig
[normal]nificant contributor to rising 
[normal]global average temperature.
[normal] Fourth, a
[normal]ll of the world’s major scientific organisations, including nation
[normal]al academies of science such as the Royal Society, agree that human activities are the major contributor to recent climate change.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q4. How effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying what is meant by uncertainty in scientific te[bold]r[bold]ms? Wou[bold]ld a focus on risk rat[bold]her than uncertainty be useful?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]11
[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]contribution of working group I to the Fifth Assessment Report
[normal], like 
[normal]its
[normal] contribution
[normal] to 
[normal]the Fourth Assessment Report
[normal], 
[normal]combines quantified levels of confidence 
[normal]with
[normal] probability levels
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]qualifies
[normal] scientific
[normal] statements with a level of likelihood – 
[normal]ranging from
[normal] “virtually certain
[normal]” to “exceptionally unlikely”
[normal] - 
[normal]with associated percentage values
[normal]. 
[normal]Yet, these expressions of likelihood, when cited without the associated percentage values, may no
[normal]t be interpreted in 
[normal]the same
[normal] way by different individuals
[normal] (
[normal]see 
[normal]Budescu 
[normal]et al
[normal].
[normal], 2009).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]2
[normal]. 
[normal]Framing climate 
[normal]change in terms of uncertainties
[normal] rather than risk
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]may 
[normal]create 
[normal]an obstacle to 
[normal]informed 
[normal]decision-making
[normal] 
[normal]about
[normal] climate change
[normal] mitigation
[normal], 
[normal]as it might 
[normal]lead to a misinterpretation that there is no disadvantage in delaying until further certainty is attained
[normal]. 
[normal]Painter (2013
[normal]) 
[normal]s
[normal]uggested
[normal] that
[normal] 
[normal]an argument
[normal] in favour of using the language of risk is that 
[normal]“
[normal]it shifts public debate 
[normal]away from the idea that decisions 
[normal]should be delayed until conclusive proof or absolute certainty is obtained (a criteri
[normal]on that may never be satisfied)
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13. Smith and Stern (2011) discuss the importance of scientists providing information about uncertainty, particularly of possible future
[normal] climate change, in a way that promotes a better understanding by policy-makers of the risks.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q6. Has AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1
[normal]4
[normal]. 
[normal]There has been a 
[normal]campaign by clim
[normal]ate change ‘sceptics’ to mislead the public, journalists and policy-makers about the significance of the 
[normal]lower
[normal] rate of increase in global average surface temperature since 1998 compared with the long-term warming rate since 19
[normal]51
[normal]. IPCC working group I was f
[normal]orced to respond to this campaign by addressing the issue explicitly in its contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report.
[normal] It attributed
[normal] the 
[normal]lower
[normal] rate of warming 
[normal]since 1998 
[normal]mainly 
[normal]to
[normal] the impact of 
[normal]short-term natural factors that mask the warming effec
[normal]t of greenhouse gases, such as 
[normal]an increase in the amount of heat absorbed by the deeper oce
[normal]ans compared with the surface, 
[normal]an increase in the amount of volcanic particles in the a
[normal]tmosphere which block out some 
[normal]sunlight and cause cooling, and a cyclical redu
[normal]ction in the amount of radiation from the sun
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15
[normal]. The contribution of working group I only considered research papers that were accepted before 15 March 2013 for publication. Since that date, new papers have been published which have added to the knowledge and understanding of the apparent lower rate of
[normal] warming since 1998. For instance, a paper by Cowtan and Way, published in November 2013, concluded that the 
[normal]Met Office’s 
[normal]HadCRUT4 record of global average surface temperature has significantly underestimated the rate of warming since 1997.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16
[normal]. It is impo
[normal]rtant to consider the lower rate of warming since 1998 within the context of the longer record of global average temperature. T
[normal]here are many other such tempora
[normal]ry periods of higher and lower 
[normal]rates of warming, and even of cooling, within the temperature re
[normal]co
[normal]rd. For instance, the linear 
[normal]trend in average annual temperature for the 43-year pe
[normal]riod between 1970 and 2012, as 
[normal]recorded in the Met Office’s HadCRUT4 dataset, is +0.165°C per
[normal] decade, but there are shorter 
[normal]15-year periods of lower warming rates, such as 0
[normal].098°C per
[normal] decade between 1979 and 1993, 
[normal]and 0.044°C per decade between 1998 and 2012 
[normal](Ward and Hicks, 2013).

[normal]Annual global averag[bold]e surface temperature 1970-2012[bold]Source: Met Office HadCrut4 dataset, 
[normal]as plotted in Ward and Hicks (2013)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q7. Do the AR5 [bold]Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]17
[normal]. 
[normal]Working group I’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report does not offer an assessment of the economic impacts of cl
[normal]imate change, which will be considered in the contribution of working group II, due for publication in 2014.
[normal] However, working group I does indicate both that both atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and some of the phys
[normal]ical impacts of climate change, such as the reduction in the area of Arctic sea ice, have increased since the publication of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report in 2007.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18
[normal]. Stern (2013) warns that many analyses significantly under-estimate the potential ec
[normal]onomic 
[normal]consequences
[normal] of unmanaged climate change because of their reliance on the outputs of models, inclu
[normal]ding those assessed in working group I’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report, which omit some of the largest risks. Stern (2013) states: “
[normal]Scien
[normal]tists describe the scale of the risks from unmanage
[normal]d climate change as potentially 
[normal]immense. However, the scientific models, because they
[normal] omit key factors that are hard 
[normal]to capture precisely, appear to substantially underesti
[normal]mate these risks. Many economic 
[normal]models add further gross underassessment of risk bec
[normal]ause the assumptions built into 
[normal]the economic 
[normal]modelling
[normal] on growth, damages and risks, 
[normal]come close to assuming directly 
[normal]that the impacts and costs will be modest and close 
[normal]to excluding the possibility of 
[normal]cat
[normal]astrophic outcomes. A new generation of models is
[normal] needed in all three of climate 
[normal]science, impact and economics with a still stronger 
[normal]focus on lives and livelihoods, 
[normal]including the risks of large-scale migration and conflicts.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q8. What implications do the [bold]IPCC’s conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report have for policy-making both nationally and internationally? [bold]&#xa0;[bold]19
[normal]. 
[normal]Since the publication of 
[normal]the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report
[normal], governments have agreed that global emissions of greenhouse gases shou
[normal]ld be reduced urgently in
[normal] order to hold the increase in 
[normal]global average temperature below 2°C
[normal], and perhaps below 1.5˚C,
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] limit the risks of dangerous climate change.
[normal] 
[normal]In addition, Parliament passed the Climate Change Act in 2008, 
[normal]requiring the UK to reduce
[normal] its 
[normal]greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 per cent by 2050, compared with 1990. The UK 205
[normal]0 
[normal]emissions target was set on the basis of interim advice fr
[normal]om members of the Committee on 
[normal]Climate Change (Turner, 2008), who indicated that it would 
[normal]be consistent
[normal] with the task of 
[normal]reducing global annual emissions of greenhouse gases covered by the Kyot
[normal]o Protocol, to about 
[normal]20 billion tonnes of carbon-dioxide-equivalent by 2050, in line wi
[normal]th the goal of limiting global 
[normal]warming to no more than 2°C by 2100, and creatin
[normal]g a low probability of warming of 4°C.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20. Although working group I’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report omits an explicit consideration of the scientific basis for the 2˚C threshold, it does point
[normal] out
[normal], for instance,
[normal] that during the last Ice Age interglacial period, which ended about 116,000 
[normal]years ago, global mean surface 
[normal]temperature was at least 2°C warmer than its late 19th century
[normal] level, global sea levels were 
[normal]about 5 to 10 metres higher than today, and the Greenla
[normal]nd and Antarctic Ice Sheets were 
[normal]much 
[normal]smaller.
[normal] This shows that there are significant risks of very serious changes in the climate, even from global warming of 2˚C, which would have severe social and economic consequences for human populations around the wo
[normal]rld.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]1
[normal]. Working group I’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report
[normal], for the first time in the IPCC’s history, 
[normal]concludes 
[normal]that 
[normal]to have at least a 50 per cent 
[normal]chance of avoiding warming of more than 2°C above pre-industri
[normal]al level, the total cumulative 
[normal]am
[normal]ount of carbon dioxide that is emitted into the atmosphere by
[normal] human activities must be less 
[normal]than about 4440 billion tonnes (equivalent to about 1210 billi
[normal]on tonnes of carbon), or about 
[normal]30
[normal]1
[normal]0 billion tonnes when other greenhouse gases and aerosol p
[normal]articles f
[normal]rom human activities 
[normal]are taken into account.
[normal] 
[normal]The amount of carbon dioxide that was emitted from the late 19th century up to 2011 was between 163
[normal]0
[normal] and 2
[normal]150
[normal] billion tonnes (equivalent to 44
[normal]5
[normal] to 
[normal]585
[normal] billion ton
[normal]nes of carbon), 
[normal]leaving a remaining budget of bet
[normal]ween about 8
[normal]6
[normal]0 and 1
[normal]380
[normal] billio
[normal]n tonnes (equivalent to 2
[normal]35
[normal] to 
[normal]3
[normal]75
[normal] billion tonnes of carbon) for carbon dioxide and all othe
[normal]c
[normal]r emissions from human activities
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q12. What relevance to the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carb[bold]on Budget?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]22. 
[normal]The Committee on Climate Change (2013) has 
[normal]comprehensively assessed this issue
[normal]. It stated: 
[normal]“
[normal]Accounting for the latest evidence, our climate objective implies global emissions pathways similar to those we used previously to guide the UK’s 20
[normal]50 target and fourth carbon budget”. However, it also added: “
[normal]Our pathways have larger cumulative CO
[normal]2
[normal] emissions than the c
[normal]ap suggested by IPCC AR5 for a 
[normal]50% probability of remaining below 2°C. This underlines that
[normal] our pathways should be viewed 
[normal]as a minimum
[normal] level of effort.
