[[[PREAMBLE]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The Reptile &amp; Exotic Pet Trade Association]]]

[[[ ]]](REPTA) was formed in 2005 to represent the interests of the UK reptile &amp; exotic pet industry. Its primary objectives are:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;REPTA predominately works with issues relating to the trade of reptiles and amphibians, but also promotes responsible keeping of so-called exotic pets, including primates and other taxa. The UK has a long tradition of keeping reptiles and amphibians in captivity and with trade, with records dating back to the 1600’s and today in the UK more than a million households keep in excess of eight million reptiles and amphibians. The reptile industry is valued at over two hundred and fifty million £ annually and significant numbers of other non-tradition, or exotic, species are also kept as companion animals.  &#xa0;The trade in reptiles as pets is dominated by captive bred animals, with some 90% of the trade in 2013 comprising of such animals.  Species such as bearded dragons, leopard geckos, corn snakes and royal pythons are now regarded as domesticated species and form part of the mainstay of the general pet trade, no being longer regarded as specialist species. The reptile market is now dominated by relatively few commonly produced species but specialists have also kept over 3,600 species and subspecies, many of which have been bred in captivity, which have been legally traded in the passed ten years.  &#xa0;The trade in primates is not a matter of concern to the day to day work of REPTA, as there is effectively no trade within the pet industry for primates as pets.  Notwithstanding this, theoretically should such a trade exist it would fall under our remit and it is, therefore, appropriate we should make a submission in respect of this investigation.      &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[SUMMARY]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[TRADE IN PRIMATES AS PETS]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1)  In the UK today the ‘trade’ (defined as sale from establishments licensed under the Pet Animals Act or imported for commercial purposes) of primates as pets is nonexistent.  &#xa0;2)  There are thought to be more than 3,000 licensed pet shops in the UK, although at the end of 2013 there was no central record of licenses issued so the precise number is unknown.  As far as a REPTA investigation could determine, there were, however, no establishments licensed to sell primates. &#xa0;3)  The sale of animals from establishments licensed under the Pet Animals Act requires all species to be included on a schedule. If any species (including primates) is sold without having been listed on this schedule, the owner would be in breach of the terms of licence, an offence actionable by the relevant Local Authority. The sale of any primate at an establishment licensed under the Pet Animals Act that has specifically listed the relevant species on its schedule is both permissible and within the law, although constitutes an event sufficiently rare as to be unrecorded in recent history. There are procedures in place to deal with transgressions of existing law and further controls would be disproportionate to the scale of the potential problem (currently estimated as zero).   &#xa0;4)  There has, historically, been a small trade in primates as pets, predominately wild-caught animals imported in the late nineteenth to late twentieth century, but today such a trade is nonexistent.  A report by the RSPCA ‘Primates as Pets published in July 2012 revealed that a survey of pet shops in 2008 showed none sold primates. This research is by no means exhaustive and does not mean there are no pet shops licensed to sell primates, the fact that none are known to either the RSPCA or REPTA is, however, suggestive of that any such trade is negligible to non-existent.       5)  The importation of primates into the UK (and EU) is regulated under EU Council Regulation 338/97: The EU Wildlife Trade Regulations.  All primates are listed on either Annex A or Annex B of these regulations and, thus, require valid CITES documentation (import &amp; export certificates).  The importation of primates for trade as pets is not banned per se, although there is a prohibition and REPTA is unaware of any legally imported trade, either wild-caught or captive-bred, into the UK from third-party countries (i.e. those outside of the EU) since the enactment of Regulation 338/97. &#xa0;6)  There are many private keepers and breeders of primates (number unknown) who produce and occasionally dispose of (sell) surplus animals.  Such activity is outside the auspices of the pet industry and is not licensable under the Pet Animals Act. The pet trade and the Pet Animals Act is specific to the commercial sale of animals from establishments (premises) of animals (primates or otherwise) intended to be kept as pets. The Act focuses on trade, i.e. the act of buying with the intent to re-sell, and specifically excludes the activity of breeding by private keepers. The breeding of companion animals is generally not licensable under the aforementioned Act, with the exception of dogs, breeding of which is regulated by the Breeding of Dogs Act.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[DEFINING WHAT IS A PET?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]7)  Defining what constitutes a pet primate is a fundamental issue that needs to be addressed, as the current situation is entirely ambiguous.  In lieu of a legal definition, REPTA would suggest that a ‘pet primate’ should be defined as an animal kept in isolation from others of its species purely for human companionship and/or entertainment. It was historically common practice to keep primates in this manner but the practice has now fallen into disuse and primates are now kept in purpose-built enclosures in appropriate social groups.&#xa0;8)  There are numerous dictionary definitions of what we understand by the term pet but not specifically pet primate and REPTA sources are unaware of any case law or legal definitions on the issue other then that offered by HMRC in respect of application of Value Added Tax (VAT) which can be found at HMRC Reference: Notice 701/15 (December 2011).  &#xa0;9)  The keeping of non-domesticated animals has become a priority issue for the Animal Rights movement, often using the term ‘exotic pets’.  The reality is that for taxa other than traditional domestic pets (cats &amp; dogs) virtual all species kept by man are exotic, i.e. not of native origin and that the keeping of native species is, in most cases, prohibited. The Animal Rights movement is a very powerful lobby that often masquerades under the banner of animal welfare, although the two are separate ideologies. The keeping of primates is an emotive issue and it is imperative that an animal rights agenda does not cloud the issues pertaining to the private ownership of primates in captivity.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF PRIMATES]]]&#xa0;10)  Under UK, and indeed EU, legislation animals are regarded as chattels, i.e. property, and ownership is, thus, afforded protection as enshrined under the Human Rights Act.  It is, therefore, assumed unrealistic to suggest that private ownership of primates should be banned, but ensure that controls are in place to ensure that the manner in which they are maintained is appropriate to their welfare.&#xa0;11)  The keeping of a solitary primate as a ‘pet’ is already effectively unlawful (illegal) under the Animal Welfare Act, as underpinned by a Code of Practice for primates, “Code of Practice for the Welfare of Privately Kept Non-Human Primates”, published in 2009.   Compliance with this code precludes the keeping of primates as pets, i.e. a solitary animal kept in isolation in an unsuitable environment for human companionship.  &#xa0;12)  Non-compliance with a Code of Practice is not, in itself, an offence, but places the evidential burden on the keeper to demonstrate they are discharging the Duty of Care enforced upon them by the Animal Welfare Act.   REPTA is of the opinion this would be an insurmountable challenge to the keeping of a single primate as ‘pet’ (companion animal) and would, thus, render the keeper liable to prosecution under Section 4 or 9 of the Animal Welfare Act.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT LEGISLATION ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]13)  It is clear that there is already sufficient legislation under the Animal Welfare Act that prevents the inappropriate keeping of primates as pets and that current legislation is adequate and effective. Current legislation is appropriate and proportionate in that it prohibits the inappropriate keeping of primates, but facilitates the responsible private ownership of such animals.  This legislation continues to be used by the RSPCA, and other prosecutors, to take action against inappropriate keeping.  &#xa0;14)  REPTA research suggests that in the past twelve months the RSPCA have successfully secured at least five successful convictions against individuals keeping primates as pets, which is clear and irrefutable evidence that current legislation is working and fit for purpose. We should not, however, confuse successful prosecutions of a few private keepers of ‘pet’ primates as indicative that private keepers of primates are poor as most are maintaining their animals to an extremely high standard. Many other taxa of commonly kept pet species (primarily dogs and cats) are subject to very high levels of successful prosecutions for breaches of the Animal Welfare Act, although there is no suggestion that these species should be the subject of ownership restrictions and/or bans.  &#xa0;15)  If there is any issue it is lack of appropriate enforcement of the current (adequate) legislation.  If the current legislation is, as REPTA would suggest, broadly fit for purpose but not enforced effectively, it is difficult to see how increased legislation without further enforcement resources would be workable.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[COMMENTS &amp; OBSERVATIONS]]]&#xa0;16)  REPTA recently participated in the Working Group which revised Model Standards for Pet Shop Licensing underpinning the Pet Animals Act.  These standards have been substantially amended since the last revision of 1998 and, whilst the WG considered including model standards for trading in primates, dismissed this due to evidence suggesting no such trade existed.&#xa0;17)  The Working Group concluded that there was no evidence to suggest there was any trade in primates by establishments regulated under the Pet Animals Act but, should this prove inaccurate, such guidance could be drafted and incorporated into the revised Model Standards.  &#xa0;18)  REPTA is a member of the Pet Advertising Advisory Group (PAAG) which recently produced a voluntary Code of Practice (Minimum Standards) for internet advertising, launched at a parliamentary reception on the 4th of September 2013.   The issue of advertising of primates on the internet has been discussed within the group, but concluded that a very high percentage of such advertisement are bogus (scams).&#xa0;19)  Further regulation of private primate ownership, if any is needed, must be reasonable and proportionate and what appears to be lacking is hard empirical data that this is necessary. There is a plethora of anecdotal and speculative testimony provided by organisations and individuals opposed to private ownership of primates and the veracity of such evidence should be questioned.&#xa0;20)  Even basic information, such as how many primates kept by private keepers, is unknown, although it is speculated the number of primates kept by private keepers varies from low estimates of 3,000 to 5,000 to as high as 15,000 to 20,000 (or higher). Without such basic information assessing the need for further regulation, such as (perhaps) the licensing of all private owners of primates is at best conjuncture and not based on reliable supporting evidence. Obtaining accurate data on the current number of primates kept by private keepers would be challenging but other pertinent data would be accessible and could be valuable in assessing requirement for further legislation (if any).&#xa0;21)  Data would ideally be collected and collated by an independent body, i.e. not an organisation that campaigns against (or indeed for) private ownership of primates which is, perhaps, a task the Select Committee could consider undertaking during the course of its enquiry.  Data that is eminently available for retrieval from the relevant government departments (local &amp; central) could be compiled for a specific time period (suggest the previous five years) and could include:   &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;22) This data would be of value in establishing the true extent of issues relating to primates as pets, even if it is not possible to quantify in relation to the number of animals kept.   &#xa0;

[[[CONCLUSIONS ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]23)  The fundamental issue is not lack of legislation, it is lack of appropriate enforcement of the legislation due to lack of funding and direction from central government.  Animal welfare is a low priority for Local Authorities, which, whilst regrettable, is understandable when resources are stretched thinly. Legislation governing the private ownership or trade of animals, i.e. The Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976, the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and the Pet Animals Act 1951 are all broadly fit for purpose. Any failure of these Acts is due to problems with enforcement by Local Authorities that are inadequately equipped to fulfil the tasks demanded of them.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]24)  The administration of the aforementioned Acts (and the Zoo Licensing Act) should, therefore, be removed from Local Authority administration and discharged by central government.  Until such time as this happens we shall continue to see inconsistencies and failures in administration of legislation that will compromise the welfare of both primates but other species.&#xa0;&#xa0;12th January, 2014   &#xa0;&#xa0;
