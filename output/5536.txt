[[[ by Oil &amp; Gas UK]]]&#xa0;1. Oil &amp; Gas UK is the leading representative body for the UK offshore oil and gas industry.  Membership is open to all companies active on the UK Continental Shelf and currently stands at more than 400.&#xa0;2. During 2013, our members made capital investment of £ billion and paid £ billion in corporation tax.  The industry supports 450,000 jobs throughout the UK and the indigenous production saves the UK some £32 billion per year in avoided imports.&#xa0;3. There are currently some 72,000 square kilometres of the UK Continental Shelf licensed for oil and gas exploration and production and this area will increase as a result of the recently announced 28th licensing round.  It is essential for the security of future energy supply that the requirements for exploration and production of oil and gas are appropriately balanced with conservation objectives.&#xa0;

[[[Implementing the 27 approved MCZs]]]&#xa0;4. There is little spatial overlap with the 27 approved MCZs and current oil and gas production infrastructure. However, given that there will almost certainly be co-location of MCZs and oil and gas operations in the future, it is essential that lessons are learned through the current implementation.&#xa0;5. We welcome the decision to include the location of the MCZ, the location of features to be protected and the conservation objectives in the designation order. However, the fact that management measures will only be developed post designation remains a significant concern.  Developers need to understand potential risks to their business both at the time of making investment decisions and in managing existing operations. &#xa0;6. The oil and gas industry is global in nature and uncertainty could divert investment to other oil and gas basins at the expense of the UK. &#xa0;7. Where an MCZ is co-located around existing infrastructure, any change to the operation required by new management measures e.g. a reduction in discharges to the marine environment, has the potential to affect the viability of the operation.  This could lead to earlier than anticipated cessation of production.  The reason for this is that an installation is designed to the current and reasonably foreseeable environmental standards, with a design life that could be twenty or thirty years.  Changes to the installation that require retro-fitting of new equipment are not always possible and usually costly.&#xa0;8. Whilst we see the latter situation as unlikely, principally because the installation would have been subject to a robust Environmental Impact Assessment,  we have to consider the scenario where an MCZ is designated on a less than sound evidence base and then as more information is acquired the conservation objective is changed from ‘maintain’ to ‘recover’.  In the worst case this could result in the cessation of activity.&#xa0;

[[[Improving the evidence base]]]&#xa0;9. We remain concerned that much of the evidence base for broad scale habitats is modelled rather than empirically derived through survey.  Our member companies provide a significant amount of data on the biology and chemistry of the seabed in the vicinity of planned or existing operations and we would expect the same level of rigour to be applied during the designation of future MCZs.&#xa0;10. We continue to support the overall objective of an ecologically coherent network of marine protected areas and agree with the staged approach to designation but with the proviso that designations are made on the basis of sound scientific evidence.&#xa0;

[[[Balancing socio-economic and environmental factors]]]&#xa0;11. On the assumption that the future tranches of MCZs will probably be taken from the remaining sites proposed by the regional projects, we have assessed the spatial overlap of the 100 sites with known discoveries of oil and gas, fields under development and fields in production.  There are 30 fields with potential overlap, one of which is the Rough gas storage installation.&#xa0;12. In terms of production, these fields account for approximately 4% of UK oil and 6% of UK gas production.  (If gas from the Rough storage is included this rises to approximately 17%).&#xa0;13. These production figures clearly demonstrate the importance of considering economic factors and the need to consult directly with industry during the designation of MCZs, however, to re-iterate a previous point, without knowledge of management measures it is not possible to make an assessment of the actual economic effect of designation. &#xa0;14. In practice, there should be the requirement for operators of consented activities to be consulted directly during the designation of a co-located MCZ and subsequently, if any changes are proposed post designation.&#xa0;

[[[Future designation process]]]&#xa0;15. The programme of designations, whether in tranches or otherwise, must be clearly articulated so that appropriate input can be made by stakeholders.  The programme should identify how the MCZ process engages with the parallel initiatives in the Devolved Administrations in achieving a coherent network across the UK Continental Shelf as a whole.&#xa0;16. If possible, an indication of an end point to the process, should be indicated i.e. the point at which the network will be deemed to be complete.  Linked to this will be the need for effective guidance on how an operator would include the potential effect of an operation on the network in an environmental impact assessment.&#xa0;27 January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;
