[normal]Written evidence submitted by Carbon Capture and Storage Association (CCS27)[bold]Executive Summary
[normal]The CCSA
[normal] welcomes this inquiry. The development of 
[normal]a vibrant 
[normal]CCS
[normal] industry 
[normal]is
[normal] critically important
[normal] 
[normal]for 
[normal]UK
[normal] climate
[normal], energy and industrial policy
[normal]. However, the deployment of CCS in the UK is 
[normal]facing 
[normal]a number of challenges. This
[normal] submission sets out the 
[normal]CCSA’s views on the 
[normal]current status of the technology
[normal],
[normal] the challenges impacting on de
[normal]ployment and makes a number of recommendations on how CCS can be
[normal] progressed
[normal]. The CCSA would like to emphasise the following points;

[normal]The CCS Cost Reduction Task Force 
[normal]“
[normal]UK gas and coal power stations equipped with carbon capture, transport and storage have clear potential to be cost competitive with other forms of low-carbon power generation, 
[normal]delivering electricity at a levelised cost approaching £100/MWh by the early 2020s, and at a cost significantly below £100/MWh soon thereafter.”
[normal]The Task Force found that there are multiple opportunities to reduce the costs of UK CCS projects based on 
[normal]current technologies.
[normal] 
[normal]These cost reductions largel
[normal]y occur as a result of local effects, e.g. shared infrastructure, and are not 
[normal]solely 
[normal]dependent on global market developments. 
[normal]CCS 
[normal]cost reduction opportunities can be grouped into four key 
[normal]areas

[normal]The Task Force identified a number of actions that are needed in order to deliver these cost reductions
[normal]. The 
[normal]electricity 
[normal]market alone cannot deliver these cost reductions and a number of interventions are required by Government if 
[normal]a cost competitive CCS industry is 
[normal]to 
[normal]be 
[normal]delivered 
[normal]in 
[normal]the UK.
