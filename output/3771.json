"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from Women on Boards UK [CEP0003]&#xa0;&#xa0;\nWomen on Boards UK is a UK-wide \norganisation for women seeking to leverage their professional skills and experience into board and leadership roles.  Our focus is to encourage, inspire and actively support women - from all sectors - to find their own pathway to the boardroom.\n&#xa0;\n Our goal i\ns a measurable and sustainable increase in the number of women on boards and in leadership roles across all sectors in the UK.  We provide a complementary service for charities to advertise board vacancies and support our members to apply for trustee roles\n.  Currently we have 4700 members in the UK. \n&#xa0;\nWomen on Boards UK:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUnder the Charities SORP, charities are already required to disclose in their accounts the number of staff pa\nid over £60,000, in £10,000 bands.  Women on Boards supports extending this requirement to disclose the total amount of employee benefits received by any individual employee paid over £100,000. \n&#xa0;\nThe \n2012 \nWomen Count:\n \nCharity leaders 2012 report provided evidence that – as the sector with the most female CEOs - the charity sector is an important training sector for women, equipping them to move into executive and board ro\nles on the FTSE and in private companies and the public sector.\n&#xa0;\nWomen on Boards does not support a statutory cap on salaries in the charity sector as we believe reducing the pay of CEOs in this sector would further disadvantage already underpaid women wor\nking in this sector, and would lead to a reduction in the caliber of the women seeking the CEO roles with obvious knock-on implications.\n&#xa0;\nThe 2011/2012 annual pay survey of the Association of Chief Executive Officers of Voluntary Organisations reports a pay gap of 16% between male and female chief executives in voluntary bodies with the pay gap rising to almost 30% for some roles.  \n&#xa0;\nWomen o\nn Boards believes that requiring organisations in all sectors to analyse and report their gender pay gap publically, is the single most important step that can be taken towards reducing these inequities.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
