"Written evidence submitted by Bhatt Murphy Solicitors (LAI 0044)&#xa0;&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;Application of the residence test to LASPO&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nImmigration Enforcement and the Residence Test &#xa0;\nImmigration detention\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Case A -  Family Y v Home Office A family with\n two young children\n were detained\n for\n \ntwo\n \nperiods\n \nat\n \nYarl’s\n \nWood IRC in April 2009 for \n11\n \ndays\n \nand September 2009 for 15\n \ndays. The adults are \nforeign \nnationals who met in the \nUK\n.\n \nThe\ny\n were \nseeking leave to remain on the basis of Article 8 and/or the Imm\nigration Rules and \nwould not, therefore, qualify under any exception to the residence test.  \n&#xa0;\nOn t\nwo separate occasions the parent\ns\n’\n immigration applications were refused unbeknown to them and certified, thereby precluding any in country right of appeal.\n On both occasions, without notice and in breach of policy, dawn raids were conducted on the family home. They were told to pack their\n belongings for removal and taken with their children in a caged prison-like van to for detention in \nYarl’s\n Wood Immigration Reception Centre. The children vomited in the van. The second enforcement action took place despite compliance with release conditi\nons.\n&#xa0;\nRemoval\n \nwas halted by a judicial review, which was ulti\nmately settled by consent with the\n \ngrant of \nan in country right of appeal. \nT\nhe family \nwas finally released following an \nopposed application for bail\n.\n&#xa0;\nA claim was brought for\n false imprisonment \nas well as b\nreaches of human \nrights including Articles 3, 5 and 8\n ECHR\n. \nIt settled with\n \nsignificant sum\ns\n \nfor all Claimants for both detentions. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase B - Immigration detention of seriously ill woman for 17 months&#xa0;KB is a 51 year old woman, apprehended at a \nUK\n airport and sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment for drug\n importation. In prison she suffered a stroke leading to paralysis of the right side as a result of which she has permanently limited mobility, eventually able to walk slowly with a stick and paralysis of the right arm. She also suffers a range of other se\nrious medical conditions and is dependent upon a strict medical regime for her survival.\n&#xa0;\nAt the conclusion of her criminal sentence the \nUK\n Border Agency detained KB for deportation despite medical evidence from her treating hospital doctor that she was un\nfit to fly. UKBA spent over a year obtaining its own medical evidence on fitness to travel which eventually confirmed the earlier stated position.\n&#xa0;\nKB spent almost one and a half years in immigration detention at \nYarl’s\n Wood Immigration R\neception Centre. \nShe alleges\n a false imprisonment and a breach of article 5 ECHR given the lack of any imminent removal and the fact that she did not present a risk of re-of\nfending or absconding due to\n her medical condition.\n&#xa0;\nKB would fall foul of the residence test, havin\ng no leave to be in the \nUK\n at any time. \n&#xa0;Case C - Detention due to difficulties in obtaining travel documentationMr D\n \nis not\n lawfu\nlly resident\n in t\nhe \nUK\n and does not\n object to returning to his country of origin. However, there have been significant difficulties in obtaining travel documentation from the relevant High Commission, rendering his return impossible to date. He is effectively stuck. There is a dispute betwe\nen the parties as to the level of Mr D’s co \n-\noperation with the re-documentation process. \n&#xa0;\nHis arrest took place when he went to report to the Home Office pursuant to the conditions of his temporary admission, with which he had been complying for a signif\nicant period. \nHe was \nthen \ndetained under immigration powers\n pending his deportation for a total of \n2.5 years. He was \nreleased following\n an application for bail which was opposed.\n \n&#xa0;\nUse of Force\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Civil remedies for breaches within the criminal justice system&#xa0;&#xa0;Case D - Female prisoner suffering sexual harassment by male prison staff&#xa0;JS was a Thai woman who was\n detained at HMP Holloway for two and a half years pending extradition to the \nUS\n after being stopped in transit at a \nUK\n airport.\n \nShe\n would fall foul of the residence test, having no leave to be in the \nUK\n at any time. \n&#xa0;\nJS suffered on-going sexual \nharassment over many months by two male members of staff. The men exposed themselves\n to her and demanded oral sex, \nordered her to undress in her cell and grabbed at her genitals when she came out of the showers. She was also subject to repeated obscene ver\nbal sexual harassment during this period on frequent occasions.\n&#xa0;\nWhen JS finally reported the events\n internal prison investigations found no case to answer in respect of one officer.\n The second member of staff faced an internal disciplinary hearing over a \nyear later. The allegat\nions of JS were found unproven and \nJS was not informed of the outcome of the hearing for five months.\n&#xa0;\nJS issued proceedings for b\nreaches of the Human Rights Act (articles 3 and 8 ECHR),\n breaches of the investigative duty on the part\n of the prison in the way in which her complaints were handled. \nS\nhe\n also\n claimed sex discrimination under article 14 ECHR and under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 as well as race discrimination due to her treatment being the result of stereotyping of her \nas a Thai woman being a prostitute/ promiscuous. \n&#xa0;\nA settlement of the civil claim was reached at £30,000\n \nwhich included \na series of steps to be taken by the prison as \na result of the lessons learnt, requiring \nthe prison authorities to re-examine the way i\nn which very serious misconduct had been handled.\n&#xa0;\nCase E - Foreign national mother in prison&#xa0;\nBB was a foreign national who gave birth to a baby with disabilities while on remand.  She spoke no English. After her sentence she was informed that the baby would be removed as they did not know if she would be allowed to remain with her baby when she \nwa\ns eventually returned to \nSpain\n.  After taking legal advice it was possible to establish that the Spanish authorities would accept her home to serve her sentence and would allow her to remain with her baby.  The decision was reversed.  Aside from the human \ncosts of an unnecessary separation of mother and child, the cost to the public purse would have been enormous.\n BB would have fallen foul of the residence test because, although an EU citizen, she was not present in the \nUK\n \nas a result of \nexercising EU right\ns and had no other \nright of residence.\n&#xa0;\nCase F - Unlawful arrest and police cautionKA is a 29 year old man from \nBangladesh\n with no previous convictions, cautions or arrests\n. \nKA had been living in the \nUK\n on a spouse visa for less than 12 months\n. His relationship broke down leaving him without leave in the \nUK\n and\n he\n would therefore have fallen foul of the residence test.\n&#xa0;\nKA suffered an assault and attended a police station to report this. Instead of his allegation being dealt with KA was arreste\nd on the basis that his assailant had attended the station a few hours previously and made an allegation of assault against him. \n&#xa0;\nKA consistently denied committing an assault. Officers told him that if he admitted it he could go home but if he did not he \nwould have to stay in custody for two to three months. KA signed a document which he later discovered had been a consent to a police caution.\n&#xa0;\nKA successfully challenged the lawfulness of the caution by way of judicial review proceedings. As a result of hi\ns complaint the officers were disciplined and issued\n \nwith\n \nwritten\n \nwarnings for unprofessional \nbehaviour\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe police communicated incorrect information about the caution to the \nUK\n Border Agency, seriously \njeopardising\n KA’s application for indefinite leave\n to remain. Upon KA’s challenge the information was rectified.\n&#xa0;\nThe claim settled for £20,000 plus an apology. KA was subsequently granted indefinite leave to remain. \n&#xa0;\nCase G - Death in custody WW was a 32-year old man from the \nRepublic\n of \nIreland\n. He ha\nd a history of drug, alcohol and mental health problems, including self harming. WW was arrested in \nLondon\n and remanded in custody pending extradition to the \nRepublic\n of \nIreland\n.\n&#xa0;\nOn arrival at HMP Brixton, WW was displaying signs of alcohol / drug withdra\nwal and referred by a doctor for a mental health assessment which never took place. During five weeks’ detention WW was never seen by a member of the mental health outreach team, despite two referrals being made, nor by the substance misuse team. When he r\neported that he would rather be extradited dead than alive he was made subject to self harm procedures which were withdrawn within 24 hours and he was found hanging the following morning.\n&#xa0;\nAn inquest jury found that WW hanged himself whilst the balance of \nhis mind was disturbed and that his death was contributed to by neglect.\n&#xa0;\nWW’s family were citizens of the \nRepublic\n of \nIreland\n and therefore not lawfully resident in the \nUK\n. A claim was brought under the Human Rights Act for breach of article 2 ECHR, the \nright to life, which was settled for £15,000.\n&#xa0;\nVictims of trafficking &#xa0;\nCase H - Unrecognised trafficking victimAS\n is\n \na\n \n19\n \nyear-old\n \nNigerian\n \nnational\n \nand\n \na\n \nvic\ntim\n \nof\n \ntrafficking,\n \nforced\n \nlabour\n \nand physical\n \nabuse\n \nat\n \nthe\n \nhands\n \nof\n \nher\n \naunt,\n \nher\n \naunt’s\n \nhusband\n \nand\n \nher\n \nmaternal\n \ngrandmother. AS’s aunt brought her to the \nUK\n in 2007 where she subjected her to sustained physical abuse. In 2009 AS reported the abuse\n \nto\n \nher\n \nteachers\n \nand local Social\n \nServices who sent a social worker to speak to AS but took no further steps to investigate the abuse. In 2012 AS reported the abuse \nto the police who closed the investigation a week later. AS claims violation of her rights pursuant to Articles 3 and 4 ECHR, on the basis that the police and social services have failed to protect her from inhuman and degrading treatment and from being he\nld in servitude.\n&#xa0;\nIn September 2012 the Home Office decided that there were reasonable grounds to believe that AS was a victim of trafficking. She then began a claim for asylum. She has a strong connection with the \nUK\n by virtue of being a victim of abuse i\nn the \nUK\n over a five-year period. Nevertheless AS would appear to fall foul of the residence test because the reasonable grounds decision was not made until after the commencement of her civil claim and her claim for asylum was brought after that decision.\n Had the civil claim been postponed until after the decision the limitation period under the Human Rights Act would have expired.\n&#xa0;\nConclusion&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n \nThese detentions occurred prior to the coalition government’s change in policy in 2010 (which reduced but did not end the detention of children under immigration powers).\n A wealth of material regarding the harm caused to children by these practices is available in the public domain. It includes reports such as ‘State Sponsored Cruelty’ by Medical Justice in 2010 which records, inter alia, children experiencing the use of \nforce themselves, children witnessing the self-harm and suicide attempts of others, witnessing their parents’ mental health deteriorate and suffering deterioration in their own physical and mental health.
