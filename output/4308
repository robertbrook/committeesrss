[normal]Written evidence submitted by James Painter[bold] (IPC0044)[bold]1. The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (RISJ) is part of the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Oxford.  It was established in 2006. The RISJ aims to serve as a leading forum for a productive engagement be
[normal]tween scholars from a wide range of disciplines and the practitioners of journalism.  It aims to bring the depth of academic scholarship to major issues of relevance to the practice of the news media. 
[normal]2. The RISJ regularly publishes reports and books on v
[normal]arious issues affecting the media.  On the specific issue of climate change, 
[normal]James Painter 
[normal]has published three recent works:  
[normal]Summoned by Science: Reporting Climate Change at Copenhagen and Beyond
[normal] (2010); 
[normal]Poles Apart: the international reporting of climate
[normal] scepticism 
[normal](2011); and 
[normal]Climate Change in the Media:

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]risk and uncertainty

[normal] 
[normal]3
[normal]. This submission 
[normal]draws on the research contained in 
[normal]Climate Change in the Media
[normal], which includes 
[normal]detailed 
[normal]discussion of the way the last round of IPCC reports in 2007 were reported 
[normal]around the world
[normal].  It focuses on the way uncertainty and risk were conveyed in around 350 articles in the print media in 18 newspapers in six countries, including the UK, with a com
[normal]bined readership of 15 million.  The book also includes a lengthy discussion of the different types of uncertainties surrounding climate change, and the possible advantages of framing the issue as one of risk management.
[normal]4. In October 2013, the RISJ also p
[normal]ublished another study on risk and uncertainty reporting in climate change and other sectors like health, which summarised what we know about the particular challenges of communicatin
[normal]g such difficult issues for the general public.
[normal] (Ashe
[normal],
[normal] October 2013)
[normal]  Thi
[normal]s publication drew on a conference held the previous year on the same topic which drew together academics, scientists and practitioners from different fields. 
[normal]5[bold]. The committee asks: [bold]How effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying[bold]&#xa0;[bold]what i[bold]s meant by uncertainty in scientific terms? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?[bold]6. 
[normal]The first point to make is 
[normal]that the 
[normal]Working Group-1 (
[normal]WG-1
[normal]) 
[normal]report of 
[normal]the Fifth Assessment Report (
[normal]AR5
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]explicitly 
[normal]contained a large number of uncertaint
[normal]ies 
[normal]about climate change 
[normal]in its Summary for Policy M
[normal]akers (SPM).  The draft version contained 
[normal]the word 
[normal]‘
[normal]uncertain
[normal]ty’
[normal] or 
[normal]‘
[normal]uncertaint
[normal]ies’
[normal] 
[normal]42 times in just 31 pages
[normal], although this was reduced to 
[normal]36
[normal] by the time the final
[normal], shorter
[normal] version was issued. (Doyle
[normal], 
[normal]September 
[normal]2013
[normal])
[normal]7.  
[normal]Laying out these uncertainties is the appropriate task of such a report and reflects the way 
[normal]the way climate science is conducted
[normal].  But 
[normal]there are several problems when communicating 
[normal]such 
[normal]scientific uncertainties to a wider audience, whe
[normal]ther they are policy makers, the media, or the wider public. 
[normal] More resources, training and 
[normal]analysis need 
[normal]to 
[normal]be directed at 
[normal]thinking through 
[normal]and implementing 
[normal]effective communication a
[normal]bout uncertainty 
[normal]by climate scientists and other bodies.  
[normal]One key obstacle
[normal] remains that the IPCC still only employs two professional communicators. 
[normal]8.  
[normal]If by ‘effective’ 
[normal]in the question 
[normal]we mean ‘improving understanding’, then there is substantial evidenc
[normal]e that scientific uncertainty can be
[normal] a difficult concept to grasp. 
[normal] It is o
[normal]ften misunderstood by 
[normal]the general public who can 
[normal]interpret it to 
[normal]imply complete, rather than relative, lack of knowledge
[normal] – or in other words, ignorance
[normal].
[normal]   
[normal]Many fail to make the distinction between 
[normal]what some call 
[normal]‘school science’, which 
[normal]is 
[normal]a
[normal] source of solid
[normal] facts and reliable understanding
[normal], and ‘research science’ where uncertainty is engrained and is often the impetus for further investigation. 
[normal] (Painter, 2013)
[normal]9.  Research carried out both in the USA and the UK suggests that messages of uncertainty too can 
[normal]be an obstacle to
[normal] public engagement
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]If scientists constantly talk about uncertainty, often the response of the listener is not necessarily apathy but lapsing into an unhappy situation of not knowing how to proceed, and therefore discounting or dodging th
[normal]e problem.  Or some can even get angry when scientists don’t know things.  (Shuckburgh 
[normal]et al, 
[normal]2012)
[normal]10.  The way the IPCC reports present uncertainties using ranges of probabilities and assigning confidence levels has also been shown to be problematic.  It
[normal] is highly laudable that the scientists are attempting to quantify the uncertainties
[normal] to help decision making
[normal], but there may well be a mismatch with public understanding unless these concepts are clearly explained.
[normal]11. For example, research in the USA 
[normal]about
[normal] the communication of the 2007 IPCC reports strongly suggests that there can be a 
[normal]big discrep
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]ancy between the meaning the IPCC intended, and the con
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]clu
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]sion people actu
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]ally drew.  In particular, they found that 
[normal]the public consistently misinterpret the IPCC’s probabilistic statements, and usually in a ‘regressive’ way, or in other words, less extreme than intended 
[normal]by 
[normal]the authors of the reports.  So for example, when the I
[normal]PCC writes that ‘many changes in the global
[normal] climate system during the 21
[normal]st
[normal] century &lt;…&gt; would 
[normal]very likely
[normal] be larger than those observed during the 20
[normal]th
[normal] century’, the IPCC intends this to mean more than 90% probability, whereas the typical respondent interpreted this to mean a 65-75% probability. 
[normal](Bu
[normal]descu et al, 2009)
[normal]12. Other criticisms of the IPCC’s portrayal of uncertainties are that it is too complicated; 
[normal]too 
[normal]confusing (because the intervals overlap); links numbers to words 
[normal]which can also be an impediment to understanding
[normal]; and ignores affect (how
[normal] people feel about what they are reading).
[normal]  (Ashe 2013, quoting Professor Chris Rapley)
[normal]1
[normal]3
[normal].  It is not clear that even the expression ‘it is 95 per cent certain that humans are mostly to blame for temperatures that h
[normal]ave climbed since 1951’ is well 
[normal]understo
[normal]od.  In the context of this statement, one IPCC author was asked on the BBC by the presenter 
[normal]on the day of the release of WG-1 ‘
[normal]what the other 5 per cent of scientists believed
[normal]?’
[normal].  In other words, there was a confusion between what the authors of the
[normal] WG-1
[normal] 
[normal]report collectively had concluded 
[normal]was true 
[normal]with a very high degree of certainty and what percentage of scientists were in agreement with the statement. 
[normal]14. More explanation 
[normal]is 
[normal]needed about what the phrase ’95 per cent
[normal] certain
[normal]’ means
[normal].   Few people may know
[normal] that such an expression in the scientific world is often taken as a gold standard for ‘certainty’ and can be likened to the degree of confidence scientists have in decades’ worth of evidence that cigarettes are deadly.  (Borenstein, September 2013)
[normal]15
[normal].  A
[normal]nother 
[normal]problem with 
[normal]highlighting the scientific uncertainties
[normal] is that 
[normal]some j
[normal]ournalists 
[normal]or writers of opinion pieces in the media 
[normal]report the uncertainties extensively
[normal], or misreport them, in order to cast doubt on the science
[normal], the IPCC
[normal] or the implications of it.  S
[normal]ome media organisations may play 
[normal]them up to follow an editorial line of justifying not taking action on curbing greenhouse gas emissions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16
[normal].  
[normal]The RISJ 
[normal]study of the way the 2007 IPCC reports were reported in the print media 
[normal]around the world showed that the media were not very good at explaining how the IPCC measured uncertainty. About 40 per cent of the articles included the IPCC concepts of likelihood and confidence levels but only 15 per cent included an explanation of what
[normal] they actually meant 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- such as 'very likely' meaning more than a 90 per cent probability. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](We are in the process of studying the 2013 
[normal]IPCC 
[normal]report, so we cannot tell yet how widely these concepts were reported this time around).
[normal]17
[normal]. 
[normal]Journalists 
[normal]interview
[normal]ed for the study 
[normal]gave lots of good reasons to explain this - such as readers or viewers not liking or understanding numbers - or the difficulties of concepts such as 'medium confidence'. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some of them agreed that 
[normal]one of the essential challenges remains to 
[normal]explain to a g
[normal]eneral public that uncertainty (i
[normal]n a scientific context
[normal])
[normal] does not mean ignorance, and uncertainty can be quantified, particularly to help decision-making.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18
[normal].  
[normal]There is a growing body of literature suggesting that risk language may be a good, or at least a less bad, way of communicating climate change to 
[normal]policy makers and 
[normal]the general public.   Many argue that when compared to the messages of disaster or uncertain
[normal]ty that often surround climate change, 
[normal]risk is far from being a panacea, but it does offer a more sophisticated and apposite language to have the discussion in and a more helpful prism through which to analyse the problem.  
[normal]1
[normal]9
[normal]. One of the arguments in fav
[normal]our of using risk language is that for policy makers, it shifts the debate away from what would count as conclusive proof or overwhelming certainty before taking action, towards an analysis of the comparative costs and risks of different policy options (in
[normal]cluding doing nothing).  
[normal]20
[normal]. 
[normal]Another is that risk is an essential part of everyday experience, including the worlds of insurance, health and investment.   Many people have to deal with it daily and manage it in different ways: most people in the developed
[normal] world take out house insurance against the low-probability, very high-impact event of a fire.  Patients 
[normal]are increasingly familiar with the concept of the risks and benefits of different health treatments
[normal] (
[normal]though they rely on trusted intermediaries to help
[normal] them 
[normal]to 
[normal]navigate the risk
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Investors constantly use the language of risk, and one top UK banker at HSBC reacted to the 
[normal]WG-1 report
[normal] by describing climate change as 
[normal]essentially 
[normal]an ‘issue of strategic risk management’.  
[normal]And s
[normal]ome of the risk assessments people make are on the same timescale as possible climate impacts – for example, taking out a pension policy into which they pay for 40 years. 
[normal]21.  It is certainly the case that risk language is 
[normal]now 
[normal]often 
[normal]being 
[normal]used by politici
[normal]ans and other science communicators.  By risk language, we mean such 
[normal]every day phrases 
[normal]'taking out an insurance policy',
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]loading the dice'
[normal] 
[normal]or 'playing Russian roulette with the climate'. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]David Cameron, Michael Bloomberg and Lord Nick Ste
[normal]r
[normal]n have all recen
[normal]tly used such language as a helpful way of describing the problem and the need to take action. 
[normal] Lord Ste
[normal]r
[normal]n for example 
[normal]argues that sceptics have to 
[normal]show 
[normal]they have high confidence the planet is going to experience only the lower end of possible temperature 
[normal]increases for them to make their case that it is not necessary to take action to minimise climate risks.
[normal]22. 
[normal]Risk concepts in a narrow sense of assigning probability levels to adverse consequences are important for 
[normal]a 
[normal]better understanding
[normal] of climate science
[normal].   For example, c
[normal]limate models can now evaluate how much man-made climate change may have made an extreme weather event like a severe flood 
[normal]or drought 
[normal]more likely.  Such risk assessments usually include probability levels, and what degree of confidence sc
[normal]ientists have in their findings.   
[normal]23.  However, even though 
[normal]risk 
[normal]language 
[normal]and concepts 
[normal]should be 
[normal]generally 
[normal]welcomed, a number of caveats should be made.  
[normal]First, some metaphors work better than others, and need to be constantly tested.  ‘Loading the dice
[normal]’ for example, has been shown to work well in the USA, but not so well in the UK where the practice of playing dice is not so widespread.  (Shuckburgh
[normal] et al
[normal], 2012)
[normal]Secondly, there is little research done with focus groups on how 
[normal]they react to risk language and concepts about climate change, in terms of understanding, engagement and behaviour change.  
[normal]Intuitively 
[normal]many observers may 
[normal]feel that risk language 
[normal]w
[normal]ould work with a wider audience, who are accustomed to risk from the worlds 
[normal]of insurance, betting, health and investment. However, there's a need to test this more. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Moreover, many people may find the numerical assignment of probabilities to possible risks difficult to understand or use as a basis for action. 
[normal]Thirdly, it 
[normal]understa
[normal]ndable that the authors of report on the physical science
[normal] (WG-1) 
[normal]sh
[normal]ied
[normal] away from using risk language.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]They argue that they prefer to use 
[normal]‘
[normal]likelihoods
[normal]’
[normal] as it is a more neutral and quantifiable language; they say risk on the other hand is a more qualitative
[normal] language and implies only bad outcomes whereas some outcomes from climate change may be beneficial to a limited extent.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]4
[normal]. 
[normal]However, t
[normal]here is already evidence that 
[normal]the Working Group Two 
[normal](WG-2) 
[normal]report on climate impacts will probably have much more risk l
[normal]anguage in it, as the IPCC 
[normal]2012 
[normal]report on extreme weather events did. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](Doyle,
[normal] November
[normal] 2013) 
[normal]This is in part explained by the different science disciplines involved, but also by the greater acceptance that the impact of extreme weather events are likely t
[normal]o be negative, and therefore 'risky' in the sense of a negative outcome.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]5
[normal].  Finally, It is worth drawing 
[normal]more 
[normal]on the literature and practical ex
[normal]perience of climate scientists o
[normal]n how to communicate the uncertainties effectively.  Many climate scientists 
[normal]used to dealing with the media and policy makers stressed that they 
[normal]have 
[normal]found it helpful to start with what they were very sure about - for example, that temperatures are going up, that it's largely caused by human activity and that many of the impacts ar
[normal]e likely to be negative - before explaining the areas of uncertainty. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]6
[normal].  There is also a lot of work being 
[normal]done in general in the media on the use of info
[normal]-
[normal]graphics in expressing risk and uncertainty around climate science and other scientific issues. T
[normal]here are already some good examples of representing risk and uncertainty
[normal] 
[normal]- and much more could be done. In many cases, visual presentations of uncertainty can be better than text for 
[normal]effective communication and 
[normal]public understanding.
