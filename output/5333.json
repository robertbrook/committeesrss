"              \n              \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nCapital Traffic Management Limited\n (CYS0139)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nCapital Traffic has substantial \nUK and international experience in all transportation modes a\nnd of the interfaces among them, including pedestrian and cycle planning.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nIn our submission to the APPCG Inquiry, \nGet Britain Cycling\n, we focused on \nthe \nthree \ncomplementary \nissues\n \nthat \nwe \nhad \nidentif\nied\n as being critical to t\nhe future of cycling in Britain, \nviz\n…\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n1.2.1\n              \nthe provision of cy\ncling infrastructure\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n1.2.2\n              \nsharing roadspac\ne with other traffic\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n1.2.3\n              \nrights of way\n \nand safety \n&#xa0;\n              \nWe identified\n the need to change attitudes and \nbehaviour as \nan \nessential\n pre-requisite to the growth of walking and cycling\n, and explored how best such \nchange\ns\n \nmay be leveraged.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nOur submission concluded…\n&#xa0;\n1.3.1\n              \nCapital Traffic does not accept that sufficient attitudinal and behavioural change \nhas occurred or will occur by the provision of dedicated cycling and walking infrastructure.\n&#xa0;\nIn any case, the limited availability of finance will mean that would never happen to any widespread extent anyway.  We must recognise that segregated cycleways a\nre and will be exceedingly helpful in many places, but that cyclists are everywhere.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.3.2\n              \nCapital Traffic does not accept that attitudinal and behavioural change will occur through exhortation to share roadspace.  \n&#xa0;\nSelf-interested motorists may continue to fail to take adequate notice of other road-users – to many, they are simply in the way.  However, the simple message of Share the Road would have resonance if accompanied by legal liability.\n&#xa0;\n1.3.3\n              \nCapital Traffic \nbelieves that attitudinal and behavioural change will take place only if powerfully reinforced by law.  \n&#xa0;\nWe are convinced that the legal protections \nwe \noutlined [\nrefer below\n]\n \nwould prompt both an immediate change in driver behaviour and subsequently the t\nake-up of walking and cycling.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.3.4\n              \nCapital Traffic concludes that the primary pre-requisite to enable walking and cycling in Britain to flourish is to change the law to give strong legal protections to the most vulnerable of our road-users.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nWe\n regret to note that the otherwise very good report from the APPCG did not recommend any changes in the law.\n&#xa0;\n              \nWe have been given to understand that were any legislation brought forward, there would be moves \nby some Members of Parliament \nto \nmake cycle helm\nets compulsory\n, as some sort of \notherwise \nill-advised \nquid pro quo\n.  While we would have no objection were such a restriction applied to cyclists under 16 (though the impact of the requirement is likely to be \ncosmetic and \nnegligible in terms of injury prev\nention\n, and a recommendation would be prefer\nable\n), \nwe consider that\n that\n would be a highly retrograde step to apply to all cyclists, and \nlikely to \nrestrict future cycling growth\n.\n&#xa0;\n              \nThis should not have been a reason for avoiding sensible legislation howeve\nr, particularly in respect of rights of way and legal liability.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n              \nWe appreciate that much \npublic\n concern has arisen after the recent \ntragic \ndeaths of cyclists in London, which \ngives urgency to\n the present Inquiry.\n&#xa0;\n              \nBelow, we have attempted a response to the question \nwhat can be done?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nThe understandable \npublic \ndemand is for action now, a quick-fix, an immediate reduction in cycling casualties.\n&#xa0;\n              \nWith due respect\n to the Committee\n, \nCapital Traffic contend\ns\n that proposals for…\n&#xa0;\n- \n              \nbetter training and advice for drivers and cyclists\n&#xa0;\n- \n              \nbetter enforcement of the law applying to drivers and cyclists\n&#xa0;\n-\n              \nbetter vehicle and road infrastructure\n&#xa0;\n              \n…are unlikely to have more than \nlimited and\n/\nor \nlong-term effects.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nNotwithstanding the \nabove, we recommend that more \ninnovative use is made of the many electronic displays now commonplace in cities and larger towns to offer safety advice\n and other guidance\n.\n&#xa0;\n              \nAt present, the \ndisplays are eithe\nr blank, or the \nsame hackneyed messages appear constantly, and tend to be ignored.\n  A communication opportunity is being missed.\n&#xa0;\n              \nWhen operational, t\nhe display\ns\n do not \ngenerally \nappear to be sufficiently reactive to real-time changes\n.  I\nt is rare that tra\nffi\nc disruption is indicated in cities (as distinct from on motorways).  Usually, they show \nroad closures next week\n, or some such.\n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nIn pursuit of a rapid response to public concern, Capital Traffic reiterates its view that dramatic \nlegislative \naction is required.  \n&#xa0;\nIf we wish to encourage walking and cycling, the fear and insecurity that many have must be eliminated.  \nTo achieve that change in mindset\n requires \nthe backup of the law\n for optimal e\nffectiveness\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe need to change the law to give better protection to both pedestrians and cyclists.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nWithout the legal protections that pedestrians and cyclists have across most of mainland Europe, the Active Travel movement will be stymied in the UK.  \n&#xa0;\nWhile \nlarge amounts of public funds\n may be \nspent on infrastructure, it will always be insufficient to give people the confidence and courage to walk and cycle on their own streets.  \n&#xa0;\nWe need to change the law and create a climate wherein pedestrians and cyclists feel safe on \nall\n streets, not just \nwhere dedicated infrastructure is in place.\n&#xa0;\nThis means \na change from \nvulnerable users being provided with space at the discretion of vehicle users, as now, \nto where \nthe latt\ner \nis \nmandated to provide it.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nWe propose a short Bill to amend the Transpor\nt Act which focuses on the rights of way and legal liability, and nothing else.  Anything more would unnecessarily delay or halt any legislation.  \n&#xa0;\nWe urge the Transport Committee to \nensure\n a fast passage through the House, while at the same time facilita\nting a debate on the issues in the Bill only.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nIt should be re\nc\nognised \nthat if \none \ntake\ns\n the number of KSIs for pedestrians and cyclists in any on\ne year (assuming all of them \nmad\ne a claim for damages, injury or loss) divide\nd\n by the number of licensed \ndrivers\n, a very small percentage \nwould result.  Few \ncar drivers would be impacted by th\ne proposed \nchange\ns\n. \n&#xa0;\n              \nNonetheless, the changes would be salutary.\n&#xa0;\nSharing the Road in New Zealand\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nOur \npreferred Bill would contain the following provisions…\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n.1\n              \nthat\n \nall \nusers of \nh\nighways, cycleways, walkways and off-routes be required to recognise the rights of all other users\n,\n \nand to share \nthat\n facility\n in a safe \nand courteous \nmanner\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1.2\n              \nthat when\n a powered vehicle passes a cyclist, \na minimum passing distance of 1m between the \nvehicle \nand the \nbicycle \nis observed\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n.3\n              \nthat when a cyclist passes a pedestrian or horse and rider, a minimum passing \ndistance\n of 1m between the bicycle and the other road-user is observed\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1.4\n              \nthat, \nin the event of \na \ncollision\n with a \npedestrian\n, \nlegal liability \nrests with the vehicle \nuser, cyclist\n or horse-rider in all cases where th\nere is no overwhelming evidence\n to the\n \ncontrary\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n.4\n              \nthat \nthe law be clarified \n(in the Bill) \nand strengthened in favour of pedestrians, and standardised for all types of road crossings\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n.5\n              \nthat \nthe rights of way of pedestrians and people in wheelchairs \ntake precedence\n…\n&#xa0;\n- on all footways\n&#xa0;\n- on cycleways\n&#xa0;\n- in shared space\n&#xa0;\n- on driveway crossings \n&#xa0;\n- once they have stepped \noff the \nfootway\n on to the \ncarriageway\n at junctions\n&#xa0;\n- on all formal\nised pedestrian\n crossings\n&#xa0;\n-\n at light-controlled intersections\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n.6\n              \nthat\n Local Traffic Authorities reduce the waiting time for pedestrians and people in wheelchairs at light-controlled intersections\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n.7\n              \nthat, in the event of a\n collision with a \ncyclist\n, \nlegal liability for collisions rests with \nthe vehicle user \nor \nhorse-rider\n,\n in all cases where there is no overwhelming evidence\n \nto the contrary\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1.8\n              \nthat all left-turning vehicles be required to give way to any cyclists within 50m back from the intersection\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n.9\n              \nthat \nthe rights of way of cyclists on designated cycleways be \ncircumscribed by those \nof \npedestrians and equestrians  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n.10\n              \nthat the default maximum speed limit in \ntown centres\n and on all non-arterial highways in residential areas becomes \neither 30 or 35km/\nh (18.7 or 21.8mi/h) \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nClearly, a new range of offences would be created by the above\n changes\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe note the apparent lack of effectiveness of the current penalties in achieving behavioural change, despite often being draconian \nwhere\n maxima are applied.\n  The exception seems to be the requirement for re-training.\n&#xa0;\nWe consider that there should be new emphasis on penalties that affect vehicle use, including for those who use their vehicle for their employment.  It is often the latter, t\nhe archetypal \nwhite van men\n and other commercial drivers, who appear the most immune to the law.  They are often \nobserved\n using their cellphones while driving, for example.\n&#xa0;\nLimits on distance travelled, higher insurance premiums, restricting licences to t\nimes of the day\n \nand/or weekdays \netc should all be considered.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nThe distances and speeds mentioned above are deliberately in metric to recognise\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n- the unnecessary use of both Imperial and metric systems in the UK\n&#xa0;\n- the\n familiarity that younger people have with metric rather than Imperial\n measurements\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n- the number of European and other foreign drivers on UK roads.\n&#xa0;\nThe Department for Transport should be encouraged to \nmetricate \nthe transportation system \nwithout further\n delay, as most other sectors have.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nCapital Traffic note\ns\n the e\nxperience \nof\n The Netherlands in the 1970s\n that shows\n that cycling was not widely taken up until \nsimilar\n legal protections were in place.  \n&#xa0;\nIn France\n, since the passage of \na stricter liability regime in 1985, bicycle safety has improved markedly. \n  A\nccording to OECD statistics\n (\n2012\n)\n, the fatality rate for cyclists has decreased by \n66 per cent since 1990\n.\n&#xa0;\nWhere The Netherlands \nand France were \nthen, Britain is now.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nThe understandi\nng one’s responsibilities while\n in charge of a potential\nly\n lethal weapon when sharing the road with other more vulnerable road users would be greatly enhanced\n by the changes we propose\n.  We are confident these \nwould \nthen \nstart to change beha\nviour and eventually culture.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4\n.3\n              \nCapital Traffic sincerely regrets the \ntragic and \ncontinuing loss of life on our highways\n.  \nWe consider that the balance has long been too much in favour of powered traffic to the detriment of our people, towns and citie\ns.  It is time this imbalance \nwas\n corrected in favour of pedestrians and cyclists.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nWe \nurge the Committee to recommend a prompt and meaningful response as well as a long-term strategy to the Government, not excluding legislation as \nproposed in this \nsubmission, to better protect pedestrians and cyclists.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n_____________________________\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAcknowledgement\n              \nOur thanks to Rod Mitchell of \nCycle Law Scotland\n for contributions to this submission.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
