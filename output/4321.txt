[[[Introduction]]]1.1              Waitrose welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Environmental Audit Committee’s inquiry into the sustainability of measures to reduce the use of plastic shopping bags.  The views represented are the views of Waitrose supermarkets, a division of the John Lewis Partnership.&#xa0;1.2              Waitrose believes that a 5p charge on single use bags will reduce bag consumption as consumers begin to change their behaviour as a result of having to pay for every bag.  &#xa0;1.3              Since the introduction of charging in Wales in October 2011, Waitrose has seen a reduction of 76 per cent of single use bags.&#xa0;1.4              Providing a free, more sustainable bag is likely to lead to increased usage, which could reverse falls in consumption as consumers begin to fall back into old habits. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[background]]]2.1              Our understanding is that the existing types of biodegradable and oxo degradable bags would not be exempt from the charge. Currently, only paper would be exempt and as WRAP have reported, whilst coming from a renewable source, paper requires significantly more energy to manufacture and transport than plastics and also have limited reuseability. 2.2              We also understand that industry has been tasked with identifying a new type of biodegradable material that overcomes the main issues already identified namely: contamination of recycling stream, confusing consumers and the potential impact on existing consumer behaviour.  Our response is therefore based on the knowledge currently available.

[[[The likely change in the number of bags discarded and any benefits for biodiversity and the environment]]]

[[[Changes in number of bags discarded]]]3.1              Since charging in Wales was introduced on ALL SINGLE USE BAGS in October 2011, Waitrose has seen a reduction of 76 per cent of single use bags.  This supports the wider report produced by WRAP earlier this summer (UK Voluntary Carrier Bag Monitoring – WRAP July 2013).&#xa0;3.2              We believe a 5p charge on single use bags will reduce bag consumption as consumers start to change their behaviour as a result of having to pay for every bag.&#xa0;3.3              If there was a free bag available with more ‘sustainable’ credentials, the likely increase in usage could reverse falls in consumption as consumers began to fall back into old habits.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[benefits for biodiversity and the environment]]]3.4              The main problem associated with single use bags is the generation of litter.3.5              According to WRAP’s research, we know the majority of households (65%) reuse their single use bags as bin liners. This would infer that the bags are either sent to landfill or for incineration and thus energy recovery.&#xa0;3.6              Some consumers will recycle their bags, we offer recycling facilities in our shops, we then reuse the plastic as part of our closed loop initiatives.  &#xa0;3.7              By imposing a charge on ALL single use bags, we know from evidence in Wales this results in a significant reduction of bags in circulation, therefore a charge on ALL bags would contribute towards a reduction in litter.&#xa0;3.8              A charging exemption on biodegradable and degradable bags would result in an increase in bag consumption.&#xa0;3.9              These would still end up in either landfill or incineration as consumers will continue to use them as bin liners. Biodegradable bags (paper/natural materials) are not designed to degrade in anaerobic landfill conditions and could release methane under such conditions.&#xa0;3.10              Biodegradable and degradable bags should not enter the recycling stream as they contaminate the recycled content and therefore are not suitable for recycling.&#xa0;3.11              The only benefit of a biodegradable bag therefore, is with regards to litter, however existing types of bio (plastic) bags still take years to decompose. We need to be changing behaviour not condoning the discarding of bags into the environment with the hope they will break down before they cause damage to marine life or unsightly litter.

[[[the impact on the use of biodegradable bags and the impact on plastics recycling]]]4.1              Recent customer research showed there is poor understanding of what biodegradable really means. When asked if consumers wanted a free biodegradable, the majority said yes, however when asked how they would dispose of the bags the majority confirmed they would continue to reuse them as bin liners. When asked if they knew the impact on the environment could be detrimental, the majority went on to say they would prefer to pay 5p for a bag that could be recycled.&#xa0;4.2              A biodegradable bag should break down more quickly. If these types of bags enter the recycling stream they will compromise the quality of the recyclant. We have established an effective closed loop process with our plastics company. There would need to be a new process to ensure bags were segregated to reduce contamination however it is likely that recycling rates would be affected.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[any wider environmental or sustainability implications of a possible increased use of natural fibre ‘bags for life’]]]&#xa0;5.1              With the potential introduction of a free biodegradable bag, we would need to consider the impact on our existing range of reusable bags. We would withdraw the existing ‘recycled and recyclable’ plastic bag as consumers would be unlikely to pay a 5p charge if an alternative, free biodegradable bag is available.&#xa0;5.2              A free bag option is likely to change the behaviour of those consumers who already reuse their bags as they would switch to using a free alternative. &#xa0;5.3              Consumers are more likely to move away from the bag for life, which, if used four times and recycled, has the lowest impact on the environment.

[[[the relative advantages and disadvantages of the proposed levy rather than a possible complete ban on lightweight plastic bags]]]6.1              The proposed levy exempts biodegradable bags. By offering a free bag, it would continue to encourage a ‘use once’ mentality as there would be little incentive to remember to reuse bags. Consumers would also view the bag as a more sustainable solution to plastic, despite it not being suitable for recycling nor would it change consumers’ behaviour regarding disposal.6.2              From WRAP’s own report and LCA data, all bags should be reused as many times as possible. Biodegradable bags especially paper bags have very limited reuse opportunities.&#xa0;

[[[the rationale for excluding particular types of retailer from the levy scheme]]]7.1              If the rationale for the plastic bag charge is environmental, then its aim should be to change consumer behaviour and to encourage the reuse of bags as many times as possible.  This would not be achieved if some retailers were exempt.7.2              Excluding some retailers would send out conflicting messages to consumers and could therefore affect the potential benefits from the charge in other areas.&#xa0;

[[[the lessons to be learnt from other countries’ experiences in this area]]]8.1                            In Wales, consumers have adapted to the charge and reusing bags is commonplace as in Europe.

[[[Any social or economic impacts of the proposed bag levy, for example on affordability for particular households or businesses]]]9.1              There would be an enormous loss of potential funds available to charities as a result of the exemption of biodegradable bags.  In Wales, the proceeds from the 5p charge go towards social and environmental good causes. With the potential volumes available, charities stand to lose considerable funds as few retailers would offer a plastic bag for 5p.  Most retailers will want to be as competitive as possible and therefore most will offer a free biodegradable bag. If a charge was imposed on all single use bags as in Wales, the proceeds could be redirected into research and development to improve kerbside recycling/on the go recycling where the main problem lies.
