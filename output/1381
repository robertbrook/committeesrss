[normal]Written evidence from Action With Communities in Rural England (ACRE) 
[normal](TIC 26)
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]ACRE is the national charity supporting rural community action through its founder members, the Rural Community Councils (RCCs) across England. The 38 RCCs are independent local development agencies, based at county level, addressing social, economic and e
[normal]nvironmental challenges in rural areas. They provide help, support and advice for community-led action in rural areas throughout England.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many of our members have carried out local transport surveys showing current demand
[normal] and gaps in provision. These have included local authority commissioned work and surveys via Parish Councils and as part of Community Led Planning activity. 
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]Surveys 
[normal]are usually undertaken 
[normal]where there is a need to identify gaps
[normal] due to cuts in bus services and
[normal],
[normal] the need for a local authority to undertake smarter transport planning in times of austerity. The surveys are effective as they identify 
[normal]possible solutions as well as 
[normal]ways 
[normal]to
[normal] save money. They often point towards the provis
[normal]ion of bespoke and community led and localised services.
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]RCAN members across the country work with Rural Transport Partnerships, where they exist, and where they don’t; they take on the challenge of working with other stakeholders to maintain the focu
[normal]s on rural transport needs and solutions.
[normal] For example, North Yorkshire County Council bring together community and in house transport providers to look at how they are working together.
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]Traditional bus
[normal] services are not appropriate to serve isolated communities both from a geographical point of view (e.g., narrow lanes), because they are ecologically unsound and economically they just don’t work.
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]We would advocate for a range of solutions to suit 
[normal]a 
[normal]community’s specific needs 
[normal]– community transport, taxi buses, small buses and post buses.
[normal]To conclude there should be a more systematic surveying of communities which would raise the issue of community transport as many communities seem confused about what
[normal] community transport is and where they can access it.
[normal]2.[bold]              [bold]To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isola[bold]ted communities?[bold]It appears 
[normal]that very little account is taken of the needs of people with disabilities, older people and younger people. Though provision in some areas aims to cater for older people. The main challenges are:
[normal]In an effort to shape service decisions Essex County Council use ‘Accession’ accessibility mapping software to ident
[normal]ify the ability of people with different needs to access key services. 
[normal]3. [bold]              [bold]What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Costs and
[normal] charging structures in low demand/high mileage areas – isolated areas by their nature means longer distances and higher costs (particularly fuel costs), which the provider would seek to pass on partially or fully to the passenger.
[normal] 
[normal]Fares need to be afforda
[normal]ble while at the same time prices charged, sustainable for the provider. 
[normal]East Cleveland Minibus Brokerage provides an example of what can be achieved to help cut costs and achieve a more sustainable service. Tees Valley RCC’s response provides details.
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]An acceptance that certain essential services will never provide an economic return and have to be subsidised in some form. The Government and the community transport sector must work together with all parties to get a best possible alternative.
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]Pr
[normal]oviding transport services at times people need them e.g. the scenario of 
[normal]catching
[normal] a bus 
[normal]on
[normal] Tuesday 
[normal]that
[normal] does not return until Friday does not work for the average passenger. Better connectivity between all parties including supermarkets and retailers 
[normal]offe
[normal]ring
[normal] bus services, between bus and rail services and between operators could link up their service provision
[normal] to
[normal]      help address this issue. 
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Provision of services in times of winter/bad weather – especially 
[normal]in
[normal] high altitude areas
[normal] needs consideration.
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]Better communication of the services that are available and an understanding that older people may not have access to the internet and efficient broadband is not readily available in some rural areas. If people don’t know about services they cannot us
[normal]e them
[normal];
[normal] unused transport is not viable.
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]Incentives for families and car users to change their mode of transport may increase use of services that are available making them more viable.
[normal]4.[bold]              [bold]How effectively do Community Transport services address the need[bold]s of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?[bold]4.1[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our Network and local transport providers have worked in partnership for many years to develop tried and tested solutions for individual communities, including demand respo
[normal]nsive buses, community mini-buses, car-based taxis, good neighbour schemes and even community rail partnerships. This includes work with isolated communities. 
[normal]Essex County Council supports 12 community transport schemes across Essex run as charitable organ
[normal]isations.  The quality of service is
[normal] a success due to it
[normal] being personalised, flexible and reliable.
[normal]4.2[bold]              
[normal]The most recent CTA State of the Sector Report showed the community transport sector is increasing but that some organisations
[normal] were struggling 
[normal]financially.  We believe that it will always need a degree of subsidy and
[normal]/
[normal]or grant funding to make a significant difference on rural routes.
[normal]4.3[bold]              
[normal]In terms of improvement there is positive trend towards the development of CT infrastructure/u
[normal]mbrella bodies at a more local level e
[normal].
[normal]g
[normal].
[normal] Buckinghamshire Community Transport Hub and Suffolk Community Transport. Their roles include help with publicity, co-ordinate demand (one stop shop approach) provide business support services for their members.

[normal]Background from Community Action [bold]Surrey who have supported voluntary car schemes for over 20 years[bold]“
[normal]In Surrey voluntary car schemes/good neighbo
[normal]u
[normal]r schemes have existed for almost 50 years and Surrey CA has supported these for over 20 years.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have about 100 such schemes offering transport to anyone in their communities but it is almost all elderly people who use the service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The schemes vary in size from 10 volunteers to 150 volunteers, doing as few as 120 passenger journeys to 15,000 passe
[normal]nger journeys a year. Last year we did a short survey of the schemes and we had a 79% return rate. The 79% reported that they did 82,500 passenger journeys for 7,300 clients.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Our estimate is that approximately 75% would have been health related journeys.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Of all the requests only 0.7% w
[normal]ere
[normal] turned down and that was usually because too short notice was given.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These voluntary schemes work very well in the communities that have them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The Voluntary Car Schemes Adviser is continually trying to develop new sche
[normal]mes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In the past 
[normal]21
[normal] years Surrey Community Action has assisted 43 schemes to develop.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There are another three in the pipeline and another two possible new schemes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On the evidence to date, it would seem that until every community/village/town has such a 
[normal]scheme, this development work will continue as there does appear to be a need for the schemes across the county, both in urban and rural areas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clients find these schemes to be a lifeline for them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The schemes provide transport to hospital appointments 
[normal]before hospital transport even begins work.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] They will go across borders and the drivers wait for their clients, often st
[normal]aying with them in the hospital”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.[bold]              [bold]To wh[bold]at extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other d[bold]emand-responsive transport services?[bold]5.1[bold]              
[normal]Taxis are cost prohibitive for many people in isolated areas, concessionary passes cannot be used in taxis and there can be a limited supply.  However they could be used as part of the transport mix in isolated comm
[normal]unities.   They could provide a failsafe option as part of a car sharing scheme?  Community First Wiltshire suggest a web based portal for taxi operators to use to advertise ‘dead’ journeys may be useful in advertising journey opportunities and in bringing
[normal] down costs for passengers.
[normal]5.2[bold]              
[normal]For young people relying on parents for financial support taxi costs can be prohibitive and put financial pressure on struggling families.
