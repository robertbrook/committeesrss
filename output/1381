default&#xa0;defaultACRE is the national charity supporting rural community action through its founder members, the Rural Community Councils (RCCs) across England. The 38 RCCs are independent local development agencies, based at county level, addressing social, economic and e
defaultnvironmental challenges in rural areas. They provide help, support and advice for community-led action in rural areas throughout England.

defaultMany of our members have carried out local transport surveys showing current demand
default and gaps in provision. These have included local authority commissioned work and surveys via Parish Councils and as part of Community Led Planning activity. 
default1.2
default              
defaultSurveys 
defaultare usually undertaken 
defaultwhere there is a need to identify gaps
default due to cuts in bus services and
default,
default the need for a local authority to undertake smarter transport planning in times of austerity. The surveys are effective as they identify 
defaultpossible solutions as well as 
defaultways 
defaultto
default save money. They often point towards the provis
defaultion of bespoke and community led and localised services.
default1.3
default              
default              
defaultRCAN members across the country work with Rural Transport Partnerships, where they exist, and where they don’t; they take on the challenge of working with other stakeholders to maintain the focu
defaults on rural transport needs and solutions.
default For example, North Yorkshire County Council bring together community and in house transport providers to look at how they are working together.
default1.4
default              
default              
defaultTraditional bus
default services are not appropriate to serve isolated communities both from a geographical point of view (e.g., narrow lanes), because they are ecologically unsound and economically they just don’t work.
default1.5
default              
default              
defaultWe would advocate for a range of solutions to suit 
defaulta 
defaultcommunity’s specific needs 
default– community transport, taxi buses, small buses and post buses.
defaultTo conclude there should be a more systematic surveying of communities which would raise the issue of community transport as many communities seem confused about what
default community transport is and where they can access it.
default2.default              defaultTo what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isoladefaultted communities?defaultIt appears 
defaultthat very little account is taken of the needs of people with disabilities, older people and younger people. Though provision in some areas aims to cater for older people. The main challenges are:
defaultIn an effort to shape service decisions Essex County Council use ‘Accession’ accessibility mapping software to ident
defaultify the ability of people with different needs to access key services. 
default3. default              defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?default3.1
default              
defaultCosts and
default charging structures in low demand/high mileage areas – isolated areas by their nature means longer distances and higher costs (particularly fuel costs), which the provider would seek to pass on partially or fully to the passenger.
default 
defaultFares need to be afforda
defaultble while at the same time prices charged, sustainable for the provider. 
defaultEast Cleveland Minibus Brokerage provides an example of what can be achieved to help cut costs and achieve a more sustainable service. Tees Valley RCC’s response provides details.
default3.2
default              
defaultAn acceptance that certain essential services will never provide an economic return and have to be subsidised in some form. The Government and the community transport sector must work together with all parties to get a best possible alternative.
default3.3
default              
defaultPr
defaultoviding transport services at times people need them e.g. the scenario of 
defaultcatching
default a bus 
defaulton
default Tuesday 
defaultthat
default does not return until Friday does not work for the average passenger. Better connectivity between all parties including supermarkets and retailers 
defaultoffe
defaultring
default bus services, between bus and rail services and between operators could link up their service provision
default to
default      help address this issue. 
default3.4
default              
defaultProvision of services in times of winter/bad weather – especially 
defaultin
default high altitude areas
default needs consideration.
default3.5
default              
defaultBetter communication of the services that are available and an understanding that older people may not have access to the internet and efficient broadband is not readily available in some rural areas. If people don’t know about services they cannot us
defaulte them
default;
default unused transport is not viable.
default3.6
default              
defaultIncentives for families and car users to change their mode of transport may increase use of services that are available making them more viable.
default4.default              defaultHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needdefaults of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?default4.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur Network and local transport providers have worked in partnership for many years to develop tried and tested solutions for individual communities, including demand respo
defaultnsive buses, community mini-buses, car-based taxis, good neighbour schemes and even community rail partnerships. This includes work with isolated communities. 
defaultEssex County Council supports 12 community transport schemes across Essex run as charitable organ
defaultisations.  The quality of service is
default a success due to it
default being personalised, flexible and reliable.
default4.2default              
defaultThe most recent CTA State of the Sector Report showed the community transport sector is increasing but that some organisations
default were struggling 
defaultfinancially.  We believe that it will always need a degree of subsidy and
default/
defaultor grant funding to make a significant difference on rural routes.

defaultIn terms of improvement there is positive trend towards the development of CT infrastructure/u

defaultBackground from Community Action defaultSurrey who have supported voluntary car schemes for over 20 yearsdefault“
defaultIn Surrey voluntary car schemes/good neighbo
defaultu
defaultr schemes have existed for almost 50 years and Surrey CA has supported these for over 20 years.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have about 100 such schemes offering transport to anyone in their communities but it is almost all elderly people who use the service.
default&#xa0;
default The schemes vary in size from 10 volunteers to 150 volunteers, doing as few as 120 passenger journeys to 15,000 passe
defaultnger journeys a year. Last year we did a short survey of the schemes and we had a 79% return rate. The 79% reported that they did 82,500 passenger journeys for 7,300 clients.
default&#xa0;
default Our estimate is that approximately 75% would have been health related journeys.
default&#xa0;
default Of all the requests only 0.7% w
defaultere
default turned down and that was usually because too short notice was given.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese voluntary schemes work very well in the communities that have them.
default&#xa0;
default The Voluntary Car Schemes Adviser is continually trying to develop new sche
defaultmes.
default&#xa0;
default In the past 
default21
default years Surrey Community Action has assisted 43 schemes to develop.
default&#xa0;
default There are another three in the pipeline and another two possible new schemes.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn the evidence to date, it would seem that until every community/village/town has such a 
defaultscheme, this development work will continue as there does appear to be a need for the schemes across the county, both in urban and rural areas. 
default&#xa0;
defaultClients find these schemes to be a lifeline for them.
default&#xa0;
default The schemes provide transport to hospital appointments 
defaultbefore hospital transport even begins work.
default&#xa0;
default They will go across borders and the drivers wait for their clients, often st
defaultaying with them in the hospital”

default&#xa0;default5.default              defaultTo whdefaultat extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other ddefaultemand-responsive transport services?default5.1default              
defaultTaxis are cost prohibitive for many people in isolated areas, concessionary passes cannot be used in taxis and there can be a limited supply.  However they could be used as part of the transport mix in isolated comm
defaultunities.   They could provide a failsafe option as part of a car sharing scheme?  Community First Wiltshire suggest a web based portal for taxi operators to use to advertise ‘dead’ journeys may be useful in advertising journey opportunities and in bringing
default down costs for passengers.
default5.2default              
defaultFor young people relying on parents for financial support taxi costs can be prohibitive and put financial pressure on struggling families.
