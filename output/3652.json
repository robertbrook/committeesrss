"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nMarilyn Fletcher B.Sc. Ph.D.\n (HSR 029)\n&#xa0;\nThe High Speed Rail Revolution: History and Prospects by Terry Gourvish&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/HS2_TheHighSpeedRailRevolutionHistoryAndProspects2010.pdf\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“Most studies indicate that it would be unwise to pin much faith in new railways as an engine of growth. That is not to say a growth stimulus is entirely absent.\n In 1997 the European Commission \nestimated \nthat the major TENS would add only 0.25 per cent to EU GDP, and 0.11 per cent to employment over the next 25 years. \nThe literature review of Preston and Wall produced the conclusion that the growth of HSRs was lik\nely \nto lie \nwithin the modest range of 1-3 per cent of GDP.”\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
