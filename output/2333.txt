[[[Summary: ]]]

[[[Why the UK’s approach to oil and mining is at a turning point]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;5. All these cases of malpractice relied on secrecy over company ownership and lax regulation, in both the UK and in its Crown Dependencies and Overeas Territories. This has made the UK an accessory to international crime and, by allowing the looting of some of the world’s poorest countries, has undermined the effectiveness of UK aid. &#xa0;The case for change is clear. &#xa0;Policy recommendations&#xa0;6. The British Prime Minister has called for public registries of the “beneficial owners” – that is, the people who ultimately own companies – as a means of combating tax evasion and fraud. In a letter from April of this year, Mr Cameron called for the “availability of beneficial ownership information through central public company registries”. &#xa0;7. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills has been holding a public consultation on this matter, examining whether a UK registry should be public or not. Global Witness is firmly of the opinion that 

[[[a public register would provide the surest safeguard against corruption.]]]&#xa0;8. An open registry would be cheap, would allow companies to know who they are doing business with (and thus reduce due diligence costs) and would enable citizens to hold companies to account.. &#xa0;9. Global Witness believes that the UK should also ensure publish registers are adopted in its

[[[ Overseas Territories (OTs) and Crown Dependencies (CDs).]]] The UK has the right to impose this decision on the OTs and CDs. A number of these territories are jurisdictions of choice for criminals setting up anonymous companies to hide their identity. While in many cases, trust and company service providers (TCSPs) are required to collect beneficial ownership information on companies incorporated in the OTs and CDs, the accuracy and completeness of this information is often doubtful. The “offshore leaks” work carried out by the International Centre for Investigative Journalism has shown that in some cases TCSPs in the OTs and CDs simply have not collected beneficial ownership information. &#xa0;10. In the final declaration at Loch Erne, G8 members pledged to publish national Action Plans which would, among other matters, require companies “to obtain and hold information on their beneficial ownership, and to ensure that this information is available in a timely fashion to law enforcement, tax collection agencies and other relevant authorities as appropriate …for example, through central registries”.&#xa0;11. Section 1504 of the US Dodd-Frank Act and the EU Accounting and Transparency Directives require American and European extractive companies to report on payments to governments on a project-by-project basis without exemptions.

[[[Case studies]]]&#xa0;

[[[ENRC]]]&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Russian Trading Structure&#xa0;16. ENRC is a company with Kazakh origins that is largely controlled by its trio of founding shareholders: Patokh Chodiev, Alijan Ibragimov and Alexander Mashkevitch.&#xa0;17. Global Witness has investigated corruption concerns around the company’s business in the DRC and has also reviewed audits which, among other matters, show how the trio siphoned money out of its Kazakh factories. The evidence not only demonstrates the importance of the UK authorities pursuing their current investigations into ENRC to their conclusion but also raises serious regulatory questions for the Stock Exchange authorities – including why ENRC was allowed to list in the first place. &#xa0;18. To comply with the word limit here, we focus on the most damning of these audits. We would be glad to offer supplementary material, oral or written.&#xa0;19. A September 2007 audit by the law firm Herbert Smith explains how the trio skimmed most of the profits from mineral sales to Russia in the years preceding ENRC’s London listing in December 2007. The audit examined how, from 2004 to 2006, four factories in Kazakhstan sold $870 million of coal, iron ore and other minerals to Russia through layers of anonymously owned intermediary companies, collectively referred to in the audit as the Russian Trading Structure (RTS). &#xa0;20. The factories concerned – majority-owned by the trio – were incorporated as separate entities from 2004 but were grouped under the ENRC umbrella in December 2006. Seventy per cent of all profits went personally to the three founder shareholders in cash, the audit said.&#xa0;21. The RTS was “based on entirely illegitimate objectives”, wrote Pieter Hamelink, a Dutch tax lawyer who headed ENRC’s Audit Committee, in a 6 April 2006 e-mail cited by the auditors. The audit said that ENRC’s smaller shareholders could have been “prejudiced by the transfer of profits away from the plants”.&#xa0;22. “The plants received, via bank transfer, a payment for their products,” said the audit. “This did not represent the total amount of payment as the RTS would also pay a cash element in respect of each transaction… for the benefit of Messers Chodiev, Ibragimov and Machkevitch.” &#xa0;23. Patokh Chodiev’s nephew, Olim, was the trio’s “treasurer” tasked with collecting the cash, according to the audit: “Olim Chodiev told us that he did not see any documentation in relation to the RTS arrangement and would simply collect the money.”&#xa0;24. While two senior officials told Herbert Smith that the RTS structure was independent of the trio, the audit provides substantial evidence that this was untrue. For example, one key firm in the RTS, Ugolenergoimpex, was “ultimately, beneficially owned by the Majority Shareholders [the trio]”, according to the head of the Moscow branch of ENRC Marketing, Anatoliy Tulyakov. Mr Tulyakov was a director of Ugolenergoimpex and was thus in a position to know about its ownership.  Evidence in the audit from Mr Hamelink and from ENRC’s Swiss tax advisers also indicate that the trio beneficially owned companies in the RTS.&#xa0;25. As well as skimming profits, RTS companies also took extra commissions. If the trio were the beneficial owners of the RTS companies, their cut of the profits may have been above 70%. &#xa0;26. From reading the audit, it appears to Global Witness that the RTS arrangement could have been fraudulent, with the trio siphoning off profits from ENRC in cash through anonymously owned companies to the expense of ENRC’s other shareholders. &#xa0;27. Much potential evidence has vanished. Key ENRC officials in Moscow had “not provided us with an honest account” when questioned about deleting data about the RTS, while other officials refused to answer questions, Herbert Smith wrote. Prior to the Herbert Smith analysis, PwC was sent falsified information as it sought to audit company revenues. During a later investigation, the UK law firm Dechert wrote in a letter to ENRC of 12 April 2013 that a false office was even created in Kazakhstan. &#xa0;28. It was not until the end of 2006 that the RTS system was closed down. In 2006, sales from ENRC’s Kazakhstan plants to Russia involved UK-registered Tekmark Consulting Ltd , which the auditors “understand is a company put forward by the RTS”. Tekmark signed “commission agreements” with ENRC subsidiaries, formally giving it a role in selling metal to Russia.&#xa0;29. The agreements with Tekmark appear to have made no fundamental difference to the RTS structure, with Herbert Smith saying “we understand that during 2006 the Majority Shareholders continued to receive the cash from the RTS in Moscow”.&#xa0;30. Tekmark appears to been have no more than a shell: “Given that Tekmark is recorded as being a dormant company at the time when the services are being provided with assets of £300 it seems unlikely, in practice, to have provided any services whatsoever,” the audit said. &#xa0;31. The people who own Tekmark are unknown, as documents filed at UK Companies House show its sole shareholder as a being another anonymously-owned company: Vestro Development, registered in Gibraltar.&#xa0;32. Despite the extremely serious findings of the audit, ENRC was able to go ahead and list on the London Stock Exchange less than three months after it was submitted. Membership of the FTSE100 ensured that UK pensioners would automatically buy its stock through tracker funds. &#xa0;33. ENRC’s Initial Public Offering (IPO) prospectus declared the RTS as a “risk factor” and recognised that it paid out $111 million to the trio. Yet the details the IPO provided of the RTS are contradicted by Herbert Smith. ENRC professed general ignorance about how the RTS was structured and about the “agency” organising it (ENRC said it believes this “agency…was neither owned or legally controlled by the Group or its shareholders”). However, the audit cites Johannes Sittard, then the CEO of ENRC, saying that every three to six months “there would be a special presentation made… concerning money which had been earned by the Majority Shareholders from RTS sales. This presentation would be restricted to the Majority Shareholders and Dr Sittard… During these presentations Ilmir Masgutov [a consultant to the factories] would hand out documentation which set out the results of the RTS trading.”  The audit shows that several officials working for the trio and its companies had a detailed knowledge of the RTS.&#xa0;34. Global Witness has put detailed questions to ENRC about the Russian Trading Structure but the response simply referred us back to a general statement of corporate principles.&#xa0;b) The DRC acquisitions&#xa0;35. In 2009 ENRC began buying mining assets in the DRC from Dan Gertler, a friend of President Joseph Kabila. Mr Gertler had secretly bought the assets at steeply undervalued prices and quickly sold them on for huge profits – in one case “flipping” a mine to ENRC for five times the original value paid. In the process ENRC paid hundreds of millions of dollars to companies registered anonymously in the British Virgin Islands. The resulting scandal has contributed to a rapid descent in its share price.&#xa0;36. Global Witness has published several reports on the “secret sales scandal” since May 2012, and a May 2013 report by the Africa Progress Panel gives further valuable analysis. Representatives of Glencore and of Mr Gertler have repeatedly denied there was any corruption in their Congolese deals, with Mr Gertler’s spokesmen challenging the valuation data used by us and the Africa Progress Panel. ENRC has issued a general statement, saying that it “has a zero-tolerance policy to bribery and corruption”,&#xa0;37. The SFO began “discussions” with ENRC over corruption allegations in the DRC and Kazakhstan by December 2011. Yet ENRC was allowed to “self-report” to the SFO for the next 16 months before the agency finally opened a criminal investigation in April 2013. David Green, who took over as as Director of the SFO in April 2012, saying that he was against “cosy deals” and favoured a tougher approach than his predecessor; the announcement of the criminal investigation suggests he may have been living up to his promises. 

[[[However, Global Witness encourages the Select Committee to examine w]]]

[[[hy the SFO took so long to launch a formal investigation]]]

[[[, and whether the self-reporting has been effective.]]]&#xa0;38. Meanwhile, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) was alerted to corruption risks when ENRC filed at least two Suspicious Activity Reports through its lawyers Herbert Smith in 2010, relating to a major mining deal in the DRC.  &#xa0;39. Global Witness has seen a leaked copy of the second of these reports, from August 2010. In it, ENRC requests permission to seal a $175 million deal with a British Virgin Islands company associated with Mr Gertler – just eight days before the deal was due to be formally announced. The report noted a risk that the mine concessions that ENRC was to buy from the BVI-registered Highwind Group “may have been obtained by corruption”. &#xa0;40. Global Witness believes ENRC misled Soca about when it became aware of the corruption risks and what it knew about the ownership of the assets.

[[[ The case of ENRC helps illustrate why the the London Stock Exchange and relevant authorities should be obliged to perform more stringent due dili]]]

The trio is now seeking to delist the company by buying out minority shareholders and it is reported that there are plans to reregister the company in Kazakhstan. This could pose a serious threat to the completion of the SFO’s criminal inquiry, a matter of deep public interest.

[[[: the case of OPL245]]]&#xa0;a) Payments to a convicted money launderer for an oil block&#xa0;43. For over a year now Global Witness has been piecing together detailed court documents and other evidence that expose how Shell and Italian oil giant Eni agreed to pay US$1.092 billion for one of Nigeria’s most potentially lucrative oil blocks, OPL245. &#xa0;44. The payment was made by Shell and Eni to the Nigerian government, which had a separate agreement to pay the same amount to Malabu Oil and Gas, a Nigerian company widely believed at the time to be controlled by convicted money-launderer and former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete.&#xa0;45. In July 2013, a British High Court court ruled that Etete was indeed the owner of Malabu. As Etete had awarded the oil block to Malabu whilst petroleum minister during the regime of the corrupt dictator General Abacha, he had effectively given himself one of the most lucrative oil blocks in Nigeria.&#xa0;46. Shell and Eni deny paying any money to Malabu. However, High Court proceedings and other evidence seen by Global Witness reveal that in reality Shell and Eni were aware and in agreement that the deal would benefit Malabu, and had even met with Etete face-to-face on several occasions. In fact, testimony heard during the case indicates that an official from Shell previously negotiated directly with Etete over “iced champagne” and that Eni officials had enjoyed a luxurious dinner at a 5-star hotel in Milan with Etete.  &#xa0;47. Global Witness believes that the deal was structured through the Nigerian government primarily to allow Shell and Eni to claim that they had not struck a deal with Etete or Malabu. Yet in making these payments, Shell and Eni had effectively bought the block from Etete for over a billion dollars, thereby “monetising” an asset that was originally acquired by Malabu in highly suspicious and probably illegal circumstances.   &#xa0;48. Documents seen by Global Witness also indicate that the deal resulted in over $801 million of the money transferred to Malabu being passed on to five Nigerian shell companies with hidden owners, raising concerns as to who ultimately benefitted from this deal.&#xa0;49. Despite Nigeria’s abundant oil wealth, Nigerians remain among the world’s poorest people and the country is set to receive just under £1 billion from the Department for International Development from 2011 to 2015. In a country that continues to be plagued by corruption the need for citizen oversight of payments to governments for their natural resources is as important as ever. Currently, and as this case demonstrates, detailed information of this nature only comes to light through the accident of court cases in London and New York.&#xa0;50. Opaque deals like OPL245 illustrate why it is so important that the UK sticks to its G8 commitment to swiftly implement the EU Accounting Directive, through transposition into UK law during 2014.  &#xa0;b) UK’s courts used to settle the proceeds of corruption&#xa0;51. Of the $1.1 billion that Shell and Eni paid for OPL245, $215 million was frozen in a UK court, pending the result of a commercial case brought by Energy Venture Partners. EVP, registered in the British Virgin Islands, argued that it helped Malabu sell the block to Shell and Eni. &#xa0;52. In July 2013, the British High Court ruled that EVP was owed at least $110 million of this for its services in arranging the sale of the block. The result of this judgment is that, in theory, $105 million should be paid over to Malabu – and hence to Mr Etete - and it has been suggested that EVP should be entitled to the remaining $110 million, held by the High Court. As of the date of this submission, this case now awaits appeal. A separate arbitration case brought by another party that alleged it assisted in the sale of OPL245 has recently been concluded behind closed doors. The terms of that settlement have not been revealed but could result in a further $75 million of frozen funds being transferred to Malabu. Those frozen funds are currently held in an account at JP Morgan Chase in London.&#xa0;53. Whether the money is returned to Malabu or paid out to the brokers, the funds are the proceeds of corruption, given that they result from the sale of an asset that was obtained in highly questionable and corrupt circumstances in the first place.

The cases discussed above amply illustrate the huge corruption concerns surrounding extractives companies listed and registered in the UK, and the damage this is doing to the UK’s reputation for probity. Opacity around resource deals and company ownership is a central part of the problem. For matters to improve the UK will have to introduce new laws and take firmer action against corporate misbehaviour. To start with, the UK should follow through on its promises, putting in place a public register of beneficial ownership and transposing the EU Transparency and Accounting Directive into UK law. &#xa0;56. As noted above, Global Witness would be glad to expand upon its recommendations and investigative findings in oral evidence to the Committee.&#xa0;
