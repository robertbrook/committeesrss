"Written evidence submitted by Bindmans LLP (LAI 0058)Introduction Dangerous in practice \nWrong in principle\nThe claimed savings are unrealistic \nThe alternative options are ineffective \nReduced availability of advice generally \n&#xa0;\nParticular impact on people with mental health problems and learning disab\nilities\nParticular impact on women\nNo adequate justification\n“Every person within the jurisdiction enjoys the equal protection of our laws. There is no distinction between British nationals and others. He who is subject to English law is entitled to its protect\nion. This principle has been in the law at least since Lord \nMansfied\n freed “the black” in Somerset’s Case (1772) 20 St.Tr.1”\n \nL\negal Aid eligibility is based on this very principle: it is currently available for all, regardless of their country of residence, provided their case raises an issue in the legal system of England and Wales and comes within the narrow \nscope of Legal Aid. \nThis is the ‘connection’ necessary \nand appropriate \nfor eligibility\n; having a dispute of substance which needs to be resolved in our Courts which cannot otherwise be funded\n. It is fair, sensible and easy to police. It has always been a feature of the Legal \nAid system. \nor\n they must show that they benefit from an exemption because they are: \nAn unworkable test \nIn \nthis one year alone, each of these \n729,483 acts of assistance \nwould have needed to be preceded by a residence test\n administered by solicitors and audited by the Legal Aid Agency\n. \nStrikingly\n,\n these statistics do not feature in the proposals at all. The scal\ne of the \npractical \nproblems the test will create is, apparently, considered to be irrelevan\nt\n by the \nMoJ\n. \n“\nThe specific \nevidence\n requirements have not yet been decided upon. However, individuals who do not already have evidence of UK nationality may have to pay a fee for a copy of their birth certificate or other documentation if they do not have easy access to them. Claimants may \nalso experience a delay in their cases whilst documentation is sought.” \nThe residence test in practice: \ninternational \nfamily cases  \n“What I find so depressing is that the case highlig\nhts the difficulties increasingly encountered by the judiciary at all levels when dealing with \nlitigants in person. Two problems in particular are revealed. The first is how to bring order to \nthe\n chaos which litigants in person invariably – and wholly unde\nrstandably – manage to create in putting forward their claims and defences. Judges should not have to micro-manage cases, coaxing and cajoling the parties to focus on the issues that need to be resolved. Judge Thornton did a brilliant job in that regard ye\nt, as this case shows, that can be disproportionately time-consuming. \nIt may be saving the Legal Services Commission which no longer offers Legal Aid for this kind of litigation but saving expenditure in one public department in this instance simply increa\nses it in the courts. The expense of three judges of the Court of Appeal dealing with this kind of appeal is enormous. The consequences by way of delay of other appeals which need to be heard are unquantifiable. The appeal would certainly never have occurr\ned if the litigants had been represented.\n With more and more self-represented litigants, this problem is not going to go away. We may have to accept that we live in austere times, but as I come to the end of eighteen years service in this court, I shall no\nt refrain from expressing my conviction that justice will be ill served indeed by this emasculation of Legal Aid” (emphasis added)\nThe residence test in practice: victims of crime, abuse and wrongdoing \n“proper protection and support for vic\ntims of crime is a fundamental part of a civilised justice system. \nand committed itself to “action” to “ensure that victims get the support they need to cope with the aftermath”. \nBut, despite improvements over the last two decades, the system has continu\ned to fall short in helping victims recover from crime, supporting them through the stresses of investigation and trial, and providing the right support at the right time.\nThe residence test in practice: other civil cases  \nDiscrimination \nAbsence of justification \n“3.42 We are concerned that individuals with little or no connection to this \ncountry are currently able to claim Legal Aid to bring civil legal actions at UK taxpayers’ expense. These may be people who have never set foot in England or Wales, or those \nwho have never paid taxes in the UK, but who are yet able to benefit financially from the civil Legal Aid scheme. Alternatively these may be people who are in the country but whose connection is tenuous because they are simply here on a visa as visitors, o\nr because they have temporary admission. \n3.43 We need to introduce a common sense test to address this anomalous situation, which we believe is currently unfair to the UK taxpayer. We believe that limited public funds for civil Legal Aid should be targete\nd at those who have a strong connection to the UK.”\nand secondly to deter ‘forum shopping’: \n“3.44 We are also concerned that the availability of Legal Aid for cases brought in this country, irrespective of the person’s connection with this country, may encourage people to bring disputes here.”  \nProportionality \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIncomplete data and flawed assumptions \nThe proposal is wholly impractical  \nWrong in principle  \nPractical implications \nEliminating funding for \ngenuine \ntest cases is wrong in principle\nImpact of the proposal, if implemented\nConclusion 2\n7 September \n2013\n&#xa0;\n \nThese are \nsummarised\n in an article by Mike \nSchwarcz\n and John \nHalford\n of this firm: \nhttp://www.solicitorsjournal.com/comme\nnt/legal-aid-cuts-more-detail-more-devils\n \n http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/features/interview-chris-grayling\n \nR v.

It would not have affected cases concerning immigration issues (about entry or terms of stay), nor the detention of any client under the Mental \nHeath\n Act 1983, nor childcare or supervision pr\noceedings under the Children Act 1989, nor child abduction proceedings covered by the Hague Convention, nor domestic violence proceedings, and nor would it cover housing proceedings where the client was at risk of homelessness.
