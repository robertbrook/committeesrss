Written evidence from the Asian Media and Marketing Group [TOB16]

default1. Asian Trader repr
defaultesents a readership of over 200,
default000 and we regularly
default 
defaultspeak out on behalf of our 
defaultreaders to voice their concerns,
default not just
default 
defaultthrough Asian Trader but also
default,
default on their behalf to Members of Parliament.
default 
defaultT
defaulthis readership includes over 47,
default000 convenience stores and newsagents
default nationwide,
default which make a huge
default contribution to the UK economy,
default and
default 
defaultnot just financially - they are often the heartbeat of
default 
defaulttheir community.
default2. The Asian community owns over 75% of all convenience
default 
defaultstores/newsagents nationwide. As such convenience retailing
default,
default and the
default 
defaultstruggles independent store owners face
default,
default is a key concern of ours and
defaultone we regularly write about. Only to frequently do we cover the impact
default 
defaultof the illicit tobacco trade on our honest retailers and their local
default 
defaultcommunities.
default3. In our experience,
default counterfeiting and smuggling is already having a
default 
defaultdevastating effect on small retailers. In addition to the illicit trade costing
default 
defaultthe taxpayer almost £2bn according to the recent National Audit Office
default 
defaultreport - and this is conservative as these are HMRC figures based on
default 
default2011 data - the average convenien
defaultce retailer loses more than £40,
default000
default 
defaultevery year through illegal tobacco sales. Illicit traders - often part of
default 
defaultcriminal gangs - continue to lurk in street corners across the UK with no
defaultregard to who buy their products.
default4. The inability of HMRC to control the illicit trade in tobacco products gives
default 
defaultsmugglers and counterfeiters a platform to expand their illegal activities.
default 
defaultIt is clear from the recent National Audit Office report that not enough is
default 
defaultbeing done by HMRC and Government to tackle the illegal trade in Roll
default 
defaultYour Own (RYO) and cigarette smu
defaultggling. According to the report,
default non
default-
defaultduty
default 
defaultpaid product for RYO and cigarettes represent 38% and 9% of UK
default 
defaultsales - our readers have told us this is more like 49% and 14%
default 
defaultrespectively.
default5. Furthermore the majority of stores are run by families where ladies are
default 
defaultat the till and are being exposed to threats and violence by criminal
default 
defaultgangs.
default6. The Police are unable to respond in time and often will not attend unless
default 
defaultblood has been spilled.
default7. These stores are at the heart of their local community and play an
default 
defaultintegral part on the High Street.
default8. Whilst many areas of this inquiry our out of scope for our comment, on
default 
defaultbehalf of our readers we wanted to thank the Home Affairs Select
default 
defaultCommittee for launching this inquiry. The Government needs to
default 
defaultcrackdown on the illicit trade, and introduce more severe penalties for
default 
defaultcriminals who knowingly sell illegal product to smokers.
default9. As an organisation we are happy to play our part in assisting with this
default 
defaultwhere we can; and we will continue to work with Asian Trader retailers
default 
defaultto encourage them to report any illegal activity in their area to the
default 
defaultrelevant authorities in order to protect their livelihoods. In our
default 
defaultexperience, retailers are often best placed to do so, however they suffer
default 
defaultfrom the lack of joined up working between local police and Trading
default 
defaultStandards services.
default10. I felt it may be useful to include some of the recent cuttings from Asian
default 
defaultTrader on this topic which highlight just some of the concerns of our
default 
defaultretailers - you can find these attached.
default11. In the interests of transparency, Asian Media and Marketing Group
default 
defaultregularly receives funding from tobacco companies both for marketing
default 
defaultand campaigning purposes. However, the views expressed represent the
default 
defaultlegitimate concerns of our contributing retailers and readership. We
default 
defaultstand as guarantors of this.
default12. If I can be of any further assistance please don't hesitate to let me know
