Written evidence from the Asian Media and Marketing Group [TOB16]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. Asian Trader repr
[normal]esents a readership of over 200,
[normal]000 and we regularly
[normal] 
[normal]speak out on behalf of our 
[normal]readers to voice their concerns,
[normal] not just
[normal] 
[normal]through Asian Trader but also
[normal],
[normal] on their behalf to Members of Parliament.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his readership includes over 47,
[normal]000 convenience stores and newsagents
[normal] nationwide,
[normal] which make a huge
[normal] contribution to the UK economy,
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]not just financially - they are often the heartbeat of
[normal] 
[normal]their community.
[normal]2. The Asian community owns over 75% of all convenience
[normal] 
[normal]stores/newsagents nationwide. As such convenience retailing
[normal],
[normal] and the
[normal] 
[normal]struggles independent store owners face
[normal],
[normal] is a key concern of ours and
[normal]one we regularly write about. Only to frequently do we cover the impact
[normal] 
[normal]of the illicit tobacco trade on our honest retailers and their local
[normal] 
[normal]communities.
[normal]3. In our experience,
[normal] counterfeiting and smuggling is already having a
[normal] 
[normal]devastating effect on small retailers. In addition to the illicit trade costing
[normal] 
[normal]the taxpayer almost £2bn according to the recent National Audit Office
[normal] 
[normal]report - and this is conservative as these are HMRC figures based on
[normal] 
[normal]2011 data - the average convenien
[normal]ce retailer loses more than £40,
[normal]000
[normal] 
[normal]every year through illegal tobacco sales. Illicit traders - often part of
[normal] 
[normal]criminal gangs - continue to lurk in street corners across the UK with no
[normal]regard to who buy their products.
[normal]4. The inability of HMRC to control the illicit trade in tobacco products gives
[normal] 
[normal]smugglers and counterfeiters a platform to expand their illegal activities.
[normal] 
[normal]It is clear from the recent National Audit Office report that not enough is
[normal] 
[normal]being done by HMRC and Government to tackle the illegal trade in Roll
[normal] 
[normal]Your Own (RYO) and cigarette smu
[normal]ggling. According to the report,
[normal] non
[normal]-
[normal]duty
[normal] 
[normal]paid product for RYO and cigarettes represent 38% and 9% of UK
[normal] 
[normal]sales - our readers have told us this is more like 49% and 14%
[normal] 
[normal]respectively.
[normal]5. Furthermore the majority of stores are run by families where ladies are
[normal] 
[normal]at the till and are being exposed to threats and violence by criminal
[normal] 
[normal]gangs.
[normal]6. The Police are unable to respond in time and often will not attend unless
[normal] 
[normal]blood has been spilled.
[normal]7. These stores are at the heart of their local community and play an
[normal] 
[normal]integral part on the High Street.
[normal]8. Whilst many areas of this inquiry our out of scope for our comment, on
[normal] 
[normal]behalf of our readers we wanted to thank the Home Affairs Select
[normal] 
[normal]Committee for launching this inquiry. The Government needs to
[normal] 
[normal]crackdown on the illicit trade, and introduce more severe penalties for
[normal] 
[normal]criminals who knowingly sell illegal product to smokers.
[normal]9. As an organisation we are happy to play our part in assisting with this
[normal] 
[normal]where we can; and we will continue to work with Asian Trader retailers
[normal] 
[normal]to encourage them to report any illegal activity in their area to the
[normal] 
[normal]relevant authorities in order to protect their livelihoods. In our
[normal] 
[normal]experience, retailers are often best placed to do so, however they suffer
[normal] 
[normal]from the lack of joined up working between local police and Trading
[normal] 
[normal]Standards services.
[normal]10. I felt it may be useful to include some of the recent cuttings from Asian
[normal] 
[normal]Trader on this topic which highlight just some of the concerns of our
[normal] 
[normal]retailers - you can find these attached.
[normal]11. In the interests of transparency, Asian Media and Marketing Group
[normal] 
[normal]regularly receives funding from tobacco companies both for marketing
[normal] 
[normal]and campaigning purposes. However, the views expressed represent the
[normal] 
[normal]legitimate concerns of our contributing retailers and readership. We
[normal] 
[normal]stand as guarantors of this.
[normal]12. If I can be of any further assistance please don't hesitate to let me know
