"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by  Shaare Zedek &#xa0;\nSummaryShaare Zedek Medical Centre is a microcosm of \nthe society that \nleaders strive to create in the region; a community of people from all religions, ethnicities and backgrounds who live and work together side by side regardless of their circumstances. \n[1]\nThrough employment opportunities, \ninstitutional collaboration, \nmedi\ncal treatment and research, Shaare Zedek delivers a \nmodel of coexistence in action, often at great financial expense to the hospital. [2]\nVario\nus research initiatives exist\n specifically\n to\n advance the medical treatment of Palestinians and Arab patients. Me\ndical departments including the Paediatric Dialysis Unit treat mo\nre Arab patients than \nf\nrom\n any other ethnic background. [3]\nEven d\nuring times of political tension and violence\n,\n the hospital continues to \nadhere to \nits principles of patient care without pre\njudice. [4]\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Shaare Zedek Medical CentreShaare Zedek UK raises vital funds to support the work of the Shaare Zedek Medical Centre in Jerusalem. \nLiterally meaning \n“Gates of Righteousness,” Shaare Zedek has responded to the needs of Jerusalem’s uniquely diverse population from its very first day of operation \nin 1902\n;\n treating patients of every race, religio\nn and nationality\n regardless of financial circumstances. \nMedi\ncal excellence, patient dignity and a compassionate individualised approach to all\n are core to our\n mission\n. \nAdditionally, t\nhe \n1,000 bed \nhospital maintains its reputation as an internationally-regarded research and teaching hospital, committed to advancing \nscientific progress, innovation and technology.\n [5]\nShaare Zedek, with its century-long tradition of offering quality medical care to all in Jerusalem, has been a highly positive force in the city’\ns development\n and has contributed greatly to residents’ qua\nlity of life.\n&#xa0;\n Today, it is considered to be in the top echelon of med\nical institutions in Israel, despite receiving \nno government funding\n \nfor equipment, development or research. \n[6]\nCoexistence as a way of lifeVisiting dignitaries\n,\n including British Parliamentarians\n,\n often ask about \nefforts taken to advance\n coexistence at the hospital. Coexistence is a way of life \nat Shaare Zedek. \nPatient ethnicity is not recorded upon admission but the hospital \nestimates that \nthe ethnic makeup of \nits patient population is very similar to th\nat\n of Jerusalem as a whole; \napproximately 70\n% Jewish, 30% Arab. Our patients are referred from all over Israel and surrounding areas including \nt\nhe \nPalesti\nnian Territories\n and other countries including the United \nArab \nEmirates\n.\n [7]\nOur staff also \nclosely mirrors\n Jerusalem’s ethnic and religious composition.\n&#xa0;\n We have several senior staff members from the Arab and Palestinian communities, including our chief cardiothoracic surgeon, a senior anesthetist, a senior uro\nlogist, and a senior cardiologist.\n [8]\nCertain departments of the hospital have a patient mix which varies significantly from the average for a variety of reasons.\n&#xa0;\n For instance, approximately two-thirds of the patients in our \nPaediatric\n Dialysis Unit are Arabs, because of a genetic predisposition in that population to kidney disease.\n \nI\nn order to better meet the edu\ncational and social needs of the\nse\n yo\nung patients and their families, the \nPaediatric\n Dialysis Unit\n has an Arab social worker \nand an Arab teacher on staff. \n [9]\nInterestingly, while in the “outside world,” there is minimal contact between ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arabs, in the \nP\na\nediatric\n Dialysis Unit, \npatients and families \nfrom both cultures \nmix freely.\n&#xa0;\n Families with children su\nffering from kidney disease find that they have much more in common than that which divides them.\n This sense of community was witnessed by \nCouncillor\n Vikki Slade on a recent visit to the hospital:\n [9]\n“These children have to come into the hospital on a \ndaily or alternate daily basis, something which has an incredible impact on the family lives of those involved. I was heartened to watch parents sit with children from the opposite side of the political divide while their own parents went to pick up other \nsiblings from school or leave the bedside for other reasons.”\n [10]\nShaare Zedek’s approach is not to ignore religious and ethnic differences; it is rather to show respect for them.\n&#xa0;\n This approach is demonstrated in a number of areas.\n&#xa0;\n A perfect example t\nakes place in the M\nuslim\n month of Ramadan, when religiously observant Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset.\n&#xa0;\n Shaare\n Zedek provides a special \nmeal for its Muslim staff members, scheduled to begin precisely at sunset.\n \n[11]\n&#xa0;\nArab patientsThe policy \nof \n“political blindness” comes at a great cost to the hospital.\n&#xa0;\n While Israeli citizens are entitled by law to health coverage through one of the country’s health funds, non-citizens like those who com\ne from the Palestinian Authority\n have no such coverage and\n often these cases are completely uninsured.\n [12]\nWhile severe limitations have been placed on the number of patients coming into Israel from the P\nalestinian \nA\nuthority\n, there are still a significant number of Palestinians being treated in Israeli hospitals\n, including Shaare Zedek.\n&#xa0;\n The cost to the hospital to treat these largely uninsured patients is well in excess of $100,000 per year.\n [13]\nDespite this\n, it is our pledge as a modern medical \ncent\nre\n driven \nby compassion and not politics \nto ensure that when a\n patient arrives at our doors in need of help, he or she will not be deprived.\n \n[14]\nA story which illustrates th\nis approach is t\nhat of a three year \nold girl rushed to Shaare Zedek from Nablus with severe kidney failure. The close relationship between the h\nead of the hospital in Nablus and the head of \nPaediatric\n Nephrology at Shaare Zedek meant one phone call ensured a crash team were waiting for her on arrival. She died on the operating table but the medical team managed to stabilize her and brought her bac\nk to life after which she made \na remarkable\n recovery in the care of the \nPaediatric\n Dialysis Unit. \nThis life saving collaboration was only possible \nbecause of the \nclose relationship between the \ntwo \ndoctors. Shaare Zedek \nwas\n \nfully \naware that there was no aut\nhorization from the Palestinian Authority to treat her\n and even if such authorization had been given it would not have covered most of the cost of the treatment. \nShaare Ze\ndek covered the full cost of the girl’s\n treatment. \nSuch stories are a regular occurre\nnce at Shaare Zedek\n and are part of the hospital’s contribution to peace\nful coexistence\n.  \n[15]\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCoexistence at times of political conflictShaare Zedek is not immune to the effects of terrorism. The direct impact on the number of patients and the \nincreased demand for emergency and trauma medicine is immense. During such periods staff-\noften \nincluding those whose family members have been victims of attacks- continue their work on the \nunderstanding that those who enter our doors \nare patients first and\n foremost\n and the duty of doctors and nurses is to heal.\n&#xa0;\n \nFollowing a shooting during the Second Intifada one young patient recounted how a team of Arab and Jewish doctors had brought her back to life:\n [16]\n“\nA bullet ripped through my chest and into my lun\ng. Two women were killed during that attack and dozens more, beside me, were wounded.\n \nI was taken by ambulance to Shaare Zedek Medical Centre and by the time we made it to the hospital, I had no pulse and no blood pressure. I was considered dead on arrival\n. Through the skilled hands of Dr. Shuli Silberman and Dr. Mahar Deeb, a Jewish and Arab doctor working together, they performed a miracle and brought me back to life. After the surgery, was a long recovery process. My after-care specialist, Dr. Salah Odat\nallah, stayed by my side through my stay in the ICU and then in the regular ward. But that was not enough. During my stay we formed a strong bond and when I was given permission to return to Chicago, he insisted he fly back with me to ensure my safe return\n.\n”\n [17]\nShaare Zedek also treated a number of Arab victims of terror attacks during the Intifada.\n One victim, \nIbrahim\n,\n explained the importance of a social workers’ support for his brother after they were both brought to Shaare Zedek \nsuffering injuries fr\nom a bus bombing\n:\n [18]\n “For him to see just how much the staff cares about him, the way everyone wants to help, has made a big difference to him.”\n [19]\n&#xa0;\nResearch &#xa0;In the area of research, we have conducted a number of studies in cooperation with \nJordanian and Palestinian physicians and hospitals, including a comparative study of the use of pain medication for cancer patients in various institutions, and a genetics study to identify mutations associated with a high risk of breast cancer.\n&#xa0;\n Cooperati\nve research with Palestinian institutions has been curtailed to some extent because the risk of terrorism has impeded travel, but staff members on both sides are doing their best to continue working together.\n [20]\nBeing \nbased in the heart of Jerusalem\n,\n Sha\nare Zedek is fortunate to have a diverse population of people with a wide ethnic pool\n which provides\n a \nfantastic \nresou\nrce for research. Recent studies \nlooking specifically at Jewish and Arab populations \ninclude research into \nchildren\n’\ns smoking habits \n and\n diabetes\n.\n [21]\n&#xa0;\nA major focus of research int\no inherited diseases\n is identifying the mutations responsible for genetic diseases in children. In Jerusalem, marriage between relatives or within a small ethnic group is still common and\n,\n combined with large \nfamily size, this results in a higher frequency of genetic diseases in children. Some diseases are common, e.g. Tay Sachs, which is now prevented by prior testing, but many of these often devastating diseases are specific to a particular family. Advances i\nn genetic technology make it possible to identify the mutation causing the disease. This can help the family prevent further affected children (e.g. by \npre-implantation genetic diagnosis\n) and also provides important insights into the functions of various g\nen\nes. We have already identified seven new disease genes in the past three\n years.\n [22]\n&#xa0;\nResearch activity in the Medical Genetics Institute includes collaboration with Palestinian colleagues to determine inherited mutations that affect breast cancer risk \nin Arab women\n. The Breast Health Centre is \nalso \nworking on a comparative study examining the characteristics \nand stages of diagnosis \nof Arab \nand Jewish \nbreast cancer patients \nin Jerusalem\n.\n [23]\n&#xa0;Shaare Zedek &amp; UK Government Shaare Zedek’s collaborative \napproach to medicine was first raised in Parliament by Lord Turnberg during a Parliamentary debate in 2003:\n [24]\n “I was very encouraged by a meeting that I had with representatives of the Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem, who described efforts that they\n were making to work with a major hospital in Amman in Jordan and in Ramallah in the Palestinian territories. They were developing plans jointly to provide humanitarian aid of a medical type in a co-ordinated way for the survivors of conflicts in Iraq and \nother places in the Middle East. Will it be possible for the UK to work with those organisations to support them and others which are working in a co-ordinated operation?”\n [25]\nThis project did not receive support from UK Government but contact remains be\ntween the institutions. \n[26]\nWe would welcome a visit by the \nCommittee to the hospital to gain a greater understanding of Shaare Zedek’s work in medical collaboration across communities. \n[27\n]\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAppendices&#xa0;\nLetter written for Shaare Zedek UK newsletter from Councillor PPC Vikki Slade following a visit to Shaare Zedek, September 2013\n&#xa0;\nAs foreign aid and field hospitals arrive in the Philippines this week I am reminded of my inspirat\nional trip to Israel and Palestine last month and the account from two members of the Israeli rescue mission to Haiti after their devastating earthquake.\nOur LDFI (Liberal Democrat Friends of Israel) Parliamentary visit was intended to provide an understa\nnding of the geo-political situation in Israel and Palestine and we were privileged to meet a range of political and social figures on both sides along with families living in Jerusalem who hosted us for their Shabbat dinners.\nOur first encounter at the h\nospital was the Paediatric Dialysis Unit where I was struck by the sheer number of children from all ethnic backgrounds who suffer from genetic kidney disorders. We were told that this has become prevalent partly due to limited integration in small communi\nties. These children have to come into the hospital on a daily or alternate daily basis, something which has an incredible impact on the family lives of those involved. I was heartened to watch parents sit with children from the opposite side of the politi\ncal divide while their own parents went to pick up other siblings from school or leave the bedside for other reasons.\nElsewhere in the hospital we toured the Emergency department, funded by generous donations and named for a British family who support a n\number of medical establishments in Israel. \n&#xa0;\nIts design is unusual in that it forms a series of concentric circles, helping specialists to work across the unit more effectively, and it is built underground to make it resilient to the attacks that were a fea\nture of Jerusalem in the past.\n&#xa0;\nAs a first time visitor to Jerusalem, the Shaare Zedek Medical Centre provided a real ray of hope among the political turmoil surrounding its historic building. A place of love, welcome to all whatever their race or religio\nn. \n&#xa0;\nOf all the places we visited in the country, this was the place I witnessed the world in one place – staff, patients and visitors representing almost every nation of the world. \n&#xa0;\nComing together with love and showing humanity's similarities rather than \nfocusing on our differences.\n&#xa0;\nCllr Vikki Slade\nProspective Parliamentary Candidate\nFor UK General Election in Mid Dorset &amp; North Poole\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n “\nShaare Zedek is hospital of choice for citizen of \nUnited Arab Emirates\n” Shaare Zedek Medical Centre (SZMC) website 2002 \nhttp://www.szmc.org.\nil/NewsHighlights/ShaareZedekishospitalofchoiceforcitizenof/tabid/729/Default.aspx\n&#xa0;\n Appendix 1\n \nhttp://www.hospitalwithaheart.ca/stories/success-stories/\nhttp://www.szmc.org.il/NewsHighlights/\nS\ntereotypesbreakdownanArabvictimofArabter/tabid/817/Default.aspx\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.szmc.org.il/NewsHighlights/Massive17kg3lb12oztumorsuccessfullyr/tabid/954/Default.aspx\n&#xa0;\n Shaare Zedek Research Report 2013 p177 \nhttp://www.slideshare.net/ShaareZedekMedicalCenter/ss-27935732\n Shaare Zedek Research Report 2013, p55-57 \nhttp://ww\nw.slideshare.net/ShaareZedekMedicalCenter/ss-27935732\n \n Shaare Zedek Research Report 2013, p55 \nhttp://www.slideshare.net/ShaareZedekMedicalCenter/ss-27935732\n&#xa0;\n Shaare Zedek\n Research Report 2013, p211 \nhttp://www.slideshare.net/ShaareZedekMedicalCenter/ss-27935732\n&#xa0;\n Hansard \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030319/text/30319-05.htm#30319-05_spnew11\n&#xa0;\n"
