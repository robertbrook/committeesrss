[[[              ]]]

[[[Introduction]]]

[[[.]]]1.1              Natural England is the Government’s statutory adviser on the natural environment. Natural England’s purpose is to ensure that the natural environment is conserved, enhanced and managed for the benefit of present and future generations, thereby contributing to sustainable development.&#xa0;1.2              Natural England is responsible for delivering, on behalf of the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Environmental Stewardship and other schemes which offer payments to farmers and other land managers in England for undertaking land management practices, which go beyond minimal regulatory compliance, to protect and enhance the environment and wildlife. These schemes form part of the current Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) (2007-2013). Natural England delivers over 51,000 agri-environment agreements, covering about 70% of English agricultural land, which provide over £400m support each year for environmental land management by farmers and land managers.  &#xa0;1.3              Natural England is also Defra’s largest deliverer of on-farm advice. Our advisers deliver around 13,000 farm visits each year advising on a range of environmental, ecological, agronomic and management issues, specialising in helping farmers access funding streams for environmental land management and assessing the outcomes they deliver. We deliver our advice through face to face visits; to groups; through farm walks, demonstrations, farmer meetings and conferences. In addition, we provide telephone support and on line services to farmers to support their delivery of our agri-environment programmes.  As well as delivering advice, we work closely with farmers to monitor the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes and the contribution they make to environmental outcomes. These include the impacts on individual habitats and species; landscapes such as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) and National Parks; and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), our most important sites for biodiversity. For example RDPE underpins 60% of our terrestrial SSSI’s managed under HLS and 67% of priority biodiversity action plan (BAP) habitat.1.4              The latest thinking on the design of future agri-environment schemes signals a move away from the existing open-to-all entry level stewardship (ELS) offer which is currently taken up on the majority of the 70% of agricultural land that is under agri-environment agreements, (within this 28% has HLS (in addition to ELS) agreements or older Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) or Countryside Stewardship (CS) agreements) to a more focused approach designed to achieve more concentrated and coordinated management change in specific areas.  A highly targeted site-specific offer for high priority sites on farmed land (e.g. statutory designations such as SSSIs), broadly analogous to the existing higher level stewardship (HLS), is anticipated to remain.  A more widely available element supporting simple one-off investments designed to deliver environmental benefits is also being explored by Defra. The successor scheme is anticipated to launch during 2015 with the first agreements starting on the 1st January 2016. 1.5              The scale of the environmental challenge is significant.  Delivering the Department’s Biodiversity 2020 strategy (including EU level commitments under the Habitats and Birds Directives) and requirements under the Water Framework Directive have recently been estimated to cost approximately £1bn/yr.  Similar estimates have also been generated by previous work.  This requirement is in excess of twice the funding available under the current programme and, although some alternative funding sources exist, they are currently small scale. The future RDPE will remain the main source of funding to deliver these policy objectives for the foreseeable future.  Consequently there will be a need for clear and transparent prioritisation between different policy objectives and also scheme targeting processes that seek to exploit the maximum synergy across the delivery of policy objectives wherever possible.1.6              The framework of EU legislation that will govern the future CAP is becoming clearer.  However, there are many outstanding issues that will be significant considerations for implementation and which remain to be clarified as part of the Implementing Regulations and Delegated Acts.  Many domestic policy decisions that will impact on the implementation of the future CAP also remain to be taken. Without this detail the scope to finalise implementation planning is limited at this stage.  It is also important to note that Defra is leading work to develop the new digitalised CAP services to support delivery of the future CAP and has yet to confirm the detailed release and delivery arrangements for the future service.  It is within this context that our evidence is provided.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Fairness]]]

[[[.]]]2.1               Ultimately fairness can be considered at many different scales and levels and is a function of policy decisions.  Throughout the whole process of negotiations, Defra Ministers have been at pains to stress that the CAP reform must be ‘fair’ for the environment, taxpayers and consumers, as well as farmers  The implementation of the reforms clearly must retain this broad perspective, balancing any conflicting pressures among these different actors to ensure the most effective attainment of explicit Government policy priorities. In the context of future CAP implementation two broad types of issue arise: &#xa0;              

[[[Modulation]]]2.3              Any consideration of fairness in this context also needs to take into account the underlying distribution of Pillar 2 funds between Member States.  This continues to be based on ‘historic’ patterns of spend pre-2000, rather than any objective criteria that reflect the need for spending to achieve defined policy objectives through Pillar 2 support, and results in an extremely low UK Pillar 2 allocation.  Conversely, the UK Pillar 1 allocation is close to the EU average (although there are significant differences both within the UK and between EU countries and indeed, between the payment regions within England).  These distributional issues have been subject to extensive analysis.  Therefore, any transfer from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 needs to be considered in this context - as utilising the flexibility of EU-level regulation to better reflect domestic circumstances and priorities.  A reduction in the level of modulation resulting in reduced Pillar 2 budgets could effectively penalise those already doing the right thing by the environment and their expectations regarding ongoing access to Pillar 2 funding.2.4              Regardless of the underlying position there is no evidence that modulation during the current period has resulted in any competitive disadvantage, as a study for the European Commission has demonstrated.  There are many factors, such as exchange rate fluctuations and national taxation policies, which drive the relative competitiveness of farming in different countries.  Furthermore there is also good evidence that spending on Pillar 2 delivers both agronomic and economic benefits in addition to environmental ones .  For example £1m of HLS expenditure generates 2.3 FTE additional jobs and £1.72m additional spending in the local economy (compared to no-scheme).  Based on anticipated annual scheme spend in 2013 ES will sustain 778 jobs and generate £415m of spending in the local economy.  The majority of these income and employment benefits are retained within the local economy (80%).

[[[              ]]]

[[[Environmental ambition of greening]]]2.5              The context for considering the most appropriate domestic implementation of the greening provisions can be usefully framed in the Government response to the EFRA Committee’s previous ‘Greening the CAP’ inquiry. In its response, the Government agreed with the Committee’s assertion that the Commission’s ‘one size fits all’ approach was too rigid and that it did not take into account variations in environmental circumstances or agronomic conditions.  The response also allowed the Government to reaffirm its commitment to “ensure a better balance of benefits to costs from greening” and to continue to work to “secure greater flexibility in recognition of Member State’s agricultural and agronomic diversity” .2. 6              The provisions for greening, agreed as part of the consolidated legislative text, provide considerable scope for a wide-range of implementation options from the basic practices through a range of specified ‘equivalent’ options or the alternative of a more flexible certification scheme approach.  In this respect Defra negotiators deserve praise for securing the ability to use a more flexible national certification scheme approach as the sole route to farmers meeting their greening obligations. However, it looks increasingly likely that the implementation of greening in England will be based solely on the three basic greening practices.  Our analysis suggests that, under this scenario, the overwhelming majority of farms will have to do little, if anything, to comply with the basic greening requirements and that greening in this form is unlikely to deliver measurable environmental benefits.  We elaborate on the other potential implications of such an implementation decision in Section&#xa0;4 of this submission. 

[[[              ]]]

[[[Scheme Access during transition]]]2.7              We are doing all that we can to ensure that the transition from the current programme to the new one is as smooth as possible for existing agreement holders, within the context of changing scheme rules and changing budgets.  Transition policies, announced by Defra in July, aim to provide support for new agreements during 2014 (subject to the final agreement of the necessary EU legislation). These new agreements will be available for farmers with old ESA or CS agreements that are coming to an end (2,808 such agreements end in 2014); for farmers with Organic ELS agreements that end in 2014 (170 OELS agreements end in 2014); for brand new Organic and Upland ELS applications; and for new HLS agreements that are necessary to address specific policy objectives before the start of the new Rural Development Programme (especially, but not exclusively, for the Water Framework Directive and for SSSIs). A draft annual budget of £30m has been set aside for these 2014 agreements. The latest position is detailed on the Natural England website.  2.8              Until now, the agri-environment programme has operated with flexible, monthly start dates.  However, the new programme rules will require a single common annual start date for all new multi-annual agri-environment commitments, to match the procedure adopted for SPS. Given that the secondary EU legislation (Implementing Regulations and Delegated Acts) is unlikely to be finalised before mid-2014 and that the next Rural Development Programme is unlikely to be approved by the European Commission until mid-2014 at the earliest, it is not going to be practicable to establish new multi-annual agreements in time for a 1st January 2015 start.  New multi-annual agreements under the future programme will not be available until 1st January 2016.  No existing higher level (or ESA or CS) agreements expire in 2015, so the new scheme will be ready when those agreements expire.  11,361 Entry Level Scheme agreements are due to expire during 2015, mostly in the later half of the year.  It is important to remember that multi-annual agreements are only one part of the future programme and that, subject to programme approval and policy decisions, it should be possible to offer payments for capital works, advice and training to support the delivery of environmental objectives (and wider schemes supporting economic/social objectives) during 2015. 

[[[              ]]]

[[[Future scheme targeting]]]2.9              An inevitable consequence of a move away towards a more focused and targeted scheme is that agreements under the landscape scale element of the future scheme will be more concentrated in certain geographical areas (reflecting the policy objective being addressed).  Agreements under the site-specific element will largely be focused on existing high value sites.  This is a necessary consequence of improving the environmental effectiveness of the scheme. However, the other elements of the Programme such as advice, training and capital works should, subject to policy decisions, be more universally available. 

[[[Future digital ]]]

[[[delivery]]]2.10              Defra has taken the decision that access to all future CAP schemes will be through digital channels.  Natural England already has extensive experience of operating a voluntary online application process for ELS, with 16,791 applications submitted via ELS online to date.  In 2012/13, 42% of applications were submitted online and 89% of customers providing feedback rated the overall quality of ELS online as good or excellent.  However, a mandated digital approach raises further implementation issues which are yet to be resolved, including:

[[[What st]]]

[[[s does the Government need to take to ensure the reformed CAP will be less bureaucratic than its predecessor and what might prevent this ambition from being achieved]]]?3.1              It is important to note that a narrow comparison of the public and private administrative burden of different elements of the CAP fails to recognise the value to society of the public goods that are being delivered.  This is especially true for Pillar 2 where a narrow focus on simplification/reducing delivery cost risks being detrimental to the delivery of environmental outcomes.  On this point we note the useful guiding principle provided in the March 2011 Agriculture Council paper on simplification, which was roundly supported by the UK and around three-quarters of EU Member States. It reads: “An acceptable justification for increased cost might include better targeting of funding towards the provision of public goods, or a reduction in risk to EU funds – providing these benefits exceed the costs of achieving that”

[[[              ]]]

[[[Interface between ]]]

[[[Pillar 1]]]

[[[ and Pillar 2]]]3.2              The addition of greening in Pillar 1 is almost certain to add to, rather than reduce, the overall level of complexity and administrative burden (for applicants and delivery bodies alike).  From a Pillar 2 delivery body perspective this is likely to add complexity in the following ways:&#xa0;              

[[[Pillar 2]]]3.3              The design of the new environmental land management scheme is intended to both improve environmental effectiveness and reduce public and private administrative burden.  Specific design decisions that address these issues include:3.4               Natural England and Defra are adhering to the principles laid down by the Macdonald review by being open and transparent and we are working very closely with customers and stakeholders on the design and development of the new environmental land management scheme. We have a customer panel which is made up of 12 ES agreement holders who have been nominated by NFU, CLA and TFA and we have consulted extensively with stakeholder organisations on the review of scheme management options.3.5              Natural England has already made significant improvements in delivery efficiency and customer focus during the current programme and has also gained Customer Service Excellence (CSE) accreditation. Our current average customer satisfaction rating is 84%.  Natural England has considerably improved the way in which we offer HLS agreements to farmers over the past few years. We have gone from a reactive stance at the start of HLS in 2006, providing only broad-brush targeting advice, to a much more proactive approach.  We have published detailed advice on the HLS opportunities in local areas.  We now discuss opportunities for potential HLS agreements with farmers and agents at local “clinics” before they have to embark on detailed applications. This is followed-up with detailed, on-farm advice when the suggested HLS applications are taken forward. 3.6              In 2013/14 the RDPE delivered by Natural England will be £477m.  The total staff cost which comes from our Grant in Aid for delivering this is approximately £9m (549 FTE) without IT costs which are £10.2m. This represents less than 2% without IT costs and less than 4% when IT costs are included. Improvements in delivery efficiency since 2007/08 are presented in Table 1.

[[[Greening]]]

[[[How should the Government ensure that CAP delivers the best environmental benefits while supporting food production]]]

[[[?]]]4.1              We fully appreciate the considerable delivery challenge and disallowance risk that implementing greening (in any form) by 2015 represents and that this favours an implementation based on the basic greening measures, at least in the short-term (see Defra’s forthcoming consultation).  Indeed we face challenges handling the interface between existing agri-environment agreements and greening to ensure that there is no double funding between greening and agri-environment payments.  However, such an implementation of greening is unlikely to generate measurable environmental benefits.   In this context it will be critical that implementation decisions across the whole of the future CAP represent the best overall balance between minimising the public and private costs of delivery, minimising the risk of disallowance and maximising the delivery of environmental public goods for society from public funding. A comprehensive programme of environmental monitoring and evaluation of greening, to enable an accurate assessment of the environmental benefits of the policy, will also be important.4.2              The relationship between sustainability and agricultural production is sometimes referred to as a balance or trade-off: there is an assumption that actions taken to improve environmental performance decrease production and vice versa.  Sometimes this is the case, but often production is only increased in the short term or requires significant additional inputs.  Integrated actions resulting in win-win outcomes are possible, enhancing both farming’s sustainability and its productivity.  In addition, the services provided by the natural environment are vital to production.  Sustainability, by definition, is a necessary pre-requisite of ongoing agricultural productivity. Evidence demonstrates that the longer-term sustainability of food production is inherently linked to the integration of environmental and agronomic priorities. 4.3              Experience from current delivery has demonstrated that delivering the majority of environmental objectives effectively is inherently complex and that Pillar 2 is generally the best tool for supporting this.  There is no evidence that voluntary environmental land management agreements under Pillar 2 have any significant negative impact on levels of food production or productivity – the majority of evidence indicates that they actually contribute to sustainable production eg floristic margins supporting pollinators.

[[[Lessons learnt]]]

[[[What are the principal lessons the Government should learn from the implementation of the previous CAP]]]

[[[?]]]5.1              A range of lessons learned reviews were undertaken, principally of Pillar 1 implementation, following the previous reform. The delivery of activity under Pillar 2 of the CAP, especially Environmental Stewardship, has typically been less problematic.  The mid-term evaluation (MTE) of the current rural development programme concluded that “Axis 2 Measures [Improving the environment and countryside] have generally performed well, with outputs and results in line with targets and broadly positive feedback from beneficiaries and stakeholders”.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Conclusion]]]6.1              The limited core Pillar 2 budget that is likely to be available in England coupled with the scale of environmental need means that it will be important that domestic implementation decisions, such as the transfer of funds from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 and the design of greening in Pillar 1, represent the best overall balance between minimising the public and private costs of delivery, minimising the risk of disallowance and maximising the environmental benefits for society from public funding. 6.2              Agri-environment schemes in Pillar 2 have a proven track record of delivering environmental benefits and help to support the long-term sustainability of agricultural systems.  However, even with the maximum permitted rate of transfer from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 and a future RDPE focused on the delivery of environmental objectives it will not be possible for the future programme to satisfy all environmental policy objectives and there will be a need for clear and transparent prioritisation between objectives.6.3              Natural England has overseen the ongoing evolution and development of agri-environment schemes during the current programme. We have successfully delivered improvements to scheme design intended to improve environmental effectiveness alongside improved customer satisfaction and significant efficiency savings. 6.4              Natural England is working closely with Defra, the Rural Payments Agency, Forestry Commission, Environment Agency and stakeholders to ensure that the transition to and implementation of the future environmental land management scheme under the next RDPE is a smooth as possible. We are also working hard to simplify the design of the scheme and simultaneously improve its environmental effectiveness.  However, there remain considerable implementation challenges that can only be fully addressed when there is greater clarity about the EU legal framework and domestic policy decisions have been confirmed.
