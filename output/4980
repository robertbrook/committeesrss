defaultExecutive Summary
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.a. 
defaultReason for submission defaultWe are submitting our evidence as the only 
defaultprogramme
default in the Middle East to bring together young adults (students) from Palestine, Israel
default,
default 
defaultJordan 
defaultand internationally for extended periods of living and studying together. We believe deeply in the importance of 
defaultthe 
defaultlong-term 
defaultand in-depth 
defaultcontact and skills buil
defaultding offered at the Arava Institute as 
defaultthe
default most meaningful and successful 
defaultbridge for real trust-building and cooperation in the Middle East.
default&#xa0;
default1.b. 
defaultOrganizationaldefault Profile defaultThe Arava Institute makes an ongoing and innovative contribution to peace education 
defaultand social justice through its mission to train the next generation of environmental leaders in the Middle East to work together to solve critical regional challenges. Since 1996, the Arava Institute has educated over 800 environmental and social justice l
defaulteaders who have the technical literacy and practical skills to build a more peaceful and sustainable 
defaultMiddle
default East.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Arava Institute for Environmental Studies (AIES) —one of the leading environmental academic and research institutions in the Middle East—
default challenges the mindset that peace and cooperation cannot be achieved in the Middle East. Even in times of conflict, AIES provides a positive paradigm for relationships between Jews and Arabs in the region, one that builds trust and understanding. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAIES is the only nongovernmental organization in the Middle East to provide Jews and Arabs 
defaultfrom the region 
defaultthe opportunity to live, study and work together. Many students arrive with fears and trepidation about meeting “the other” for the first time
default. The 
defaultA
defaultrava Institute 
defaulthelps 
defaulttransform these
default misperceptions and fears into friendships and understanding, and most importantly into trusting partnerships that sustain, even in the 
defaultface of conflict. 
default 
default A quote from 
defaulta 
defaultPalestinian alumna expresses these achievements: 
default“We are not just talking about it, we are doing it. We are changing things together.” 
default&#xa0;
default2.a
default. 
defaultPeacebuilding and Environmental Leadership Seminar - 
defaultPELS
defaultThe Peacebuilding and Environmental Leadership S
defaulteminar (PELS)
default 
defaultis a compulsory, non-credit component of the Institute's academic studies 
defaultprogramme
default that consists of discussions, workshops, guest lectures and field trips that provides a safe forum for students to investigate aspects of the social and political context in which environmental problems develop, as well as the kinds of relationships neede
defaultd to foster a more just, peaceful and ecologically secure future.
default 
defaultPELS creates a facilitated forum for participants to express their views on race, religion, culture, identity
default, history
default and the current political situation. Participants gain a deeper unders
defaulttanding of the cultural and political sensitivities inherent in such discussions, as well as gain leadership and communication skills needed to establish and maintain cooperation across the region.

defaultThe 
defaultCentre
default for Transboundary Water Management (
defaultCTWM
default)
defaultThe 
defaultCentre
default for Transboundary Water Management (CTWM) is a research 
defaultcentre
default led by Dr. Clive Lipchin 
defaultusing
default a multi-disciplinary cross-border approach to water management in our region.  Research areas include wastewater management in transboundary watershed
defaults, the Red Sea – Dead Sea Pipeline, solar desalination and more. The 
defaultCentre
default regularly promotes and holds stakeholder meetings and conferences between Palestinian, Jordanian and Israeli water professionals and stakeholders – be they engineers, politicians, 
defaultNGOs, students, 
defaultand 
defaultmore
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll our Research 
defaultCentres
default (Long-term Ecological Research; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Agriculture) work on a cross-boundary approach with joint research with Jordanian and Palestinian partners.

default2.c
default. The Arava Alumni Peace and 
defaultEnvironmental Network (
defaultAAPEN
default)
defaultStudents leave the Arava Institute poised to cooperatively implement initiatives that raise public awareness about forgiveness, peace, and sustainability. These young leaders are building a more peaceful and sustainable future
default in the Middle East, the United States, and throughout the world.  The Arava Alumni Peace and Environmental Network (AAPEN) supports
default over 800
default alumni in maintaining connections with each other and serves as a forum for the exchange of ideas and creation of new initiatives, functioning as a network of young professionals working on peace and the environment in the Middle East.
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite the trials and tribulations of life in the Middle East, our students manage to maintain communication. For example, w
defaulthen violence in Gaza escalated 
defaultin 
defaultautumn
default 
defaultof 2012
default, it was 
defaultthanks to
default PELS that Arava students knew how to support
default and talk to
default one a
defaultnother. In student-led PELS dialogue 
defaultgroups,
default they spoke candidly about their identity, their fears, and their hopes of dispelling centuries-old animosity with forgiveness and 
defaultlove.
default&#xa0;
default Through PELS, the foundation for respectful communication had been establi
defaultshed so that when the discussions came to an end, students continued to express their solidarity through small but meaningful gestures. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThroughout
default various political crises, we have witnessed other dialogue groups 
defaultfall apart
default. Our alumni network continues 
defaultto meet, cooperate and work together, at times while communicating serious disagreement, despite difficult times, relying on tools of listening and trust developed as students
default at the Arava Institute
default.
defaultApproximately 70% of our graduates work in related fields of environment, peace-building, community organization, 
defaultand so on
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe submitted
default a
default PELS proposal to the 
defaultB
defaultritish 
defaultE
defaultmbassy in 2012.
default 
defaultWe were not aware of the possibility of other British funding for our work in the region.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Academic 
defaultProgramme
default as a whole costs 
defaultapproximately 
default470,000
default 
defaultGDP per 
defaultyear
default.
defaultThe PELS 
defaultProgramme
default specifically costs 
default56,000 GDP
default 
defaultper semester.
defaultStudent scholarships, especially for Jordanian and Palestinian students, cost 
default5,500 GDP
default 
defaultper semester
