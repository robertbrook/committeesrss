"3\n                            &#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Matt Hodges (CYS0031)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nANNEX&#xa0;\nRe Paragraph 8&#xa0;\nThis van passed so close to me I felt the draft and is now passing this tandem with a young child on the back. This totally ignores the Highway Code rule to give cyclists plenty of room in case they need to avoid a dangerous road surface.\nRe Paragraph 8&#xa0;\nThis van is less than two feet from the cyclist’s rear wheel and went on to drive past causing the cyclist to swerve left.\nRe Paragraph 9&#xa0;\nIf I hadn’t slowed down I would be near the rear wheel of that bus.\nRe Paragraph 10&#xa0;This car has just passed me and turned left across my path. As I had been watching its erratic course in my mirror it didn’t take me by surprise.\nRe Paragraph 12This is a bit far away but the movie clearly shows the cyclist swerve right to avoid the taxi as it pulled out of the side road.\nRe Paragraph 14&#xa0;\nOvertaking into a blind bend. Again a bit far away but the van and the oncoming car both had to jam their brakes on to avoid a collision. But it might have swerved left and hit the cyclists. The movie clip went to the police and the driver received a section 59 warning.\nRe Paragraph 14&#xa0;\nI had just passed a line of parked cars. Now this articulated truck is grinding through the gears as it accelerates to pass me before the narrowing at the pedestrian refuge. I have to slow down as I have no idea how far over it will come.\nRe Paragraph 15&#xa0;\nI have had my hand out since this car was more than 75 metres behind me but he blasts past as I am lining up to turn into the road at the end of the black railings. Unfortunately the rain on my camera lens meant the number plate was not legible.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
