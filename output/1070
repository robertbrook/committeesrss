default  
default&#xa0;defaultI default              default The issue of denying prisoners voting rightsdefault&#xa0;defaultM
defaulty observations 
defaultwill be confined 
defaultto the issue of principle:  the question of a total ban on prisoners
default’
default voting.
default&#xa0;defaultIt 
defaulti
defaults helpful to address this issue by examining the first three questions raised in the Call for Evidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultI.1.default              defaultQuestion 1.  defaultWhat are the historical and philosophical justifications for denying prisoners the right to vote?default&#xa0;defaultI.1.1.
default              
defaultThe historical justifications 
default&#xa0;
defaultHistorically, convicted criminals were “outlaws”, who could be killed on sight.  Under the common law
default,
default outlawry evolved into “attainder”, the status of all those convicted of felonies.
default  
defaultThat status entailed the loss of all civil rights, and amounted to “civic death”.
default   
default&#xa0;
defaultI.1.2.
default              
defaultIt is
default surely
default clear that such
default historical justifications 
defaultcannot 
defaulthave great force in the 21
defaultst
default century, even though the long history of the ban has been much relied upon as a justification.  (In the 2011 debate in the House of Commons, for example, it was stated:  “We decided in this country centuries ago that convicted criminals should not have the right to vote”
default.)
default 
default  It would widely be regarded as regrettable 
defaultif the current penal system were to be judged by 
default 
defaultthe standards which prevailed centuries ago.
default&#xa0;
defaultI.1.3.
default              
defaultIt may be thought that the Grand Chamber 
defaultof the Court 
defaultwas 
defaulttherefore 
defaultcorrect in 
defaultHi
defaultrst
default in refusing to attach value to a long-standing ban in the absence of an assessment of its appropriateness in the light of modern penal policy and current human rights standards.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultI.1.4.
default              
defaultThere is however one historical development of particular significance:  the introduction of postal voting
default under the Representation of the People Act 1948.  This made prisoners’ voting a practical possibility.
default&#xa0;
defaultI.1.5.
default              
defaultThe philosophical justifications
default&#xa0;
defaultUntil recently t
defaulthere was relatively little debate in Britain about the p
defaulthilosophical
default j
defaultustification
default for denying prisoners the right to vote.
default The justification was partly historical, and there was no recent debate on the issue in Parliament or, apparently, beyond. 
default One of the consequences of the ECHR was the need to consider justifications seriously.  So for example the UK in 
defaultH
defaulti
defaultrst 
defaultput forward careful argument which was in part accepted by the Court.
default&#xa0;
defaultI.1.6.
default              
defaultSeveral strands can be discerned in the
default recent
default debate on the issue of 
defaultwhether as a matter of 
defaultprinciple a ban is justified.
default  A brief comment may be made on the various strands.
default&#xa0;
defaultI.1.7. (1)
default              
defaultCan the ban be justified as p
defaultart of the offender’s punishment
default?
default  In general, the loss of amenities which accompanies incarceration can be seen as part of the offender’s punishment.  It is not obvious 
defaulthowever 
defaultthat deprivation of the right to vote is very significant in this context.
default  (See below, under question 3.)
default&#xa0;
defaultI.1.7. (2)
default              
defaultCan the ban be justified as e
defaultnhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law
default?
default  This was part of the argument advanced by the UK 
defaultin the 
defaultHirst 
defaultcase 
defaultand was accepted in principle
default as a justification
default by the Court.  However it could 
defaultclearly 
defaultalso be argued that
default, on the contrary, and in contrast with deprivation of other amenities, to
default 
defaultallow
default certain categories of prisoner to vote would “enhance civic responsibility”.
default&#xa0;
defaultI.1.8. (1)
default              
defaultCan the ban be justified as a
defaultn “inherent feature”
default of imprisonment?
default In the early years of the Convention, the European Commission of Human Rights 
defaultregularly 
defaultargued that certain restrictions of human rights were an 
default“
defaultinherent feature
default”
default of imprisonment, or that certain limitations on human rights were “inherent limitations”
default, i.e. limitations inherent in imprisonment
default.
default  So for example a prohibition on correspondence by prisoners was regarded as an inherent limitation.  That approach was dropped about forty years ago: it was recognised by the Court and the Commission that such limitations and restrictions must be justified by one of the public interests recognised under the Convention.
default&#xa0;
defaultI.2.default              defaultQuestion 2.   defaultWhy is the right to vote considered to be a human right?default&#xa0;defaultI.2.1.
default              
defaultThe right to vote has long been considered a 
defaultconstitutional and 
defaulthuman right.  It is recognised as such in the leading universal instrument on human rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966 (Article 25).  
default It is routinely included in modern constitutions and bills of rights.  It would no doubt be included in any new British Bill of Rights.  This does not mean that there cannot be limitations on the right to vote.  But it does mean that any such limitation must be properly justified
default a
defaults appropriate and necessary, that is, as proportionate
default 
default The reasons why 
defaultthe right to vote 
defaultis
default,
default 
defaultand should be, 
defaultconsidered a human right may emerge from the following brief discussion.
default&#xa0;defaultI.2.2.
default              
defaultThis question can best be considered in the context of the ECHR provisions themselves.  Consideration of those provisions will suggest why the right to vote is and 
defaultshould be regarded as a human right.  It is true that Article 3 of the First Protocol is not drafted in the same manner as the other provisions
default; it does not, on the model of most of the other provisions, explicitly provide   (perhaps with certain limitations) “Everyone has the right to vote …”
default. 
default Article3 provides as follows:  “The High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections
default at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.”
default&#xa0;
defaultI.2.3.
default              
defaultNevertheless it seems clear that the article must be regarded as providing for a right to vote
default, and it has long been so interpreted by the Court
default.
default  A right to vote can readily be implied in the article:  that view is supported by the following considerations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI.2.4.
default              defaultFirstdefault,
default 
defaultthe essential requirements for a right to qualify as a human right are
default, broadly speaking,
default first, that it is fundamental, and second, that it is in principle – subject to possible exceptions – to be available to everyone.
default  Few would dispute, since the advent of universal suffrage, that there is such a right to vote:  it is fundamental, and 
defaultit is a right for everyone, in the sense that any exceptions (for example, minors, possibly convicted prisoners, etc.)  must
default 
defaultbe properly justified.
default 
default 
default              
defaultI.2.5.
default              
defaultSeconddefault, it would make little sense to include the provision in the ECHR, which is after all a Convention on human rights, if the right to vote, which is implicit in, and is the key to, the provision were not a human right.
default&#xa0;
defaultI.2.6.
default              
defaultThirddefault, it would make it impossible to enforce the provision under the ECHR’s system of access for individuals to an international Court.
default  (A case could be brought before the Court by another Cont
defaultr
defaultacting State, but 
defaultsuch cases are almost never brought: 
defaultthere have been very few in the entire 60-year history of the Convention.
default)
default&#xa0;
defaultI.2.7.
default              
defaultFourthdefault, the right is indeed a human right since it underpins many of the other rights and 
defaulti
defaults fundamental
default to the very existence of
default a modern democratic society
default.
default 
default There is throughout the Convention a close l
defaultink with democracy
default, a link which is also emphasised in the preamble.  Convention rights and their limitations are safeguarded by national law, which is underpinned by a democratic system of government.  However that does not of course entitle even a democratically elected legislature to override human rights.  The position of the UK Parliament is particularly important in this respect:  in many European States and other democracies around the world, human rights are protected by constitutional courts and supreme courts whose decisions prevail over parliamentary legislation.  Thus the UK Parliament has a special responsibility for the protection of human rights in the United Kingdom.
default&#xa0;
defaultI.2.8.
default              
defaultBecause of its fundamental importance in a democracy, vot
defaulting
default is, unusually, regarded as not only a right but a duty.  In most systems, it is a moral and political duty rather than a legal duty (in some legal systems it is also a legal duty, and a failure to vote is penalised). 
default&#xa0;
defaultI.2.9.
default              
defaultIt may also be thought that, i
defaultf voting is properly regarded as a duty, a 
defaulttotal
default ban on prisoners voting is more difficult to defend.
default&#xa0;
defaultI.default2default.default10.default              defaultExcursus on EU lawdefault&#xa0;
defaultFrom the letter inviting me to give evidence to the Committee, I gather that I am also expected to consider EU law. The right to vote is also a fundamental right in EU law.  
default(The term “fundamental right” is generally used in EU law, rather than “human right”, but the meaning is essentially the same.) 
default&#xa0;
defaultI.2.11.
default              
defaultElections to national parliaments are not regulated by EU law.  However, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, first adopted in 2000, includes as fundamental rights the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament and in municipal elections.
default   The right to vote in elections to the European Parliament
default also
default falls within Article 3 of the First Protocol to the ECHR.
default 
default Since those Charter rights which correspond to Convention rights are to be interpreted in the same way as the Convention rights,
default it can be argued
default, on  that ground also,
default that a total ban on prisoner voting in elections to the European Parliament, and perhaps also to some extent in municipal elections,  infringes the Charter and therefore the EU Treaty.
default&#xa0;defaultI.3.default              defaultQuestion 3.  defaultIs disqualifying prisoners from voting a suitable part of their punishment?default&#xa0;
defaultI.3.1.
default              
defaultThis must be to some extent a matter of opinion.  Disqualification from voting may seem to some rather inappropriate as a punishment.  They may see a positive value in giving the vote to certain categories of prisoners – for example, those serving short sentences, or those in open prisons nearing the end of their sentence.  And some of those who support denying prisoners the vote may accept that its significance as a punishment is modest.  Considered on top of incarceration itself, with the attendant humiliations and with all the restrictions which incarceration necessarily entails, it may be thought that deprivation of the vote is symbolic
default rather than part of the punishment
default.  
defaultIt certainly seems unlikely to have any deterrent value.  It may well be thought however that at any rate prisoners convicted of serious offences should not be allowed to vote. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI.3.2.
default              
defaultIt will be the essential task of Parliament to decide how the balance should be struck to take account of these views:  and it seems that the Court’s judgment gives sufficient latitude to enable an appropriate balance to be struck while complying with the essential requirement of the judgment.
default&#xa0;
defaultIIdefault              defaultThe issue of compliance with the judgment of the Strasbourg Court.default&#xa0;
defaultII.1.
default              
defaultParliament’s concern at the judgment is u
defaultnderstandable
default on several counts
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultII.2.
default              
defaultThe Committee finds itself in an unusual situation, in which it is called upon to consider for itself how to respond to the Court’s judgment.   Conflicting signals have come from the Government.  Even the Court has not given a clear signal on how to comply.  And the subject matter – the election of Members of Parliament – is manifestly one of special concern to Parliament.
default&#xa0;
defaultII.3.
default              
defaultHowever, two points do seem clear beyond doubt.  First, there is an obligation to comply with the judgment – this will be discussed below.  Second, it should be seen as an advantage that the judgment gives sufficient scope for a reasonable solution to be found.
default  Thus a measure which makes some significant provision for voting rights, replacing the current total ban, would be sufficient to comply with the judgment; and it would be for the Committee and ultimately for Parliament to find the best solution.
defaultAs for the obligation to comply with the judgment, 
defaultthere is no doubt whatever about the principle
default.
defaultII.4.
default              defaultFirstdefault,default it would be
default flagrantly
default illegal
default not to comply with the judgment
default.  
defaultIt would be illegal u
defaultnder international law, not domestic law, but there should be no doubt whatever that international law is binding on the UK.  It is moreover a treaty obligation, one to which the U
defaultnited 
defaultK
defaultingdom
default has signed up.
default&#xa0;
defaultII.5.
default              
defaultArticle 46
default(1) of the ECHR provides:  “The High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the final judgment of the Court in any case where they are parties.”
default&#xa0;
defaultII.6.
default              
defaultIn the United Kingdom treaty obligations are not directly enforceable in the courts.  But that does not mean that they are not binding on the United Kingdom.
default&#xa0;
defaultII.7.
default              
defaultMoreover t
defaulthe duty to comply with international law and treaty obligations is spelt out in the opening provisions of the Ministerial Code, as proclaimed by the Prime Minister when he took office in 2010.
default&#xa0;
defaultII.8.
default              
default“
default1 MINISTERS OF THE CROWNdefault&#xa0;
defaultGeneral principledefault&#xa0;
default1.1 Ministers of the Crown are expected to behave in a
default 
defaultway that upholds the highest standards of propriety.
default&#xa0;
default1.2 The
default 
defaultMinisterial Code should be read alongside the
default 
defaultCoalition agreement and the background of the overarching
default 
defaultduty on Ministers to comply with the law including international
default 
defaultlaw and treaty obligations and to uphold the administration of
default 
defaultjustice and to protect the integrity of public life.”
default&#xa0;
defaultII.9.
default              
defaultThe reference to “the overarching duty on Ministers to comply with the law including international law and treaty obligations” is clear and categorical.
default&#xa0;
defaultII.10.
default              
defaultIt seems clear also that Parliament should not 
default– still less, 
defaultdeliberately
default –
default put Ministers
default and the Government in breach of their duty, and put the United Kingdom in breach of its solemn 
defaultlegal 
defaultobligations.
default&#xa0;
defaultII.11.
default              
defaultMoreover, there is an element of paradox
default in penalising those who break the law by a measure which is itself manifestly illegal.
default&#xa0;
defaultII.12.
default              
defaultIt must also be stressed that no adverse consequences 
defaultare likely to
default follow from a measure which gives voting rights to some prisoners.  
defaultMost
default European States impose limited restrictions, or no restrictions, on prisoners’ voting rights, and difficulties
default, of whatever kind,
default do not seem to have arisen.
default&#xa0;
defaultII.13.
default              defaultSeconddefault, 
defaultfailure to comply with the judgment
default would seriously damage the United Kingdom’s reputation.  The U
defaultnited 
defaultK
defaultingdom
default has 
defaultjustifiably 
defaulttaken pride in the protection of hum
defaultan rights
default: 
defaultplans are under way for substantial
default celebrat
defaultions of
default the 
default8
default00th anniversary of Magna Carta; but a serious breach of the ECHR would strike a
default seriously
default jarring note
default.  T
defaulthe U
defaultnited 
defaultK
defaultingdom
default has 
defaultjustifiably 
defaulttaken pride
default also
default in respect for the rule of law.  To select those judgments with which to comply and to reject others is profoundly inconsistent with any understanding of the rule of law
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultII.14.
default              defaultThird,default 
defaultfailure to comply with the judgment
default would send the wrong signal to the other 46 Contracting States to the Convention.
default  It might encourage other States to violate the Convention, which, it may well be thought, would not be in the interest
defaults
default of the United Kingdom
default.  The United Kingdom
default has hitherto had an outstanding record of compliance with the Convention and, beyond the Convention and the Council of Europe, has made protection of human rights and observance of the rule of law a central plank of its policy.
