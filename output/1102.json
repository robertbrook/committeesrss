"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from a resident of Jersey (Resident A)&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1 \nI am a resident of Jersey who is concerned about abuses in our \nLegal and\n Parliamentary system\n as well as the Police\n. \n.\nI understand that my evidence is the property of the Committee \nbut I would respectfully ask that my evidence is not published on the Internet as I am a States worker and fear losing my job if my name is known.  I have discussed this with my poli\ntic\nal representative.\n&#xa0;\n2\n \nThere are about 300 lawyers in Jersey who have a privileged minority\n status.\n \n It is from this group that the Bailiff and Law Officers are selected and appointed and\n it seems to me that \nthey still dominate the proceedings of government, the judicia\nry\n and the\n \nadministration of so many\n aspects of island life\n.\n T\nhey survive apparently \ndespite\n the\n \nrecomm\ne\nnd\nations contained in the Sir Cecil Clothier\n \nand Lord Carswell\n Reports\n.\n              \n3 An example of\n this is a f\normer magistrate designate, jailed for fraud, who despite having not worked since 2008 only resigned in January this year.\n  My understanding is that his salary cannot be reclaimed. \n&#xa0;\n4\n The \nbehaviour\n of former Bailiff Sir Philip Bailhache since 2010 ha\ns\n highlighted \nproblems in\n the prevailing system\n, by which I mean a concentration of power in few hands\n.\n&#xa0;\n5\n \nE\nven whilst serving as Bailiff, Sir Philip was \na\nctive in politic\ns\n and\n had an agenda\n for an “independent” Jersey\n.  This seems to me to be driven \nby\n elite who wish to avoid accountability for their actions.  If what I read on the local internet Blog sites\n is correct\n, the people do not want it.\n I feel it relevant to mention at this point that these Blogs are increasingly trusted over the Main Stream Media.\n&#xa0;\n6 S\nince retiring \nas Bailiff he\n has been elected as a Senator and now sits in the States as a political\n representative \n“of the people”. \n His plan for States Reform (removal of Senators and larger constituencies formed the \nmain part of his successful election \ncampaign \nas a Senatorial candidate in 2011.\n&#xa0;\n7\n The recent (24 April) Jersey Referendum, which the politically dominated Electoral\n \nCommission\n which\n he chaired,\n \nattracted a minimal public participation\n of around 26% which does not suggest confidence on the public’s part in the democratic process.  Voter apathy is a problem in Jersey.\n&#xa0;\n8\n \nI\nf \nthis\n gains the approval of the States Assembly and the Privy\n \nCouncil, will \nb\ne for reduced and less democratic representation of the public\n, my concern is that it will make our\n \nsystem of\n \ngovernment \ne\nven less compliant with international standards than\n before.\n&#xa0;\n9\n Sir Philip has ambitions to make Jersey independent of the British Crown and to be our Foreign Minister\n. \nThis proposition has not been put to the electorate.\n Any conflict\ns\n with UK Government\n wi\nll, in my view \nbecome more acute as the Island drifts towards “independence” \n \nassert\ning an international identity of its’ own\n, if there is no scrutiny of Jersey’s institutions and Government.\n \n&#xa0;\n10\n That Jersey’s economy is now so dominated by the so called “Finance Industry” is a\n \nspecific aspect that needs to be considered critically and its affects, both within and\n \noutside the Island, examined.\n There are questions as to the sustainability of this\n&#xa0;\n1\n1\n \nThe\n ongoing problems relating to the Dean of Jersey have revealed\n gaps\n and obscurities in the arrangements for his appointment and\n \ndiscipline.\n It seems to me that \nthe “Crown” aspect \nis not fully \nunderstood\n by Islanders \nand it is not\n \ncertain where \nr\nesponsibi\nlity and power lies\n.\n  Indeed, there are two inquiries (under Dame Heather Steele and Bishop John Gladwin) ongoing\n.\n&#xa0;\n12\n Th\nat the laws and usages of Jersey are so little understood\n in the Island is\n not a new\n complaint\n,\n but it is evident that the ignorance\n extends to \nrelationships\n with \nUK institutions\n and Government\n.\n              \n&#xa0;\n13\n \nOur\n Home Affairs Minister\n has failed\n to take any\n effective\n action, where he has been advised\n that \nserving police officers have been perverting the course of justice\n.  He has requested the amendment of Standing Orders to prevent \na Deputy \nasking questions about this.  \n \n14 \nThe loss of evidence from police custody relating to child abuse (Haut de la Garenne) and which is highly relevant to the States Compensation Scheme for victims of abuse\n.  Events at the home came to light in 2008 and only now is a Committee of Inquiry getting underway.\n15\n The collusion of civil servants and politicians to remove a Minister from Office\n over his concerns \nabout\n our Child Protection Policy. T\nhis\n was revealed by a former Chief of Police\n, who\n was suspended from his job with no explanation or resolution.  In my view this is against natural justice.   \n16\n The working of the legal aid system which means that ordinary citizens have almost no chance of getting any justice in the legal system\n.  It is means tested and funded by lawyers.  The allocation of a lawyer from a rota system means that justice can be compromised by the allocation of an unsuitable lawyer for the case at hand.\n&#xa0;\n17 Jersey lacks anti-discrimination laws and many other progressive measures.  It appears that the small, powerful legal profession is responsible for blocking these thing\ns\n from happening\n&#xa0;\n18\n I\n wonder why the UK Government is more committed to Sark’s good governance when it has a population of 600.  Jersey has around 99,000.\n&#xa0;\n19\n Resid\nents do not know how to invoke \ngood governance (which is ill-defined) in Jersey\n in order to resolve and prevent abuses\n.  \n&#xa0;\n20\n \nThe\n ultimate responsibility of the UK governmen\nt\n also needs to be considered\n,\n as do any failures to intervene.\n The UK must take seriously the responsibility it has under the ECHR towards the good governance of the Crown Dependencies.\n&#xa0;\nJuly 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
