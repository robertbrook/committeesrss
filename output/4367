[normal]In June 2010, the NAO reported that DECC had inherited a poorly coordinated approach towards direct support for renewable energy technologies. This made it impossible to demonstrate 
[normal]whether the Government was achieving value for money from public funds towards to the UK’s legally binding targets:
[normal]We asked the NAO to review “Public funding for innovation in low carbon technologies in the UK” and we are publishing their report and la
[normal]unching our own inquiry. The NAO report highlights that that since June 2010, DECC have taken steps to improve co-ordination of innovation funding . DECC re-launched the Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group (LCICG) in late-2011 comprising all the bodie
[normal]s involved in funding low carbon innovation: BIS, DECC, DEFRA, MOD, DfT, DCLG, UKTI, the Welsh Government, the Scottish Government, the Energy Technology Institute, Crown Estate, Ofgem, Carbon Trust, Scottish Enterprise, Technology Strategy Board, and the 
[normal]Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. The LCICG is preparing a strategy for launch in early 2014, which should include an assessment of the opportunities for funding for different low carbon technologies. The LCICG should also report on the d
[normal]ifferent stages of the innovation process where public investment could be most effective.
[normal]However, the UK’s performance on funding for low carbon innovation to date has been mixed. UK expenditure on energy research and development doubled between 2006-201
[normal]1 and DECC allocated £185m for 2011-2015 for low carbon innovation: but it under-spent its budget between 2011-2013 because of delays in agreeing and launching its projects. Furthermore, there is no commitment beyond 2015 to a low carbon innovation budget,
[normal] leaving industry uncertain on support for their investment in long-term innovation initiatives.
