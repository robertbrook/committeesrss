defaultIn June 2010, the NAO reported that DECC had inherited a poorly coordinated approach towards direct support for renewable energy technologies. This made it impossible to demonstrate 
defaultwhether the Government was achieving value for money from public funds towards to the UK’s legally binding targets:
defaultWe asked the NAO to review “Public funding for innovation in low carbon technologies in the UK” and we are publishing their report and la
defaultunching our own inquiry. The NAO report highlights that that since June 2010, DECC have taken steps to improve co-ordination of innovation funding . DECC re-launched the Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group (LCICG) in late-2011 comprising all the bodie
defaults involved in funding low carbon innovation: BIS, DECC, DEFRA, MOD, DfT, DCLG, UKTI, the Welsh Government, the Scottish Government, the Energy Technology Institute, Crown Estate, Ofgem, Carbon Trust, Scottish Enterprise, Technology Strategy Board, and the 
defaultEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. The LCICG is preparing a strategy for launch in early 2014, which should include an assessment of the opportunities for funding for different low carbon technologies. The LCICG should also report on the d
defaultifferent stages of the innovation process where public investment could be most effective.
defaultHowever, the UK’s performance on funding for low carbon innovation to date has been mixed. UK expenditure on energy research and development doubled between 2006-201
default1 and DECC allocated £185m for 2011-2015 for low carbon innovation: but it under-spent its budget between 2011-2013 because of delays in agreeing and launching its projects. Furthermore, there is no commitment beyond 2015 to a low carbon innovation budget,
default leaving industry uncertain on support for their investment in long-term innovation initiatives.
