"BRC24\n&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from Pro Electrical Services (Bredon)&#xa0;\nI am an Electrical Contractor working in both Domestic and Commercial properties. I have been with 2 different Part P Scheme providers. I would make the following points to the Committee :-\nVery few\n people are aware of the need to use a registered Electrician. I have a guy living near me who is a labourer for a local Electrical Company. He has rewired/partial rewired 3 houses in my street. They have not been notified or tested. My options are report \nhim and watch nothing happen or forget it. This is not acceptable. If he was installing gas systems then that would have a different reaction from LABC and the \nspecifier\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe Part P scheme involves a yearly fee of around £400 and an assessment to see the \nsame books and paperwork. I have a copy of BS7671, calibration certificate, test certification software etc \netc\n. I had it last year and will still have it next year. I believe the yearly assessment should be 3 yearly instead but for the same fee. I can’\nt se\ne where the money goes and don’t believe it is representative of the scheme running costs. I, like many of my trade believe they are pigs at the trough and don’t represent our trade for the trades sake.\n&#xa0;\nCertsure\n in its guise of the Electrical Safety Regis\nter, is using its position to pressure electrical contractors to take out unnecessary levels of membership in addition to the £440 it costs to register under the Part P arrangements. Good Electricians are being misrepresented on the Electrical Safety Regis\nter. I have written to my local MP, \nElecsa\n and the Government about this. I changed scheme provider to NAPIT and registered for the \nElectricsafe\n Register. This is has a far more even open approach to providing a central point to check registration.\n&#xa0;\nI woul\nd advocate and support a single register but not run by a body such as the \nCertsure\n (NICEIC or ELECSA).  In the 10+ years they have run the Part P schemes, they have failed to enlighten the public by advertising or any other means about the use of register\ned contractors and electrical safety. They have taken our hard earned money and attempted to extort more using the Electrical Safety Register. \nD \nMcAspurn\n \nPro Electrical Services\n22 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
