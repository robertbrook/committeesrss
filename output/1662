default concerns 
defaultthat
default the issue of 
defaultbiomass 
defaultsustainability
default has been over simplified by campaigners and the media in recent 
defaultmonths
default. 
defaultBiomass has several uses; generating heat, providing power in the form of electricity generation and as a fuel for transport. In discussing sustainability concerns there is a tendency to refer to all of these uses collectively without looking at th
defaulte relative merits of each type of use. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3 
defaultBiomass burned to produce heat is 85% efficient compared to generating electricity by burning pure biomass which is only 30-35% efficient
default1
default. 
defaultThe level of support provided to generate electricity from biomass is o
defaultut of proportion compared to the level of support for heat when the scale of inefficiency is taken into consideration.
default For example, suppliers receive 1.5ROCs/MWH 
defaultfor
default biomass 
defaultelectricity;
default 
defaultROCs currently trade on average
default at
default 
default£43
default,
default this equates to £6
default5
default/MWH 
defaultplus the price for the electricity. However, a 
default1MW biomass boiler under the commercial RHI currently receives
default 
default1p/kWh which equates to just £10/MWH. 
default 
default1.
default4
default 
defaultSecond
defaultly
default, the use of biomass to generate heat is the most deployed technology under the non-domestic 
defaultRHI scheme. This
default, along with widespread uptake in other European markets
default demonstrates that biomass is currently one of the most desirable 
defaultrenewable and low carbon technologies for
default consumers. The degression of the medium biomass tariff
default (commercial systems b
defaultetween 200kW and 1MW heating capacity)
default under the budget management mechanism for the RHI is a serious issue. 
defaultWhilst having a range of renewable technologies is desirable, attempting to create an equal market without reviewing current market desirability of
default technologies is not in line with meeting renewables targets.
default 
defaultCPL was relieved that in the latest RHI quarterly forecast statement to 31 July 2013, no
default further
default degression will take place
default this 
defaulta
defaultutumn
default. However, medium biomass did exceed its trigger and the o
defaultverall trigger was close to being met. Medium biomass only avoided 
defaultfurther 
defaultdegression because this o
defaultverall spend was a mere £800,000 below the trigger point of 
default£60.1 million – despite the fact that DECC are way below required deployment levels to achieve 
defaultrenewable heat ambitions
default. CPL remains concerns by how narrowly 
defaultthese triggers were missed;
default medium biomass
default is
default on the brink of anot
defaulther degression that could
default flatten the market 
defaultand
default damage the chances of meeting renewables targets. 
default 
default1.
default5
default 
defaultWe have 
defaultsome concern
default over the pace of decarbonisation of heating and call upon the Committee to play particular attention to DECC’s work in the following areas:
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe tariff bands for the non-domestic RHI which are causing widespread market distortion. CPL is seeing clustering
default of systems at tariff boundaries (e.g. at 975/995kWh) and evidence of under specification in order to gain from the medium tariff band. This band being preferred due to the inadequate rate of return for larger installations. To resolve this issue, a more i
defaultntelligent tariff system is required – perhaps with a greater number of tariff bands.
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe budget management mechanism and t
defaulthe early degression of the medium biomass tariff 
defaultwhich 
defaultjeopardises achievement of renewable heat ambitions. Whilst a budget

defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA simple change to the RHI budget mechanism that would significantly reduce the prospect
default of premature tariff degression would be to merge some of the set-aside budgets for individual tariff bands. Instead of separate budgets for small, medium and large biomass, DECC should instead have one simple consolidated budget.

defaultSustainability standards for biomass for heating are in place under the RHI and should continue to be set at least a

defaultStandards should be reviewed on a regular basis.

default&#xa0;default3. Response to Questions default3.default1default Is the government taking the right approach to reduce heat energy demand?default3.
default2
default A number of policy measures have been introduced to incentivise energy efficiency improvements to reduce the 
defaultdemand for heat. These include the Green Deal and ECO with minimum energy performance an entry requirement for the domestic RHI.
default3.
default3
default 
defaultIt should be noted that there is a limit to which heat demand can be reduced through energy efficiency in much of the UK’s 
defaultbuilding stock. Many older properties would require substantial and un-economic (even with Green Deal Finance) improvements to make a meaningful reduction in heat demand. In other circumstances, such as with listed buildings and in natural conservation are
defaultas, many demand reducing measures will be unsuitable.
default3.
default4
default 
defaultIt therefore makes sense to target low carbon and renewable heating solutions at those buildings which are using the most harmful fuels (off the gas grid) and 
defaultfor which it will be 
defaulthardest to reduce 
defaultdemand. The associated ‘’bang for buck’’ in applying a renewable system in such circumstances will be much higher compared to a building where demand can be substantially reduced through efficiency and where the primary heating fuel is gas.
default3.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhat progress i
defaults the government making on reducing the demand for heat?
default3.
default6
default The latest Heat Strategy document published in April 2013
default2
default sets out the government’s plans to meet the heat challenge in industrial heat, networked heat, heat in buildings, grids and infrastructu
defaultre. 
default3.7
default defaultCPL welcomes many of the proposals in the Heat Strategydefault including evidence of actions to support the launch of the domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). After a long wait for the domestic RHI scheme to be finalised (which came after the Heat Strategy was published), actions to demonstrate the government’s c
defaultommitment are important. 
default3.
default8 
defaultThe evidence annex to the 
defaultHeat Strategy
default provides two cost-optimisation scenarios models (RESOM and ESME). 
defaultCPL is concerned 
defaultthat 
defaultneitherdefault model shows particularly high deployment of biomass heating in 2050default. This also appears con
defaulttradictory to efforts to promote biomass through the RHI.
default3.
default9
default The basis of a limited role for biomass in DECC’s longer term scenarios is unclear and may be due to limitations in scenario models. 
defaultHowever, i
defaultf the DECC models assume a steady-state (i.e. no fu
defaultture improvements) for biomass heating technology we would argue that this is unlikely to be the case.
default3.
default10
default defaultBiomass heating is one of the most efficient methods of producing renewable energy. There are substantial opportunities to improve the way biomass defaultis utilised in heating within the UKdefault, through more efficient heating systems, cost reduction in manufacture and installation, alternative feedstocks and process innovations such as torrefaction. 
default3.11 
defaultTorrefaction
default is the thermochemical treatment of biomass
default at 200 to 320C, carried out under atmospheric pressure and in the absence of oxygen. Torrefied pellets can be produced from a wide range of biomass feedstocks and 
defaultt
defaulthe process removes 
defaultwater and other substances leaving
default a solid material which can be densifi
defaulted into briquettes or pellets. 
defaultThe main advantage of this process is that each torrefied pellet could contain twice the energy as those pellets available today; this reduces transportation and storage costs. 
defaultThe 
defaultimplementation of the RHI presents a medium 
defaultterm commercial opportunity for existing technologies and users. However, the Heat Strategy illustrates that 
defaultmore support for the biomass industry is required to ensure it can fulfil its important role defaultin developing new innovative technologiesdefault.default3.1
default2
default To pro
defaultvide more adequate support
default,
default improvements must be made to tariff levels under the RHI. It should be noted that evidence from banks and other internal investors shows that 
defaultthe 
defaultthreshold for lending to new projects in most circumstances is a Return on Capital
default Expenditure (RoCE) of 15%
default or
default higher. The DECC methodology uses a Rate of Return (RoR) set at just 12% which is less well recognised in the marketplace. In addition, a review of the budget management mechanism should be carried out to remove any overzealou
defaults
default or premature
default degression of tariff rates.  
default3.1
default3
default defaultUnder the non-domestic RHI the current biomass tariffs do not provide adequate support for the technology to be deployed correctlydefault. Clustering of installations around the tariff boundaries is evidence that 
defaultinstallations are being underspecified (e.g. at 975/995kWh) to fall into the medium biomass tariff. CPL has seen instances where these underspecified systems must continue to rely on an existing fossil fuel boiler system. Had the &gt;1MW tariff provided an ad
defaultequate rate of return then a correctly sized installation would have enabled the fossil fuel system to be completely removed.
default 
default3.1
default4
default 
defaultFurthermore, 
defaultthe design of the budget management mechanism resulted in degression of the medium scale biomass tariff when thdefaultis is the only technology currently performing strongly.default CPL is concerned that further degression will result in medium biomass installations, particularly at the lower end of the tariff boundaries
default,
default becoming completely unviable.
default CPL fears that this would f
defaultlatten
default the market and severely damag
defaulte
default progress towards meeting the UK renewables targets.
default 
defaultA simple change to the RHI budget mechanism that would significantly reduce the prospect of premature tariff degression would be to merge some of the set-aside budget
defaults for individual tariff bands. Instead of separate budgets for small, medium and large biomass, DECC should instead have one simple consolidated budget.
default3.1
default5
default Biomass is deemed a key fuel for heat production from both the cost and GHG perspectives. What 
defaultshould be done to ensure methods of calculating biomass GHG balance represent an accurate picture?
default3.1
default6
default DECC provides sustainability requirements for biomass including GHG requirements and in addition there are specific sustainability requirements being im
defaultplemented under the RHI. An online tool - the UK 
defaultBiomass &amp; Biogas Carbon Calculator
default is provided by OFGEM to enable generators and others to 
defaultassess the emissions associated with biomass electricity and heat generation. The tool takes into account the emissions across the bio-energy lifecycle from cultivation of biomass to processing and transport. The calculator should be 
defaultreviewed on a regular 
defaultbasis to ensure the process takes into account the most up-to-date information available on the bio-energy lifecycle.
default3.1
default7
default 
defaultAdditional actions that generators and suppliers of biomass can take to ensure accountability of standards, including GHG, through th
defaulte supply chain include:
defaultCPL has a robust understand of sustainability issues and fully complies with each of these additional actions.
default3.1
default8
default There are sustainability guidelines for biomass, do these go far enough?
default3.1
default9
default 
defaultUnder the RHI, sustainability regulations for biomass are to be laid by 
defaultthe 
defaultend of 2013 and compliance demonstrated by April 2014. RHI recipients must provide evidence of performance; including 60% GHG savings against EU fossil fuel heat average
default,
default and meet 
defaultspecific land use criteria. Alternatively, RHI recipients are permitted to source fuel from ‘approved supplier’ lists.
default3.
default20
default defaultCPL supports the introduction of biomass sustainability regulations but is concerned about confusion between the use of biomass to gdefaultenerate electricity, transport fuel and heat. defaultBiomass for heating and combined heat power is the most effective use of biomass
default. Generally speaking, using bioenergy for heat and power is more efficient in reducing GHG compared to using bioenergy for transpo
defaultrt fuel. Indeed, burning pure biomass to produce heat is 85% efficient; generating electricity by burning the same material is only approximately 30-35% efficient
default1
default. 
default3.2
default1
default The below chart (adapted from ‘The Carbon Balance of Woodfuel’, Northern Woodheat, 20
default10) compares the estimated ‘carbon balance’ of a range of different woodfuels and compares them with the carbon balance of fossil fuels conventionally used for heating. The CO2 emissions associated with the use of wood as a fuel were calculated considering
default every step in the process including planting, harvesting, transportation of timber, processing, transportation of processed fuel and finally the use of the wood as fuel. Woodfuels produce a relatively low amount of CO2 even where they are imported.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default2
default2
default 
defaultSustainability standards 
defaultfor biomass in the UK should reflect the desire to encourage use in its most efficient application i.e. heat.  This may mean that higher sustainability standards are required for less efficient uses such as power generation; such
default as the 
default70% 
defaultGHG savings
default compared to fossil fuel alternatives
default recently announced to
default ensure the sustainability of wood-fuel used to create energy.
default default3.2

default Furthermore, adefaultny regulation should be in line with requirements being developed at an EU level and providdefaulte a balance between ensuring compliance defaultwhilst not deterring investmentdefault. As the biomass market expands there will be increased competition to provide cheaper sources of biofuels, whether from within the EU or the rest of the world. R

default What will the local environmental impact (for example air pollution) be from the use heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units?
default3.2
default5
default 
defaultLocal 
defaultenvironmental pollution is potentially a big issue for the low carbon heating sector. The current application of air quality rules in planning means that companies deploying these technolog
defaulties 
defaultmust navigate a patchwork of different standards and requiremen
defaultts across the country. It makes sense to have rules on air 
defaultquality;
default however efforts to promote a national approach would be 
defaultbeneficial.
default3.2

default 
defaultAs an example, biomass boilers installed under the RHI will soon be subject to emissions constraints for NOx and Pa

default CPL strongly supports the maintenance and development of the Clean Air Act.

default Restrictions on the burnin

default 
defaultWhat are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps? 
default3.
default30
default 
defaultOn site biomass boilers have more merits than gas and produce fewer emissions compared to centralised
default electricity production. 
defaultA domestic heat pump powered by centralised electricity production has two inefficiencies when compared to the use of an on-site biomass boiler (as oppose
defaultd
default to gas).
default 
defaultFirst, a heat pump 
defaultmust
default rely on a back-up boiler,

defaultas outlined above, the burning of biomass to generate electricity is significantly less efficient than to produce heat.

default We expectdefault significant pent-up demand for renewable heating systems in the initial months of the RHI as the scheme has been in gestation since 2009.
