[normal]1.[bold] [bold]Executive Summary[bold]1.1 
[normal]CPL 
[normal]welcomes the 
[normal]Select 
[normal]Committee’s inquiry into 
[normal]Heat
[normal]. 
[normal]Our response focuses on biomass systems and the supply of sustainable UK biomass fuel which is CPL’s core area of expertise and as such we have responded to the questions that are relevant to our business and expertise. In or
[normal]der to expand on the points raised, CPL would be delighted to provide further written or oral evidence if this is required.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e have 
[normal]some
[normal] concerns 
[normal]that
[normal] the issue of 
[normal]biomass 
[normal]sustainability
[normal] has been over simplified by campaigners and the media in recent 
[normal]months
[normal]. 
[normal]Biomass has several uses; generating heat, providing power in the form of electricity generation and as a fuel for transport. In discussing sustainability concerns there is a tendency to refer to all of these uses collectively without looking at th
[normal]e relative merits of each type of use. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 
[normal]Biomass burned to produce heat is 85% efficient compared to generating electricity by burning pure biomass which is only 30-35% efficient
[normal]1
[normal]. 
[normal]The level of support provided to generate electricity from biomass is o
[normal]ut of proportion compared to the level of support for heat when the scale of inefficiency is taken into consideration.
[normal] For example, suppliers receive 1.5ROCs/MWH 
[normal]for
[normal] biomass 
[normal]electricity;
[normal] 
[normal]ROCs currently trade on average
[normal] at
[normal] 
[normal]£43
[normal],
[normal] this equates to £6
[normal]5
[normal]/MWH 
[normal]plus the price for the electricity. However, a 
[normal]1MW biomass boiler under the commercial RHI currently receives
[normal] 
[normal]1p/kWh which equates to just £10/MWH. 
[normal] 
[normal]1.
[normal]4
[normal] 
[normal]Second
[normal]ly
[normal], the use of biomass to generate heat is the most deployed technology under the non-domestic 
[normal]RHI scheme. This
[normal], along with widespread uptake in other European markets
[normal] demonstrates that biomass is currently one of the most desirable 
[normal]renewable and low carbon technologies for
[normal] consumers. The degression of the medium biomass tariff
[normal] (commercial systems b
[normal]etween 200kW and 1MW heating capacity)
[normal] under the budget management mechanism for the RHI is a serious issue. 
[normal]Whilst having a range of renewable technologies is desirable, attempting to create an equal market without reviewing current market desirability of
[normal] technologies is not in line with meeting renewables targets.
[normal] 
[normal]CPL was relieved that in the latest RHI quarterly forecast statement to 31 July 2013, no
[normal] further
[normal] degression will take place
[normal] this 
[normal]a
[normal]utumn
[normal]. However, medium biomass did exceed its trigger and the o
[normal]verall trigger was close to being met. Medium biomass only avoided 
[normal]further 
[normal]degression because this o
[normal]verall spend was a mere £800,000 below the trigger point of 
[normal]£60.1 million – despite the fact that DECC are way below required deployment levels to achieve 
[normal]renewable heat ambitions
[normal]. CPL remains concerns by how narrowly 
[normal]these triggers were missed;
[normal] medium biomass
[normal] is
[normal] on the brink of anot
[normal]her degression that could
[normal] flatten the market 
[normal]and
[normal] damage the chances of meeting renewables targets. 
[normal] 
[normal]1.
[normal]5
[normal] 
[normal]We have 
[normal]some concern
[normal] over the pace of decarbonisation of heating and call upon the Committee to play particular attention to DECC’s work in the following areas:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The tariff bands for the non-domestic RHI which are causing widespread market distortion. CPL is seeing clustering
[normal] of systems at tariff boundaries (e.g. at 975/995kWh) and evidence of under specification in order to gain from the medium tariff band. This band being preferred due to the inadequate rate of return for larger installations. To resolve this issue, a more i
[normal]ntelligent tariff system is required – perhaps with a greater number of tariff bands.
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The budget management mechanism and t
[normal]he early degression of the medium biomass tariff 
[normal]which 
[normal]jeopardises achievement of renewable heat ambitions. Whilst a budget 
[normal]managemen
[normal]t tool 
[normal]is 
[normal]necessary
[normal] DECC should be enabled to apply discretion in scenarios such as 
[normal]this
[normal], where the market for the m
[normal]ost deployed technology
[normal] is 
[normal]now 
[normal]facing restrictions.
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A simple change to the RHI budget mechanism that would significantly reduce the prospect
[normal] of premature tariff degression would be to merge some of the set-aside budgets for individual tariff bands. Instead of separate budgets for small, medium and large biomass, DECC should instead have one simple consolidated budget.
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The support for biomass u
[normal]sed for heat should 
[normal]recognise incentives available for less efficient uses elsewhere and seek to encourage most efficient use of resources.
[normal]e)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Sustainability standards for biomass for heating are in place under the RHI and should continue to be set at least a
[normal]s high as those set out for biomass at a European level. 
[normal]Standards should be reviewed on a regular basis.
[normal]2[bold].[bold] About CPL[bold] Industries[bold]2.1 
[normal]CPL Renewables is a leading specialist in wood pellet heating solutions for commercial and public sector organisations. 
[normal]CPL Renewables is an important arm of CPL Industries, Europe’s largest manufacturer and distributor of smokeless solid fuels. Operating since 1955, with over 500 employees, the company has invested substantially in diversification over the past few years w
[normal]ith a focus on renewable products.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3. Response to Questions [bold]3.[bold]1[bold] Is the government taking the right approach to reduce heat energy demand?[bold]3.
[normal]2
[normal] A number of policy measures have been introduced to incentivise energy efficiency improvements to reduce the 
[normal]demand for heat. These include the Green Deal and ECO with minimum energy performance an entry requirement for the domestic RHI.
[normal]3.
[normal]3
[normal] 
[normal]It should be noted that there is a limit to which heat demand can be reduced through energy efficiency in much of the UK’s 
[normal]building stock. Many older properties would require substantial and un-economic (even with Green Deal Finance) improvements to make a meaningful reduction in heat demand. In other circumstances, such as with listed buildings and in natural conservation are
[normal]as, many demand reducing measures will be unsuitable.
[normal]3.
[normal]4
[normal] 
[normal]It therefore makes sense to target low carbon and renewable heating solutions at those buildings which are using the most harmful fuels (off the gas grid) and 
[normal]for which it will be 
[normal]hardest to reduce 
[normal]demand. The associated ‘’bang for buck’’ in applying a renewable system in such circumstances will be much higher compared to a building where demand can be substantially reduced through efficiency and where the primary heating fuel is gas.
[normal]3.5
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]What progress i
[normal]s the government making on reducing the demand for heat?
[normal]3.
[normal]6
[normal] The latest Heat Strategy document published in April 2013
[normal]2
[normal] sets out the government’s plans to meet the heat challenge in industrial heat, networked heat, heat in buildings, grids and infrastructu
[normal]re. 
[normal]3.7
[normal] [bold]CPL welcomes many of the proposals in the Heat Strategy[bold] including evidence of actions to support the launch of the domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). After a long wait for the domestic RHI scheme to be finalised (which came after the Heat Strategy was published), actions to demonstrate the government’s c
[normal]ommitment are important. 
[normal]3.
[normal]8 
[normal]The evidence annex to the 
[normal]Heat Strategy
[normal] provides two cost-optimisation scenarios models (RESOM and ESME). 
[normal]CPL is concerned 
[normal]that 
[normal]neither[bold] model shows particularly high deployment of biomass heating in 2050[bold]. This also appears con
[normal]tradictory to efforts to promote biomass through the RHI.
[normal]3.
[normal]9
[normal] The basis of a limited role for biomass in DECC’s longer term scenarios is unclear and may be due to limitations in scenario models. 
[normal]However, i
[normal]f the DECC models assume a steady-state (i.e. no fu
[normal]ture improvements) for biomass heating technology we would argue that this is unlikely to be the case.
[normal]3.
[normal]10
[normal] [bold]Biomass heating is one of the most efficient methods of producing renewable energy. There are substantial opportunities to improve the way biomass [bold]is utilised in heating within the UK[bold], through more efficient heating systems, cost reduction in manufacture and installation, alternative feedstocks and process innovations such as torrefaction. 
[normal]3.11 
[normal]Torrefaction
[normal] is the thermochemical treatment of biomass
[normal] at 200 to 320C, carried out under atmospheric pressure and in the absence of oxygen. Torrefied pellets can be produced from a wide range of biomass feedstocks and 
[normal]t
[normal]he process removes 
[normal]water and other substances leaving
[normal] a solid material which can be densifi
[normal]ed into briquettes or pellets. 
[normal]The main advantage of this process is that each torrefied pellet could contain twice the energy as those pellets available today; this reduces transportation and storage costs. 
[normal]The 
[normal]implementation of the RHI presents a medium 
[normal]term commercial opportunity for existing technologies and users. However, the Heat Strategy illustrates that 
[normal]more support for the biomass industry is required to ensure it can fulfil its important role [bold]in developing new innovative technologies[bold].[bold]3.1
[normal]2
[normal] To pro
[normal]vide more adequate support
[normal],
[normal] improvements must be made to tariff levels under the RHI. It should be noted that evidence from banks and other internal investors shows that 
[normal]the 
[normal]threshold for lending to new projects in most circumstances is a Return on Capital
[normal] Expenditure (RoCE) of 15%
[normal] or
[normal] higher. The DECC methodology uses a Rate of Return (RoR) set at just 12% which is less well recognised in the marketplace. In addition, a review of the budget management mechanism should be carried out to remove any overzealou
[normal]s
[normal] or premature
[normal] degression of tariff rates.  
[normal]3.1
[normal]3
[normal] [bold]Under the non-domestic RHI the current biomass tariffs do not provide adequate support for the technology to be deployed correctly[bold]. Clustering of installations around the tariff boundaries is evidence that 
[normal]installations are being underspecified (e.g. at 975/995kWh) to fall into the medium biomass tariff. CPL has seen instances where these underspecified systems must continue to rely on an existing fossil fuel boiler system. Had the &gt;1MW tariff provided an ad
[normal]equate rate of return then a correctly sized installation would have enabled the fossil fuel system to be completely removed.
[normal] 
[normal]3.1
[normal]4
[normal] 
[normal]Furthermore, 
[normal]the design of the budget management mechanism resulted in degression of the medium scale biomass tariff when th[bold]is is the only technology currently performing strongly.[bold] CPL is concerned that further degression will result in medium biomass installations, particularly at the lower end of the tariff boundaries
[normal],
[normal] becoming completely unviable.
[normal] CPL fears that this would f
[normal]latten
[normal] the market and severely damag
[normal]e
[normal] progress towards meeting the UK renewables targets.
[normal] 
[normal]A simple change to the RHI budget mechanism that would significantly reduce the prospect of premature tariff degression would be to merge some of the set-aside budget
[normal]s for individual tariff bands. Instead of separate budgets for small, medium and large biomass, DECC should instead have one simple consolidated budget.
[normal]3.1
[normal]5
[normal] Biomass is deemed a key fuel for heat production from both the cost and GHG perspectives. What 
[normal]should be done to ensure methods of calculating biomass GHG balance represent an accurate picture?
[normal]3.1
[normal]6
[normal] DECC provides sustainability requirements for biomass including GHG requirements and in addition there are specific sustainability requirements being im
[normal]plemented under the RHI. An online tool - the UK 
[normal]Biomass &amp; Biogas Carbon Calculator
[normal] is provided by OFGEM to enable generators and others to 
[normal]assess the emissions associated with biomass electricity and heat generation. The tool takes into account the emissions across the bio-energy lifecycle from cultivation of biomass to processing and transport. The calculator should be 
[normal]reviewed on a regular 
[normal]basis to ensure the process takes into account the most up-to-date information available on the bio-energy lifecycle.
[normal]3.1
[normal]7
[normal] 
[normal]Additional actions that generators and suppliers of biomass can take to ensure accountability of standards, including GHG, through th
[normal]e supply chain include:
[normal]CPL has a robust understand of sustainability issues and fully complies with each of these additional actions.
[normal]3.1
[normal]8
[normal] There are sustainability guidelines for biomass, do these go far enough?
[normal]3.1
[normal]9
[normal] 
[normal]Under the RHI, sustainability regulations for biomass are to be laid by 
[normal]the 
[normal]end of 2013 and compliance demonstrated by April 2014. RHI recipients must provide evidence of performance; including 60% GHG savings against EU fossil fuel heat average
[normal],
[normal] and meet 
[normal]specific land use criteria. Alternatively, RHI recipients are permitted to source fuel from ‘approved supplier’ lists.
[normal]3.
[normal]20
[normal] [bold]CPL supports the introduction of biomass sustainability regulations but is concerned about confusion between the use of biomass to g[bold]enerate electricity, transport fuel and heat. [bold]Biomass for heating and combined heat power is the most effective use of biomass
[normal]. Generally speaking, using bioenergy for heat and power is more efficient in reducing GHG compared to using bioenergy for transpo
[normal]rt fuel. Indeed, burning pure biomass to produce heat is 85% efficient; generating electricity by burning the same material is only approximately 30-35% efficient
[normal]1
[normal]. 
[normal]3.2
[normal]1
[normal] The below chart (adapted from ‘The Carbon Balance of Woodfuel’, Northern Woodheat, 20
[normal]10) compares the estimated ‘carbon balance’ of a range of different woodfuels and compares them with the carbon balance of fossil fuels conventionally used for heating. The CO2 emissions associated with the use of wood as a fuel were calculated considering
[normal] every step in the process including planting, harvesting, transportation of timber, processing, transportation of processed fuel and finally the use of the wood as fuel. Woodfuels produce a relatively low amount of CO2 even where they are imported.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]2
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]Sustainability standards 
[normal]for biomass in the UK should reflect the desire to encourage use in its most efficient application i.e. heat.  This may mean that higher sustainability standards are required for less efficient uses such as power generation; such
[normal] as the 
[normal]70% 
[normal]GHG savings
[normal] compared to fossil fuel alternatives
[normal] recently announced to
[normal] ensure the sustainability of wood-fuel used to create energy.
[normal] [bold]3.2
[normal]3
[normal] Furthermore, a[bold]ny regulation should be in line with requirements being developed at an EU level and provid[bold]e a balance between ensuring compliance [bold]whilst not deterring investment[bold]. As the biomass market expands there will be increased competition to provide cheaper sources of biofuels, whether from within the EU or the rest of the world. R
[normal]obust r
[normal]egulations shoul
[normal]d 
[normal]prevent the use of non-sustainable sources whilst promoting a fair price for approved sources.
[normal]3.2
[normal]4
[normal] What will the local environmental impact (for example air pollution) be from the use heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units?
[normal]3.2
[normal]5
[normal] 
[normal]Local 
[normal]environmental pollution is potentially a big issue for the low carbon heating sector. The current application of air quality rules in planning means that companies deploying these technolog
[normal]ies 
[normal]must navigate a patchwork of different standards and requiremen
[normal]ts across the country. It makes sense to have rules on air 
[normal]quality;
[normal] however efforts to promote a national approach would be 
[normal]beneficial.
[normal]3.2
[normal]6
[normal] 
[normal]As an example, biomass boilers installed under the RHI will soon be subject to emissions constraints for NOx and Pa
[normal]rticulates. However, biomass boiler
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]not installed
[normal] 
[normal]under the RHI 
[normal]will not be subject to 
[normal]the 
[normal]same constraints. It is logical to develop consistent requirements as part of the Clean Air Act and Air Quality Regulations.
[normal] A review of the Clean Air Act is underw
[normal]ay this year.
[normal] CPL strongly supports the maintenance and development of the Clean Air Act.
[normal]3.2
[normal]7
[normal] 
[normal]Consideration should also be 
[normal]given to
[normal] the type of heating system that is being replaced with a renewable source. 
[normal]W
[normal]here 
[normal]a replacement
[normal] technology is ‘no worse’ in terms of air pollution 
[normal]than the existing system but provides considerable improvements in relation to CO2 emissions, this should be taken in consideration. This in order to avoid a scenario where older inefficient systems are n
[normal]ot being replaced because the air quality standards are too high. Ideally, CPL would advise following the same route as the Republic of Ireland and becoming entirely smokeless as the best way to tackle the issue of air
[normal] 
[normal]pollution.
[normal] Restrictions on the burnin
[normal]g of specified solid fuels would be more effective than placing restrictions on more efficient heating systems, especially where the air pollution is no worse.
[normal]3.2
[normal]8
[normal] 
[normal]In addition,
[normal] if it is designed and implemented correctly,
[normal] the European EcoDe
[normal]sign Directive 
[normal]has the potential to
[normal] solve many of the emissions problems in the domestic sector by providing a framework of requirements to reduce emissions.
[normal]3.2
[normal]9
[normal] 
[normal]What are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps? 
[normal]3.
[normal]30
[normal] 
[normal]On site biomass boilers have more merits than gas and produce fewer emissions compared to centralised
[normal] electricity production. 
[normal]A domestic heat pump powered by centralised electricity production has two inefficiencies when compared to the use of an on-site biomass boiler (as oppose
[normal]d
[normal] to gas).
[normal] 
[normal]First, a heat pump 
[normal]must
[normal] rely on a back-up boiler, 
[normal]likely to be 
[normal]fos
[normal]sil fuel
[normal],
[normal] during colder periods. Second, 
[normal]as outlined above, the burning of biomass to generate electricity is significantly less efficient than to produce heat. 
[normal]3.
[normal]3
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]What are the lock-in, costs and GHG savings from the promotion of different forms of dome
[normal]stic heating solution? 
[normal]3.3
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]Every year, 1.5 million gas boilers and 65,000 oil boilers are installed in the UK. Each of these installations represents a lock-in of at least ten years. 
[normal]Compared to such fossil fuel systems, the 
[normal]benefits of a bi
[normal]oma
[normal]ss system
[normal] include
[normal]:
[normal]Lower emissions/more efficient
[normal]Price 
[normal]Consumer appeal
[normal]Availability
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]3
[normal] 
[normal]How successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?
[normal]3.3
[normal]4
[normal] We expect[bold] significant pent-up demand for renewable heating systems in the initial months of the RHI as the scheme has been in gestation since 2009. We feel that it is important that DECC does not perceive this as a sustained surge and instigate severe tariff degres[bold]sion (leading to a stop/start industry) but instead carefully examine the underlying trends[bold].[bold]3.3
[normal]5
[normal] 
[normal]Based 
[normal]on 
[normal]the evidence of deployment under the non-domestic RHI and the Green Deal the
[normal] enduring deployment
[normal] rate
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]for 
[normal]the domestic RHI may be limited. However, it is relevant that 
[normal]the most deployed technology under the non-domestic RHI is biomass. [bold]3.3
[normal]6
[normal] The [bold]o[bold]il [bold]b[bold]oiler market today is approximately 65,000 units. If the RHI is able to take a 15-20% share of this market in t[bold]he early months that would represent a substantial success.[bold] [bold]If take up were by biomass boilers only
[normal] [bold]the relative costs are illustrated in the below table:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15%[bold]No of [bold]installations[bold]9

[normal]565
[normal]Total [bold]cost (£m/year)[bold]£
[normal]25m
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.3
[normal]7
[normal] 
[normal]Whilst 
[normal]it must be noted that 
[normal]commercial and domestic decisions will differ when installing new technologies, biomass
[normal] has 
[normal]an
[normal] advantage in that it uses boiler technology which is familiar to domestic customers.
[normal] In a study into consumer behaviour included in the evidence annex to the Heat Strategy
[normal]2
[normal], 47% of homeowners had heard of a biomass boiler compared to 47% 
[normal]for 
[normal]GSHP, 32% 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]ASHP, 31% 
[normal]for 
[normal]heat networks and 27% 
[normal]for 
[normal]micro-CHP.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]In addition, a biomass boiler is simpler to retrofit into an existing home resulting in less disruption for householders when compared to other technologies.  [bold]1
