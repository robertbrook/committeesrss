"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from Astute Technical Services Ltd I watched the on line video of your recent select committee interview of the operators of the electrical\n&#xa0;\n safety schemes with some concern.\nFor your information I am an electrical engineer not an electrician who inspects and tests electrical installation both domestic and commercial. I \n&#xa0;\nam the appointed inspector for two local authorities carrying out inspections of domestic installations for \nPart P compliance. I also carry out inspections of electrical installations as an expert witness for Trading Standards and appear in the criminal court to prosecute offenders in addition to appearing in the County Court in civil matters. I am also a part t\nime lecturer at a college teaching the regulations, inspection and test and the design of electrical installations. I am registered with the NICEIC as an Approved Contractor and I am also a member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology. I am not \nan electrician and I do not engage in electrical installation work in order I can be unbiased and independent. \nHaving watched the video and listened to the questions and answers I believe that your committee may not be aware of some of the issues concerni\nng Part P of the Building Regulations.\nShould you require any m\nore information in connection with Part P I would be happy to give you an unbiased honest answer rather than the smoke and mirrors you have been hearing. Although it would be professional suicide for me, as I would be treated as a whistle blowe\nr\n, I would b\ne prepared to appear before your select committee and answer any questions they may have. I would however be happier and more comfortable to meet you in private and answer your questions.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
