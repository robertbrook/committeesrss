defaultWe carry out consultation work with disabled people and carers in Somerset through our Network project.  We work with local authorities to consult on issues that disabled people may be interested in having their say on.  We also carry out Disability Forums and Discussion Groups inviting speakers to engage with disabled people and carers and give them a chance to have their voice heard.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have been asked to carry out consultation work for Somerset County Council on topics such as the ‘Long Term Transport Strategy for Somerset’ in 2010 and the ‘Bus Subsidies Reduction Consultation’ in January 2012.  In addition to this, issues regarding transport ha
defaultve
default been raised by our members at our disability groups and forums.

defaultThis information is summarised below;

defaultPublic Transportdefault              
defaultEven in more urban areas such as Taunton, disabled people who

defaultare wheelchair users have to wait sometimes close to 2 hours for a

defaultpublic transport bus with a ramp which is suitable for them.

defaultthere are inconsistencies in staff attitudes in assisting people to

defaultaccess buses. 
defaultBus drivers can ask for other passengers to

defaultThe cost of community transport schemes has increased and is

defaultare also in high demand and are often difficult to obtain.

defaultNo community transport is available in the evenings to provide

defaulttransport for disabled people to attend groups. This can be a vital

defaultway of preventing isolation.
