[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] a user led organisation based in Somerset but also operating in different parts of the country providing
[normal] services which promote independent living.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We carry out consultation work with disabled people and carers in Somerset through our Network project.  We work with local authorities to consult on issues that disabled people may be interested in having their say on.  We also carry out Disability Forums and Discussion Groups inviting speakers to engage with disabled people and carers and give them a chance to have their voice heard.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have been asked to carry out consultation work for Somerset County Council on topics such as the ‘Long Term Transport Strategy for Somerset’ in 2010 and the ‘Bus Subsidies Reduction Consultation’ in January 2012.  In addition to this, issues regarding transport ha
[normal]ve
[normal] been raised by our members at our disability groups and forums.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This information is summarised below;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Public Transport[bold]              
[normal]Even in more urban areas such as Taunton, disabled people who 
[normal]              
[normal]are wheelchair users have to wait sometimes close to 2 hours for a 
[normal]              
[normal]public transport bus with a ramp which is suitable for them.  
[normal]There 
[normal]              
[normal]is only 
[normal]1disabled space for a wheelchair on public transport and 
[normal]              
[normal]there are inconsistencies in staff attitudes in assisting people to 
[normal]              
[normal]access buses. 
[normal]Bus drivers can ask for other passengers to 
[normal]              
[normal]collapse buggies to a
[normal]ssist access but cannot insist, 
[normal]this relies on 
[normal]              
[normal]members of the public being 
[normal]              
[normal]helpful.
[normal]              
[normal]There are l
[normal]imitation
[normal]s 
[normal]of access
[normal] with
[normal] smaller buses in rural area
[normal]s.
[normal]Hospital Transport[bold]Community Transport[bold]              [bold]              
[normal]The cost of community transport schemes has increased and is 
[normal]   
[normal]              
[normal]not necessarily cheaper than taxis. There are als
[normal]o problems in 
[normal]              
[normal]getting
[normal] 
[normal]transport, 
[normal]other services 
[normal]such as Slinky are not provided 
[normal]in 
[normal]              
[normal]all areas of the 
[normal]C
[normal]ounty
[normal] (
[normal]report extract 
[normal]Jan 2009)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]If you have a 
[normal]              
[normal]concessionary pass, depending on 
[normal]which service 
[normal]you use, you 
[normal]              
[normal]can use your bus p
[normal]ass.  
[normal]Slinky is limited to certain areas and it 
[normal]              
[normal]doesn’t cross boundaries
[normal], they serve the local communities in the 
[normal]              
[normal]areas they are based.
[normal] “
[normal]If one person wants it in the north and then 
[normal]              
[normal]another wants it
[normal] in the south it cannot be done”.
[normal]  
[normal]These services 
[normal]              
[normal]are also in high demand and are often difficult to obtain.
[normal]              
[normal]No community transport is available in the evenings to provide 
[normal]              
[normal]transport for disabled people to attend groups. This can be a vital 
[normal]              
[normal]way of preventing isolation.
[normal] 
[normal]Taxis[bold]              
[normal]When disabled people have to use taxis to get to appointments 
[normal]              
[normal]because of lack of availability of public transport they need to have 
[normal]              
[normal]a known company to use as access can vary e.g. the ramps used 
[normal]              
[normal]for powered chairs are not always to the same safety standards.
