"Written evidence submitted by the Churches Refugee Network (LAI 0084)Introduction:The requirement of a 1-year residence test will be contrary to the provisions in the European Equality Directives for the following groups of people, and inevitably will bring into sharper public contrast those areas of the UK Asylum and Immigration laws which are currently allowed to override most other legislation, and which often clash with the Directives.1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUndocumented citizens who have lived in Britain most of their lives (\nun- aware of the need to obtain British citizenship\n)\n2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThose recently granted refugee status.

They are almost without exception relegated to the lowest socio-economic rungs, and the recipients of societal discrimination  in employment, accommodation and treatment by statutory authorities  tasked with pu\nblic order and border control. We fully  recognizing the need for  sensible border controls , serving our national interest of resource distribution and balanced economic development. Yet we find it extremely difficult to persuade ourselves that the measur\nes proposed do serve these common purposes rather than amount to a generalised discrimination amounting to xenophobia.\nWe will now comment specifically on each of the above groups listed: \n1.) Undocumented citizens who have lived in Britain most of their lives but were not \nmade \naware of the need to obtain British citizenship when their origins are from a Commonwealth country which gained independence after they left.\n Often they\n are\n not well educated and socially marginalised\n in fairly closed local communities\n. A\nfter years of \n‘under the \nstatutory \nradar’ residence \ntheir official presence in \nBritain\n \nhas\n suddenly registered. T\nhey are\n frequently\n shocked to be \n‘\ndetected\n’, often having been un\na\nware of their illegal status, \n and help\nless to find a solution. \nIf their ‘residence clock’ \n(re)\nstarts at point of\n statutory\n detection they too wi\nll be excluded from Legal Aid, a\ns will their children.\n \nSeveral such cases  were found by us  in a number of primary schools in \nSE London\n  by teachers \nwith  whom we are in contact, and often they bring  them  to our attention because the\n stressful\n situation affects children’s behaviour and academic performance. \nMany of these children have one British (possibly absent) parent  and one un-\nstatused\n \n, often \nsingle, \nparent; many are entitled to obtain British citizenship both by UK parentage and by length of stay. Without obtaining \ngood \n legal advice\n,\n clarification \nand – support \nsuch an application will not be submitted and both child and un-\nstatused\n parent ar\ne at risk of detention and removal. \nMostly such families are very poor, even destitute, and legal work could never be funded by them. \n(The fee charged for a British passport is a first deterrent, at ?£750.-) We have helped to start a fund to collect such (\nexorbitant) fees, and referral to charitable legal assistance ‘on tap’ for such cases. \nIf \nparent and child(\nren\n) are not informed, and \nthe authorities t\nake action to detain and remove, (often) long-standing \nfamily life is destroyed and the children’s future\n and education disrupted. \n&#xa0;\n2.) Those recently granted refugee status.By the nature of our work, and that of our Committee members, we retain contact with many former asylum seekers who acquired a form of Leave to Remain, be it as  full refugees, or Discr\netionary (Legacy\n) Leave. They may seek work and accommodation, but in the current climate this is incredibly hard. Many end up as home carers, cleaners  or security staff, employed on zero-hours contracts. We need not spell out the consequences of inadequa\nte and irregular income which engulfs them. Here is \na\n case study:\n&#xa0;\nFrancophone recently granted DLR under the Legacy backlog cases, works as an agency  home \ncarer\n at £3.50/ hour \nexcluding\n travel costs, achieving on average 16-20 hours per week, or £112-£120.-\nLived in a studio flat costing £900.-/ month, only part covered by Housing Benefit. She relies each month on church support for her food and utility bills. She has recently left the f\nlat and moved in with friends , hoping to save enough  to get her 16 year old daughter over here who is at risk of a premature Muslim marriage and female circumcision. \nIt means she no longer meets HO rules for housing her child.\nAs this form of  Leave gran\nted does not permit Family Reunion as a refugee, she will need to earn £18.600+ to qualify for bringing her child to safety, which she will not achieve before the girl’s 18\nth\n birthday.....Paying to challenge the Family Rules  of July 2012, or her working c\nonditions,  is out of the question without Legal Aid.\n&#xa0;3.) The effect on spouses/ partners and children, especially those living abroad: \n1) \n under the new Family Rules\n 09/07/2012\n \n, and 2) under previous settlement grants \nwhich declares them to be  NRPF\n \n(No\n Recourse to Public Funds)\n until 2 years of settlement\n. \nTo \npr\nevent the\nse groups \n from access to Legal Aid would make an already highly ethnic/gender discriminatory situation even worse. \n 1) \nThose who entered into marriage/partnership whilst in the \nUK\n under a current and valid visa are refused settlement rights, \nand \nwill not have legal help. Even if the partner is settled in \nBritain\n, it is clear many will not have the resources to take private legal action\n, especially \nfor those \nwhere the British partne\nr is of \nboth \na British ethnic minority background \nand\n female, falling in the very lowest of median \nUK\n annual incomes.\n (see \nKofman\n and Wray, \n and \n)\n It also applies to those who \nrecently entered under visas \nobtained after an \nArranged Marriage \nand have not \nyet reached the 2 years’ stay entitling them to settle in their own right.\n The JCHR will also be familiar with the current spate of legal actions against those affected by the Family Rules July 2012 receiving spousal\n/ close relative \n visa refusals  affecti\nng even quite well off \nand high status professionals who are  \nBritish citizens.....\n..\n \n&#xa0;\n4.) Adverse effect on asylum seekers detained under DFT/Detained Fast Track \n, that \npernicious\n, pseudo-\n legal procedure. During this form of detention \n they are not deemed to have entered the \nUK\n. \n \nThough there are legal aid contractors listed for these cases, the quality of such advice is variable from very good to appalling, depending on the luck of the dice\n via\n assignment by the Home Office in the \nIRC\n.\n Such new arrivals \nmay\n occasionally\n (though \nthey \nrarely\n are\n) be\n lifted out\n if their cases are recognised to be ‘too complex for quick resolution under DFT’\n(as the Guidelines say) \n or if they are acknowledged to be sick, or victims of torture\n,\n thanks \nnot to\n IRC medical centres but mostly \nto independent NGO assessment by Medical Justice and a DFT  solicit\nor who will fight for them. Most\n however reach the end of their superficial and hasty procedure\n and failure\n, remain\ning \n in detention to await removal...somet\nimes weeks and months (see recent migrant detention statistics) \nThere are approximately 30.000 immigration detainees annually. Of these, 30% , or ?10.000 are held in Detained Fast Track.\n&#xa0;\n5.)Those who delayed seeking asylum, remaining illegal, \nhaving \narrived irregularly/ unnoti\nced, including those trafficked and hence not ‘on the arrival  radar’ with\nin\n the immigration service.\n Often they avoid contact because their previous trauma causes them to  fear any  authorities.\n They struggle invisibly, with men\ntal health symptoms of PTSD, and at risk of exploitation and self harm.\n&#xa0;\nMost\nly such\n people, once detained, are immediately labelled ‘Detained Fast Track’ procedure cases\n; a p\nrocedure which, more than any other,  illustrates the \n \ndeeply ensconced \nstatutory\n disbelief of anything a migrant \nor asylum seeker \nmay say. It\n means they \nwill \nhave an overhasty asylum procedure with\nin the IR\nC’s, with \n \ndesignated \nspecialist\n contract \n immigration detention lawyers, who have often no more than half an hour for interview a\nnd appeal preparation and who remain without\n any opportunity to gather quality\n evidence in support of the claim. \nMost, \neg\n. \n98-99% of such claims are refused. Thereafter many\n, especially those \n \nwho cannot be re\n-\ndocumented and/or removed, \nremain in detention\n for prolonged periods during which they can sometimes access lawyers who will provide a Judicial Review\n if new evidence arrives \nduring \n the detention period.....\n. We \nknow, as do many detention NGO’s and specialist lawyers, of \n many such cases who eventual\nly succeed\ned\n and obtain\ned L\neave to Remain. To close all access to \nfurther \nLegal Aid \neg\n. for Fresh Claims followed by Judicial Reviews, \nfor such cases is \nunjust.\n \n6.) The undocumented, the Stateless, and the ‘ un-removeables’ :If someone\n arrived without documents, or with false documents, \nand are promptly or shortly afterwards detained, \nthey may receive a criminal sentence, with further \ndire \nconsequences\n under these same proposals on \ntheir eligibility for Legal Aid \n-\nsee \nbelow \nunder \n‘propo\nsed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisoners’.\n Whilst awaiting such procedures they will be in immigration detention and are legally deemed \nnot\n to have entered the \nUK\n.\nOthers \nare or \n \nhave \nbecome\n de facto Stateless, and\n the Home Office s\nhows no signs of \nany \nwillingness\n \nto implement the new UNHCR Statelessness Guidelines\n unless coerced legally\n. \nYou will be aware that\n a number of  countries \ndon’t re-document their ex citizens: \namongst them \nChina\n, \nIndia\n, \nBangladesh\n, \nIran\n, \nSomalia\n.\nEven if released on Temporary Admission or bail, such people will be unable to access a lawyer to present their statelessness- or ‘un-\nremoveable\n’ claim, and will live for prolonged periods  in \na \nNASS Section 4 \n futureless and destitute \nlimbo, depending on \nhand-outs and compatriots......\n&#xa0;\n7.) .) The effects on victims of domestic violence or abuse who are in the \nUK\n \n less than a year and hav\ne not\n completed the 2 years residence test \nwhich would allow\n them to \nhave sought \nsettlement in their own right.\n It appli\nes especially to those who arrive as spouses in arranged marriages, to those coming under Art.8 as refugee relatives, \nto those who come to join as a \nnewly wed\n or civil partner  to a British citizen , \nand  also\n, especially, \n to those recently arrived to joi\nn \nin \na relation of informal cohabitation. During this time they are under conditions of ‘No Recourse to Public Funds’ and hence doubly ineligible for Legal Aid.\n Transfer into a strange country often brings out weaknesses in relationships, causing tensions \nand breakdown. \nAmongst NGO’s such as ours, it is well recognized that p\nartners\n/ family members\n of newly \nstatused\n refugees\n, ‘New Citizens’,\n after a joyous reunion, soon \nfind that the enforced separation of many years caused by the asylum procedure’s \nnotorious\n  \ninefficiencies, may have \ncaused estrangement, and often changed\n the power balance within a marriage.\n  U\nnder a 1 year residence \nrequirement these vulnerable sp\nouses\n/ partners \n would \n have no legal remedy and their children may  be un\n(\nder\n)\n-protect\ned\n too\n.\n Under the EEA2006 Regulations\n on DV, this is even more so for\n thos\ne who cohabit informally; as yet they \ncannot have Legal Aid for confronting a DV situation. \nWhilst the \nAIRE Centre\n has assisted to successfully win 2 such cases \nat\n Tribunal level, t\nhis has not yet resulted in a change of regulation to protect informal co\n-\nhabituees\n who will be left\n without support\n. We\n currently \n have one such a case, a visa-law abiding University  post Graduate \nstudent\n. She was\n  finally released on bail after  5 month\ns’\n immigration \n detention\n.\n (Incidentally, her appeal will not be heard until Spring; due to Courts’ overload with unrepresented cases \n,\n staffing\n-\n and interpreting\n problems\n.\n). Initially she was, regretfully, refused Legal Aid\n by her committed\n solicitor,\n (hi\nmself an ex immigr\nation detainee before becoming a solicitor\n) \n until DV was documented and the AIRE precedent cases allowed a judge to grant Leave attracting  Legal Aid. Meanwhile, her church/ NGO support network in the NE had already given an undertaking \nthey would carry the legal costs if no Legal Aid were to be obtained. It is but one of many examples of the voluntary sector being pres\nsed into substituting statutory funding \nfor \nmeritorious\n cases denied LA under the present rules\n.\n States’ explicit  obliga\ntions under international law  are being dishonoured by the new Legal Aid rules. \nAt the current rate the ‘Big Society’ is shrinking to quite a small ‘Good Society’ as statutory resources are being \nwithheld from more\n and more areas of migrant lives, whilst \nobstructing their ability to contribute to our society\n economically and culturally\n. \n&#xa0;\n8.) a)+ b): a) The effects on those who arrived with a valid visa to work and found their work was abusive, their study not as agreed, or even non-existent.\n E\nxamples \nare those undocumented \nmigrants, \nso \noften youngsters,  who are arrested\n after being illegal trafficked, and then  kept locked up  in exploitative and illegal employment \nmaintaining secret \n‘\nmarijuana farms\n’ in unobtrusive private houses to pay off debts to \nprotect their  far away families from criminality. And \n the many women , from E.\n \nEurope\n \n, Africa, SE \nAsia,who\n are \nmisled and lied to, then \ntrafficked hoping to ob\ntain  a promised ‘good job’ \nend\ning\n up\n \nraped, and \nlocked \n in\nto \n sexual or  domestic exploitatio\nn\n with their passports confiscated and threatened with police- and immigration action\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n8.) b) Adverse effects on foreign students, especially non-EEA, \neg\n. in problems with the  grants- or college authorities. \nStudents who applied in good faith to find their college was non-existent, or did not offer them the promised \ngrants, or \nthe pre-paid and promised \nstudent \naccommodation. We had one such a case; fortunately we could\n at the time \n \nstill refer for \n legal assis\ntance. That would no longer be available if a 1 year residence Legal Aid blocking rule is to\n be applied\n.\n&#xa0;\n9.) The proposed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisonersFor the government to rely entirely on the internal prison complaints sy\nstem to remedy regime deficiencies, injustices, failures to act on medical or disability issues is entirely unsatisfactory. \nAmongst them:\n.) Prisoners with health – or disability problems of institutional  management within institutions.\n.) Prisoners requi\nring continuity of medication , \neg\n. \nimmuno\n-suppressant- or psychogenic drugs.\n.) Foreign National Prisoners who were detained on arrival for an immigration documentary offense, and had no opportunity to consult a legal representative.\n.) Prisoners subjecte\nd to bullying by other prisoners or by staff.\n.) Prisoners unable to access education.\n \nWe believe other orga\nni\nsations, with daily \nexperience of the criminal prison system will respond better  on this  to the Commission; \nW\ne do not have sufficient \nin-depth \nknowledge of prison practices to usefully assist the JHCR. \nHowever, we refer the Commission \nto an informed \n analysis\n of the qualitative \nissue\ns in prison law (as well as alternative cost projections) \nin a paper by \nDr.N\n.\n \nArmstrong of Matrix Chamber\ns\n. \n \nWe no\nte however, that prisoners in the criminal law system usually have criminal, not immigration-  lawyers. Their expertise mostly does not cover immigration law and \nit\n’\ns\n attendant problems of health and trauma.  \nO\nur long standing experience of Immigration Re\nmov\nal Centre procedures shows us t\nhat \n internal complaint procedures and remedies such as Independent Monitoring Boards, have had no \ndiscernable\n effect on outcome for almost all most complaints except very minor ones.\nThe arguments below apply to Foreign N\national Prisoners, be they in RDC’s or in prisons: \n \nT\nhe removal of Legal Aid for internal detention issues is\n therefore \nlikely to be harmful\n, especially in connection with \nserious \nissues of medical/ mental health treatment, allegations of assault or sexua\nl abuse, and  racial , religious or gender discrimin\natory language or behaviour; L\nike \nother immigration detention NGO’s, \nwe \nhave \nample\n distressing case anecdotes\n:\n \nF\nailure to \nacknowledge, or \noffer \ntreatment to, \nvictims of torture, as well as non-compliance \nwith UN rules they should not be detained, is but one example.\n.....\n We have been involved in th\nis\n issue since 1998:\n It h\nas\n taken \ndecades\n of insistence\n against \nH\nome \nO\nffice\n \nstonewalling \n by \n specialist NGO \nMedical \nJustice\n, lawyers, visitors’ groups \n and othe\nrs\n \n to receive an undertaking from the Home Office such reports \nwould\n be taken serious....\nusually only after a successful legal challenge.\n \nFor \nyears\n they were not\n; Lord \nAvebury\n and colleagues have done PQ’s about Rule 35 from 2007 onwards\n,.....\n.  A\n  2012 i\nnspection report by ICI John Vine noted that torture victims\n, or vi\nctims of traffickin\ng were not adequately attended to \n....\n    \nIt is only \nvery \nrecently\n, after  several more of their  PQ’s throughout 2013, \nthat we have \nfirst hand\n experience\n (in August 20\n13) \nhow \n for one of our \n tortured \nex detainees \nthat undertaking \nwas \nfinally being honour\ned without having to resort to  judicial oversight \nto grant release.\n \nThe unreasonable \ntime pressures on those solicitors \ndoing contract detention work ensures that \nunless specialist\n- and advocacy \n NGO’s \ncan \nintervene , such claims\n will\n rarely reach the courts. If Legal Aid is no longer a\nvailable to those detained, \n that option will be closed.\n \nThat has grave\n real life \n consequences: \nW\nith \n specialist therapeutic NGO’s\n we\n  remain aware of ex detainees where the consequences of neglecting PTSD in prison situations \nh\na\ns \nled\n \n to \nsevere \npsychotic breakdowns\n, in detention and upon release, \nand  long term functional damage. \nSuch a \ncase history generalises undoubtedly to the gr\nowing number of  Foreign National Prisoners in our\n prison\n estate\n: Depriving them of Legal Aid  to address weaknesses of institutional management is a recipe for serious incidents both for \ngood \ninstitutional order and individual prisoner well being.\n \n&#xa0;\n10) Providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid for work done on the case if the Courts grant Leave to proceed.Much of the preparatory work for a Judicial Review must be performed prior to lodging. \nThis was a result of the reforms following the Carter Review. \nThe advantage of this is less work/ cost post Leave to appeal, and better\n ongoing \n \ncommunication between counsels \nand their instructing solicitors\n, \n and the courts. \nMany of the cases presented \n, especially\n but not only, \n in asylum/ immigration, are of the sort which have life changing consequences if \n statutory decisions\n are not challenged\n.  \nIn addition a number of them are prepared\n specifically  to investigate\n significant issues of public inte\nrest which have previously been denied hearing, yet clearly need clarification or challenging as to their legality.\n \nShould the preparatory work for such issues no longer be payable, then solicitors will no longer be able to instruct and pay counsels witho\nut putting their firm’\ns economic survival at risk. It will increase the number of appeals against refusals of Leave to Proceed\n, another Court burden.\n \nFurthermore, w\ne are  aware that many of the cases currently submitted for Leave to Proceed to Judicial Re\nview, will result in the respondent \n‘\ngiving way\n’\n and  hence bringing the case to an acceptable outcome without incurring further public costs. The level of such pre-hearing agreements is , we are told and have experienced, very high; ( around 50%, see also\n Armstrong, footnote 8) since lawyers would not usually pursue a matter if they were not already convinced of \nit\n’\ns\n merit, both in legal terms and in Legal Aid criteria parlance Such cases are de facto ‘successful’ from the point of view of the appellant. However his/her legal team \nwould not be paid\n for that good outcome.  \nWe are aware that the intentions of the \nrece\nnt \nlegislation \non the legal profession’s reform, \nare to \nsignificantly \nshrink the number of \n public law practitioners\n through\n removing \n their ability to \ndraw\n upon Legal Aid\n. B\nut to do so by denying the less affluent, less articulate  members of those in the\n UK  \na\n legal remedy is unjust\n and \ndiscriminatory, \ncontraven\ning both the Equality Directive on equal access to goods and services and \n Art.6 of the ECHR\n on the right to fair trial. It will short\n \ncircuit and thus  \n \ndeeply \ndamage the quality of legal debate i\nn our \ncountry\n and eventually our legal profession, and it\n’\ns\n \ndeservedly \neminent\n global reputation. Both will irreparably damage  the common good.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n11) \nLegal aid should be removed for all cases assessed as having “borderline” prospects of success.This section does not differentiate between ‘borderline’ and ‘vexatious’ cases: Legal Aid removal for cases clearly falling into the latter category is of course justifiable....if ‘vexatious ‘ is what they are........However, ‘borderline’, as used here,  i\ns a concept which is seriously deficient in practical application: \nThe LAA Legal Aid awarding authority already implements a self administered assessment by the solicitor, the ‘merits test’. Many solicitors practice it in a very cautious manner\n to avoid lo\nsing income\n, sometimes resulting in deserving cases not being heard for lack of Legal Aid (so-called ‘cherry picking’)\n.\n \nOther practitioners, committed to their client\n’s predicament\n, will take more risk in assigning ‘merit’ and \npersist in \napply\ning\n for Lega\nl Aid. But there is an issue he\nre of potential damage to \ndevelopment\n of the law\n:  ‘Borderline’ cases are often those where existing case law or expert evidence is not conclusive or  situation\ns\n in the ‘real world’\n  have\n changed such as to require judicial r\ne-examination.\n \nOn such occasions a ‘borderline’ case will serve the public interest of developing a new judicial consensus to address the\nse\n changed circumstances. \nWithin the immigration- and asylum  field that continues to happen on a regular basis: the \nresolution of issues around female gender, definitions of persecution, of internal relocation, of freedom to practice  or openly hold religious or political views have all been the subject of such ‘borderline’ cases and resolved in a manner which changes c\nase law judicial consensus. \n \nWe do not therefore approve of this proposal to tighten exclusion for cases whose assessment of merit are not immediately clear cut.\nSeptember 2013\n \nCouncil Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin\n&#xa0;\n: also called the \"Race Directive\" (\nDirective 2000/43/EC on Anti-discrimination\n) \n\n \n \nDirective 2006/54/EC\n of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation\n \n\n  Council \nDirective 2004/113/EC\n of 13 December 2004 implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and\n services\n \nhttp://sprc.info/news/family-migration-rules-could-cost-uk-850-million-in-a-decade-say-middlesex-academics/\n \nMiddlesex \nUni.Dept.Law\n/Dept.
