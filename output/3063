[normal]&#xa0;[bold]House of Lords EU Select Committee - EU action to tackle youth unemployment Call for[bold] [bold]Evidence October 2013[bold]We are delighted that the House of Lords is taking the issue of youth unemployment seriously and looking at ways that this crisis can be tackled across the whole EU region.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Impetus – The Private Equity Foundation (Impetus – PEF) is a venture philanthro
[normal]py organisation that 
[normal]provide
[normal]s
[normal] package
[normal]s
[normal] of support to high calibre charities which includes; grant funding, intensive management support, and pro bono expertise which helps charities scale-up and have greater social impact.  Our areas of focus are education
[normal]al attainment at secondary school for the most disadvantaged, and work readiness. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the UK current approaches to tackling youth unemployment are failing.  We have a structural issue in this country.  Youth unemployment has been on the rise since the ear
[normal]ly 2000’s and a return to economic growth will not be enough to fix the problem.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We believe that fundamentally youth unemployment can only be reduced if we support all young people in their transition from education into employment.  
[normal]This might seem lik
[normal]e an obvious point but by focussing on youth unemployment and not th
[normal]e school to work transition, 
[normal]policy often ends up being focussed on the problem rather than the prevention.  We want to see policies which are about early intervention.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Young people’s ti
[normal]me in education must reflect the changing needs of the labour market if they are to make a successful school to work transition, with focus being placed on both achieving better qualifications and having the skills and work experience today’s employers req
[normal]uire.  Qualifications are important.  A person who leaves school with 5 GCSE’s A*- C will on average earn 20% more than a person who leaves with no qualifications.  And, a person who gets a degree will earn on average 105% more than someone with no qualifi
[normal]cations.  However, qualifications are not the only game in town.  Over the last 30 years skills needs have shifted, making it harder for young people to enter the workforce.  But the way education and employers interact has not moved with the times.  More 
[normal]than 1 in 5 employed young people are in sales and customer service – these employers often expect young people to be job ready from day one – this was not the case when large proportions of young people worked in manufacturing and were trained on the job.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Employers have a central role to play – and most that we talk to understand this although they often struggle to know how or what they can do.  We often ask; ‘are our young people ready for the world of work?’ we should also be asking; ‘are our employers
[normal] ready for young people?’
[normal]Although we fully agree that this issue needs to be on the top of the political agenda – politicians alone cannot fix this alone.  We believe it is time for government, employers, social sector organisations, schools, parents and 
[normal]young people to collaborate – we all have a role to play.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]So what should we do to make the transition from education to employment smoother?  Below are five areas that we believe the commission should consider and we would be happy to speak about each in 
[normal]more detail:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With over one million young people out of work, the UK has one of the highest youth unemployment rates of OCED c
[normal]ountries – although we are not alone in the EU, struggling with this problem.  This is certainly an issue which requires focus from government, employers, schools and the social sector.  However, we strongly believe that by only focusing on the young peopl
[normal]e who are out of work today, we may omit to fix the entrenched structural issue.  For the sake of future generations we must also implement policies that ensure our 14, 15 and 16 year olds are being adequately prepared now for their transition from educati
[normal]on into employment.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is not an either or choice.  Yes, support the young people who are struggling to find work today.  More employers must be encouraged to take on trainees and apprentices providing qualifications, valuable work experience and a full time job once comple
[normal]ted.  But, we also need to consider the children within the education system and what can be done now to adequately prepare them for the employment market.  
[normal]A schools
[normal] primary objective is for young people to gain qualifications and whilst this is incredibl
[normal]y important more surely must be done both within school and outside to equip young people with the skills, qualifications and experience 
[normal]todays
[normal] employers require.  High quality, locally relevant and face to face careers, information advice and guidance can
[normal] play a huge role in helping young people make the right choices about the career path which is right for them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The House of Lords is right to have raised youth unemployment as an area of concern, we would urge them to also think about the next generation
[normal].  A clear vision is required of the kind of youth labour market we want, both in the UK and across the EU.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the UK, Germany is often cited as a great example of what can be achieved, but always followed with; “but we are not Germany”.  This must be tru
[normal]e of all EU countries 
[normal]who
[normal] face a youth unemployment crisis.  Surely there are opportunities for us to learn from Germany and other member states, however, labour markets especially for the young are 
[normal]very
[normal] localised.  We need to consider who we are as a nati
[normal]on and what kind of youth labour market we want.
[normal]  Our 
[normal]vision is for a UK youth labour market with clear and valued academic and vocational pathways to employment.  A system where educators and employers, social sector, parents and young people are collabor
[normal]ators and where as a society none of us are satisfied unless every young person is supported to gain the qualifications, skills and work experience required for them to make a successful transition from education into employment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case study – [bold]ThinkForward[bold]ThinkFor
[normal]ward
[normal] was created in 2010 by Impetus – The Private Equity Foundation 
[normal]following its research into how to dramatically reduce the likelihood of young people becoming NEET (not in education, employment or training).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]Thinkforward
[normal] Programme current
[normal]ly operates in fourteen schools in East London and is aimed at ensuring students who are at risk of dropping out make a successful transition from education to employment. It is part funded by a social impact bond commissioned by the Department for Work an
[normal]d Pension’s (DWP) Innovation Fund and using a payment-by-results contract.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An experienced coach is placed in the school and using a data driven approach the 10% of year nine pupils identified as being most at risk of dropping out or not making a successfu
[normal]l transition from education into employment are, enrolled onto the programme.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The coaches provide sustained support from age 14 to 19, providing continuity through what can be a turbulent time in life.  Coaches work with the students to develop an actio
[normal]n plan for their future career.  
[normal]Where young people need specific help the coach signposts them to local service providers who are best able to support them.
[normal]  Critical to its success is the way 
[normal]ThinkForward
[normal] engages employers.  Participants benefit from wor
[normal]k place visits, careers days, work tasters and work experience placements.  All young people spend time with a business mentor, attend skills based courses and receive support as they develop their CV, apply to college or for jobs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The evidence shows that
[normal] 
[normal]Thinkforward
[normal] is making a tangible impact in the schools who are already involved in the project. The programme’s annual review for 2012 reports that 98% of young people progressed into education and employment during the pilot, 700 new young people have b
[normal]een enrolled, and 100 employees have volunteered on the project. 
[normal]Of the 350 pupils old enough to have taken their GCSE’s, 55% have achieved 55% A*-C, beating an original target of 30%.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Success is measured by hard and soft outcomes. Hard outcomes measures 
[normal]include a focus on qualifications, behaviour, attendance and entry into training, learning or sustained employment. To measure the softer outcomes, a personal development tracker tool is used to assess young people's readiness for work in terms of mindset 
[normal](for example self-belief, aspiration, determination) and employability (for example teamwork, communication, planning and organising) skills. Planned evaluation activities from the DWP and the Education Endowment Foundation include a randomised control tri
[normal]al in four schools focusing on education outcomes, and a qualitative and quantitative study in ten schools looking at both education and employment outcomes.
