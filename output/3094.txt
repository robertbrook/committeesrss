[[[Introduction ]]]1.1              BIS are responsible for the industrial strategy and we published the Oil &amp; Gas Strategy in March 2013.  It has a clear focus to support oil and gas investment, boost growth and enhance the UK's energy security.  1.2              In addition, BIS is responsible for: &#xa0;1.3              UKTI sector teams and international networks identify overseas opportunities for the UK supply chain.  They share information with industry, assess UK capability in oil, gas and mining and promote UK capability overseas.   UKTI also provide direct support for companies and promote UK business overseas – including by ministerial visits.1.4              DECC seeks to ensure the UK has secure, clean and affordable energy supplies. To that end, DECC works with the oil and gas industry to maximise the UK's oil and gas resource and is working with industry to realise its economic potential.&#xa0;&#xa0;1.5              DECC responsibilities include the issuing of licences for oil and gas exploration and production, regulating field development and offshore oil and gas pipeline activities as well as regulating the environmental aspects of the offshore oil and gas industry, including decommissioning.&#xa0;DECC&#xa0;sponsors the Coal Authority whose responsibility includes issuing licences for coal exploration and extraction.&#xa0;

[[[Economic Contribution]]]

[[[ including employment]]]2.1              The extractive industries, and the petroleum sector in particular, generate significant economic rent—the difference between the value and cost of production. Extractive industry revenues tend to be volatile, uncertain and exhaustible.2.2              Information on the economic contribution of UK coal, oil and gas production – including in terms of direct contribution to GDP, direct employment and investment – is included in UK Energy in Brief. That contribution is summarised in the following table:2.3              The table at 

[[[Annex ]]]

[[[1]]]

[[[ ]]]gives a feel for the importance of fossil fuels to meeting UK energy demand and of UK production of those fuels.2.4              Comprehensive information on the UK oil and gas industry including the UK supply chain is provided in the annual Economic Report of Oil &amp; Gas UK.  Including the 36,000 people it estimates to have been directly employed in hydrocarbon exploration and production in 2012, Oil &amp; Gas UK estimate that the UK upstream oil and gas industry supported some 450,000 jobs.  There are many highly skilled jobs, across the whole economy, with 200,000 employed in the supply chain, 112,000 in jobs induced by the economic activity of the above employees and 100,000 in the export of goods and services.2.5              Up-to date coal statistics are published by the Coal Authority and by UK Coal. UK Coal’s Daw Mill deep mine closed in March 2013 following a devastating fire. That leaves the UK with just three large operational deep mines – Hatfield, Kellingley and Thoresby collieries. 2.6              The greatest part of UK coal demand comes from electricity generation. Power stations have represented more than 80% of total UK coal consumption each year since 2001 and 86% in 2012. Over this period coal has provided on average around a third of total UK electricity with gas’s share averaging 40% (and approaching a half in 2008–2010) but those shares were roughly reversed in 2012.2.7              UKTI published UK – Delivering Global Mining Solutions in June 2013, providing an overview of the UK’s world class capabilities to the global mining sector, including mining, finance and consulting services.2.8              Information on UK fossil fuel production is published monthly by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and summarised annually in the Digest of UK energy statistics (DUKES), most recently in July 2013:

[[[ industry]]]&#xa0;3.1              As set out in UK – Delivering Global Mining Solutions capability publication, the UK's mining equipment designers and manufacturers deliver world-leading products across the entire mining lifecycle.  The UK has world-leading educational providers and cutting edge R&amp;D facilities which deliver training as well as research which is utilised across the world. &#xa0;3.2              A UK firm can provide equipment with many of the components manufactured in the UK including planning, construction, operation and closure.  London is also a centre of excellence in the provision of business and professional services in support of the sector.   &#xa0;3.3              These UK-based services supporting the extractive industries have often developed in response to mining companies listed in London and/or have located in London to be close to their client’s Head Quarters.&#xa0;3.4              More specifically, locally sourced extractives are important to other sectors in the UK.  A good example is indigenous limestone which is used in the manufacture of cement, mortar and concrete.  Limestone is vital for security of supply and cost competitiveness in construction projects.

[[[UK Extractive Industries Competitive Position]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1              The Oil &amp; Gas Industrial Strategy highlighted that the oil and gas sector generates £27bn for the economy. The strategy also shows that the UK is the largest producer of oil in Europe and that forecasts show that there will be record investment in 2013 of £14bn to search for and produce UK oil and gas reserves.  4.2              UK firms are involved across the mining supply chain from the provision of components to manufacture of completed items of equipment which are exported across the globe.  With limited domestic opportunities, UK mining equipment companies have had to develop innovative products and technologies to compete internationally.&#xa0;4.3              The UK has world class engineering design companies active in the extractives sector and involved in mine design, construction, and associated services such as power, water and infrastructure.  UK consultancies advise on all aspects of the mine design and operation including environmental impact assessments and master planning.   As well as the global financial centre for the industry, London is also a centre of excellence in the provision of business and professional services which support the sector.&#xa0;

[[[Corporate Governance ]]]

[[[and reputation]]]&#xa0;5.1               London is one of the world’s leading financial centres and attracts a wide range of companies to list on its markets.  As well as having significant expertise in mining and extractives, a key strength of the UK and its financial institutions is its strong corporate governance framework, which is robust by comparison to many countries in which extractives may operate.  A listing on the London Stock Exchange is evidence that a company is held to a high standard which promotes confidence when dealing with that company. &#xa0;5.2              The extractive industry has a unique risk profile as a result of the varied projects that the average extractive company carries out. These projects are often in countries carrying greater risks which require permits and licences.  There are particular risks which extractive companies could be particularly exposed to. These might be reputational, operational, environmental as well as bribery and corruption risks. The UK’s existing regulatory regime helps to mitigate these risks.  Extractive companies have a responsibility to ensure that their corporate governance is compliant with the regulatory regime. &#xa0;&#xa0;5.3              In itself, the number of extractives listing in the UK should not pose any concerns if they are compliant with the regulatory regime.   However, there are a number of events that would raise concerns that the regulatory regime is being improperly applied.  This includes, but is not limited to:i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; a significant number of companies displaying corporate governance failures;ii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; inadequate monitoring or enforcement of failures of corporate governance on an industrial scale;iii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; corporate governance failures affecting the market value of extractives across the industry as a whole and;iv)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; a significant number of companies listing in London that pose a significantly higher risk profile than the average FTSE listing.  &#xa0;5.4              Without mitigating these risks, investors could question the effectiveness of the UK regulatory framework as whole, with inherent reputational risks to the UK and its financial institutions. &#xa0;5.5              At present, there are concerns that the interests of minority shareholders are under-represented in companies where there are powerful majority shareholders and in companies which are traded publicly but have a relatively small proportion of shares in public circulation. In both these situations there is a concern about the increased concentrations of shareholder power in the hands of the few. This means it is less likely that minority shareholders will be able to make their views known and hold directors to account in the event of corporate governance failures. &#xa0;5.6              These issues have been considered by the UK Listing Authority.  The FCA consulted last October on proposals to enhance the effectiveness of the Listing Regime overall and in particular to provide greater protection to shareholders in situations where there is a controlling shareholder.&#xa0; FCA intends to provide feedback on this consultation in October. &#xa0;

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;6.1              The UK Government is committed to working with stakeholders including industry and NGOs when developing and delivering policy.  The Accounting Directive and EITI provide good examples of the Government working with both NGOs and Industry on transparency. 6.2              At the international level, the Board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) brings together civil society organisations and companies and investors on a regular basis to agree the EITI rules by consensus.&#xa0; Several UK-listed extractive companies are on the EITI Board. In each of the 39 countries which implement the EITI, there is a multi-stakeholder group of Government, companies and civil society which together oversee the EITI process.&#xa0; 6.3              As part of the UK implementation of the EITI, BIS is establishing a multi-stakeholder group which will also allow UK extractive companies and NGOs to work together to oversee reporting of payments to the UK Government for extractives.6.4              BIS brought NGOs and industry together to work on extractives transparency during the negotiations and implementation of the Accounting Directive.  The most recent meeting included industry representatives from Shell, BP, BG Group, Rio Tinto and Anglo American, who attended alongside NGO representatives from Publish What You Pay, CAFOD, Tearfund, Christian Aid, Global Witness and ONE.  &#xa0;6.5              These meetings helped to build understanding between the two groups around the reasons why they had each adopted their respective positions.  These meetings allowed them to begin to identify areas where a compromise could satisfy both parties.  BIS will continue to hold all-group meetings at regular intervals during the implementation phase.

[[[Extractive Sector and skills ]]]7.1              The extractive industries cover a wide group of sub-sectors from mining and quarrying to the oil and gas extraction industries all with similar, but different, skills challenges. 7.2              The Oil and Gas sector Industrial Strategy identified how the sector and the Government can work on the skills challenges faced by the sector.  Links could be made with opportunities in future sectors including shale gas. 7. 3              The strategy acknowledges that high levels of activity and global competition have resulted in skills shortages in the sector.  The lack of availability of skilled workers is one of the biggest challenges the sector faces.  The strategy suggests key actions to be taken forward by Government and Industry such as a skills gap analysis, initiatives to recruit ex-military personnel and the redeployment of those from other linked industries to the sector.  These will build on the number of existing initiatives being taken forward by the Offshore Petroleum Industry Training Organisation (OPITO) and others to ensure the pipeline of skilled individuals into the Oil and Gas sector.7.4              Increasing use of technology and automation is likely to result in a continuing contraction of the aggregates, mineral and coal industry workforce.  This in turn is creating a demand for highly skilled individuals with a wide range of talents and there are some reported skills shortages and hard to fill vacancies.   7.5              Recently, through a partnership with the Institute of Quarrying and Derby University, the industry has developed an online University Certificate in International Quarry Operations, mainly intended to support companies abroad. This partnership has launched a Centre for Mineral Products Professional Development, offering a wide range of industry developed higher level programmes. A higher level apprenticeship in Mineral Products Technology has also been launched, its development supported by the Government’s Higher Apprenticeship Fund. 7.6              We will continue to improve the responsiveness of the skills system to the needs of business.  We are promoting greater employer leadership and closer collaboration between business and higher education and further education colleges. 7.7              It is important that business leads in developing the skilled workforce required to maintain the competitiveness of the UK’s extractive industries sector and to enable its future growth.  We expect businesses to work closely with bodies such as EU Skills (the Sector Skills Council for Energy and Utilities), Cogent (Chemicals, Nuclear, Oil and Gas, petroleum and Polymers) and OPITO to help identify the sectors current and future skills challenges.7.8              Across all sectors of the UK economy, we have acknowledged the broader challenge to improve science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills.  The Government is funding a number of initiatives aimed at increasing the number of young people taking STEM subjects and improving the image of manufacturing and engineering.  These include the STEM Ambassadors programme, See Inside Manufacturing, the National Careers Service and improving the quality of all levels of apprenticeships.7.9              The BIS Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor Perkins, is undertaking a review with industry and learned bodies such as the Royal Academy of Engineering so we understand the scale of the engineering skills challenge in the UK.  He will report in the autumn.  The UK Commission for Employment and Skills also conducts work to understand the skills needs and challenges of key areas of the UK economy, including the energy sector.   &#xa0;

[[[ to EITI]]]&#xa0;8.1              The UK signed up to EITI to show leadership on extractives transparency and to encourage other countries to follow suit.  We are responding to concerns that potential EITI countries are deterred from joining the initiative due to the perception that EITI is designed for poor and corrupt countries.  The Government aims to send a clear message that EITI is a global standard for both developed as well as developing countries.&#xa0;8.2              3.5 billion people live in resource-rich countries but many are not seeing the benefits from the extraction of their natural resources. Far too often poor governance leaves citizens suffering from conflict and corruption. The EITI was formed to change this.&#xa0;8.3              We anticipate there could be domestic and international benefits to business in the UK signing up to EITI.  Domestically, there is potential for an improved relationship between industry and civil society as they work together to implement EITI.     8.4              Internationally, UK extractives companies operating in resource-rich countries benefit from lower reputational risk and better relations with the communities where they operate. EITI is a strong signal that the UK is a responsible operator, further enhancing our reputation abroad.8.5              The UK getting our own house in order will encourage others, including emerging economies, to sign up. As more countries join the EITI, overall global standards of transparency are raised, and together with mandatory reporting, this levels the playing field for UK companies. 8.6              The International Board requires the major decisions including scope and materiality of each domestic EITI to be decided and agreed by its Multi-Stakeholder Group, consisting of industry, civil society and Government.  The UK MSG will meet for the first time on 9 October to begin its work to agree a proportionate process and develop a work plan on implementation.&#xa0;8.7              It is important that reporting requirements are consistent, whether they arise from EITI, EU reporting rules in Chapter 10 of the Accounting Directive or the Transparency Directive.&#xa0;

[[[Role of regulation ]]]&#xa0;9.1              London is one of the world’s leading financial centres and attracts a wide range of companies to list on its markets.  One reason for this is our legal and regulatory framework.  While many companies list in their geographic home, other companies will have a choice of location and as a result the UK is in competition with other markets, in particular the US.  Any decision to change the regulatory system would need to be taken in this context and maintain the competitiveness of the UK market for issuers whilst providing an appropriate degree of protection for investors. &#xa0;9.2              Notwithstanding the need to maintain a competitive environment, the UK is regarded as a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance.  A high value is placed on the trust and transparency of the UK’s corporate governance framework.  To enhance this further, BIS recently published a discussion paper on Transparency &amp; Trust.  It introduces proposals to improve the transparency of corporate ownership structures in the UK and to increase trust in companies and those who run them by ensuring that we have adequate and robust sanctions in place when the rules are broken.&#xa0;9.3              The Financial Conduct Authority, as the independent regulator for the UK’s listing regime, consulted last October on proposals to enhance the effectiveness of the Listing Regime overall and in particular to provide greater protection to investors in situations where there is a controlling shareholder.&#xa0; The FCA is&#xa0;intending to provide feedback on this consultation in early October.

[[[ompetitive landscape ]]]&#xa0;10.1              The UK’s expertise in oil and gas gives us a huge national advantage.  Government and industry are working together to keep the UK at the heart of the global race in the worldwide energy industry, creating jobs and growth.&#xa0;10.2              The Oil &amp; Gas Industrial Strategy was developed in partnership with industry.  It sets out a clear path to exploit the UK’s remaining resources and overcome an increasingly challenging production environment.  &#xa0;10.3              Since publication, the Oil &amp; Gas Industry Council, supported by a BIS-led secretariat, has begun taking forward the actions listed in the strategy. Several have already been completed, and a number of key milestones are due to be finalised by the end of this year. One of the key deliverables – a research project mapping the UK supply chain, including exports, by value and destination, to determine areas of constraint and potential opportunities for additional support – is now underway.&#xa0;10.4              In addition, DECC commissioned an Oil and Gas Review in June 2013.  This is being led by Sir Ian Wood, who is looking in depth at the key issues which need to be addressed to ensure the longevity of the industry and our resources.  &#xa0;10.5              With this increasing focus on environmental and governance considerations, the UK's comparative advantage in the professional services sector will increasingly be called upon to support these mining developments.  Coupled with the need to raise large capital investment for many mining developments ($20bn not being unusual) the City of London will continue to be an important funding source.  &#xa0;10.6              The Competition Commission currently has an inquiry into the Aggregates, Cement and Ready Mix Concrete industries. The outcome of the investigation will not be known until the end of 2013.
