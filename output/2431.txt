[[[Written evidence from John Dodson. Chair, Shropshire Seniors (TIC 111)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Introduction.]]]Shropshire is the largest land locked county with one of the greatest levels of rurality in England. The county has an ageing population that will reach 70,000 by 2015 and 84,700 by 2025. This out of a total population of 296,900 in 2015 and 305,000 in 2025 which represents one of the largest percentages of elderly people in any English rural county. (these figures are Shropshire Council predictions).Based on these basic factors alone Shropshire County should have a public rural transport system that addresses these factors, but this is not the case.

[[[Cause.]]]

[[[Fact 1. ]]]Arriva is contracted to provide trunk route bus services only on a hub and spoke system radiating from Shrewsbury to the small number of key market town as well as providing urban services in Shrewsbury.

[[[Fact 2.]]] Shropshire council operates a service called 'Shropshire Link which is designed to provide geographical users with a link between home, trunk route bus stops and local market towns. Nine buses cover the county in geographical areas – 2 days per area through an advanced booking system. This service will be terminated in November 2013, the reasons given are not enough clients and therefore unacceptable high cost.

[[[Fact 3. ]]]Some of the market Towns operate private bus providers for in town bus services but these do not cover surrounding rural areas.

[[[Fact 4.]]] When the Shropshire Link service is withdrawn the only alternative sources of rural transport will be Dial a Ride that operates in select areas with no timetable scheduling link, privately run community buses, community cars and taxis.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Effect.]]]Impact of this totally inadequate rural bus service situation will be.

[[[Fact 5.]]]

[[[ ]]]Isolation that leads to depression and medical intervention. It is estimated that 80% of the elderly population have un-diagnosed depression.

[[[Fact 6.]]] Serious restriction on the ability to attend doctor, hospital or other important appointments.

[[[Fact 7.]]]

[[[ ]]]For those with or without Personal Budgets getting to educational, therapeutic and social engagements of their choice is is difficult. This works against the important Preventative Care agenda.

[[[Fact 8. ]]]No planned timetable scheduling that eases journeys on bus services that are available often means potential elderly users decide against the journeys referred to in 

[[[Facts 6 and 7 ]]]above.

[[[Fact 8.]]]

[[[ ]]]Economic constraints on the elderly is leading many to contemplate foregoing their own transport . However the very poor or none existent rural transport system is forcing these elderly people to re think which is resulting in greater financial concerns and resultant worry.&#xa0;

[[[Comment]]]Social responsibility for providing long term reliable rural public transport that ensures social mobility is recognised in many European countries. However in the rural counties of England this is not the case despite political statements that purportedly seeks to redress this situation.Access to broadband is not the panacea, a large percentage of the elderly will never use the system and computers do not have wheels to get these isolated people out to socialise in the community.The Environment Secretary is reported to have said that his department would lead efforts throughout the government to make policies 'rural proof'. He is further reported as saying that in his North Shropshire constituency, not having a car or ability to drive puts isolated people at a disproportionate disadvantage. The writer of this evidence document lives in his constituency on a substantial “B” class road but never sees a bus from one month to another!&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
