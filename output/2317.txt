[[[Written evidence submitted by Phil Alexander [OLS0021]]]]&#xa0;Children nowadays have the ability to access large quantities of very useful information effectively replacing the large and space-taking encyclopaedias of days passing.&#xa0;What ruins the good that we appreciate is the low down, corrupting content that even adults are safer without.&#xa0;As a parent of four children I would welcome a large padlock on all content that was unsuitable to children, the key to which would also be locked away.&#xa0;Please could the Government urgently developing a secure firewall and legislate a mandatory download that blocked such content and the owners of computers that feel they must defile themselves, would have to apply to a Government watchdog?&#xa0;Why do less than half of our parents have blocks on home computers? If the parents arenâ€™t bothered, pity help the children.&#xa0;I appeal to the pity there is in the House, to have the heart to get this cracked.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
