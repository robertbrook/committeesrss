[[[&#xa0;]]]Inclusion London welcomes the opportunity to provide written evidence to the joint Select Committee on the Draft Deregulation Bill, which is available at:  http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm86/8642/8642.pdf&#xa0;Information about the call to evidence is available at: http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/draft-deregulation-bill/news/have-your-say-on-the-draft-deregulation-bill/&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Inclusion London ]]]Inclusion London is a London-wide organisation which promotes equality for London’s Deaf and disabled people and provides capacity-building support for Deaf and disabled people’s organisations in London.&#xa0;

[[[Disabled People]]]&#xa0;

[[[Support for EDF and NAT submissions]]]Inclusion London supports the submission made by the Equality and Diversity Forum (EDF) and the National Aids Trust (NAT) submission, both of which raise concerns with Clause 2 – Employment Tribunal’s power to make recommendations and Clause 58 - new duty for regulators to have regard to promoting economic growth when they reach decisions.  NAT also raises concerns regarding, Clause 35 – ‘Removal of the duty on the senior President of tribunals to report on the standards of decision making by the DWP, which Inclusion London also supports. &#xa0;

[[[2. Inclusion London evidence]]]&#xa0;Inclusion London is providing a very brief submission to raise an additional issue to EDF’s and NAT’s submission, regarding Schedule 8 Part 6 of the Draft Deregulation Bill, because we are concerned that it will further curtail disabled people’s access to rail travel.  &#xa0; &#xa0;

[[[Summary of Inclusion London’s evidence]]]Inclusion London recommends that Schedule 8 Part 6, of the draft Deregulation Bill is removed altogether, because we believe that it will make it easier for rail operators to apply for exemptions to meeting accessibility requirements for disabled passengers. This will further inhibit disabled people’s access to rail travel, which will stop disabled people from taking up employment and volunteering opportunities and other opportunities in life, as well as preventing participation in cultural and social activities.    

[[[Accessible transport    ]]]An accessible transport system is vital to enable disabled people to take up employment or volunteering opportunities and to participate in cultural and social activities. Yet, disabled people continue to face huge challenges with rail transport, as illustrated by Tanni Grey Thompson, who had to throw her wheelchair off the train and then crawl off because no one was on the platform to offer assistance. Even the new line Cross rail, which is currently being built in London at the cost £14.8 of public money, will have 7 stations without step free access.  &#xa0;

[[[Schedule 8, Part 6]]]Inclusion London is very concerned that Schedule 8 Part 6, of the draft Deregulation Bill will make it easier for rail operators to apply for exemptions to meeting accessibility requirements for disabled passengers. Inclusion London therefore recommends that Schedule 8, Part 6 is removed all together. &#xa0;Any changes in the regulations that weaken the responsibilities of rail operators to provide accessible rail travel is a move in the wrong direction. Inclusion London does not believe there is sufficient evidence to warrant this change, especially as it risks limiting disabled people’s access to rail travel even further.   &#xa0;The proposals in Draft Deregulation Bill intend to reduce the burden of regulation on business, however, these changes should not be at the expense of disabled people’s access to rail travel.  &#xa0;That concludes Inclusion London’s response.
