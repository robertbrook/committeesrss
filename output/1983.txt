[[[ current safety measures at level crossings adequat]]]

[[[e? How should they be improved?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.  The UK has one of the best level crossing safety records in Europe.  Excluding suicides and suspected suicides, there were nine fatalities during 2012/13 (four pedestrians and five road vehicle occupants).  Although this is a slight rise from 2011/12, which saw the lowest number of fatalities (5) and harm in the last 10 years, it is still well below the 10-year average and perpetuates an overall trend towards improvement in safety performance.         &#xa0;2.  Rail industry operational errors or other process issues only account for a small percentage of level crossing incidents.  Unfortunately, misuse remains a serious issue.  The vast majority of incidents at level crossings arise from the behaviour of road users and pedestrians, either accidental or deliberate, and it is these groups which carry the highest risks as a result of their actions.  As well as the potential risks to themselves, misuse by road users and pedestrians also transfers risks to train passengers as well as substantial costs from damage and delays to the rail industry.  The best way to reduce risk at level crossings is to ensure they are used safely and that any instructions displayed are followed.  Network Rail has an on-going programme of public campaigns (see below) aimed at raising awareness of the risks of level crossing misuse. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.  The Rail Accident Investigation Branch has investigated 41 level crossing accidents and incidents, including publication of a specific report on the use of automated open level crossings, to ascertain if safety improvements are necessary.  The majority of recommendations have resulted in implementation by industry and progress is monitored by the Office of Rail Regulation.  While it is unfortunate that such investigations are sometimes necessary they are nevertheless a positive illustration of the industry safety framework and “lessons learned” systems in action.  The Rail Accident Investigation Branch will be submitting its own more detailed submission to the Committee.  &#xa0;4.  The Department notes that it now receives significantly more representations on convenience issues, particularly those for road users and communities in which busy crossings are situated, than on safety matters.

[[[rpasses what other cost-effective measures can be introduced to replace or improve safety at level crossings?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.  For a variety of reasons there may be limited options for replacing or improving safety at level crossings, but if it proves impossible to close a level crossing, examples of other cost-effective measures to drive safety improvements might include:&#xa0;&#xa0;6.  The Department notes that Network Rail is already either rolling out such measures across the network, or in the case of some physical works, is trialling their installation at a number of locations.  Network Rail, in consultation with the local highway authority, are best placed to identify the costs, benefits and appropriate business cases of taking action for their respective networks at any given location.   &#xa0;

[[[How]]]

[[[ should expenditure on improving safety at level crossings be prioritised in relation to other demands on the rail ]]]

[[[budget?]]]&#xa0;7.  The Department considers that the most effective way to improve safety at level crossings is to ensure that ring-fenced funding is made available to Network Rail for this purpose and to direct resources at those level crossings with the highest risk factors.  &#xa0;8.  In our July 2012 rail investment strategy, which set the strategic objectives for rail for 2014 - 19), the Secretary of State included explicit notice of his wish for the industry to “…reduce the risk of accidents at level crossings…” and “…to make ring-fenced funding for this purpose”.     &#xa0;9.  The Office of Rail Regulation, in its Draft Determination, has made provision for a £67 million fund to enable Network Rail to deliver a plan to maximise the reduction in risks of accidents at level crossings over and above meeting its existing legal obligations in this respect.  The Office of Rail Regulation will publish its final Determination on 31 October 2013.  &#xa0;10.  The Department understands that a level crossing fund comprising an additional £10 million will also be made available by Scottish Ministers to support Network Rail, local authorities and other local stakeholders in facilitating the closure of level crossings in Scotland.&#xa0;11.  With funding from the Department, and as part of the RSSB (formerly the Rail Safety &amp; Standards Board) rail industry research programme, Network Rail has also participated in a project to extend existing industry risk management models to level crossings.  The resulting All Level Crossings Risk Model (“ALCRM”) has further improved Network Rail’s ability to manage the risk to level crossing users, passengers and rail staff by targeting those crossings with the highest risk for remedial measures.  The ALCRM, in conjunction with further risk recognition and assessment work, will be an important element in identifying those level crossings where funding will provide the most substantial safety improvements over 2014-19. &#xa0;

[[[Is]]]

[[[ Network Rail giving sufficient priority to improving safety at level crossings?]]]&#xa0;12.  Network Rail has a policy to avoid new level crossings being built due to the associated safety and convenience issues and to close existing level crossings so far as is reasonably practicable.  &#xa0;13.  However, it would not be proportionate, or practical, to remove all existing crossings and Network Rail has put in place a significant programme of 19 projects designed to enhance level crossing risk management and reduce level crossing risk.  Network Rail has also set itself challenging targets for reducing level crossing risk by 25% by the end of March 2014 and a further 50% by March 2019. &#xa0;14.  The Department believes that these targets and initiatives, together with the ring-fenced funding Network Rail is likely to receive for 2014-19, mean that it will be able to give sufficient priority to improving safety at level crossings.

[[[Is]]]

[[[ Government policy and regulatory action by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety at level crossings adequate? What more should the Government and ORR do?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]15.  The Department will consider any recommendations the Committee makes in this area in due course.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[6  ]]]

[[[How]]]

[[[ should the legislation governing level crossings be updated?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]16.  The Department recognises that the current law on level crossings is antiquated, complex and inaccessible.&#xa0; For this reason the Department, in collaboration with the Office of Rail Regulation, put forward a proposal to the Law Commission for&#xa0;a comprehensive review of level crossing legislation.&#xa0; In June 2008, the Law Commission announced that this review would take place as part of its 10th programme of law reform.&#xa0; Following public consultation, the Law Commission expects to publish its recommendations later in 2013.&#xa0;17.  The Department, together with the Office of Rail Regulation, will need to consider the Law Commission’s proposals in detail before responding.&#xa0;

[[[How]]]

[[[ should public awareness of safety at level crossings be improved?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]18.  In addition to making physical and other changes to level crossings in order to make them safer, Network Rail is already doing a great deal to improve public awareness of safety at level crossings.  &#xa0;19.  Examples of this work include:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;20.  The Department believes that Network Rail’s strategy provides comprehensive coverage but would welcome the Committee’s recommendations on how public awareness could be further improved.  &#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Investigation Into The Safety Of Automatic Open Level Crossings On Network Rail’s Managed Infrastructure, Rail Accident Investigation Branch, Report 12/2011, July 2011.  Available from www.raib.gov.uk/cms_resources.cfm?file=/110728_R122011_AOCLs_Class_Inv.pdf.
