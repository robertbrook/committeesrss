"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary [CST0015]&#xa0;\nHer Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the \nPublic Administration\n Select Committee inquiry \ninto \ncrime statistics.\n&#xa0;\nHMIC is an independent body which inspects \nand reports on \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of policing in England and Wales on behalf of the public. We conduct inspections on a range of issues \n–\n both on our\n own, and \njointly \nwith other inspectorates in the criminal justice system. \n&#xa0;\nOur written submission of evidence \nrespond\ns\n to the committee\n’\ns questions by \nprovid\ning\n background o\nn\n the work already undertaken by HMIC in respect of\n police crime recording standards\n;\n and o\nn\n our current and future work in this regard.\n&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\nA\nn inspection of the \nintegrity of police recorded crime is an important part of HMIC’s current inspection programme. The inspection will answer\n the question\n \n’\nto what extent can police recorded crime information be trusted\n’\n and \nwe \nwill publish a full report \nin autumn 2014. \n&#xa0;\n1.1 \nHMIC \nconsiders\n \nit of the utmost\n importan\nce\n \nthat\n \npolice forces have \nhigh\n-\nquality data t\nhat allows them to \nestablish where, when\n,\n and how often crime and anti-social behaviour (ASB) is happening\n.\n \nThis ensures:\n&#xa0;\nHMIC\n has therefore undertaken a programme of work over a number of years to test \naspects of whether crimes are being recorded by the police when they should be, and categorised correctly. \nSome of this work \nassessed\n accuracy in recording particular crimes, and some \nwas concerned with\n particular aspects of the crime and incident reportin\ng process\n. T\nhe number of forces inspected ranged from all 43 Home Office forces, to just one. \n&#xa0;Crime Counts (2009) and The Crime Scene (2012)1.2 HMIC’s first report \non\n crime data integrity\n,\n \nCrime Counts – \nA\n \nreview of data quality for offences of the most\n serious violence\n,\n was published in October 2009\n.\n \nT\nhis \nwas followed by \nThe Crime Scene \n–\n \nA review of police crime and incident reports\n, which was published in January 2012\n.\n \nWhile the first of these focused solely on the data recorded in relation to serious violence, \nand\n the latter was much wider in scope, b\noth\n \nexamined\n how effective forces \nw\nere in ensuring incident records which contained details of a recordable crime resulte\nd in the \ncorrect \ncreation of crime record\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n3\n \nThe Crime Scene\n considered the quality of crime and incident data, and the arrangements in place to ensure \nit\n \nwas\n recorded \nand managed appropriately (i.e. in a way that complies\n with national guidelines)\n. T\nh\ne inspection \nfocus\ned\n on \nthe \nstandards of incident \nreport \nclosure\n,\n and whether crimes were \ncorrectly \nrecorded or not.  \n&#xa0;\n1.\n4\n \nBased on examination of a small sample of crime and incident records in each of the 43 Home Office-funded forces, \nHMIC\n \nfound\n \nthat the majority of forces \nwere correctly\n recording crimes based on the information available within an incident record\n. However,\n \nthis conclusion mask\ned\n \na \nwide variation \nin \nthe \naccuracy \nof force decisions in this regard\n: \n18 forces correctly recorded crime\ns in 95% or more of cases; 15 forces did so in between 90 and 94% \nof \ncases; and 11 forces in between 86 and 89% of cases.\n \nThis\n \ncould mean \nforces that made poorer decisions \nwere unde\nr-recording some crimes, which c\nould have \na corresponding impact \non the ac\ncuracy of published crime statistics\n (although \nit should be noted that \nthe size of the sample used in this inspection was too small to make any definite statements on this – it was used instead as an indicator of where there might be issues)\n.  \n&#xa0;\n1.\n5\n \nThe su\npervision and justification for making a decision to \ndeclassify a recorded crime \nafter it has been recorded as such \n(referred to as ‘\nno\n-\ncrim\ning\n’\n)\n was found to be subject to a marked \noverall improvement since this area was \nlast \nexamined\n. Perhaps as a result, \nthe national average of correct decisions for violent offences was 84% – \nan\n improve\nment\n from 2009, when the average was 64% for the most serious violent offences.\n&#xa0;Crime Recording in Kent (2013)1.\n6\n In\n February 2013, the Pol\nice and \nCrime Commissioner for Kent co\nmmissioned HMIC to conduct an inspection to determine whether the people of Kent can have confidence in the force’s crime figures. \nThis inspection resulted in the publication of the HMIC report \nCrime recording in Kent – A repo\nrt commissioned by the Police and Crime Commissioner for Kent\n \n in June 201\n3\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n7\n This inspection found that appreciably more need\ned\n to be done before the people of Kent c\nould\n be confident that the crime and resolution figures published by the force \nwe\nre \nas accurate as they should be. HMIC found that the force had under-recorded approximately one in every ten crimes\n,\n and that \nit\n d\nid\n not interpret the Home Office Counting Rules (HOCR) correctly, \nmeaning\n crimes \nwe\nre not correctly recorded\n. \nI\nt is important to\n note that the findings for Kent cannot be extrapolated to make judgments regarding the accuracy of crime recording in other forces\n, as the methodology was specific to th\ne force area\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.\n8\n While Kent Police had made improvements to the way it dealt with t\nhe declassification of recorded crimes (\nno\n-\ncriming)\n,\n and had reduced the total number of occasions \nwhere\n \nthis occurred, we found that the decision to do so was \nstill \nincorrect in more than 25% of the cases reviewed. \nIt \nwas of particular concern \n– \nand unacc\neptable \n–\n that this inaccuracy was evident in cases of rape, robber\ny and violence\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n9\n HMIC is due to \npublish \na report in\n \nJanuary 2014 \non\n the progress that has been made by Kent Police since \npublication of the 2013 report\n.\n&#xa0;\nHMIC’s 2013/14 crime data integrity programme1.1\n0\n \nCrime Counts \nand \nThe Crime Scene \nboth \nexamined\n only crime and incident records created as the result of a call made by a member of the public into force call centres. However, \ncrimes are \nalso \nreported to police forces through a number of \nother \nroute\ns\n (\nsuch as through calls to control rooms, referrals to specialist investigation departments from other public bodies\n,\n or directly to officers\n)\n. Therefore our crime data integrity programme for 2013/\n14 will review the integrity of \nthe data recorded via each of these other routes, to give a more complete overview of crime recording\n. The outcome of this work \n(which is explained in more detail in paras 4.3-4.6 below) \nis expected to be published during au\ntumn 2014\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1 None of HMIC\n’s\n re\nviews of crime data integrity \nhas\n \nspecifically \nexamined\n the influences which may lead to the mis-recording of crime\n by the police\n. The\n reviews \nhave\n,\n however\n,\n considered those influences \nwhich may positively contribute to the integrity of \ncrime recording. \nThe Crime Scene (2012)2.\n2\n \nThe 2012 HMIC report\n,\n \nThe Crime Scene\n – \nA review of police crime and incident reports\n,\n \nfound\n \nthat forces which \ndemonstrate\nd\n good standards of data quality all \nhad\n \na clearly identified \nchief officer\n lead who act\ned \nas the force champion for such issues\n,\n and \nwho \nactively promote\nd\n good crime and incident re\ncording standards. \nHMIC found that t\nhe message \nsuch chief offic\ners\n \nsen\nt\n to their force\ns\n about the importance of maintaining high standards \nin this regard \nneed\ned\n to be consistent, unequivocal\n,\n and \npracti\ns\ned\n. It \nalso needed to be\n clearly understood by staff.\n \n2.3 \nOther\n aspects \nwhich HMIC reported as being the most \ninfluential in maintaining standards in recording crime were: good governance and supervision; and knowledgeable staff – in particular, an objective force crime registrar with strong influence over local crime recording decisions, to ensure these were not \nunduly influenced by the pressure to achieve certain outcomes.\n We concluded that: “The final responsibility for HOCR compliance should not, therefore, be vested in the same individuals as are accountable for crime reduction and detection” (para 5.6).\nForging the Links – Rape investigation and prosecution (2012)2.4 In this report (which was conducted jointly with HM Inspectorate of the Crown Prosecution Service), HMIC found that there were wide variations across forces in the number of rapes that remained on the system (and so were investigated) compared to those\n that were ‘no crimed’ (i.e. removed from the crime recording system because the police decide that a crime has not been committed). We \nstated\n that \n“\ni\nn the past performance pressures may have influenced forces\n’\n approaches to either the initial recording or\n subsequent levels \nof ‘no crimes’ for rape offending” (para 1.29), and advocated instead a regime that places equal emphasis on\n \nan analysis of rape crimes and associated intelligence\n as on low offending levels\n, \nwhich would act\n as an encouragement to retain\n crime records on the system.\n \nHMIC’s 2013/14 crime data integrity programme2.5 Our programme for 2013/14 will \nconsider\n more widely the influences that may result in the mis-recording of crime.\n&#xa0;\n3.1 \nHMIC \nconsiders\n \nthe \nrole of the \nf\norce \nc\nrime \nr\negistrar \n(FCR) \nto be\n \ncentral to ensuring \nforce systems for recording crime \nare \neffective and accurate\n. \nThis role is a requirement detailed in the \nNational Crime Recording Standard (NCRS)\n,\n which states\n (in section 4.2)\n:\nTo ensure the NCRS is maintained within the force, and to provide greater consistency within and across forces, each force should appoint an FCR to act as final arbiter for the audit process; the interpretation of the counting rules; and for ensuring the o\nutcome from investigations into those crimes is correctly recorded. The FCR must be outside operational line command and answerable to the chief officer with overall responsibility for the accuracy and integrity of crime recording processes. To ensure that\n the responsibilities of the post are effectively met, a deputy or other identified person should be appointed. \n&#xa0;\nThe \nkey\n tasks of an FCR are: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere is full recognition\n \nthat the FCR role and responsibilities continue to evolve over time.\n&#xa0;\nThe Crime Scene (2012)3.\n2\n Our 2012 \nreview found forces that finalised incidents well ha\nd\n a strong FCR, who act\ned\n as the final arbiter for disputes \nin respect of \nthe interpretation of the counting rules and enjoy\ned\n clear, unequivocal chief officer support. Indeed, evidence from the review indicated that 34 of the 44 forces reviewed claimed to\n have sufficiently strong, independent FCRs, with clear chief officer support.\n \nHowever, \nHMIC \nfound limited evidence of forces directly assessing whether their own crime quality audits provided confidence that their crime figures gave an accurate account o\nf their \nperformance\n,\n and\n f\new forces compare crime audits with crime performance in any meaningful way\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n3\n \nI\nn 2012\n,\n \nHMIC also reported \nthat \nevidence strongly supports the notion that leadership, supervision and oversight help attain good crime and incident data quality. Strong and effective leadership is therefore a critical component in raising standards. \nEqually, where there is the slightest\n doubt as to the chief officer’s expectation \nin relation to\n crime and incident data quality, standards will inevitably slip.\n&#xa0;4.1 HMIC recognises that there is still mor\ne to be done to secure the integrity of \npolice\n-\nrecorded crime data\n.\n \nT\nhe work of the Crime Statistics Advisory Committee (CSAC)\n,\n as an independent advisor on matters related to the measurement of crime\n,\n and the collection and presentation of crime data\n,\n is welcomed.\n The rest of this answer focuses on what HMIC has done (and is doing) to ensure the integrity of this data. \n4.2 \nCrime data and crime recording are \ncomplex areas of policing,\n and there continues to be a need for greater clarity and understandi\nng. Therefore, \nHMIC has \ninspected police crime data integrity for a number of years\n. \nThis has included inspections dedicated\n specifically\n \nto crime data\n,\n as well as integrating consideration of crime data accuracy within other formal inspection activity\n, su\nch as HMIC inspections of the approach taken by police forces to deal\ning\n with anti-social behaviour\n.\n \nHMIC’s 2013/14 crime data integrity programme4.3 \nHMIC \nhas\n \ncommitted to inspect\ning\n crime data integrity \nagain \nduring 2013/14. Her Majesty’s Chief \nInspector of Constabulary confirmed this commitment to the Home Affairs Select Committee\n in May 2013\n,\n and agreed to report on the issue in \nautumn\n 2014. \n4.\n4\n This inspection will include \nour\n assessment of the accuracy of crime recording through the various routes that crimes can be reported to the police\n \n(\nsuch as through calls to control rooms, referrals to specialist \ninvestigation\n departments from other public bodies or directly to officers\n)\n. Our initial findings will be \nprovid\ned \nin an interim report \n(as\n requested by the Home Secretary\n)\n,\n which will be published in spring 2014\n.\n4.\n5\n \nTh\ne \nprincipal\n test for the inspection is \nto de\ntermine\n: \nT\no what extent can police recorded crime information be \ntrusted?\n \n4.\n6\n The specific objectives of the inspection involve establishing:\nMonitoring of force performance4.\n7\n In addition to the formal crime data integrity programme\n,\n \nHer Majesty’s Inspectors of Constabulary (HMIs) routinely monitor the performance of police forces\n, including \nas regards\n \nthe integrity of data\n.\n This \nhelps to \nensure that:\n•    \nemerging problems \nwith the efficiency or effectiveness of individual forces are spotted quickly, and Chief Constables and local policing bodies\n \nare aware of those problems and are taking corrective action; and\n•    \nif problems with the efficiency or effectiveness of a forc\ne are enduring and there is a low prospect of \ntheir\n \nbeing resolved, those problems are raised formally with the local policing body, so that they can respond.\n4.\n8\n Routine monitoring identifies \npotential\n \nissues for closer scrutiny. Some of these will be out\nside the control of the force and local policing body, or will already have been tackled; but some may be indicators of systemic or management failings in the force. The decision \nas to\n \nwhether to follow up with the force and local policing body over any co\nncerns rests with the HMI who leads on HMIC’s relationship with that force area. \n&#xa0;\n5.1 \nAll \nHMIC’s work \non crime data integrity\n is undertaken so that the level of confidence\n policy-makers, the police and the public should have\n in police crime data can be understood. \n5.2 \nOur work in Kent, described earlier, \nsets out \nthe extent to which confidence can be placed in \nthe force’s\n \ncrime\n data. The approach\n used to determine this\n \nwill \nalso \nbe used\n in our 2013/14 \ninspection, which is due to be published\n in \nautumn\n 2014.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1 This is not a\nn issue on which \nHMIC \nhas published or indeed \nhold\ns\n a view\n. Our focus is instead on the effectiveness and efficiency of the systems and processes forces use to record crimes and ASB.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nPolice and crime commissioners for police areas outside London; the Mayor’s Office for Policing and \nCrime for the Metropolitan Police Service; and the City of London Corporation for the City of London Police.\n \nCrime Counts: A review of data quality for offences of the most serious violence\n, HMIC, London, 2009.

No-crimes account for approximately 3-4% of overall recorded crime. No-criming is an important part of the \nHOCR as it caters for situations where the original decision to record a crime clearly turns out to be wrong (for example, where someone reports to the police that their car has been stolen from a multi-storey car park, only to find it later on a different\n floor). While it is appropriate for some cases to be no-crimed, when this is done incorrectly it can mean that suspects may not be brought to justice and the force’s published crime figures will be inaccurate.\n \nCrime Counts: A review of data quality for offences of the most serious violence, \nHMIC, London, 2009.
