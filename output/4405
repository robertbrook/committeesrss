[normal]Overview[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]WaterAid transform
[normal]s
[normal] lives by improving access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in the world’s poorest communities. We work with 
[normal]local 
[normal]partners in 27 countries 
[normal]across 
[normal]Africa, Asia, Central America and the Pacific region, and influence decision-makers to maximise our impact. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]WaterAid believes that those responsible for 
[normal]ensuring the delivery of 
[normal]WASH 
[normal]services 
[normal]have a key role in
[normal] remov
[normal]ing
[normal] societal barriers
[normal] (access in the built environment, negative attitudes and a lack of consultation and involvement).  
[normal]No
[normal] 
[normal]one
[normal] should be discriminated against 
[normal]due to 
[normal]an 
[normal]i
[normal]mpairment.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Globally, 2.5 billion people lack access to adequate sanitation, and over
[normal] 76
[normal]8
[normal] million lack access to safe water
[normal]. Th
[normal]is 
[normal]crisis 
[normal]particularly affects 
[normal]disabled people
[normal] living in poverty
[normal]. 
[normal]Disparities
[normal] are even larger when
[normal] disability
[normal] combines with more than one form of exclusion, such as gender, remoteness, ethnicity, chronic illness and ageing
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Disabled people in poor communities often lack WASH services because 1) facilities are not inclusive, 2) there is a serious lack of accessi
[normal]ble information available on low-cost, low-tech adaptations for WASH facilities, 3)
[normal] negative attitudes lead
[normal] to exclusion
[normal], and 4) 
[normal]they 
[normal]are rarely meaningfully consulted or involved in 
[normal]decisions about 
[normal]WASH 
[normal]policy and 
[normal]programmes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]More research is needed to better 
[normal]demonstrate
[normal] 
[normal]how a lack of WASH affects disabled people 
[normal]living in poverty 
[normal]and their families, as well as the benefits of inclusive WASH approaches at scale. To help fill this knowledge gap, 
[normal]WaterAid, 
[normal]the Water Engineering D
[normal]evelopment Centre (WEDC) 
[normal]and 
[normal]Leonard Cheshire Disability (LCD) 
[normal]are collaborating on the 
[normal]Undoing Inequity 
[normal]project. This is a DFID funded project through the Sanitation and Hygiene Applied Research for Equity (SHARE) consortium
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he project
[normal] 
[normal]aim
[normal]s
[normal] to understa
[normal]nd the barriers and opportunities that disabled
[normal] people
[normal], 
[normal]older persons 
[normal]and 
[normal]those 
[normal]with a chronic illness 
[normal]face 
[normal]in 
[normal]accessing WASH services in 
[normal]one ward in 
[normal]Zambia and 
[normal]two districts in 
[normal]Uganda.

[normal]WaterAid’s response to this inquiry 
[normal]will 
[normal]draw on our
[normal] knowledge of developing and delivering ‘inclusive WASH’ 
[normal]that meets the needs of everyone through
[normal]out their life.
[normal]  This 
[normal]submission
[normal] 
[normal]explains the 
[normal]barriers that disabled people face when accessing WASH services, how these can be addressed and recommendations f
[normal]or DFID.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What are the barriers that disabled people [bold]living in poverty[bold] [bold]face when accessing WASH services? [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Lack of access[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Inaccessible WASH designs 
[normal]can mean 
[normal]physically disabled people 
[normal]are forced 
[normal]to crawl on the floor to use a toilet or defecate in the open. These difficulties are compounded when disabled women and girls have no facilities to manage menstruation. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the 
[normal]Undoing Inequity
[normal] project, over 40% of vulnerable household members in Uganda and Zambia 
[normal]said they 
[normal]wait for help to ‘go to the toilet’
[normal]. In some cases
[normal],
[normal] disabled people soil themselves while waiting. This 
[normal]heightens the risks of 
[normal]loss of dignity
[normal] and 
[normal]self 
[normal]respect
[normal], increased st
[normal]igmatisation
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]intensifie
[normal]d
[normal] burden on 
[normal]carers. To reduce the need to relieve themselves, many disabled people limit their consumption of food and water. These issues have implications for their health and safety, and negatively affect their self esteem.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If water sources are too far away or inaccessibly designed, or water containers in the household are not accessible, disabled people rely on others to collect water for them. 26% of respondents 
[normal]from
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]Undoing Inequity
[normal] 
[normal]research
[normal] in Uganda said they do not have enough to drink because there is no one to help them access water
[normal]. 
[normal]Stigma and discrimination[bold]2.4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]S
[normal]tigma and discrimination
[normal] lead to exclusion from 
[normal]WASH services. For instance, 
[normal]in Uganda, the 
[normal]Undoing Inequity
[normal] project revealed 
[normal]that 
[normal]19% of
[normal] 
[normal]disabled 
[normal]people
[normal] were told by non-disabled people not to touch water because they 
[normal]were
[normal] ‘dirty’
[normal]. Many disabled people 
[normal]had been 
[normal]jeered at when attempting to use a public toilet
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lack of consultation and involvement[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.5.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]D
[normal]isabled people’s needs are largely absent from WASH 
[normal]policies
[normal] and standards.
[normal] Existing information is rarely accessible, so 
[normal]they 
[normal]may be unaware of their rights and 
[normal]feel unable 
[normal]to raise complaints.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.6.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A lack of accessible information on low cost, low tech adapt
[normal]ations for WASH facilities is a major barrier to WASH for disabled people
[normal]. Materials used and methods applied to mobilise communities are rarely accessible for people with sensory impairments, so they do not receive the same information as non-disabled 
[normal]people
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]D
[normal]isabled people are often excluded from decision-making processes that can directly affect their lives, and are rarely consulted or involved in WASH programmes. In Uganda, where adaptations to household toilets were made to make them more accessi
[normal]ble, only 50% of disabled people were consulted
[normal]. This can 
[normal]lead to inappropriate design
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]mean
[normal]ing
[normal] that disabled people remain un-served. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.8.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]World Health Organisation/Unicef Joint Monitoring Project (
[normal]JMP
[normal])
[normal] household surveys hide disparities within the hous
[normal]ehold.
[normal] 
[normal]SHARE
[normal]-
[normal]funded research in Uganda and Zambia clearly demonstrate
[normal]s
[normal] this
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]When asked if ‘everyone uses the same household toilet’
[normal] in Uganda
[normal], 88% of household heads answered positively.
[normal] 
[normal]This compared to 73% when disabled
[normal] people
[normal], older 
[normal]persons 
[normal]and 
[normal]those
[normal] 
[normal]with a chronic illness were asked.
[normal] 
[normal]In Zambia the positive response dropped from 96% to 84%. To understand the situation fully
[normal], data must be disaggregated and 
[normal]disabled people within the household 
[normal]need to 
[normal]participate in 
[normal]surveys.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3 [bold]              [bold]What are the solutions [bold]to address the barriers that [bold]poor [bold]disabled people face when accessing WASH services? [bold]Improving accessibility[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The most cost-effective way to improve accessibility for disabled people is to 
[normal]involve 
[normal]them
[normal] in the design 
[normal]process 
[normal]and 
[normal]incorporate inclusive 
[normal]technology
[normal] 
[normal]from the outset, rather than making expensive changes later. WEDC research shows that the additional cost of making a 
[normal]new 
[normal]school latrine accessible is less than 3% of the overall cost of the latrine
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]WaterAid and WEDC are 
[normal]developing low tech, 
[normal]low cost inclusive WASH adaptations and designs for the household and public places (eg schools, market places, health centres) to ensure people with disabilities are able to access them. These include safe and secure toilets with ramps, wider entrances, r
[normal]oom inside to allow a wheelchair user and a carer to enter and turn with ease, simple handrails, and movable wooden toilet seats that can be placed over pit latrines. Simple adaptations to water points include clearing the path to the water apron, putting 
[normal]in ramps, allowing room for a wheelchair user to turn easily, incorporating a water container resting stand, and fitting a t-handle bar to the handpump.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Installing rainwater harvesting jars near disabled 
[normal]people’s homes
[normal] can reduce reliance on others to col
[normal]lect water from handpumps that are far away. The rainwater can be used for washing, supplement
[normal]ing 
[normal]drinking water collected from 
[normal]protected 
[normal]wells. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Challenging stigma and discrimination[bold]3.4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Too often WaterAid hears 
[normal]‘
[normal]there are no disabled people in our community
[normal]’
[normal] or 
[normal]‘
[normal]there are no disabled children in the school
[normal]’
[normal]. This demonstrates that disabled people and children are being excluded and we challenge this.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]s
[normal]ations 
[normal](DPOs) 
[normal]and assisting disabled people to realise their rights
[normal], 
[normal]discrimination and s

[normal] can be overcome
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]ccessible information on inclusive WASH designs, including information on menstrual hygiene management, and running awareness-raising campaigns to highlight the issue of disability in relation to WASH and hu
[normal]man rights
[normal] is critical
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]WaterAid 
[normal]encourages the local par
[normal]t
[normal]ner organisations we invest in to work with disabled people’s 
[normal]organisations
[normal],
[normal] and to include disabled people in decision
[normal] 
[normal]making. We 
[normal]promote participatory community mobilisation
[normal] and 
[normal]monitoring and 
[normal]evaluation
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]enable
[normal] different groups to take part, including those with less power. In the 
[normal]Undoing Inequity 
[normal]project, more meaningful 
[normal]participation has led to increased social interactions between disabled and non-disabled people in Zambia
[normal]. This in turn h
[normal]as challenged stigma and improved disabled people’s self esteem and dignity
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Improving consultation and involvement[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensuring services can be used 
[normal]by 
[normal]all requires c
[normal]arrying out accessibility audits 
[normal]with a range of people, including disabled people, to 
[normal]evaluate the accessibility of existing WASH facilit
[normal]ies
[normal] and identify possible changes or improvements during planning and construction
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Inclusive WASH designs 
[normal]should be 
[normal]shared in accessible formats (pictures
[normal] for people who cannot hear
[normal] or read
[normal] and audio
[normal] fo
[normal]r people who cannot see
[normal]) and 
[normal]local languages
[normal], so that 
[normal]everyone has access to relevant information about WASH technology options
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.10.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Developing the
[normal] capacity of practitioners to design inclusive WASH interventions can be improved over several stages. Awareness-raising can be carried out using mechanisms such as participatory 
[normal]‘
[normal]barrier analyses
[normal]’
[normal] including disabled people and DPOs at the community, distr
[normal]ict and national levels
[normal].  This also increases people’s awareness about the requirements and rights of disabled people
[normal].  T
[normal]echnical training 
[normal]is 
[normal]then 
[normal]given to address these barriers. Results show that disability 
[normal]‘
[normal]specialists
[normal]’
[normal] do not need to be employed to ma
[normal]instream inclusive WASH in development
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.11.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Multi-sectoral collaboration between disability, education, WASH and health stakeholders can help ensure that disability is mainstreamed within development.
[normal] 
[normal]If this is not done
[normal],
[normal] we risk duplicating efforts 
[normal]and
[normal] continuing to develop WASH solutions that are not accessible for 
[normal]all
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.12.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Through the 
[normal]Undoing Inequity 
[normal]project
[normal] 
[normal]we are working with the disability sector to generate rigorous evidence about how a lack of WASH 
[normal]affects 
[normal]poor 
[normal]disabled people and their families.
[normal] 
[normal]D
[normal]POs
[normal] and disability service providers are providing specialist advice and guidance to ensure we encourage meaningful participation of disabled people in the total project cycle so that services are fully inclusive.
[normal] DPOs
[normal] are also 
[normal]helping
[normal] us 
[normal]recognise 
[normal]the political actors and 
[normal]understand the 
[normal]structures in the disability sector
[normal], so we can collectively 
[normal]lobby for the realisation of 
[normal]disabled people’s rights, including the right to water and sanitation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.13.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Through the 
[normal]Undoing Inequity 
[normal]project
[normal], 
[normal]w
[normal]e are developing
[normal] data collection tools to gather information on WASH disaggregated by impairment (using the Washington Group categories of disability).
[normal] 
[normal]Our household surveys identify family members 
[normal]with additional access requirements, 
[normal]and 
[normal]ask 
[normal]whether or not everyone in th
[normal]e household can use the public and private WASH facilities in their area.

[normal]Recommendations[bold] for DFID [bold]in order to mainstream inclusive WASH[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1[bold].[bold] 
[normal]              
[normal]Use the findings from the DFID-funded 
[normal]Undoing Inequity 
[normal]project to mainstream
[normal] inclusive WASH within DFID’s policy and practice, and encourage others to do the same. 
[normal]T
[normal]his means to:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.1.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Promote low cost, low tech accessible WASH designs
[normal], including 
[normal]menstrual hygiene management facilities
[normal].  These must be 
[normal]part of school and hospital design
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensure that investment in 
[normal]WASH 
[normal]through bilateral
[normal] or
[normal] multilateral aid or NGOs stipulates that 
[normal]inclusive practice and design is a core component
[normal] of 
[normal]the 
[normal]work
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensure 
[normal]information on inclusive WASH is communicated in an accessible way
[normal] and community mobilisation methods can be understood by everyone.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Run accessible awareness-raising campaigns 
[normal]to highlight the issues of disability and WASH, facts about menstrual hygiene management, the rights of disabled people, including the right to w
[normal]ater and sanitation, as well as mechanisms for th
[normal]o
[normal]se claiming rights
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.5.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensure meaningful participation of disabled people throughout the total programme cycle. Methods include carrying out access
[normal]ibility
[normal] audits in partnership with disability groups and end users, and conducting participatory barrier analyses at different levels.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.6.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Develop the capacity of 
[normal]governments, 
[normal]the private sector
[normal] and practitioners to 
[normal]design inclusive WASH interventions, raising aware
[normal]ness through mechanisms such as participatory barrier analyses and proving technical training. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.7.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Encourage multi-sectoral collaboration between disability, education, WASH and health stakeholders so that disability is mainstreamed within development, and e
[normal]nsure 
[normal]that funding and other resource commitments reinforce this. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.8.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensure data collection methodologies
[normal] on 
[normal]WASH access
[normal] are 
[normal]designed to assess intra-household inequalities, due to gender, age and disability, and measure the accessibility and acceptability 
[normal]of WASH facilities outside the home for disabled people, including for menstrual hygiene management.
