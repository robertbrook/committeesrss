"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from RAC Motoring Services (SRN 040)&#xa0;&#xa0;BACKGROUND&#xa0;The RAC is the UKâ€™s most progre\nssive motoring organisation, r\ne\npresenting\n more than seven million members, providing services for both private and business motorists, and is committed to making driving easier, safer, more affordable and more enjoyable \nfor all road users. \n&#xa0;\nWe employ more than 1700 patrols providing roadside ass\nistance across the entire \nUK \nroad network and through this \nwe \nhave significant insight into \nhow the road networks are managed\n and maintained\n.\n&#xa0;\nThere is little doubt that \nsignificant \nchallenges \nlie ahead \nfor those responsible both for \nstrategic \nand local ro\nads \nwith \ncongestion\n \nset to grow as a consequence of \ngrowth return\ning\n to the economy. This is compounded by the current condition of the roads which have degenerated as a consequence of several harsh winters and a lack of investment \nin \nmaintenance \nand \nalso \nthe longer term need to reduce the environmental impact of road transport.\n&#xa0;\nWe, therefore, welcome the opportunity to provide evidence to the Transport Select Committee as part of its review of the Strategic Road Network following the publication of its Ac\ntion for Roads command paper.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGeneral policies\n&#xa0;\nEnvironmental benefits\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\nIN SUMMARY&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
