"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Association of Employment and Learning Providers (AELP)IntroductionThe Association of Employment and Learning Providers (AELP) represents the interests of a range of organisations delivering vocational learning and employment and employability support.  The majority of our 650+ member organisations are independent provide\nrs (from both the private and the third sectors) holding contracts with the Skills Funding Agency, with many also delivering Department for Education (EFA) and Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) funded provision.  In addition to these we have a number o\nf colleges in membership, as well as non-delivery organisations such as SSCs and awarding bodies as Associate Members, which means that AELP offers a well rounded and comprehensive perspective and insight on matters relating to its remit. \nComments1.\n \nWe \nwelcome\n the significant increase in the proportion of independent providers \nbeing rated good or outstanding in their Ofsted inspect\nions over the past 12 months.  T\nhe number of independent providers rated good or outstanding in the last academic year rose f\nrom 60% to 67\n%.\n2. \nWe were also pleased with \nthe overall number of providers improving their grades (32% of providers inspected) in comparison with last year’s figures\n, however, there were some\n (16%) whose overall rating fell\n.  We recognise that\n any provi\nder receiving an inadequate grade is still a cause for concern\n we\n \nare\n committed to working with Ofsted, the Education and Training Foundation and providers to address this challenge.\n3. \nThe observations in the Chief Inspector’s annual report are based on f\nindings of the first year of the new Common Inspection Framework (CIF) with the revised Framework’s emphasis on the quality of teaching and learning.  Most providers will now have built the quality processes into their delivery models and we would expect t\nhe improvements to continue.  \nIndeed, recently\n there have been two\n grade 1 inspections of independent providers.  \n4. \nDelivery of teaching and learning in a work based environment is different to the traditional classroom approaches.  Work based learning b\ny definition takes place in the many different environments of the workplace, often involving very small groups or even individual trainees.  The training provider may also be operating over several sites, which requires management oversight of a consisten\nt set of standards.\n  \nIndependent providers score highly in terms of flexibility of their training and meeting employers’ needs\n, \nfactors key to the effective delivery of training and important elements in the CIF standards.  As employers take a more central\n role in the development of programmes employer responsiveness \nwill be\n an increasingly important factor in the inspection process\n.\n   \n5. \nWe note that the Ofsted Annual Report suggests “that there is still too much provision that is not responsive to local \nemployment needs” and that “training providers need to ensure that vocational provision is better matched to the needs of local businesses and communities”.  We must point out that apprenticeship provision precisely reflects the real time needs of local bu\nsinesses as all apprentices are now employed by those same businesses\n and \napprenticeships are attracting hugely impressive satisfaction rates from both employers (92%\n) and apprentices (89%\n) alike.\n  \n6. \nAELP does\n, however,\n believe that LEPs have a role to play in developing local skills and employability strategies\n.  Their knowledge of their locality should be used to identify needs and opportunities, in conjunction with providers, to inform the development of appropriate \nlocal skills and employability provision across the country.  We are committed to working with the LEPs and local employers to ensure that they play a full part in the delivery of those local skills strategies and we would recommend full engagement and inv\nolvement of providers on LEP Boards and Committees.\n7.\n \nThe report goes on to state that apprenticeships are failing to meet their full potential because young people \nare not sufficiently employable, lacking basic skills, aptitudes in vocational and employa\nbility skills and appropriate attitudes for work.  This is not the fault of apprenticeships or their provi\nders, but the result of failure\n \nof\n the school system to prepare \nall \nyoung people adequately for the world of work. \n \nHopefully the introduction of stud\ny programmes, and Traineeships in particular, will help address these issues and enable more young people to progress into employment and ideally apprenticeships.  It will be important however that Ofsted recognises that progression into an apprenticeship \nis not the only successful outcome for Traineeships, and that any employment, or progression to further training or HE, must also be seen as successful outcomes for the new programme.\n8. \nIt is also true that success rates play a significant part in determi\nning the grade of the provider.  Delivering to some hard-to-help groups in difficult working environments can mean it is very challenging to deliver high success rates and this partly explains why classroom based learning has traditionally had higher succe\nss rates.  \n&#xa0;\n9. \nWe agree with the comments on the need for good careers guidance\n.  \nAll young people should have impartial and independent careers advice about all their options, including the costs of various routes open to them, the funding available, the\n range of occupations that can be accessed as well as the labour market demand and likely wage returns for these occupations.\n  \nUnder the current arrangements access to independent careers advice is inadequate and many providers believe that the signposting to vocational training \nneeds to be addressed as a matter of urgency\n, a view seemingly shared by Chief Inspector, Sir Michael W\nilshaw, following Ofsted’s review of careers guidance in schools\n \nin 2013.\n  We also agree the finding that there is no easy system for transferring information on young people directly from schools to other providers.  Both issues – good careers guidance a\nnd the need for a simple system to transfer information – need to be addressed as a priority.\n10.\n \nWe note that English and maths provision remains a significant concern.  The report does, however recognise that many FE and skills providers are working with\n learners who failed to achieve level 2 in these vital skills at school.  It also recognises that young people achieved better results in functional English and maths than those taking GCSEs as a repeat.  This supports our long held position, that function\nal skills must not be replaced by GCSEs in those subjects until the qualifications have been reformed \nto ensure the content, assessment strategy and flexibility of the examination structure is appropriate for the workplace.\n&#xa0;ConclusionThe achievement of h\nigh standards of delivery which are reflected in Ofsted grades has never been more important.  With the requirement for providers to have grades 1 or 2 to deliver traineeships, the need to achieve good grades has become more important and AELP and its memb\ners recognise this.  \n&#xa0;\nWe are confident that independent training providers can respond to this challenge and deliver excellent results.   We will work with Ofsted to ensure that the inspection framework recognises excellent delivery and creates the platfo\nrm for provider improvement.  This will enable us to work in partnership with providers to generate better grades across the sector\n.\n&#xa0;\nAELP would welcome the opportunity to discuss these comments in more detail with members of the Committee as it prepares \nfor the evidence
