"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nAviva (CYS0134)\n&#xa0;\nAbout Aviva&#xa0;Aviva provides peace of mind for more than 34 million people across the world, protecting their families and possessions by providing insurance, savings and investment products.  \n&#xa0;\nAviva insure\ns\n \nabout 4\n00,000 \nvehicles under Commercial \nMotor Fleet \ncontracts\n. We are committed to \nprotecting\n our customers in order to build a stronger, sustainable business, which makes a positive contribution to society, and for which our people are proud to work.\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;\nAviva \nis supportive of \ninitiatives that preserve \nli\nfe or\n prevent injur\ny\n. Aviva \nis \nalso \ncommitted to recognising good \nstandards of \nrisk management and assist\n our\n \np\nolicyholders to achieve these goals by \nemploying a \nnationwide \nteam of \nFleet \nRisk Consultants\n. These individuals help customers to identify \nkey \nhazards\n, \nthen provid\ne\n information, guidance and practical solutions to eliminate or minimise\n the associated risks.\n  \n&#xa0;\nAviva is also currently working with the road safety charity BRAKE, to produce a specific VRU focused information leaflet designed to rais\ne awareness and promote risk management best practice.\n \n&#xa0;\nOver recent years, Aviva has witnessed a significant rise in the frequency of claims involving cyclists under our Commercial \nMotor \nFleet account, which is up 64% across 2011/12 compared with the 2008-10 average \n(see graph below). \nIt is also apparent in our data, that \nLarge Goods\n Vehicles\n \n(\nparticular\nly\n \nc\nonstruction\n \nv\nehicles\n)\n are commonly involved, very often as the vehicle turns left a\nt a junction.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI hope the\n following \nthoughts provide some assistance to the Transport Select Committee and \nI \nam happy to \nsupply \nfurther \ncomment\n if more detail or information is required.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Q1 Is cycling safe, particularly in towns and cities?&#xa0;1.\n \n \nThis is a matter of perception. \nAviva recognises that \na great deal of \nGovernment \nresource\n has\n \nalready \nbeen invested\n and this has undoubtedly resulted in \nthe \nadvancement \nof\n \ncycling \nsafety\n. However\n,\n comparisons with other countries suggest there is still considerable scope for further improvement in the UK.\n&#xa0;\nQ2 What could central and local government do to improve cycling safety?&#xa0;2.\n \n \nT\nhere have been many debates and consultations on such matters and so Aviva will restrict comment to the following points, where \nit is felt \nwe can add \nuseful \ninsight\n.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n3.\n \n \nIn \nAviva’s e\nxperience, most \nserious \ncollisions between a motorist and a cyclist involve the driver simply not seeing the cyclist before impact.\n They tend to occur at junctions and roundabouts\n. R\narely is the driver blatantly reckless and invariably they are mo\nrtified by what has happened. \n&#xa0;\n4. \n \nAviva believes that \nto effectively tackle this type of \noccurrence\n, the issues and consequences need to be \nembedded in the public psyche\n and that this\n \nis \np\nrobably\n best \nachieved by \nraising awareness via \na \n‘\nhard hitting\n’\n \ncommunication campaign\n. Certainly this should utilise \nTV \nand printed \nadvert\nising\n, but also \nother \nforms of \nsocial media\n. The adverts should aim to have a \nsimilar \ngravitas \nto those previously used \nto encourage seat belt usage and to \nlook twice for\n oncoming \nm\notorcyclist\ns\n.\n \nWhilst commendable, the current \nTHINK\n!\n ‘Look Out’ \nfor \ncyclists’\n \ncampaign \ndoes not seem to have \na great deal of \nsupporting video, nor has \nit \nachieved \nsufficient\nly high\n profile yet.\n&#xa0;\n5. \n A\n nationwide advert would provide an opportunity to demonstrate benefits \nsuch as\n cyclists \nw\nearing a helmet / hi-viz clothing\n,\n warn about the dangers of under-taking / use of ear phones and promote the availability of any free / low cost cycling training sch\nemes (themes preferably to be agreed in advance with recognised cycling associations such as the CTC\n &amp; LCC\n). \n&#xa0;\n6. \n \nSpecifically in relation to collisions \ninvolving \nLGVs / Construction Vehicles turning left at a junction\n,\n \nAviva is supportive of the recently\n produced Construction Logistics Standard, which we feel represents good practice and would encourage operators / clients to \nbuild \nthis \ninto the\nir\n procurement process\n. \n&#xa0;\n7. \n \nT\nransport for London\n’s \nFleet Operator Recognition Scheme\n (FORS)\n \nis \nanother \nexcellent \ninitiative\n, of\n \nwhich \nAviva \nis supportive\n,\n and \nit is felt \nshould be \npublicised and \nextended to other regions as quickly as possible.\n&#xa0;\n8. \n \nAviva currently\n offer\ns\n to\n \nfund the cost of supplying \nour Fleet LGV customers \nwith warning decals (\nillustrated \nbelow)\n and Fresnel lenses\n. We\n consider \nthis \nto be a cost effective means to raise \nboth \ncyclist awareness and \nto \nimprove the driver’s field of vision respectively. This initiative has received widespread \npraise\n and \nGovernment might \nlike to \nconsi\nder \nmaking the dist\ninctive\n \n/\n intuitive\n decal \nin particular\n, freely available to a wider audience, perhaps via\n FORS\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9. \n  \nAviva is of the view that all professional drivers should \ncomplete a Vulnerable Road User focused module as part of their mandatory Driver CPC training, preferably \nto include physically experiencing things from \nthe perspective of a cyclist.\n   \n&#xa0;\nQ3 Is it desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, for example by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours?&#xa0;\n10\n. \n \nFollowing a \nreview of \nkilled and \nserious\nly\n injur\ned\n cyclist\n \nclaims \non\n our Commercial Motor account, Aviva is \nbelieves\n that the most effective means to protect cyclists is to \nphysically\n separate \nthem from other road \nusers.\n Wherever this is possible, \nsuch\n segregation will also substantially remove the sources of antagonism that otherwise inevitably arise between the two fa\nctions.  \n&#xa0;\n11. \nIn London at least, Police data confirms that most incidents involving cyclists occur during peak commuter times. With this in mind, Aviva believes there is justification to at least explore the prospect of \nrestricting access to certain road\n networks for\n some vehicles \nduring\n certain times\n of the day\n. The matter is of course complicated by the number of different stakeholders involved and the risk of unintended \nconsequences\n. Perhaps there is scope to undertake a limited trial &amp;/or introduce me\nasures only for vehicles which do not meet stipulated safety standards as a means to encourage greater compliance.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n              \nPage \n1\n of \n3\n"
