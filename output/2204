defaultThe Institute for Learning – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;defaultThe Institute for Learning (
defaultIfL
default) is the independent, voluntary professional body for teaching and training practitioners in the further education and skills sector. Our members work in further education colleges, independent training providers, community learning providers and in the public services delivering learning and skills provision funded by the Education Funding Agency, Skills Funding Agency and privately. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur mission is to support our members to achieve excellence in their individual practice, helping them to deliver life-changing opportunities for their learners.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur members, including lecturers, tutors, trainers, assessors, teachers as well as middle and senior managers, belong to a professional community dedicated to excellence in teaching, training and assessment practice for the over four million learners in the sector. 
defaultThe provision that 
defaultIfL
default members deliver ranges vastly from pre-entry and foundation levels up to higher and post-graduate level provision across academic and vocational subjects and apprenticeships.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis response sets out our position on the specific provisions within the draft Deregulation Bill that affect our members and affect the delivery of the very best quality teaching and learning. Specifically, our response will focus on the following clauses Clause 32 and Schedule 13 and their inter-relationships between the Education Act 2002 and the Further Education Teachers’ Qualifications (England) Regulations 2007. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition to making clear the Institute for Learning’s opposition to the removal of primary and secondary legislation allowing for a minimum qualification requirement for further education, we believe the process by which the Further Education Teachers’ Qualifications (England) Regulations 2007 were revoked this summer will be of interest to the Joint Committee as it is related to powers within the draft Deregulation Bill for ministers to 
defaultdisapply
default legislation.
default&#xa0;defaultSeptember 2013default&#xa0;defaultResponse and Recommendationsdefault&#xa0;defaultClause 32 of the draft Deregulation Bill is titled, ‘Further and higher education sectors: reduction of burdens’ and enacts Schedule 13. The Bill proposes that provisions within Schedule will, if passes as proposed, come in to effect 2 months after the day that the Bill becomes an Act.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe first clause of Schedule 13, ‘Regulation of qualification requirements for teaching staff and principals’ in the draft Bill proposes to remove parent primary legislation within the Education Act 2002
default which allows for regulations of minimum qualification requirements for those teaching in further education institutions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMost teaching and training practitioners in further education, unlike in schools, undertake initial teacher training in-service, rather than pre-service. This allows for learners in further education to benefit from experts from the worlds of business and industry as their 
defaultteachers. Regardless of the different emphasis on in-service of initial teacher training it is 
defaultIfL’s
default core belief that teaching and training in further education is a profession and should be set as such in legislation. Respected professions in medicine, healthcare, accounting and law all have regulated minimum entry qualifications and 
defaultIfL
default believes that this protection should also be afforded to teaching in further education. Having trained and qualified teachers in our further education sector is in the public interest. It sits above the industrial interests of individual further education employers in further education and so it is appropriate that the government maintains the regulations in legislation as the guardian of public standards in the public interest. Until recently, these minimum requirements were stipulated in regulations.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe most recent regulations for teachers in further education are the Further Education Teachers’ Qualifications (England) Regulations 2007. These regulations
default required individuals to gain a preparatory initial teacher training qualification within one year of employment in a teaching or training position within a further education institution and that a full level 5 (PGCE equivalent) teacher training qualification should be obtained within 5 years. This time window enables new teachers to train to a high standard in-service.
default&#xa0;
defaultAn evaluation
default of the Further Education Teachers’ Qualifications (England) Regulations 2007, commissioned by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills, showed that:
default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore, despite a public consultation by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills
default (BIS, 2012) showing that there was overwhelming support for maintaining the regulations, the government laid statutory instruments to revoke them on 8 August 2013 to come in to effect on 1 September 2013. On the question, ‘do you agree that the Further Education Teachers’ Qualifications (England) Regulations 2007 should be revoked from 1 September 2012?’ only 20 per cent of respondents said yes and 74 per cent said no. When the responses from national 
defaultorganisations
default in the further education sector were 
defaultanalysed
default separately, there was still a clear view given that the regulations should remain. Of the national 
defaultorganisations
default from the sector that responded to the same question, only 15 per cent of respondents said yes, the regulations should go and 38 per cent said no, they should stay (15 per cent said they weren’t sure and 31 per cent did not reply). The very same consultation analysis by BIS showed that 100 per cent of the national sector 
defaultorganisations
default that had responded believed that revoking the regulations would have unintended consequences. This figure was 80 per cent when the rest of the consultation responses were included.

defaultThe Institute for Learning’s own evidence
default&#xa0;
defaultprovides an insight into the effectiveness and impact of the regulations. In a 2012 survey of almost 6,000 teaching and training practitioners across further education and skills found:
defaultIn recognition of this evidence, 
defaultIfL
default is calling for the committee to take note that this method of deregulation, conducted as it has been, has not provided for opportunities for the Department to properly consider what will be significant impacts on individuals and 
defaultorganisations
default. This includes awarding 
defaultorganisations
default that, as businesses, deliver services and benefit to the public, and the 
defaultrigour
default and standards expected by the regulator 
defaultOfqual
default. University teacher training departments, as part of universities as businesses, could also lose revenue should there be a drop in teacher trainees. No risk assessment has been published which analyses the impact on commercial 
defaultorganisations
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAll of this meant that there was no opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny of this revocation due to the summer recess. In effect, this demonstrates that ministers already, without the powers proposed in the draft Bill, can 
defaultdisapply
default legislation that they no longer wish to remain in statute as primary legislation.
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendationsdefaultIfL
default recommends that the Joint Committee for the Draft Deregulation Bill:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultGeneral Questionsdefault&#xa0;defaultYes – the deregulation Bill can be focused only on areas where change is needed in primary legislative provision. The requirement for further education teachers to be qualified can be held, adapted for removed using secondary legislative procedures through statutory instruments. There is therefore no need to alter relevant primary legislation in this area as proposed in the draft Bill. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultNo. Provisions within Clause 32 and schedule 13, specifically those relating to removing powers of the secretary of state to create regulations for the qualifications of teachers in 
defaultfurther education, are not evidence based. A public consultation
default, an independent impact analysis
default and research conducted by the Institute for Learning
default have collectively demonstrated strong support for the need for a statutory requirement for qualified further education teaching and training practitioners. 
defaultIfL
default has recommended that the committee look very closely at these provisions within the draft Bill. No impact assessment has been published on removing the statutory requirement for further education teachers to gain initial teachers training qualifications. This could have provided a number of insights, including on the quality of teaching and learning across the further education and skills sector, the impact on commercial 
defaultorganisations
default that deliver initial teacher training such as awarding 
defaultorganisations
default and universities and potential issues with regards to the perception of the quality of further education and skills provision in England compared to the devolved nations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIfL’s
default strong view is that the government’s role is to promote the public interest, using primary and secondary legislation to do that where necessary. High quality teaching and training in the further education and skills sector delivered by highly trained and qualified professionals is absolutely in the public interest and, as such, it is right that there is appropriate legislation in this area. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRemoval of provisions requiring teaching and training practitioners to be qualified may actually increase burdens placed in businesses, 
defaultorganisations
default and individuals. No assessment has been on the potential commercial loss to businesses, such as awarding 
defaultorganisations
default and universities, who deliver initial teacher training to further education teachers. Individuals who are keen to become a trained and qualified teaching practitioners in the further education and skills sector will, without a statutory entitlement, potentially have to source and fund this training, at a cost of up to £9,000 per year, themselves without the support of their employer. Whilst colleges, training 
defaultorganisations
default and other providers of further education and skills provision will not have to demonstrate regulatory compliance in regard to the qualifications of their teachers, they may well find themselves in a position where this is simply demanded elsewhere, such as through 
defaultOfsted
default, thereby not actually reducing the regulatory burden.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is in the short, medium and long term interest of the state that teachers in further education and skills are highly effective and deliver high quality learning and training. It therefore not fair or justified to remove powers for the secretary of state to make regulations in this area as proposed in the draft Bill. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis question has been covered in our response to question 4. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSection 136(b) of the Education Act 2002, which the draft Bill seeks to remove, and the inter-related Further Education Teachers’ Qualifications (England) Regulations 2007 provided a guarantee to further education learners that they will be taught by a highly qualified professional. Students and employers, as the users of the further education sector, may well have been part of the clear majority of respondents to a public consultation on the revocation of the regulations that said that the regulations should remain in place. Specific consultations with these user groups were not conducted. The National Union of Students, which represents students in further education, supports the statutory requirement for trained and qualified teachers in further education.
default&#xa0;
defaultWherever young people and adults train and learn in England’s further education sector they should be confident and assured that they are being taught by properly trained and qualified teachers, not left to chance. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultgovernment have
default rightly placed skills policy at the heart of their strategy for economic growth. Further education and skills providers and the provision they deliver is also vital to social mobility, personal wellbeing and community cohesion. But, as the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister said in their foreword to the white paper published by the Department for Education in 2011, “no education system can be better than the quality of its teachers” so it therefore seems counter-productive and counter-intuitive to, at this time, deregulate and indeed completely remove powers to deregulate, qualifications for teaching and training practitioners. To achieve prosperity and gain maximum efficiency from the further education and skills system, standards must not only be set high, but also consistently applied across the whole system and country. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs above for (a).
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultNo – provisions in Clause 32 and Schedule 13 of the draft Bill have not been subject to any cost-benefit analysis.
default Initial and continuing teacher education in further education and skills is an investment, not an overhead. The better equipped our teaching and training practitioners are to empower students, employees and apprentices to achieve, the better 
defaultchance our economy has to achieve sustainable growth and to deliver better life chances to the four million young and adult learners.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultPower to defaultdisapplydefault legislation no longer or practical usedefault&#xa0;defaultThe Further Education Teachers’ Qualifications (England) Regulations 2007 were revoked via a negative resolution procedure statutory instrument over the summer recess.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis has meant that no parliamentary scrutiny has been able to have taken place in advance on the revocation coming into force. Effectively, this demonstrates on way in which secondary legislation can already be 
defaultdisapplied
default.
