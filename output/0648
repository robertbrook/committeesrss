defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultthe Royal Meteorological Society (RMetS) default(CLC028)default1. 
defaultThe Royal Meteorological Society is the professional and learned society for weather and climate. The Society serves not only those in academia and professional meteorologists, but also those whose work is affected in some way or other by the weather or climate, or simply have a ge
defaultneral interest in the weather. 
defaultThe membership includes scientists, practitioners and a broad range of weather enthusiasts. 
default2. 
defaultWe administer the national vocational qualifications of the profession and under our Royal Charter pursue our purpose of the advancement of meteorological science.
default&#xa0;
default As meteorological science has developed it has come to include not just the science of weather and climate itself, but the application of this to disciplines such as agriculture, aviation, hydrology, marine transport and oceanography, as well as the impacts of climate change and the interaction between the atmosphere and the oceans. 
default3. 
defaultThe Society was established on 3 April 1850 as 'The British Meteorological Society', and was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1866, when its name was changed to "The Meteorological Society".
default&#xa0;
default The privilege of adding 'Royal' to the title was granted by Her Majesty Queen Victoria in 1883.

defaultWhat is the current state of public understanding of what is meant by climate change? How has this changed in recent years?default5. 
defaultPublic understanding of climate change and 
defaulthow these perceptions have changed
default have been 
defaultin the subject of
default a number of studies in recent years. 
defaultA
default 
defaultseries of polling results from 2005 to 2011 consistently find that more than three quarters of the UK population think that the climate is changing and that there is at least in part a human cause
default (Shuckburgh et al, 2012)
default. These polling results also show that there has been a decrease in concern about climate change over this time period, with a drop from more than three quarters of the population agreeing that they were at least fairly concerned in 2005 to just less than two thirds of the population in 2011. 
default&#xa0;
default              
default6. Pidgeon and Fischhoff (2011)
default 
defaultfound that over more than a decade of public polling 
defaultin the US 
defaultthe ma
defaultjority of those asked believed climate c
defaultha
defaultnge was 
defaultoccurring
default. Percentages ranged
default from 48% in 1998 to a peak of 65% in 2006 but then a relative decline to 52% was 
defaultseen
default in 2010. Those 'unsure' 
defaultin 2010 (36%) rose to near the peak level recorded in 
default1998 (39%) along with 
defaulta rise of 
defaultthose who believed climate change was not occurring peaking at 10% in 2010
default (up from 3% in 2006)
default. 
default7. 
defaultTherefore there is evidence to suggest that
default, while
default the majority of the public believe
defaults
default climate change is happening, in recent years the size of that majority has dropped
default.

default.
defaultWhich voices are trusted in public discourse on climate science and policy? What role should Government Departments, scientific advisers to Government and publicly funded scientists have in communicating climate science?default8. 
defaultShuckburgh et al. 2012 presented polling results from 2006 to 2011 concerning which groups the public trust to give correct information on climate change. There has been a decrease in trust in all groups over this time period, but “independent scientists” have consistently been scored as the most trusted group 
defaultwith 68% agreeing they could be trusted in 2006 and 51% agreeing in 2011. “Government scientists” were trusted by 21% in 2006 and just 13% in 2011, whereas “The government” was trusted by 14% in 2006 and 10% in 2011.
default9. 
defaultShuckburgh et al., 2012 
defaultindicated that 
default2011 
defaultviews on whether climate scientists c
defaultould
default be trusted were 
defaultsplit. Over
default one-third of the UK public agree
defaultd
default that they could trust climate scientists to tell the truth about climate change and 
defaultslightly less (
defaultabout one-third
default)
default disagree
defaultd
default. 
default10. 
defaultIt is evident that there is potential 
defaultfor climate scientists 
defaultto 
defaultcontinue to build on this trust.
default The RMetS is actively engaged in a number of initiatives to help support this.

defaultProfessor Tim Palmer FRS
default (and RMetS 
defaultPresident

default states: 
default"
defaultThe enormous interest in climate change does not, of course, arise from any inherent fascination in the science of the problem. Rather, interest stems from the perceived way that climate change will affect society.
default&#xa0;
default Some people worry about the impact on their freedom and prosperity, of policies that aim to reduce our carbon footprint. Others worry that without policy to curb emissions, the freedom and prosperity of future generations will be impacted even more. As a scientist I try to separate these from the science issues, especially when speaking in public. I believe that the public’s confidence in climate science and climate scientists may increase if it is felt that the scientists can take a mostly disinterested view on climate policy. From such a disinterested scientific perspective, the threat of substantial, even calamitous, climate change is unequivocal. However, at the same time, I myself do not believe we are yet doing all that is scientifically and technically possible to really understand and quantify the nature of this threat.

defaultGovernment needs to have a unified and well articulated view on climate change 
defaultboth internally and externally. It needs to be based upon 
defaultrobust
default independent scientific evidence
default. 
defaultHow could public understanding of what is meant by climate change be improved? What are the main barriers to this? Does the media have a positive role to play?default13. 
defaultThe public understanding of climate change is significantly affected by the 
defaultmedia,
default both positively and n
defaultegatively. Much of the RMetS’s
default work with 
defaultnewspapers
default, radio and televisio
defaultn
default, as well as handling public enquiries
default,
default relates to clarifying misunderstanding
defaults and misreporting by the media
default. Climate change is no exception. 
defaultEffective communication 
defaultto the public 
defaultof climate science by the government and 
defaultby professional
default organisations like RMetS is essential. Certainly the media have a positive role to play.
default14. 
defaultThe main route to enhancing public understanding must be through improved treatment of it in 
defaultschools through 
defaultthe 
defaultN
defaultational 
defaultC
defaulturriculum. 
defaultIn its submission to the Department for Education's consultation on reforming the English National Curriculum for Key Stages 1-3 (ages 5-14) the RMetS welcomed the increased focus on physical geography, including weather and climate. However, the Society argued strongly for the retention of climate change in the Geography curriculum, as well as some improvements to the coverage of weather and climate. It also argued for the introduction of basic physics relevant to climate change into the Science curriculum at KS3.
default 
defaultThe Society considers that the potential environmental, social and economic ramifications of climate change should be discussed in the core curriculum by all children and not left as options to be taken at a later stage. This will allow the next generation to make informe
defaultd decisions about their future.
default 
defaultHow important is public understanding in developing effective climate change policy? default15. 
defaultPublic understanding of climate change is fundamentally important. Public support for funding decisions and policy priorities 
defaultbased around
default climate change 
defaultcan only be achieved by
default effective communication
default of the reasons behind those decisions
default. Individual actions by members of the public, either voluntarily or as a result of policy initiatives, can only work effectively if members of the public acknowledge the value of changing their behaviour to help 
defaultclimate change policies 
defaultsucceed.
default 
default16. 
defaultResearch conducted on behalf of the RMetS in 2009 
defaulthighlighted that 100% of the general public surveyed on weather and climate matters were either ‘interested’ or ‘very interested’ in a

defaultplain English explanation
default&#xa0;
default of the causes and effects of climate change"
default.
defaultWhat evidence is there that public attitude to climate science affects their engagement with energy policies or initiatives?default1
default7
default. 
defaultThe study by 
defaultShuckburgh et al 2012 found that: 
default“Measures of public interest, engagement and trust associated with climate science are positively correlated, while the belief that climate change is exaggerated is negatively correlated, with concern about climate change and willingness to change behavior.”
default 
defaultHowever, whether this means that public attitude to climate science affects their engagement with policies or initiative, or the other way around, could not be determined from the data.

defaultCan lessons about public engagement with climate change policy be learned from other countries?default&#xa0;default default20

defaultInternational engagement with other nations about climate change policy can only be advantageous to the UK.
