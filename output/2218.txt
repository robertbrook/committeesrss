[[[ – Written Evidence]]]&#xa0;I have lived for 41years in a small village in the Peak District National Park (PDNPA) and for several years I was a voluntary  PDNPA ranger. I have always been a keen walker and have a deep concern for the protection of Rights of Way.&#xa0;For the past 3 .5 yrs. I have been involved in monitoring  the use of a local route,Chertpit and Leys Lane,Great Longstone, and I will be happy to submit all records if required. The lane became classified as a BOAT following a public Inquiry in Feb. 2010. The inspector's decision was based on historical evidence- that is the probability that the route had historically been used by horse and carriage. Local people found this difficult to comprehend as the narrowest section of the route is only 2 metres wide between the ancient walls. This concern was reflected in the number who attended  the inquiry- over 90 on the first day and slightly less on the next two days. This is in a village with a population of 843.&#xa0;Over the previous 10 years the route was used occasionally mainly by trail bikes but now, as a BOAT, it is used frequently not only by trail bikes but  also by quad bikes and 4x4's. Please see the photograph number 1. This was taken in the narrowest section of the route. Please notice that the rear left wheels are touching the foundation stones of the field walls and the right side wing mirror  is touching the opposite wall. Please see photograph number 2. This again was taken in the narrowest section. Where do walkers, cyclists and horse riders go? The horse riders are no longer able to use the lane as it is too dangerous for both horse and rider, cyclists have had to lift bikes over the walls, or in some cases over the vehicles, and walkers have to retreat,climb walls or give up using the lane.&#xa0;Following the Inquiry in Feb. 2010 appeals were made to the Highway Authority  Derbyshire County Counci for a Traffic Regulation Order without success. In Feb.2o12 the local campaigning group "rocking the BOAT" submitted a request for a TRO to the Peak District National Park Authority. We are still waiting for a public consultation  process. Meanwhile on the lane damage to the route and the walls continues.  Please see photograph  number 3 taken in April this year and notice the damage to the walls. The grass verges have all been eroded and vehicles are now damaging the foundation stones. There is more anxiety felt by the walkers and cyclists and it is reported that it is not only the horse riders who feel prohibited but also walkers and cyclists.&#xa0;These are my comments about just one lane in the Peak District National Park but I know that there are many others in a similar situation  throughout the PDNP.&#xa0;Much could be done by amendments to the Deregulation  Bill to ease the problems I have mentioned.&#xa0;I propose&#xa0;&#xa0;In addition to my personal proposals I expressly support the formal submissions made by the Green Lanes Environmental  Action Movement (GLEAM),  the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG),the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance  (PDGLA),the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance(YDGLA) and the local group "rocking the BOAT".Yours sincerely&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Pictures 1 and 2 not published here.
