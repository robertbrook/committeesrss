default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThank you for inviting me, on behalf of the Local Government Association, to offer oral evidence to 
defaultthe Work and Pensions Select
default Committee 
defaultas part of your inquiry 
defaultinto the role of Jobcentre Plus in the reformed welfare system. I have included below those aspects of follow up which I promised at the meeting
default on 16 October 2013
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultExperiences of local authority pilots on the challenges faced by rural communities default&#xa0;
defaultOver the 
defaultsummer 
defaultthe LGA
default published a report, titled 
defaultLocal government and Universal 
defaultCredit
default, 
defaultin
default collaboration with the Department for Work and Pensions
default. This includes a number of 
defaultcase studies, including offerings from 
defaultWest Lindsey and North Dorset 
defaultwho directly 
defaultrefer to the challenges of 
defaultuniversal credit
default delivery in rural areas.

default&#xa0;
defaultEvidence of whether local authority and JCP partnerships, such as in Newcastle, have encouraged a longer-term approach default&#xa0;
defaultNewcastle Futures Limited (NFL)
default is an independent organisation established and jointly supported by Newcastle City Council (NCC) and Jobcentre Plus (JCP). The organisation has an excellent record for supporting disengaged people into sustained employment over its seven year existence.
default 
defaultN
defaultFL is tasked with meeting the dual complimentary responsibilities of NCC, to support vulnerable residents in the city, and of JCP, to help people move off job seekers alliance, which are believed to be best met through a single approach.
default 
defaultIndividual NFL adv
defaultisers are responsible to the dual ambitions of NCC and JCP and so in turn deliver a provision that looks long-term and, rather than trying to move people off-benefits as soon as possible, can tap into a range of services to provide a holistic and personali
defaultsed offer that gets at the routes of unemployment. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe approach is very successful, and is central to the city’s future employment strategy. But it is built on strong long-term relationships, and additional investment, at the local level and is not necessarily encouraged by the way the Government seeks to 
defaultcontrol JCP services nationally. This is why this kind of approach does not exist everywhere and why Newcastle is seeking further local flexibilities through the City Deal. Further information

defaultData sharingdefault&#xa0;
defaultFinally, I wanted to follow up on your questions around data sharing
default. 
defaultCouncils 
defaulthave statutory duties
default to support young people to participate in work or learning, to track their participation, and to identify those disengaged or at risk of disengaging. Councils must rely on a complex range of local providers to provide quality data at the right time to ful
defaultfil these responsibilities. 
defaultThe obligation is on councils to invest resource in building relationships with different providers, and to convince them it is in their interests to share data and work together. 
default&#xa0;
defaultJCP currently share the names of claimants
default in 
defaultsome places where there are good relationships
default, but not benefit type or contact details, which is essential if councils are to support young people to participate. The Memorandum of Understanding
default between the Department of Education and Department for Work 
defaultand Pensions
default will be useful in supporting this, 
defaultal
defaultthough 
defaultit 
defaultwill need to implemented effectively if it is to improve data sharing on the ground
default, which can be too often held back by ineffective local relationships and national disincentives
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI hope all of
default the above information answers your queries and is of assistance to the Committee’s inquiry. Should you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
