              
[normal]Correspondence from Cllr Sharon Taylor, Chair, Finance Panel, Local Government Association
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for inviting me, on behalf of the Local Government Association, to offer oral evidence to 
[normal]the Work and Pensions Select
[normal] Committee 
[normal]as part of your inquiry 
[normal]into the role of Jobcentre Plus in the reformed welfare system. I have included below those aspects of follow up which I promised at the meeting
[normal] on 16 October 2013
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Experiences of local authority pilots on the challenges faced by rural communities [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Over the 
[normal]summer 
[normal]the LGA
[normal] published a report, titled 
[normal]Local government and Universal 
[normal]Credit
[normal], 
[normal]in
[normal] collaboration with the Department for Work and Pensions
[normal]. This includes a number of 
[normal]case studies, including offerings from 
[normal]West Lindsey and North Dorset 
[normal]who directly 
[normal]refer to the challenges of 
[normal]universal credit
[normal] delivery in rural areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]n electronic version
[normal] of the report
[normal] is available on our website
[normal]. 
[normal]Let me know if you 
[normal]would like
[normal] any hard copies
[normal] and we can have these produced
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Research[bold] on application[bold]s[bold] for [bold]local [bold]welfare support[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]W
[normal]e do
[normal] 
[normal]n
[normal]o
[normal]t have specific figures on the number of applicants
[normal] [bold]for
[normal] [bold]local welfare support. However, the LGA is undertaking qualitative research into local schemes (how they are working, the demand for 
[normal]the schemes
[normal] and 
[normal]how they are being 
[normal]fund
[normal]ed
[normal]) and
[normal] we would be 
[normal]happy t
[normal]o share a further update after our 
[normal]focus group on 7 November. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Evidence of whether local authority and JCP partnerships, such as in Newcastle, have encouraged a longer-term approach [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Newcastle Futures Limited (NFL)
[normal] is an independent organisation established and jointly supported by Newcastle City Council (NCC) and Jobcentre Plus (JCP). The organisation has an excellent record for supporting disengaged people into sustained employment over its seven year existence.
[normal] 
[normal]N
[normal]FL is tasked with meeting the dual complimentary responsibilities of NCC, to support vulnerable residents in the city, and of JCP, to help people move off job seekers alliance, which are believed to be best met through a single approach.
[normal] 
[normal]Individual NFL adv
[normal]isers are responsible to the dual ambitions of NCC and JCP and so in turn deliver a provision that looks long-term and, rather than trying to move people off-benefits as soon as possible, can tap into a range of services to provide a holistic and personali
[normal]sed offer that gets at the routes of unemployment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The approach is very successful, and is central to the city’s future employment strategy. But it is built on strong long-term relationships, and additional investment, at the local level and is not necessarily encouraged by the way the Government seeks to 
[normal]control JCP services nationally. This is why this kind of approach does not exist everywhere and why Newcastle is seeking further local flexibilities through the City Deal. Further information

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Data sharing[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally, I wanted to follow up on your questions around data sharing
[normal]. 
[normal]Councils 
[normal]have statutory duties
[normal] to support young people to participate in work or learning, to track their participation, and to identify those disengaged or at risk of disengaging. Councils must rely on a complex range of local providers to provide quality data at the right time to ful
[normal]fil these responsibilities. 
[normal]The obligation is on councils to invest resource in building relationships with different providers, and to convince them it is in their interests to share data and work together. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]JCP currently share the names of claimants
[normal] in 
[normal]some places where there are good relationships
[normal], but not benefit type or contact details, which is essential if councils are to support young people to participate. The Memorandum of Understanding
[normal] between the Department of Education and Department for Work 
[normal]and Pensions
[normal] will be useful in supporting this, 
[normal]al
[normal]though 
[normal]it 
[normal]will need to implemented effectively if it is to improve data sharing on the ground
[normal], which can be too often held back by ineffective local relationships and national disincentives
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope all of
[normal] the above information answers your queries and is of assistance to the Committee’s inquiry. Should you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
