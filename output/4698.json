"&#xa0;\nAFS0097Written evidence submitted by Dr Ruth Boyask, Plymouth University&#xa0;\nThe \nE\nffectiveness of \nA\ncademisation in \nN\narrowing the \nG\nap for \nD\nisadvantaged \nC\nhildren\nEvidence from the BELMAS Structural Reform Research Programme funded study:\n‘New Relations between Local Authorities and Schools’\n&#xa0;\nExecutive SummaryAcademisation has changed the responsibilities and functions of local authorities\n (LAs)\n in resp\nect of their work with schools, yet they retain significant statutory responsibility for fair access to schooling, the needs of vulnerable children, school improvement and performance, and advocacy for parents, families and children. Their ability to act u\npon these responsibilities is affected by financial loss as schools convert to academies and central government cuts funding. \nThe resultant climate is competitive, and in some cases, combative.\nThis paper reports on findings of case studies \nof\n four \nLAs\n wit\nhin one region. Three of the authorities attempted to mitigate competition within the market-led environment, whereas one embraced it. \nThe findings from the project of relevance to this project are divided into two themes: 1) \nStatutory responsibilities of\n LAs and reduced financial resources\n, and 2) \nConfusion in functions and responsibilities\n of LAs.\nEven though academisation promotes school autonomy, LAs remain statutorily responsible for s\nome of the operations of academies, \n(for example,\n \nstatutory assessment of SEN and the prosecution of non-attendees at school\n)\n. While responsibilities for vulnerable children and many other serious concerns and issues come to the local authority, limited fi\nnancial and human resources can cause significant oversights. A core \nfunction for the LA is \nthe capacity to act \non all concerns and issues that are brought to it by stakeholders\n. \nRespondents from the four case studies all reported some element of confusion in respect of their responsibilities to schools. There are responsibilities enshrined in the statutes themselves that have not changed, against which Ofsted \ninspect\n local authori\nties, yet different messages \nabout school autonomy \nemerge from the Department for Education. \nThese ambiguities are exacerbated when schools are transitioning to academy status, and also impact upon an LA’s capacity to offer a stable \nset of\n service\ns for cru\ncial functions like school improvement\n. \nConclusionThis research suggests that a market economy of schooling and services to schools impacts upon local authorities’ capacity to meet the needs of disadvantaged children and young people. LAs need the financ\nial and human resources to respond to the issues that come to them. As inequalities within society increase, there will be greater demand placed upon LAs to respond to the needs of children.  \n&#xa0;\nThere is\n a lack of clarity around role and\n responsibility in the interactions betwee\nn schools and local authorities\n,\n and also \nwithin \nexternal relationships\n.\n While a simple solution to the ambiguit\nies\n may appear to be more clearly defining lines of accountability, I think there is a deeper problem \nto be resolved. Current policies impacting upon the education and care of children emphasise competition, including the academies programme, forcing school\ns and LAs to compete for custom\n and authority\n, \nwork\ning\n against co-operati\non\n or community engagement. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe expansion of the academies programme \nsince 2010 has resulted in a profound reconfiguration of the responsibilities and functions of local authorities in respect of the\nir\n work \nwith \nschools. \nThrough\n \nThe Academies Act\n (2010)\n and \nThe \nSchools White Paper\n (2010) \ngoverning and management bodies of academies have new responsibilities that previously had been responsib\nilities within\n the\n local authority\n, including \ngreater school-level control over finances and expenditure\n. \nYet Local \nAuthorities\n (LAs)\n still retain important responsibilities in respect of schooling including:\n•\n              \nEnsuring there is fair access to schooling\n•\n              \nSupporting vulnerable children\n•\n              \nImproving the performance of schools and ensuring high standards  \n•\n              \nUsing their de\nmocratic mandate to advocate for parents, families and children \n(DfE, 2010; Parish, Baxter and Sandals, 2012). \nThe capacity of LAs to enact these responsibilities\n is\n affected by significant funding cuts to their formula grants (Stabe &amp; Jones, 2011), but \nalso financial loss as schools convert to academies. A\ncademisation \nhas resulted in\n pro\nfound\n change\ns to\n how \nLA\ns recognise and enact responsibilities for disadvantaged children in \nacademy \nschools, \nand\n \nchanges in financing have\n also affected how local authori\nties relate to maintained schools. Furthermo\nre, the promotion of autonomous\n school\ns has created a competitive \nenvironment \nthat works against the best interests of disadvantaged children, making the job of the local authority to ensure the needs of the most\n vulnerable are met much more difficult. \nAn LA Senior Manager\n with strategic responsibility for services to schools \nclaimed that \nwithin her LA \nwhere 44% of schools are academies, \nrelationships between schools had become “combative”\n as a result of competition.  \nDifferent \nLAs\n have trialled different solutions to changes in their resource, but within four \nrecent \ncase studies\n of LAs\n each had made immense moves away from statutory provision as a norm. Of the four \nLAs\n only one fully embr\naced a competitive market model to achieve its statutory responsibility to the social good, whereas the other local authorities have differently attempted to mitigate the challenges of a competitive environment so they may enact this responsibility. This h\nas been through the following mechanisms:\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHolding onto a limited statutory provision (although in light of recent funding cuts this is unlikely to continue)\n;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunity and stakeholder engagement;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUtilising business structures founded on principles of coope\nration and mutuality.\n1.1 Evidential basis of the reportThis r\neport \ndraws upon findings from the ‘New Relations between Local Authorities and Schools’ study to \npresent evidence \nthat addresses the terms of reference of this select committee inquiry in respect of the functions and responsibilities of local authorities. The report presents findings \nfrom this study \nthat \naddresses \nt\nhe functions and responsibilities in relation to acad\nemies and free schools of local authorities operating between the Secretary o\nf State and individual schools, and considers the significance of these findings for determining\n \nwhat these functions\n and responsibilities should be. \nThe study has focused upon four \nLAs\n from within a single region looking at how their relationships with schools have changed as a result of structural reform in the schooling sector. \nTable.

They’\nre very homesick; trying to make contact with their families. All that stuff is really important. \nAnd we are doing it a bit on a shoestring I have to say at the moment (\ninterview \n11 April 2013\n, brackets \nand emphasis added \nby researcher\n).\n&#xa0;\nA\nn Ofsted\n report \nfrom an LA inspection from the same region was\n \nreleased \nshortly after this interview\n,\n \nraising\n \nserious \nconcerns about child protection services\n. It\n \nclaimed\n that\n within the inspected LA\n “there are systemic weaknesses in managerial oversight and quality assurance that enable inconsistent and ineffective practice to go unchallenged and as a consequence some children and young people are exposed to unnecessary risk of significant harm”\n.\n  \nT\nhis\n was also an\n LA\n that had also adopted a fiercely competitive market model of services for children and young people\n, drawing upon the financial backing and commercial experience of a corporate partner\n. \nThe more market orientated LA in my study has adopt\ned a position of broker between service providers and schools. The LAs who have attempted to mitigate the effects of competition because it \nfragments \nco-operation amongst schools or works against the interests of the most disadvantaged \nremain located\n \nwithi\nn market relations. \n&#xa0;\nThe solution\ns\n \nfor survival within a market economy of services to schools for\n \nall the case study\n LA\ns\n has been \nthe\n disestablish\nment of\n \nprovision\n within the LA\n, and move towards commissioning model\ns to fulfil statutory duties\n. \nThe model\n within one of the LAs \naimed\n predominantly \nto \ncommission services \nfor disadvantaged children and young people \nfrom school\n providers\n. The other three\n LAs had developed some form of traded service\n based upon their disestablished statutory service provision\n, in one case retaining a 20% interest in a joint venture established in partnership with a large corporate backer, and in the two other cases developing business units within the local authority. \nService provision as a core function of the LAs is almost n\non-existent, and the traded services are offered to both maintained and academy schools.\n This le\naves\n LAs trying to account for differences in their commitments to maintained schools compared with academies. In many cases there remains little difference.\n \nYe\nt some LA responde\nnts argue there is a difference\n in quality of service between statutory and traded provision. \nA respondent who at the time of interview retained a position within a small \nstatutory provision \nunit within\n an\n LA\n \nunder threat of becoming a fu\nlly traded service \nsaid\n:\n&#xa0;\nIt’s not a foregone conclusion that commissioning\n out and putting things to arm’s length\n will diminish the service, but I think there is a fear that it could\n…\nCertainly in practical terms, I can see that if I and my colleagues are \ncommissioned out, then a lot of the stuff that just lands on your desk on a day-to-day basis I’m really concerned about who will do that?  If I’m commissioned to do specific things I will do those specific things, I will become a traded service. Who will p\nick up all the little incidental things which if they’re not picked up sometimes become huge things.  Personally I have fears about that, and I know that most of the colleagues I work closely with have fears about that as well\n…\nwe are really genuinely worri\ned about it in terms of the service that the schools, families and children will be receiving\n (Interview 16 May 2013)\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2&#xa0; \nConfusion in functions and responsibilities of LAsRespondents from the four case studies all reported some element of confusion in respect of their responsibilities to schools. There are responsibilities enshri\nned in the statutes themselves\n that have not changed, against which Ofsted intend inspecting loc\nal authorities, \nyet\n different messages \nemerge\n from the Department for Education. \n…We’ve got Sir Michael Wilshaw in Ofsted saying, “We’re going to inspect the local authorities and you are responsible for outcomes for all children, even if it’s in academie\ns and free schools; it’s down to you to sort out how you negotiate that space with the academies”. We’ve got the DfE saying, “Actually schools are autonomous, they’re out of local authority control” (interview 11 April 2013).\nThis\n ambiguity\n has practical i\nmplications for \nLAs when \nrationalising services and\n managing\n their costs. For example, when discussing statutory provision of Governor Services in one case study LA I was told:  \nWe looked into this quite carefully and in fact we asked our legal department\n to look into exactly what the Local Authority was obliged to provide but it was not easy to discern. In the end the Local Authority believes that the induction training that we are providing for new Governors and new Chairs of Governors is something that \nwe are obliged to provide (interview 16 April 2013).\nFor the main part,\n \nthe case study \nLAs seem to be minimising commitments to statutory provision\n,\n particularly in respect of academies\n. \n \nHowever, they are still engaged in a transitional situation. One res\npondent drew attention to differences between sponsored and converter academies in relation to her LA’s responsibility for school improvement. She pointed out that the LA was likely to be already working with schools who were becoming sponsored academies, \nand that the LA was taking the lead in supporting the conversion process. \nT\nhe sponsor in my view should be wholly involved in the period up until conversion, and my experience is that they’re quite reluctant to do that.  Obviously they will do the TUPE\n a\nnd the statutory stuff that has to be done to keep the processes moving along, but in terms of school improvement, particularly in trying to raise achievement or trying to improve the quality of teaching, it’s quite difficult to get them involved until the\n actual co\nnversion date has taken place. \nThat I don’t think is in the best interests of the school. \n(Interview 16 May 2013)\nThis situation is further complicated because the sponsored academies are generally in a position where they are being ‘forced’ to c\nonvert. Schools dislike this situation, and so it seems do the LAs in my case studies. \nWe’re pretty consistent there because one of the things that I don’t think anyone is comfortable with is this whole concept of forced academies. And we’ve had quite int\neresting exchanges with the DfE about this, because they’ve come down with a hit list of schools and say, right this where you’ve g\not to do this. I think issuing \nwarning notices and things\n…\nBut our principle has always been that if a school is going to convert, unless it’s absolutely failing and it’s on its knees – and we don’t have schools like that in \n[this LA]\n at the moment – then it’s something you negotiate with the governors. \n(interview\n 11 April 2013)\nFurthermore, \na\n respondent suggested that sponsored\n ac\nademies were a threat to the LA\n maintaining a school improvement service, even as a traded service since “the more schools that are forced academies, I think they are less likely to buy b\nack because if you are a sponsored academy you will have your budget top-sliced by your sponsor for school improvement, so why would you then find another pot of money to buy local authority school improvement?” \n(Interview 16 May 2013)\n3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConclusionsThe LAs \nreported in this study recognise their statutory responsibilities for disadvantaged children. However, recent structural reforms are impacting in various ways on their capacity to act upon these responsibilities. This research suggests that \na market econom\ny of schooling and services to schools impacts upon local authorities’ capacity to meet the needs of disadvantaged children and young people. LAs need the financial and human resources to respond to the issues that come to them. As inequalities within soci\nety increase, there will be greater demand placed upon LAs\n to respond to the needs of children.  \n&#xa0;\nT\nhe \nreported study i\nndicates that there remains a considerable lack of clarity around role and\n responsibility \nin the interactions between \nschools and local \nauthorities\n \nand also through external relations\nhips\n with governmental bodies such as Ofsted. While a simple solution to\n the\n ambiguity may appear to be more clearly de\nfining lines of accountability, \nI \nthink\n there is a deeper problem to be resolved\n. Current \npolicies impacting upon the education and care of children emphasise competition, including the academies programme, forcing schools and\n LAs to compete for custom\n. While three of the four case studies reported upon in this paper are attempting to mitigate \nthe\n competitive \nconditions, the evidence suggests that external pressures such as funding and central accountability \nare \nwork\ning\n against\n their attempts at\n co-operati\non\n or\n supporting\n community \nengagement\n (see Boyask, forthcoming for a more detailed account \nof the research findings and conclusions)\n. \nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\nReferences: Boyask, R.
