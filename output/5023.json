"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nSandra Sanderson\n [PCC Progress 15]\n&#xa0;\n1. \nThe role of \nPolice and Crime P\nanels in holding their commissioners to account:\n&#xa0;\nThe \nPCC\n in \nCounty X has demonstrated a\n low level of commitment\n,\n in practice, to \nequal opportunities\n.  For example: recruiting staff to his\n/her\n office without any regard to equally opportunities recruitment and selection processes, thus setting a very poor example as a senior public servant.\n&#xa0;\nAlso a\nwarding grants under the \nLocal P\nolicing \nF\nund: The \nPCC\n gave a \nsignificant grant to one local group to\n before eve\nn launching the application process\n.  Many local organisat\nions were then refused awards on\n the basis that there was insufficient funding. It is difficult to avoid the appearance of favouritism.\n&#xa0;\nIt\n does not appear that the Police and C\nrime Panel are able to hold the C\nommissioner to account in areas of equal opportunities and fairness.  \n&#xa0;\n2. The role of C\nommissione\nrs in budget and precept setting:  A\ngain the\n admini\nstration of the Local Policing Fund where\n a \nsignificant grant\n was given out to one organisation before others where even able to access th\ne application form.  This gives rise to concerns around the C\nommissioner’s attitude to the budget.  \n&#xa0;\n3. Effectiveness of C\nommissioners in promoting local policing priorities:\n&#xa0;\nThere has been some consultation in \nour area \naround the \nPCC\n’s priorities.  However, the major consultation meeting was extremely disappointing for those participating.  Whereas significant dissent was expressed at the consultation meeting, the notes suggested a much greater agreement with the \nPCC\n’s plans.  Further, consultation with the third sector has looked very\n much like a fait accompli.  It was very clear to everyone present\n that the \nPCC\n has decided what the priorities are and it is difficult to avoid the appearance that the consultation \nis merely a case of “going through th\ne motions.”  For instance, the C\nommissioner\n’s office had\n undertake\nn\n a “mapping exercise” of all the third sector agencies involved with crime and crime reduction work.  At the consultation meeting this \nmap was produced but it did not\n include any of the\n county hate crime partnerships – despite the fact that \nthese are voluntary sector led p\nartnerships receiving significa\nnt funding from the respective Crime Reduction Partnerships and the County C\nouncil.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nPCC\n has made it clear that he\n/she\n fully supports the notion of a sing\nle gateway for victims\n his\n/her\n consultation\n with the voluntary sector appears mostly to\n focus on how this may operate, not on the more fundamental questions of whether it is desirable or necessary.  \n&#xa0;\nPlease note we do not feel able to identify the County as we are an organisation who will be seeking funds from the \nPCC\n and fear that if he/she knows we have criticised him/her\n \nin this consultation this might af\nfect his/her funding decisions.\n&#xa0;\nSandra Sanderson\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
