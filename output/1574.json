The Athena SWAN award system \nrecognizes good practice relating both to Gender Equality, and to creating a culture that is more likely to retain\n talented individuals, especially women.\n&#xa0;\n1\n5\n.\n              \nExamples of good practice within our School of Medicine include:\n&#xa0;\na\n.\n              \nD\ne\nvelopment of a Senior Academic W\nomen’s Forum\n&#xa0;\nb.\n              \nEstablishment of a group of mentors for female clinical academic trainees\n&#xa0;\nc.\n              \nRegular \ncareer development and confidence-building workshops for mid-career women\n&#xa0;\nd.\n              \nInitiation of a “Returning Carer’s Fund” to provide financial support for any activity that mid-career Academics and Researchers who have taken care leave for three months or mor\ne believe will re-energise their careers\n&#xa0;\ne.\n              \nSchool-wide increase in Equality and Diversity awareness\n and training\n&#xa0;\nf.\n              \nEnsuring that appointments panels and committees have female representation (we do not impose a particul\nar percentage to avoid adversel\ny\n \nimpacting on women’s time commitment to such activities)\n&#xa0;\ng.\n              \nIncreasing visibility of senior academic women via seminar speakers, chairing responsibilities, and a regular school-wide newsletter\n&#xa0;\nh.\n              \nEnsuring that women are as well supported as men in promot\nions processes.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat can the Government do?\n&#xa0;\n16.\n              \nW\ne believe that Government can play a\n role in encouraging the retention of\n women in academic STEM careers, which can be both financial\n \nand practical, in the following areas:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n McNeil and Sher: http://www.physics.wm.edu/~sher/survey.html\n \nMoss-Racusin CA, et al.
