"&#xa0;\nThe Association of Directors of Children's Services \n(ADCS) \nvalues the\n opportunity to respond to the c\nall for evidence into Academies and Free Schools. \nADCS \nis the professional association for directors of children's services an\nd their senior management teams.\n \nUnder the\n provisions of the \nChildren Act 2004, the DCS\n \nis\n the \nchief\n officer responsible for the discharge of local authority functions \nwith regard to \nthe education of all children in their local area\n. \nT\nhe DCS provides a clear and unambiguous line of \nprofessional\n accountability for children’s services\n, including education\n and\n \nas such, has a particular interest in\n the\n performance of academies and free sch\nools\n.\n Directors of children’s services \nare\n statutorily responsible for the education of every child in their local area regardless of where they receive their schooling. ADCS believes that\n local authorities have\n a key role to play in the improvement and pe\nrformance of all schools\n regard of their designation, and as such \nh\nas a pro-active interest in the governance and scrutiny of academies and free schools. \nThe announcement of the establishment of eight regional commissioners for education by the Department for Education in December 2013 h\nas\n added a new dimension to the intervention and monitoring of academies and free schools. At the moment it is u\nnclear what role the new commissioners will have in monitoring and intervening in low performing academies that are not currently failing.\n \nIt must be the goal of all involved to prevent schools from failing in the first place, rather than simply issuing wa\nrning notices or using other intervention powers after the failure has occurred. R\negional commissioners will not be directly\n nor democratically\n accountable locally and the size and structure of the\n eight\n regions mean it is unlikely that they will be able t\no develop the detailed understanding of local schools that the local authority has. \nFurther clarification on the role of regional commissioners in monitoring and challenging low performing academies and free schools\n, and their proposed interaction with the\n role of the local authority,\n would be most welcome. \nChains of academies are not currently subject to inspection as local authorities are. We would advocate that inspection of academy chains, and the support they provide for their schools is subject to in\nspection by Ofsted in the future. \nThe underperformance of any school should be subject to local scrutiny, and if possible a locally provided solution\n should be found\n before academy status is considered. At present any formal action\n taken\n by a local authority to secure improved performance in an underperforming school, such as the use of warning notices or an IEB appears to be a trigger for the consideration of a \nforced conversion\n to academy status\n by the Department for Education\n. Allowing\n local authorities to intervene and \nsecure\n locally delivered solutions to improve schools would be preferable to the swift conversion to academy status. \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
