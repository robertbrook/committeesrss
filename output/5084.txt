&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by the Alliance for Middle East Peace&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Executive Summary:              The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP), a United States charitable organization, comprised of grassroots peacebuilding nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, urges this Committee to: &#xa0;&#xa0;              ALLMEP also urges:&#xa0; and stands ready to assist the Committee to these ends.

[[[Written Evidence Submitted by the Alliance for Middle East Peace]]]&#xa0;To the International Development Committee:1)                             Thank you for the opportunity to present evidence regarding Britain’s spending in Israel and the Palestinian territories.  This is an important inquiry at a pivotal moment in the quest for a final status agreement, hopefully resolving decades of conflict in the region.  The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) lauds the Committee for its effort; seeks to encourage the Committee to recommend dramatically enhanced funding for people-to-people (P2P) projects in the region that demonstrably lay the groundwork for any sustainable peace; and encourages visits of high-level officials to those projects at the earliest possible time. 2)                             It is our understanding that the goal of the British government is a “prosperous Middle East with a sovereign and viable Palestinian State living in peace alongside a secure Israel…” and that “resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a UK priority.”  To this end, the UK expends approximately £90 million annually (approximately US $54.6 million) in Israel and the Palestinian territories, with the vast majority (£86 million) dedicated to Palestine economic development through the Department for International Development (DfID).  None of these funds support people-to-people activities, and only £4 million (US $6 million) goes to both Israel and the Palestinian territories through the interdepartmental Conflict Pool.  Although the majority of the Conflict Pool funds go to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs, only one of the thirteen projects currently being funded (ALLMEP member Peres Center/Palestinian Red Crescent) brings Israelis and Palestinians together in cooperative activities. It is this disparity that ALLMEP seeks to address.  &#xa0;3)                            ALLMEP recommends:&#xa0;The Alliance for Middle East Peace4)                             The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP), a United States charitable organization, is a grassroots consortium of some 80 NGOs conducting people-to-people (P2P) coexistence, reconciliation, and cooperative activities among Israelis and Palestinians, Arabs and Jews in the region.  Serving thousands of Israelis and Palestinians, these organizations daily lay the foundation for any sustainable peace in the region, striving through their programs both to solve intractable problems and to produce the behavioral shifts essential to attitudinal change.  Their work is critical, yet dramatically under-resourced.  ALLMEP's mission is to foster its members' efforts and efficacy by working, primarily in the United States, to increase funding and support for these projects from the public and private sectors and to raise the successful profile of peacebuilding activities both as an essential ingredient of the peace process and as a counterpoint to violence and conflict.  Today, this robust, growing coalition is connecting true peacebuilders to the policymakers, to the public, and to the press. 5)                             Through an annual US Congressional appropriation – ALLMEP's signature accomplishment to date –

[[[peacebuilding programs has flowed to the region]]].  Not only is ALLMEP the only advocate for this crucial US funding, but we have become the acknowledged “go-to” resource for both USAID and our members regarding this critical “track II diplomacy.”  6)                             ALLMEP is currently seeking to initiate an even more potent mechanism for dramatically enhanced funding for people-to-people activities: an 

[[[International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace.  ]]]Building on the enormous success of the annual US Congressional appropriation, ALLMEP has, for some time, been in negotiation with the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority, the US Administration and Congress, the United Nations, the European Union, and numerous Arab governments as well as potential private donors for the creation of the International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace.  The proposed International Fund would be modeled on the hugely-successful International Fund for Ireland, founded in 1986, which provided billions of dollars to people-to-people peacebuilding efforts in Northern Ireland.  With the resumption of peace talks last summer, the proposed Fund has garnered significant traction:  we expect introduction of a bipartisan authorizing bill in the US Congress within weeks.  The Fund is integral to and intertwined with the success of “track I” diplomatic efforts, permitting a dramatic scaling up of successful P2P programs/efforts.  US $200 million is the Year I target, with $50 million to come from the US.  To the extent that the Commons Select Committee is investigating whether the modest influx of British Conflict Pool Funds (only minimally committed to P2P work) is sufficient, ALLMEP respectfully submits that the Committee consider Britain’s active participation in this proposed International Fund.&#xa0;The significance of people-to-people (P2P) projects7)                             Since 2004, with ALLMEP’s energetic advocacy, the US Congress has provided funding through its foreign assistance program for worldwide “people-to-people reconciliation programs which bring together individuals of different ethnic, religious and political backgrounds from areas of strife and war… [including] such programs in the Middle East.”  To date, these USAID Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) funds have provided direct support through competitive grants for innovative people-to-people conflict mitigation and reconciliation programs in at least 36 countries, including those in the Middle East.  So successful have these grants been that, since FY 2008, a dedicated component of the global fund has been reserved for programs in Israel and the Palestinian territories, thus ensuring key funding for Middle East projects vital to stabilizing the region, while preserving funding for other conflict areas.  Since FY 2010, Congress has provided US $10 million annually (£6 million) to this end.  USAID manages the Middle East reconciliation grant program through its Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM).  NGOs apply directly to USAID for grants and USAID distributes the funds through a competitive process.  These grants “provide opportunities for adversaries to come together to address issues, reconcile differences, and gain understanding and mutual trust by working toward common goals.” 8)                             ALLMEP member organizations, competitors for and recipients of the USAID CMM grants, are on the front lines of the Middle East conflict.  These organizations turn the challenges of daily life into opportunities for cooperation and, in so doing, lay the groundwork for any sustainable peace.  Every day, they tackle the spectrum of challenges and opportunities inherent in the region, engaging thousands of people on the ground in cooperative projects, breaking down barriers and stereotypes, and changing attitudes, while at the same time building trust and laying a foundation for lasting peace.  These programs provide respect and dignity, hope and understanding, cooperation and reconciliation – elements often missing in conflict situations, but without which, resolution is impossible.  In the ebb and flow of diplomacy, the ups and downs of the peace process, these NGOs are a constant:  they are on the ground modeling what Israeli and Palestinian politicians in the area have failed to achieve – tangible, concrete examples of what peace can look like.  9)                             As examples:  These groups help Jewish settlers and their Palestinian neighbors open constructive interfaith dialogue; they engage Israelis and Palestinians who have lost loved ones in the conflict to talk about non-violence; they create soccer and basketball leagues engaging tens of thousands of kids, who learn teamwork and cooperation with new friends from the “other side”; they pair Israeli and Palestinian villages to share environmental resources, since water knows no borders; they bring together Israelis and Palestinians to cooperate in medicine, business, and education; they expose Israelis and Arabs to positive and human images of one another through TV shows and films; and they mobilize hundreds of thousands to call on their leaders to work toward a two-state solution. 10)               These actions confirm that peace is no mirage, but an achievable reality.  When the peace process reaches closure – and it must – it will be these programs that have laid the groundwork and planted the seeds necessary to support a successful outcome.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]Evidence of Success11)               In fact:  these programs work.  Rigorous analyses and evaluation by USAID conclusively demonstrate greater trust; enhanced cooperation; increased “conflict resolution values”; decreased aggression and loneliness; and mitigation of hazardous environmental and health conditions between project participants from opposing sides of the conflict.  An in-progress, comprehensive evaluation of the Reconciliation Program by USAID is expected to provide even more data upon completion later this year.12)               Not only is there empirical data to validate the success of people-to-people programs, but participants themselves are acutely aware of the tremendous benefits that are realized through funding of people-to-people NGOs:

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;These personalized accounts – and there are countless more – of successful people-to-people reconciliation efforts made possible through CMM grants underscore the critical need for funding to ensure that the progress of peace continues, including through the British Conflict Pool.13)               This “track II diplomacy” is a critical foreign policy tool in addressing the Middle East conflict.  Without building grassroots support for peace, as these projects do, political peace agreements in the Middle East may never arrive and cannot endure.  Thus, bolstering nascent peace agreements through people-to-people efforts is critical to long-term stability, democracy and growth in the region.  It will be these programs that will enable the success of any diplomatic solution.  14)               In addition, these P2P projects give the often-silent two-thirds majorities on both sides, who support a two-state solution in poll after poll, tangible ways to work toward that better tomorrow.  They prove “there is a partner.” These people-to-people programs bolster diplomatic efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by establishing grounds for cooperation and existence and building grassroots constituencies for peace on both sides

[[[&#xa0;]]]That groundwork must be laid first, to hasten an agreement and to give it the best possible chance of success.  Projects underway at this very moment confirm that these people can successfully work together across borders and conflict lines, developing true professional and personal relationships. Ultimately, the programs provide a mechanism for people on both sides to overcome stereotypes and accept each other’s right to live in peace.&#xa0;Conclusion15)               There can be little doubt that people-to-people programs have broad, positive implications for long-term stability and a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.  The United States investment, although substantial, is not sufficient; a similar commitment to such programs through the British Conflict Pool – and ultimately through an International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace – is essential.   Additionally, NGOs like those supported by USAID – those engaged in P2P programming – should be supported by the entirety of funds in the Conflict Pool.  ALLMEP urges British officials to visit these hopeful and inspiring programs, and stands ready to assist the Committee in any way possible.  Thank you for this opportunity.                                          - 9 -www.allmep.org Data provided by Foreign Minister for the Middle East, 25th November 2013.  Given our lack of expertise, ALLMEP offers no evidence regarding the administration of the Conflict Pool overall.  Our testimony will imply that there are additional and different NGOs – those directly engaged in P2P work by contrast to protest and campaigns – that would benefit from these funds. Similarly, we cannot comment on the experience of NGOs endeavoring to access British government funds:  our expertise there lies with the US government.  Neil A.
