[[[reforms to legal aid]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“Karen Buck (Westminster North, Labour): To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether his estimate of potential savings in the legal aid budget assumes a potential increase in costs to the court system arising from additional numbers of litigants in person.&#xa0;“Jeremy Wright (Kenilworth and Southam, Conservative): …….While the reforms may result in an increase in numbers of litigants in person (LiPs), it is not immediately evident that this will result in increased costs for the courts. The impact assessment which accompanied the Act set out a number of actions that the MOJ will, and is now, taking to monitor the impacts on the courts” (emphasis added)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Residence test and immigration detention]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;The ‘Transforming Legal Aid’ consultation exercise (2013) invited opinions on the proposal for a residence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to those with a “strong connection” with the UK.  The subsequent consultation “Transforming Legal Aid: Next Steps”, which closes on 18th October 2013, introduces a number of additional exceptions to the residence test.  The consultation document states: &#xa0;“We have also concluded that there are further limited circumstances where applicants for civil legal aid on certain matters of law would not be required to meet the residence test. The test will therefore not apply to categories of case which broadly relate to an individual’s liberty, where the individual is particularly vulnerable or where the case relates to the protection of children” (MoJ, 2013)&#xa0;&#xa0;“1. Detainees making applications [release on] immigration bail2. Detainees making applications for [release on] temporary admissionBoth these situations will be exempt from the residence test, where they qualify for funding under&#xa0;paragraphs 5, 20, 25, 26 and 27&#xa0;of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to LASPO.&#xa0; Challenges to the lawfulness of detention by way of judicial review under paragraph 19, will also be exempt.Detainees who wish to make civil claims to challenge the legality of their detention after having been released.These types of proceeding, which are funded under paragraph 22 of schedule 1&#xa0;to&#xa0;LASPO,&#xa0;will not be exempt from the residence test.” (Ministry of Justice, 2013)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Case study: Beth and Daniel Beth’s grandfather, who was caring for her and her disabled brother Daniel during their mother’s detention, became seriously ill and was admitted to hospital three times. Beth had to stop attending school to care for her brother and grandfather and missed her GCSE exams.   Beth found it extremely difficult to look after her seven year old brother, was has limited motor control and severe behavioural problems. Children’s Services deemed Daniel to be at risk of emotional and physical harm, and found that: ‘Daniel has found it very difficult being separated from his mother…  [A] concerned neighbour rang to report that Daniel was playing alone in the road at 8pm... he walks into people’s houses.’  &#xa0;Two months into his mother’s detention Daniel was hit by a car.  Despite receiving reports about the welfare of these children, the Home Office detained their mother for 160 days before she was released on bail by the Tribunal. The Home Office subsequently awarded the family compensation for the mother’s detention. Under the proposed residence test, this mother would not have been able to access Legal Aid for her civil claim challenging the legality of her detention.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Exceptional Funding]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“Unlike the State’s own nationals, foreigners have to meet a further, exceptional, test. It is not enough that they have legal rights, legal merits and the absence of means. They must show that the refusal of funding in their individual case is itself a violation of the Human Rights Act 1998 or EU law. That is unequal treatment which is unjustifiable. The prohibition does not focus on legitimacy of the resort to the Court, the nature of the issue, the viability of the argument. Being a foreigner does not indicate a lesser need, or a lesser justification, for effective access to the Court” (LIBERTY, 2013)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“To deny legal aid altogether to such persons, so that even the minimal rights provided to them by the law cannot be enforced, is in our view unconscionable”. &#xa0;

[[[Trafficked people in detention ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;If not, the proposal to introduce a residence test should at the very least be subject to full Parliamentary scrutiny. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Judicial review]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;“Tackl[ing] the burden that the growth in unmeritorious judicial reviews has placed on stretched public services…. In this paper the Government sets out a series of further reforms which, it states, seek to address three interrelated issues: i. the impact of judicial review on economic recovery and growth, ii. The inappropriate use of judicial review as a campaign tactic, iii. The use of the delays and costs associated with judicial review to hinder actions the executive wishes to take.” (MoJ, 2013: 6-7)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“The Government is concerned by the use of unmeritorious applications for judicial review to delay, frustrate, or discourage legitimate executive action” (MoJ, 2013: 7 iii))&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[reviews to challenge removal from the UK]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Case studyFaith was detained with her partner for 206 days after serving a prison sentence. Her four children were aged between one and 11 when she went to prison; the eldest child was a British Citizen. The children were extremely distressed, and some of them developed behavioural and health problems.  &#xa0;Three months into her detention, the Home Office wrote to Faith and her partner informing them that they intended to remove the parents and children together. The family had been separated for two years and five months. The Home Office noted the need for the children to ‘re-establish their relationship with their parents before removal,’ and envisaged that this might happen at Heathrow Airport. It is extremely concerning to see that the Home Office thought it would be appropriate to reunite these extremely distressed children with their parents during the course of their forced removal. This removal attempt was cancelled, and the Home Office arranged a new date for the family to be removed using the same method, but this was prevented by a Judicial Review application. The parents were subsequently released from detention and granted leave to remain in the UK. &#xa0;
