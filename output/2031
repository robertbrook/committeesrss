[normal]Diana [bold]Mallinson[bold] – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I am writing in support of the amendments to this bill proposed by the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA), the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA), the Green Lanes Environmental Action Movement (GLEAM) and the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am a member of the first three organisations and work as a volunteer for them researching the history of “lost ways”, green lanes which are public rights of way but whose status – footpath, bridleway or byway open to all traffic (BOAT) is unknown, because they are not on the definitive map of public rights of way.   The process of adding lost ways to the definitive map will be simplified by proposals (clauses 12-18 and Schedule 6) already included in the draft Deregulation Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]But at present there is a very great disincentive for me and other researchers involved with these organisations. The vast majority of the routes we research are exempt from the extinguishment of public motor vehicular rights brought about by the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC), because they are on the “list of streets”, the list of highways maintainable at public expense.  If I find that a route has historic public vehicular rights because it was set out in an enclosure award in the 18
[normal]th
[normal] or 19
[normal]th
[normal] century as a route that the public could use with horse drawn vehicles, it will automatically, under the present law, becomes a BOAT and thus open to modern motor vehicles.   In other cases there may be no clear evidence as to whether the route has historic public vehicular, public bridleway or public footpath rights, so that the highway authority (or the Planning Inspectorate if the highway authority’s decision is disputed) has to make a decision on the basis of the balance of probability.   It is also possible that modern use by 4x4s and motorbikes may be sufficient for such routes to become BOATs, even if historically they were only bridleways or footpaths.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am aware that there are many green lanes in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the Peak District National Park which have historic public rights for horse-drawn vehicles, and which, being on the list of streets, are not protected by NERC.  But many of these were never maintained even for use by horse and cart, and were probably little used by such vehicles, being superseded by alternative routes tarmaced in the 20
[normal]th
[normal] century.  An example is Deadman’s Hill (case study 4.2 in YDGLA’s submission) where horse-drawn vehicle use was probably only by the residents of the hamlets which it linked in Nidderdale and Coverdale.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An example of a route which is now a BOAT, but where the Planning Inspector found that “t
[normal]he evidence in support of
[normal] [it] 
[normal]being a vehicular highway is far from compelling
[normal]”, is Mill Lane, pictured in Appendix 2 of PDGLA’s submission.  This green lane used to be a popular walking and horse-riding route between the villages of Eyam and Stoney Middleton in the 
[normal]Peak District National Park.  As PDGLA says, local people now avoid it because of the risks of meeting motorised users.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is difficult to explain to local people, who feel passionately about the damage and loss of amenity caused by off-roader use of local green lanes, why there is no point, under the current law, in opposing BOAT status where the historical evidence indicates or strongly suggests dedication for horse-drawn vehicles.  All I can do is advise them to campaign for a traffic regulation order, which they may (see the submission from Stoney Middleton Parish Council) already have been doing without success.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I therefore strongly support the amendments proposed by YDGLA, PDGLA, GLEAM and GLPG, because they would make green lanes on the list of streets into restricted byways, in line with the historic use of most of such routes, and would make it easier for local communities to get traffic regulation orders on other green lanes.
