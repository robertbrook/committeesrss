[normal]CRIME STATISTICS[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for your letter of 6 December 2013 and the re
[normal]quest 
[normal]for information on crime statistics.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In my Police and Crime Plan
[normal] I have set 4 Police and Crime O
[normal]bjectives which are underpinned by 14 performance measures.  The
[normal]se measures will 
[normal]help 
[normal]indicate how well my objectives are being achieved.  The Chief Constable reports on performance against these measures to me at my bi-monthly Accountability and Performance Panel.  The measures are not targets per se but they are 
[normal]one 
[normal]of
[normal] the means by which I hold the Chief Constable to account for addressing performance.  I have attached a link to my Police and Crime Plan where you will see explained at pp27-29 the performance measures and the performance assessment framework.

[normal]Clearly the veracity of crime recording data i
[normal]s
[normal] impor
[normal]tant to me if I am going to 
[normal]gauge
[normal] the levels of performance in my Force’s area.  
[normal]It will be no surprise therefore that
[normal] I was concerned about recent statements 
[normal]made elsewhere about
[normal] the integrity of crime recording data
[normal].  
[normal]I immediately requested the Chief Co
[normal]nstable to reassure both myself and the public of Suffolk 
[normal]upon 
[normal]data quality by reporting to my 5 December Accountability and Performance Panel.  I have attached the link to th
[normal]e Chief Constable’s
[normal] report for your information.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I was pleased to note the detail of the processes set out
[normal] in the report and to hear direct from the Chief Constable as to the strong audit regime in Suffolk backed up by strong leadership.
[normal]  As a result
[normal],
[normal] I am as satisfied as I reasonably can be as to the integrity of Suffolk’s crime data quality.
