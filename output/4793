defaultThank you for your letter of 6 December 2013 and the re
defaultquest 
defaultfor information on crime statistics.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn my Police and Crime Plan
default I have set 4 Police and Crime O
defaultbjectives which are underpinned by 14 performance measures.  The
defaultse measures will 
defaulthelp 
defaultindicate how well my objectives are being achieved.  The Chief Constable reports on performance against these measures to me at my bi-monthly Accountability and Performance Panel.  The measures are not targets per se but they are 
defaultone 
defaultof
default the means by which I hold the Chief Constable to account for addressing performance.  I have attached a link to my Police and Crime Plan where you will see explained at pp27-29 the performance measures and the performance assessment framework.

defaultgauge
default the levels of performance in my Force’s area.  
defaultIt will be no surprise therefore that
default I was concerned about recent statements 
defaultmade elsewhere about
default the integrity of crime recording data
default.  
defaultI immediately requested the Chief Co
defaultnstable to reassure both myself and the public of Suffolk 
defaultupon 
defaultdata quality by reporting to my 5 December Accountability and Performance Panel.  I have attached the link to th
defaulte Chief Constable’s
default report for your information.

default&#xa0;
defaultI was pleased to note the detail of the processes set out
default in the report and to hear direct from the Chief Constable as to the strong audit regime in Suffolk backed up by strong leadership.
default  As a result
default,
default I am as satisfied as I reasonably can be as to the integrity of Suffolk’s crime data quality.
