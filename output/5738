defaultWritten evidence from 
defaultCllr. Roger Seabourne
default [PCC Progress 49]
default&#xa0;
defaultThe views expressed below are my personal observations of and participa
defaulttion in the Hertfordshire PC
defaultP
default, during its nascent year and 
defaultdo not 
defaultnecessarily reflect the views of the organisations I represent or
default apply to 
defaultother
default Panels.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have f
defaultocussed my comments 
defaultmainly 
defaulton 
defaultthe role of the PCP i
defaultn holding to account the PCC, which I consider to be far from satisfactory.  While I started from a position of not being supportive of the principle of an elected, political Police Commissioner, I am still open minded, waiting to be convinced of its 
defaultmerits;
default 
defaulthowever, I
default have serious concerns about 
defaultthe lack of clear guidance and 
defaultsome of the detail
default of the new governance arrangements
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1. 
defaultI believe there was 
defaulta lack of understanding about the role 
defaultand remit of the Panel by their office
defaultr
defaults and some members of the 
defaultPanel
default itself.
default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultt is 
defaultwidely 
defaultaccepted
default that PCPs 
defaultshould 
defaultperform a scrutiny function for PCCs by acting as a critical 
default“
defaultfriend
default”
default.   However, critical cronies tend not to do this and this invaluable assistance can be lost which leaves some PCCs seriously disadvantaged.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile it is now quite common for a scrutiny committee to be of a si
defaultmilar political make up as the E
defaultxecutive body they scrutinise, in my personal experience they learned very early on that it was in everyon
defaulte’s interest, particularly the E
defaultxecutive
default itself
default, for there to be robust scrutiny.  The PCP, perhaps because of its
default lack of understanding, 
defaultmake up or lack of balance
default,
default seemed to follow not so much a “light touch” scrutiny as a “light stroke”.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst I admire Paul Darby’s submission [PCC Progress 10] wishing “no PCC or his staff should be over-p
defaultolitically involved, if at all”, t
defaulthis might be rather ambitious if not impractical and n
defaultaïve.  I fully support his wish and
default his reasons
default 
defaultfor 
defaulthaving a co-opted member as Chair
default, this
default 
defaultwhile not perfect,
default would be more transparent and a considerable improvement on the current positi
defaulton
default. Particularly because
default they would be independent of the administrative officers and hopefully
default as well
default, more independent of the PCC.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn my experience, the P
defaultCP did not 
defaultfully 
defaultunderstand the role of a scrutiny panel, (
defaultalso 
defaultsee 4 below).  They were defensive towards questions from the public which then developed into a strong culture of denial 
defaultas
default more unanswered questions were followed 
defaultup by further more detailed, more probing 
defaultquestions.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PCP agreed to let the PCC have a 
defaultpublic 
defaultquestion &amp; answer session 
defaultat the start of Panel meetings
default allowing the public to scrutinise the PCC
default.  
defaultI considered 
defaultthis 
defaultto be inappropriate as this was the PCP’s l
defaultimited allocated time to do this
default, and the PCC 
defaultalready 
defaulthad ample opportunities elsewhere to engage directly with the public
default and could create as many more as he wished.  However, the PCP
default would not, on too many occasions, answer questions from the public themselves when 
defaultthey attempted
default to scrutinise the Panel.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere was a failure of the Panel to deal properly with and answer questions from members of the public, who were not shown the respect, courtesy and consideration they deserved.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs the year progressed 
defaultI be
defaultgan to see
default this was 
defaultmost likely 
defaultthe result of the over bearing influence of the administrative
default officers supporting the P
defaultCP.
default  
defaultIt
default 
defaultis also worth considering the point that there is a strong financial incentive and perhaps even a viability issue connected with 
defaultan
default authority (in a non unitary authority) remaining as 
defaultthe PCP’s 
defaulthost authority.  A
defaults with any culture, once it became established, it was difficult to change.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2. Each Panel has £53,000 of funding from the Home Office to support its Police and Crime Panel. I understand this figure was arrived at from the average funding required, with on-costs, to appoint a scrutiny officer.  Whilst I can see the logic of this in terms of setting a national budget referencing ‘market testing’ and comparative value for money, it bears no relation 
defaultwhatsoever t
defaulto the actual costs incurred to fund a system adequately in order for 
defaultit
default to be able to perform its functions, let alone perform them to a high or even acceptable standard.
default  
defaultIt would be some coincidence if the vastly differing sizes of Constabularies, geographical as well as numbers employed, with different sized PCC administrations all required exactly the same amount of funding to scrutinise such vastly differing budgets.  
defaultIt is 
defaultalso 
defaultincongruous for the PCP to scrutinise the PCC’s three year budgetary plan while not being able to have a one year plan for itself.  Funding needs to be decided
default, 
defaultsecured and 
defaultbe 
defaultpredicab
defaultle for at least the medium term, as is done in almost all other similar areas.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3. 
defaultIt is widely claimed and publicised that 
default“T
defaulthe public have the information they need to hold their PCC and force to account.”  Provided, of course, it is actually published.
defaultThe Government expects high standards of transparency and has set out the 
defaultinformation that PCCs must publish to support the public in effectively holding 
defaultthem to account. 
default 
defaultBy publically setting rates and requiring full publication of expenses quarterly the Government 
defaultbelieves it 
defaultis ensuring PCCs will be fair and transparent in cla
defaultiming expenses.   
default&#xa0;
defaultI understand and accept it is not the Government’s role to monitor compliance, 
defaultand 
defaultit is for the Chief Executive, as monitoring officer, to ensure that the PCC has complied with all legal duties.  
defaultHowever
default, if this does not occ
defaultur
default, and I witnessed that it did not,
default I 
defaultwas, and am still not
default convinced
default, 
defaulthaving a 
defaultP
defaultCP that has no powers or sanctio
defaultns to force compliance is valid, justified
default, helpful
default or useful.
default  
defaultT
defaulthe PCC 
defaultis required 
defaultto provide i
defaultnformation and answer questions, but there appears to be no recourse if non compliance is established.  I
defaultt would appear it would then be up to a member of
default the public (or perhaps the P
defaultCP?) to take legal action to ensure compliance, which cannot be expected to happen, not least because of the cost
default.  This is
default unacceptable.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe widely claimed and publicised belief is only credible if the information is actually published.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4. 
defaultThere 
defaultwas, and still is in Hertfordshire, a conflict of 
defaultinterest in members sitting on The County
default Community Safety Board with executi
defaultve powers, and sitting on the P
defaultCP to scrutinise decisions
default made by that Board
default, including the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the PCP.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.  There i
defaults a wide
defaultly held perception that the P
defaultCP has a v
defaulteto on 
defaultthe setting of the 
defaultprecept.  T
defaulthis is
default, in reality,
default not only misleading, but also erroneous
default and therefore dishonest
default as it only the first propo
defaultsal, and not the
default subsequent one, that can be vetoed.
default&#xa0;

default)

defaultRecent research has demonstrated that over 60% of people have now

default 
default(
defaultWrit
defaultten evidence from Kevin Hurley
default)
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a significant difference between “having heard of” and “knowing about”.
default 
defaultHowever, there is a huge gulf between “knowing one could go to a police authority with concerns about policing and crime” and “knowing about /
default 
defaulthaving heard of” PCCs.
default&#xa0;
defaultLeaving that aside, 
defaulti
defaultt is very misleadin
defaultg to claim “O
defaultnly 7% of people knew that they could go to their police authorities with concerns about policing and crime in their area while 
default6o%+ / 
default70% know about police and crime commiss
defaultioners”.
default  
defaultIt begs the question - 
defaultwhat has gone on that that has made people
default (more)
default aware of PCCs?
default  
defaultUnfortunately, the 
defaultcause of the raising of the level of awareness appears to be
default more the negative media reports concerning some of the quite outrageous conduct of a few PCCs
default 
defaultrather than the, no doubt, 
defaultsound
default work of the majority.

default. 
defaultWhist t
defaulthe local electorate 
defaulthas the option of 
defaultjudg
defaulting
default whether PCCs are making best use of public money and hold them
default to account at the ballot box, they have not given the indication that they intend to do so.  This not only does not ensure 
defaultPCCs are making 
defaultthe best use of public money, but also might, in reality, actively discourage it.
defaultBy not allowing each candidate the free
default 
defaultpost 
defaultthat candidates for M
defaultembers of Parliament enjoy, the importance of the post
default 
defaultof PCC 
defaultwas devalued in the electorates’ eyes and it contributed to the very low turnout.

default. I concur, from m
defaulty personal experience of one P
defaultCP, 
defaultwith the 
defaultLocal Government Association
default’s submission that “…..
defaultPanels have come to realise that the formal powers, such as they are, have at best been of little use

defaultThe appointment
defaults
default of Deputy PCC
defaults
default 
defaultin Hertfordshire (one post, two appointments
default following the resignation of the first incumbent
default) were
default, at best, poorly handled
default.  T
defaulthe public were left with the widespread perception that the PCC ha
defaultd appointed ‘one of his mates’, 
defaulttwice
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a strong case for 
defaultelecting a Deputy PCC at the same time and for the same term as the PCC.  
defaultThis would be more transparent and might, in some cases, even achieve a better political balance.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is also of note and some concern that the appointment of a Deputy PCC is subject to verification, 
defaultbut the appointment of
default 
defaultan “Assistant” PCC is not.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;

default0
default. 
defaultIt is inconsistent to give the PCP a significant 
defaultstatutory
default role in scrutinising their PCC’s decisions in respect of the appointment and the removal of a Chief Constable but not to be given the same 
defaultstatutory 
defaultresponsibility of scrutinising the PCC’s decision to extend or not to extend a Chief Constable’s fixed term appointment. 
defaultGiven the respective four and five year terms of office of PCCs and Chief Constables, a PCC 
defaulthaving serious concerns about the competence or performance of a 
defaultChief Constable 
defaultwhich warrants consideration of dismissal would
default, at certain points in the term,
default almost certainly be
default inclined
default to
defaultwards inertia, 
default‘let
defaultting
default the clock tick’
default and tolerating the situation thereby
default avoid
defaulting
default scrutiny
default rather than grasping the issue and dealing 
defaultwith it.
default  
default&#xa0;
default11. The legislation was rushed and the implementation even more so.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusion.
defaultIn the final analysis, it is the effectiveness of the police force and the level of crime and disorder that matters most.  I have seen nothing 
defaultin this new governance arrangement 
defaultthat raises either the general public
default’s
default perception of the police or the public’s expectations
default 
defaultof them.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn fact I believe
default 
defaultbecause of 
defaultthe adverse publicity some of the 
defaultPCCs
default’ antics have
default attracted, and as the public do tend, unfairly and unfortunately, to 
default‘lump them all together’, 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic confidence in the Police Force is lower now that it has been for some time.  That in itself is not only a very worrying aspect but also, more critically, makes 
defaultthe job of the police more difficult than it would otherwise be and 
defaultcrime reduction itself much more difficult to achieve.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs it seems unlikely the governance arrangements will be abolished, it requires some serious amendment and fine tuning in the light of the experience and evidence.
