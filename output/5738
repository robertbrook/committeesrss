[normal]Written evidence from 
[normal]Cllr. Roger Seabourne
[normal] [PCC Progress 49]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The views expressed below are my personal observations of and participa
[normal]tion in the Hertfordshire PC
[normal]P
[normal], during its nascent year and 
[normal]do not 
[normal]necessarily reflect the views of the organisations I represent or
[normal] apply to 
[normal]other
[normal] Panels.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have f
[normal]ocussed my comments 
[normal]mainly 
[normal]on 
[normal]the role of the PCP i
[normal]n holding to account the PCC, which I consider to be far from satisfactory.  While I started from a position of not being supportive of the principle of an elected, political Police Commissioner, I am still open minded, waiting to be convinced of its 
[normal]merits;
[normal] 
[normal]however, I
[normal] have serious concerns about 
[normal]the lack of clear guidance and 
[normal]some of the detail
[normal] of the new governance arrangements
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. 
[normal]I believe there was 
[normal]a lack of understanding about the role 
[normal]and remit of the Panel by their office
[normal]r
[normal]s and some members of the 
[normal]Panel
[normal] itself.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I
[normal]t is 
[normal]widely 
[normal]accepted
[normal] that PCPs 
[normal]should 
[normal]perform a scrutiny function for PCCs by acting as a critical 
[normal]“
[normal]friend
[normal]”
[normal].   However, critical cronies tend not to do this and this invaluable assistance can be lost which leaves some PCCs seriously disadvantaged.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While it is now quite common for a scrutiny committee to be of a si
[normal]milar political make up as the E
[normal]xecutive body they scrutinise, in my personal experience they learned very early on that it was in everyon
[normal]e’s interest, particularly the E
[normal]xecutive
[normal] itself
[normal], for there to be robust scrutiny.  The PCP, perhaps because of its
[normal] lack of understanding, 
[normal]make up or lack of balance
[normal],
[normal] seemed to follow not so much a “light touch” scrutiny as a “light stroke”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst I admire Paul Darby’s submission [PCC Progress 10] wishing “no PCC or his staff should be over-p
[normal]olitically involved, if at all”, t
[normal]his might be rather ambitious if not impractical and n
[normal]aïve.  I fully support his wish and
[normal] his reasons
[normal] 
[normal]for 
[normal]having a co-opted member as Chair
[normal], this
[normal] 
[normal]while not perfect,
[normal] would be more transparent and a considerable improvement on the current positi
[normal]on
[normal]. Particularly because
[normal] they would be independent of the administrative officers and hopefully
[normal] as well
[normal], more independent of the PCC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In my experience, the P
[normal]CP did not 
[normal]fully 
[normal]understand the role of a scrutiny panel, (
[normal]also 
[normal]see 4 below).  They were defensive towards questions from the public which then developed into a strong culture of denial 
[normal]as
[normal] more unanswered questions were followed 
[normal]up by further more detailed, more probing 
[normal]questions.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The PCP agreed to let the PCC have a 
[normal]public 
[normal]question &amp; answer session 
[normal]at the start of Panel meetings
[normal] allowing the public to scrutinise the PCC
[normal].  
[normal]I considered 
[normal]this 
[normal]to be inappropriate as this was the PCP’s l
[normal]imited allocated time to do this
[normal], and the PCC 
[normal]already 
[normal]had ample opportunities elsewhere to engage directly with the public
[normal] and could create as many more as he wished.  However, the PCP
[normal] would not, on too many occasions, answer questions from the public themselves when 
[normal]they attempted
[normal] to scrutinise the Panel.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There was a failure of the Panel to deal properly with and answer questions from members of the public, who were not shown the respect, courtesy and consideration they deserved.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As the year progressed 
[normal]I be
[normal]gan to see
[normal] this was 
[normal]most likely 
[normal]the result of the over bearing influence of the administrative
[normal] officers supporting the P
[normal]CP.
[normal]  
[normal]It
[normal] 
[normal]is also worth considering the point that there is a strong financial incentive and perhaps even a viability issue connected with 
[normal]an
[normal] authority (in a non unitary authority) remaining as 
[normal]the PCP’s 
[normal]host authority.  A
[normal]s with any culture, once it became established, it was difficult to change.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Each Panel has £53,000 of funding from the Home Office to support its Police and Crime Panel. I understand this figure was arrived at from the average funding required, with on-costs, to appoint a scrutiny officer.  Whilst I can see the logic of this in terms of setting a national budget referencing ‘market testing’ and comparative value for money, it bears no relation 
[normal]whatsoever t
[normal]o the actual costs incurred to fund a system adequately in order for 
[normal]it
[normal] to be able to perform its functions, let alone perform them to a high or even acceptable standard.
[normal]  
[normal]It would be some coincidence if the vastly differing sizes of Constabularies, geographical as well as numbers employed, with different sized PCC administrations all required exactly the same amount of funding to scrutinise such vastly differing budgets.  
[normal]It is 
[normal]also 
[normal]incongruous for the PCP to scrutinise the PCC’s three year budgetary plan while not being able to have a one year plan for itself.  Funding needs to be decided
[normal], 
[normal]secured and 
[normal]be 
[normal]predicab
[normal]le for at least the medium term, as is done in almost all other similar areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. 
[normal]It is widely claimed and publicised that 
[normal]“T
[normal]he public have the information they need to hold their PCC and force to account.”  Provided, of course, it is actually published.
[normal]The Government expects high standards of transparency and has set out the 
[normal]information that PCCs must publish to support the public in effectively holding 
[normal]them to account. 
[normal] 
[normal]By publically setting rates and requiring full publication of expenses quarterly the Government 
[normal]believes it 
[normal]is ensuring PCCs will be fair and transparent in cla
[normal]iming expenses.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I understand and accept it is not the Government’s role to monitor compliance, 
[normal]and 
[normal]it is for the Chief Executive, as monitoring officer, to ensure that the PCC has complied with all legal duties.  
[normal]However
[normal], if this does not occ
[normal]ur
[normal], and I witnessed that it did not,
[normal] I 
[normal]was, and am still not
[normal] convinced
[normal], 
[normal]having a 
[normal]P
[normal]CP that has no powers or sanctio
[normal]ns to force compliance is valid, justified
[normal], helpful
[normal] or useful.
[normal]  
[normal]T
[normal]he PCC 
[normal]is required 
[normal]to provide i
[normal]nformation and answer questions, but there appears to be no recourse if non compliance is established.  I
[normal]t would appear it would then be up to a member of
[normal] the public (or perhaps the P
[normal]CP?) to take legal action to ensure compliance, which cannot be expected to happen, not least because of the cost
[normal].  This is
[normal] unacceptable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The widely claimed and publicised belief is only credible if the information is actually published.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal]There 
[normal]was, and still is in Hertfordshire, a conflict of 
[normal]interest in members sitting on The County
[normal] Community Safety Board with executi
[normal]ve powers, and sitting on the P
[normal]CP to scrutinise decisions
[normal] made by that Board
[normal], including the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the PCP.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.  There i
[normal]s a wide
[normal]ly held perception that the P
[normal]CP has a v
[normal]eto on 
[normal]the setting of the 
[normal]precept.  T
[normal]his is
[normal], in reality,
[normal] not only misleading, but also erroneous
[normal] and therefore dishonest
[normal] as it only the first propo
[normal]sal, and not the
[normal] subsequent one, that can be vetoed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal]. 
[normal]“
[normal]In contrast, 7 in 10 people know about police and crime commissioners.
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]Written evidence from the
[normal] Home Office [PCC Progress 01]
[normal])
[normal]“
[normal]Recent research has demonstrated that over 60% of people have now 
[normal]heard of the PCC role.
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]Writ
[normal]ten evidence from Kevin Hurley
[normal])
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is a significant difference between “having heard of” and “knowing about”.
[normal] 
[normal]However, there is a huge gulf between “knowing one could go to a police authority with concerns about policing and crime” and “knowing about /
[normal] 
[normal]having heard of” PCCs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Leaving that aside, 
[normal]i
[normal]t is very misleadin
[normal]g to claim “O
[normal]nly 7% of people knew that they could go to their police authorities with concerns about policing and crime in their area while 
[normal]6o%+ / 
[normal]70% know about police and crime commiss
[normal]ioners”.
[normal]  
[normal]It begs the question - 
[normal]what has gone on that that has made people
[normal] (more)
[normal] aware of PCCs?
[normal]  
[normal]Unfortunately, the 
[normal]cause of the raising of the level of awareness appears to be
[normal] more the negative media reports concerning some of the quite outrageous conduct of a few PCCs
[normal] 
[normal]rather than the, no doubt, 
[normal]sound
[normal] work of the majority.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]. 
[normal]Whist t
[normal]he local electorate 
[normal]has the option of 
[normal]judg
[normal]ing
[normal] whether PCCs are making best use of public money and hold them
[normal] to account at the ballot box, they have not given the indication that they intend to do so.  This not only does not ensure 
[normal]PCCs are making 
[normal]the best use of public money, but also might, in reality, actively discourage it.
[normal]By not allowing each candidate the free
[normal] 
[normal]post 
[normal]that candidates for M
[normal]embers of Parliament enjoy, the importance of the post
[normal] 
[normal]of PCC 
[normal]was devalued in the electorates’ eyes and it contributed to the very low turnout.
[normal]  
[normal]Holding them to account in this way only works 
[normal]of course 
[normal]if they 
[normal]stand for 
[normal]r
[normal]e-election………..
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal]. I concur, from m
[normal]y personal experience of one P
[normal]CP, 
[normal]with the 
[normal]Local Government Association
[normal]’s submission that “…..
[normal]Panels have come to realise that the formal powers, such as they are, have at best been of little use
[normal]………………”
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal]. 
[normal]The appointment
[normal]s
[normal] of Deputy PCC
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]in Hertfordshire (one post, two appointments
[normal] following the resignation of the first incumbent
[normal]) were
[normal], at best, poorly handled
[normal].  T
[normal]he public were left with the widespread perception that the PCC ha
[normal]d appointed ‘one of his mates’, 
[normal]twice
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is a strong case for 
[normal]electing a Deputy PCC at the same time and for the same term as the PCC.  
[normal]This would be more transparent and might, in some cases, even achieve a better political balance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is also of note and some concern that the appointment of a Deputy PCC is subject to verification, 
[normal]but the appointment of
[normal] 
[normal]an “Assistant” PCC is not.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]0
[normal]. 
[normal]It is inconsistent to give the PCP a significant 
[normal]statutory
[normal] role in scrutinising their PCC’s decisions in respect of the appointment and the removal of a Chief Constable but not to be given the same 
[normal]statutory 
[normal]responsibility of scrutinising the PCC’s decision to extend or not to extend a Chief Constable’s fixed term appointment. 
[normal]Given the respective four and five year terms of office of PCCs and Chief Constables, a PCC 
[normal]having serious concerns about the competence or performance of a 
[normal]Chief Constable 
[normal]which warrants consideration of dismissal would
[normal], at certain points in the term,
[normal] almost certainly be
[normal] inclined
[normal] to
[normal]wards inertia, 
[normal]‘let
[normal]ting
[normal] the clock tick’
[normal] and tolerating the situation thereby
[normal] avoid
[normal]ing
[normal] scrutiny
[normal] rather than grasping the issue and dealing 
[normal]with it.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. The legislation was rushed and the implementation even more so.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion.
[normal]In the final analysis, it is the effectiveness of the police force and the level of crime and disorder that matters most.  I have seen nothing 
[normal]in this new governance arrangement 
[normal]that raises either the general public
[normal]’s
[normal] perception of the police or the public’s expectations
[normal] 
[normal]of them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In fact I believe
[normal] 
[normal]because of 
[normal]the adverse publicity some of the 
[normal]PCCs
[normal]’ antics have
[normal] attracted, and as the public do tend, unfairly and unfortunately, to 
[normal]‘lump them all together’, 
[normal]the 
[normal]public confidence in the Police Force is lower now that it has been for some time.  That in itself is not only a very worrying aspect but also, more critically, makes 
[normal]the job of the police more difficult than it would otherwise be and 
[normal]crime reduction itself much more difficult to achieve.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As it seems unlikely the governance arrangements will be abolished, it requires some serious amendment and fine tuning in the light of the experience and evidence.
