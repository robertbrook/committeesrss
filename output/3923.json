"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from POhWER [PHS0042]&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;\n1\n              \nThis submission is made by POhWER, an advocacy charity established over fifteen years ago by service users who felt unequal to the task of voicing concerns about decisions made by public bodies on matters that affected their day to day lives.\n&#xa0;\n2\n              \nWe provide NHS complaints advocacy services from the outset. We focus particularly on people who are vulnerable, distressed or drawn from the protected equality groups.\n&#xa0;\n3\n              \nLast year alone, we handled over 30,000 calls about the NHS complaints process to our information, advice and advocacy centre and provided over 4,000 people with direct advocacy support. We can draw on the experiences of all these clients to provide you with evidence based views on the Parliamentary and Health Service \nOmbudsman\n.\n&#xa0;\n4\n              \nOur focus in this submission is on the second tier of the NHS complaints handling process. \nT\nhe first tier \nwas designed with substantial complainant involvement and feedback from our clients suggests that it has the potential to deliver the \nkind of approach and the outcomes \nthey seek. However, it \nsuffers from poor implementation and has not kept pace with the recent NHS changes. \nUnfortunately our experience with the second tier, when cases are taken to the Ombudsman, is not so positive. This is particularly worrying in an organisation that is a specialist complaint handler.\n&#xa0;Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman&#xa0;\n5\n              \nSo far this year, since April 2013, 8% of our NHS cases were referred on to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO). In previous years, we have referred around 15% of cases to PHSO.\n The reason for this seems\n to be a growing reluctance to \nuse the Ombudsman service because of the experiences of others.\n&#xa0;\n6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur clients tell us that they have experienced the following problems:\n&#xa0;\nDelay&#xa0;7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe\n understand that\n in April 2013, PHSO changed its complaints process in order to be able to investigate more complaints. It also changed its senior management structure and is soon to make \nsignificant \nchanges to \nresources in \nthe structure below\n that level\n. The impact of the\nse changes for our clients appears to have \nbeen to lengthen the \ncomplaints \nprocess\n and make it \nless customer focused\n.\n \nW\ne understand that there are over 700 complaints being held in a backlog before a decision to investigate is even made.\n One client has been informed that PHSO will take 40 \ndays\n just\n to consider whether to \ninvestigate their complaint which mean\ns it will be mid-January before \nour client will hear from PHSO again. This is a long time for a client to \nknow whether their case is even going to be considered, let alone resolved. \nAnd if they are not being communicated with during the process\n (see below)\n, it can become extremely frustrating and upsetting for our clients.\n&#xa0;\nPoor service and bias in favour of bodies complained about&#xa0;\n8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClients tell their us that complaints are being paraphrased rather than conveyed to organisations ‘as put’ by the complainant: PHSO’s \ninterim casework policy and guidance – section 4: Proposals to investigate\n states that they scope what they are (and are not) proposing to investigate and that \na\n decision to narrow the scope of the complaint \nthat has been \nput to them is theirs. Our clients are reporting to us that this means that\n all too often\n \nPHSO does not address\n t\nhe issues they wanted consider\ned. C\nertain aspects \nare ignored and others are \ninterpreted wrongly or not stated clearly. In one case where our client objected to the summary of her complaint, her case was ‘withdrawn’ \nby PHSO \nas she would not consent for her truncated complaint to be sent to the Trust as her complaint.\n This\n appears to run against \nthe\n intention of the\n Health Service Ombudsman Act \nwhich states:\n&#xa0;\nProcedure in respect of investigations.\nE+W+S+N.I.(1)Where a Commissioner proposes to conduct an investigation pursuant to a complaint under \n[F1section 3(1)\n], he shall afford— \n(a)to the health service body concerned, and \n(b)to any other person who is alleged in the complaint to have taken or \nauthorised\n the action complained of, \nan opportunity to comment on \nany allegations contained in the complaint. \n&#xa0;\nThis surely means that PHSO should not paraphrase\n the meaning of a complaint or reduce it to what they think t\nhey can achieve.\n \nAt the very least they need to explain to complainants why they feel no worthwhile outcome can be obtained on the aspects that they propose not to investigate so that complainants have a chance to challenge this.  By the time they have reached the Ombudsman, most complainants are battle weary. They would not be pursuing the case if they did not feel a strong sense of injustice.  The Ombudsman is their last hope –  surely incumbent on her to do her best to investigate or explain fully why she feels there is nothing useful to be achieved.\n&#xa0;\n9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLack of openness with the complainant: clients tell us that documents that form part of the investigation are shared\n only \nwith bodies\n complained about\n. As a result, complainants cannot confirm whether the information from the body is correct or complete. The impact of this is that complainants feel the process is biased towards the \norganisation complained about\n and that their views are insignificant \nin\n the whole process.\n&#xa0;\n10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPoor communication:\n many of our clients tell us that they are only contacted at the beginning and end of the process but \nnot on an on going \nbasis\n. Therefore, they have no idea about the progress of their complaint, nor are they given an opportunity to clarify or comment on the responses received by the body until the \ndraft report is written. T\nhis is \nusually \ntoo late as the Ombudsman is \nfrequently\n unwilling to accept new information or evidence at this stage.\n&#xa0;\n11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLack of integration: many of our client’s complaints \ncross the\n health and social care \nboundaries\n. PHSO does not have the remit to investigate social care complaints and therefore our clients then either need to deal with two Ombudsmen or have their complaint investigated as a ‘joint investigation’. As the two Ombudsmen sit in different locations, have different processes and different remits, this makes it very difficult for our clients and all the problems stated above are exacerbated.\n \n&#xa0;\n12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLack of impact: PHSO’s own figures show \nthat, in 2012-2013, they received over 24,000 complaints about the NHS or Government departments. Of these, they completed 384 investigations which \nwas\n less than 2% of all complaints received. Therefore, the learning from complaints is limited to a relatively small number of complaints and the impact is minimised.  \nAs noted earlier, this poor level of impact is a key factor in clients ’decisions not to take their case to PHSO. \n&#xa0;\nPHSO and Advocacy&#xa0;13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur experience shows that advice and advocacy services provide an important and independent link between the service provider and the client. We provide our clients with the confidence and tools to voice their concerns and to ensure improvements are made as a result. \n&#xa0;\n14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdvocacy and advice can support a complainant, help PHSO with its communication and ensure that the process is balanced and fair. \nWe believe PHSO could benefit from creating stronger links with advice and advocacy providers \nwho are trained in this field. \nA survey conducted by PHSO in 2\n011 and shared with ICAS providers showed that of all the advice and advocacy organisations they surveyed\n,\n knowledge of PHSO and a good understanding of the service it provided was very significantly higher\n in the NHS complaints advocacy service\n than in other advice and advocacy agencies. \nFurthermore, the take up rate for health cases supported by \nspecialist NHS complaints advocates\n is three times that of the general PHSO take up rate. \n&#xa0;\n15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrently PHSO provides a link on its website to an organisation calling itself ‘NHS Advocacy Services’. Not only is this link b\nuried in the site and fails to\n appear when you search the site using the term ‘advocacy’, it also links to only one \nadvocacy provider\n cover\ns only a limited part \nof England. This discriminates against vulnerable clients in all other geographical areas and causes \nconfusion for the complainant as there is no signposting to providers in their area. \n We have also not been able to meet with the Ombudsman in over a year to discuss how we can work together for the benefit of complainant\n.\n&#xa0;\nWhat would make PHSO better?&#xa0;\n16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe feel that PHSO \nwould benefit from\n the following.\n&#xa0;\n17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBeing more customer focused. A\nt POhWER\n,\n we ensure we contact our clients on a regular basis, to keep them updated and to \nensure they clearly understand what is \nhappening\n. We also ensure that there is complete transparency and share documentation with our clients whenever possible.\n PHSO would be better if it improved its communication and openness with complainants.\n&#xa0;18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHaving an external review of its processes. C\nurrently \nPHSO’s process\n appears to have lengthened the time to investigate, introduced more delays for customers, shows bias towards the body complained about and \ndoes not investigate the complaint as stated\n.\n \n An external review of PHSO’s new process\n, perhaps involving complainants,\n and determining whether it is actually bringing any benefits to complainants or delivering value for money would be beneficial.\n \n&#xa0;19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHaving an integrated approach to health and social care complaints. A \nsingle health and social care investigation process which is clearly signposted and consistent across the boundaries\n, mirroring the process at tier 1 would be far more efficient than the current arrangements.\n \n&#xa0;20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMaking better use of advice and advocacy services, and doing more to support vulnerable people. Engaging more with advice and advocacy services and better signposting to these providers on their website\n would benefit PHSO, the body being investigated and the complainant and give everyone\n – and especially vulnerable people - \nan opportunity to make their voice heard.\n This would also reflect the recognition afforded to advocacy support in the Francis Report, the Government’s response and the Clwyd Hart Review.\n  PHSO might also wish to reflect on the lack of advocacy support for people with Parliamentary complaints.  Many of these complainants are drawn from the most vulnerable and distressed populations in the country and the absence of active lobbying for support for their needs (despite evidence of the effectiveness of advocacy).\n&#xa0;21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHaving a regional presence rather than a national focus. As the NHS has changed and there is a greater emphasis on regional or local knowledge, PHSO would benefit from regional \ninvestigators, \nwith greater knowledge and awareness of issues in their area.  This would grow the expertise of the investigators of the bodies within their area and they would be more likely to spot the systemic issues arising on a regional basis than a national one.\n&#xa0;\n22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe hope that the Select Committee finds this information \nof use for its inquiry into the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. There is a great deal more we can say and would be very pleased to assist in any way we can.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
