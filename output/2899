[normal]Malaria Consortium is one of the world's leadin
[normal]g organisations dedicated to
[normal] comprehensive malaria
[normal] and neglected tropical disease control and child health
[normal] in Africa and Southeast Asia. As an international non-governmental organisation, we undertake programmes in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, 
[normal]surveillance, operational research and health 
[normal]system strengthening in Nigeria, Uganda, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Mozambique, 
[normal]Ghana, Senegal, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar
[normal]. While malaria control is at the heart of our strategy, we also
[normal] undertake complementary
[normal] work on
[normal] child health including
[normal] integrated community case management of childhood illness (ICCM)
[normal], malnutrition
[normal] and the control of 
[normal]n
[normal]eglected 
[normal]t
[normal]ropical 
[normal]d
[normal]iseases (NTDs).
[normal] Our 
[normal]concentration
[normal] is
[normal] on improving access to care for the poorest and most marginalised in society, including women, children and ethnic minorities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Malaria Consortium 
[normal]welcomes the opportunity to
[normal] have
[normal] input into this 
[normal]important inquiry. We have focussed our submission on those aspects of democracy and development in Myanmar that relate specifically to health, 
[normal]the 
[normal]area of our organisationâ€™s primary
[normal] expertise.
[normal] Our organisation refers to Myanmar/Burma as Myanmar and so for the purpose of this submission we shall use this title.
