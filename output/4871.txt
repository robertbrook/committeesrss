[[[]]]]&#xa0;In response  to the Home  Affairs Committee's ongoing  inquiry into the United Kingdom's   counter-tenor  efforts,  I  write  to  encourage  the  Committee   to  examine programs that help identify individuals attempting to travel abroad to join al Qaeda and wage jihad.   As recent events have demonstrated,  one of the most significant challenges facing  Western  states  in  the fight  against  al Qaeda  is stemming  the flow  of  foreign fighters  who attempt to fight alongside  al Qaeda's affiliates in Syria, Somalia, Yemen, and other parts of the world.&#xa0;On  August  22,  2013,  then-Director  of  the  United  States  Federal  Bureau  of Investigation (FBI) Robert C. Mueller publicly reported that citizens of the United States had  travelled  to  Syria  to  fight  with  rebel  groups  attempting  to  overthrow  the  Assadregime. It is also no secret that many of the factions fighting in Syria are allied with alQaeda. In fact,  one of  the largest  and most lethal  rebel  groups, the  al-Nusra Front, is officially   considered   a  terrorist  organization   by   both   the   British   and   American governments, as well as the United Nations (U.N.), and is widely considered anal Qaeda affiliate.&#xa0;This presents a threat to every country fighting violent  Islamist extremists. The danger is exemplified  by the several incidents of British and American citizens charged with ties to terrorist groups acting in Syria over the past year. An American woman fromFlint, Michigan  was killed while fighting  in Syria in May. In February, a British man died  battling  the  Assad  regime  as  a  member  of  a group  of  Sunni  extremist  foreignfighters. Video  of his group,  the Katiba al-Muhajireen  (the Battalion of the Migrants), released  in June shows  individuals from several  European  countries, as well as Canada and the United States fighting Assad 's forces near western Aleppo.  They are only one of the many armed groups allied with al Qaeda's  Islamic State of Iraq and al Nusra Front wings.&#xa0;The security vacuum within Syria and the relative ease with which individuals can cross the Syrian  border makes  it difficult  to track the movements  of jihadi fighters or determine  their exact numbers and identities. This problem  is compounded  by the fact that, according to British Foreign Secretary William Hague, "there is enough uncontested space  in Syria  for some  violent  Islamist  groups  to provide  extensive  training.  This  is particularly  concerning  as we assess some of the individuals  being trained will seek to carry out attacks against Western  interests  in the region or in Western states, now or inthe  future."  The  Chairman  of  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives  Permanent  SelectCommittee  on Intelligence  (of which  I am a member) has also acknowledged  that, "at some point all of these people from Europe are going home. All the folks there from all over the world, including the United States, will be coming home if they do not meet their end on the battlefield."&#xa0;As   Chairman   of  Committee   on  Homeland   Security   in  the  U.S.  House  of Representatives during  the 112th  Congress,  I  held a series of  hearings  to examine  the danger of homegrown Islamist extremists in the United States. My Committee found thatdozens of Americans  have travelled abroad to join al Qaeda to fight and train in multiple spots around the globe. Not only did these individuals in some cases attempt to return to the United States, but many became leaders within al Qaeda in their own right - gaining a reputation on the battlefield as was the case with Omar Hammami  in Somalia, or using their knowledge of Western society to spread al Qaeda's  message like Anwar al-Awlaki.&#xa0;While  we can only  estimate,  most  experts  suggest  that the  number  of foreign fighters allied with al Qaeda's groups in Syria is a significant figure. Many report there are at least several hundred overall, with perhaps as many as 100 British citizens linking­up with primarily al Qaeda-backed  groups. For the United States, the figure  is slightlysmaller. According  to one report from July of this year, there are now more Westernersin  Syria  than  there  have  been  in  other  conflicts  involving  al  Qaeda-linked   extremist groups in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia or Yemen.&#xa0;It appears that most foreigners hoping to join the jihad in Syria move south into the country from Turkey. According  to the United States Congressional Research Service (CRS), most foreign fighters prefer travel via Turkey (and northern Lebanon)  because of "better   regional  air-travel   linkages   with  Beirut  and  Turkish  cities." In  fact,  one international airport in Adana, Turkey has international flights to multiple destinations in Germany, and sits only a few hours drive from the Syrian border near Aleppo.&#xa0;As was demonstrated  recently  in Kenya, where individuals  from several Western countries, including Americans and Britons, reportedly took part in an al Shabaab assault on a  major shopping  mall  in Nairobi, this  is a  pressing  challenge.  Combatting  it  will require a joint, sophisticated  effort on the part of countries such as the United Kingdom and United States. A solution demands a strategy to counter extremism that identifies the threat that violent  Islamist  extremism  poses; coordination  between national  intelligence and law enforcement  agencies and local law enforcement; proactive assistance  from local communities  most susceptible to radicalization and recruitment by al Qaeda; intelligence sharing  and assistance  among foreign pa1tners; and rigorous  oversight  to ensure regular evaluation  and  constant  improvement.  Therefore,  as  your  Committee  carries out  this investigation,  I encourage  you to further study  how best to prevent the citizens  of ours and other countries  from  travelling  to fight with al Qaeda, and  how we can track  and prosecute those that do.&#xa0;Furthermore,  the  willingness  to  travel  to  terror  safe  havens  and  join  violent Islamist   extremist   groups,   even  when  these   attempts   are  unsuccessful,   should   be considered an indicator that these individuals are capable of carrying out attacks in their home  countries,   as  in  the  case  of  the  Woolwich  attackers,  one  of  who  reportedlyattempted  to  join  al Shabaab  in 2010, and  in the  case  of Tamerlan  Tsarnaev. Somereports suggest that Tsarnaev's travel to Russia in early 2012 was an attempt to meet with violent  extremists  in the Caucuses. Both of these individuals  would  return  home  and subsequently  murder innocent victims in the name of jihad.&#xa0;My colleagues  and I in the United States Congress  are grateful our country has reliable partners and good friends in the United Kingdom. We eagerly await the results of your investigation,  because the questions  the Home Affairs Committee  is attempting  to answer are of vital importance  to the U.S., as well as to the U.K.&#xa0;Please, do not hesitate to let my office know if we can be of any further assistanceto your effort.&#xa0;Chairman Peter T kingMember of CongressSeptember 2013
