[[[Executive Summary]]]1.1The evidence-base on disability and development needs to be improved in order to better understand the magnitude and types of disabilities, the impact of disability, and the most effective strategies for including people with disabilities in development initiatives. &#xa0;1.2Improving the evidence on the magnitude and types of disability, as well as the broad ranging impact of disability, will make an invisible group more visible, and identify key targets for programme planning.&#xa0;1.3Research is needed to strengthen the evidence base for “what works” in development programmes involving disability, including assessment of cost-effectiveness, in order to allocate scarce resources efficiently.&#xa0;1.4Consensus needs to be improved on the measurement of disability, so that these data can be collected more frequently and consistently to allow data disaggregation and to monitor trends over time.&#xa0;1.5Quantitative data need to be combined with qualitative data to ensure that disabled people are enabled to speak in their own voice and identify the service gaps that affect them. &#xa0;

[[[International Centre for Evidence in Disability]]]2.1This submission is being made by the International Centre for Evidence in Disability, based within the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. Our mission is to work in partnership to improve health and well-being among persons with disabilities through excellence in research, teaching and knowledge translation. Our research focuses on improving the evidence base on global disability and health, to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of disability inclusive development.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.2We work closely with NGOs, including many members of the BOND Disability and Development Group such as CBM, Sightsavers, and Handicap International as well as non-disability focused organisations such as PLAN International.&#xa0;3.

[[[The Inquiry]]]3.1We would like to use this opportunity to welcome this inquiry and to applaud DFID’s commitment to strengthening disability inclusion in their work. Moreover, we believe that this inquiry is of fundamental importance given the calls of the UN General Assembly, during a High Level Meeting on Disability and Development in September 2013, that all stakeholders urgently prioritise disability inclusive development with disability-targeted actions. &#xa0;&#xa0;4

[[[Knowledge gaps]]]4.1The World Report on Disability, produced by the World Health Organisation and the World Bank, highlights important gaps in our knowledge on disability. This includes robust data on the magnitude and types of disabilities, the impact of disability and the most effective strategies to improving quality of life of people with disabilities and for disability inclusive development. This report made recommendations to “improve disability data collection” and “strengthen and support research on disability”. 4.2In our work, we believe that these knowledge gaps exist with respect to disability overall, as well as for specific types of impairment (hearing, vision, physical, cognitive) and disability as a result of mental health conditions. The lack of data on disability limits opportunities for effective service planning, early intervention and maximisation of quality of life for persons with disabilities.&#xa0;&#xa0;4.3We therefore welcome DFID’s call for improvements to global data on disability.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Recommendations]]]5.1We believe that improvements in global data on disability are needed in four key areas: impact of disability, “what works”, measurement of disability and a mixed methods approach.&#xa0;5.2Research is needed to document the impact of disability on the lives of people and their families. This is needed in order to make an invisible group more visible, as well as to identify where programmes should be focussed. Impact could be measured in terms of inclusion in education and employment, access to health care, poverty and well-being, among others. As an example, our recent study “Include Us”, undertaken with Plan International, highlighted that children with disabilities were much less likely to attend school than children without disabilities across 30 countries. This shows that their rights set out in the UNCRPD are not being met, and indicates a clear target for intervention.&#xa0;5.3We also need to strengthen the evidence base on ‘what works’ in development programmes involving disability. This is to ensure that programme implementers are working in the optimal way to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities and their families. ‘What works’ can be measured in terms of positive change after implementation of the intervention. This includes assessment of the cost-effectiveness of interventions in order to provide data for efficient allocation of funds to maximise positive impact with the resources available. As an example, we are developing a participatory evaluation methodology for the assessment of Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) programmes. This will allow better evaluation of CBR programmes in order to identify the recipe for success and positive impact. &#xa0;5.4We applaud the call for data disaggregation as this will allow measurement of the impact of a broad range of interventions on people with disabilities, as well as the particular needs of people with different types of disabilities (different functional impairments, different levels of severity, multiple impairments). Not only do measures of disability need to be included in censuses and surveys for data disaggregation to be possible, but in-depth assessment of the prevalence of different impairments and appropriate interventions to improve quality of life in different settings should also be encouraged. Consensus needs to be improved on the measurement of disability, so that these data can be collected more frequently and consistently as well as allowing data disaggregation and comparison between countries and over time. Further work is needed to this end.&#xa0;5.5Quantitative data provide a clear and objective picture of the impact of disability and of development initiatives. However, these quantitative data need to be combined with qualitative data to allow full exploration of the issues (e.g. barriers and facilitators to inclusion) and to ensure that the voices of disabled people are captured in the research produced. As an example from our work, we quantitatively assessed the barriers to the uptake of medical services, and explored the reasons for these barriers in more detail through in-depth interviews. More such studies are needed.&#xa0;&#xa0; World Health Organization, World Report on Disability, Geneva, 2011. Include Us!
