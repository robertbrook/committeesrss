Written evidence from Doreen (LTC 29)defaultLymphoedema
default&#xa0;
defaultLong term condition
default&#xa0;
defaultI am 59 and suffered with 
defaultlychin
default 
defaultschrosis
default 
defaultmost of my adult life which unfortunately turned to cancer of the vulva 3 years ago. I
default 
defaulthad a radical surgery and had all my lymph glands
default in my groin removed.
default 
defaultI
default 
defaultnow have secondary 
defaultlymphoedema
default i
defaultn my groin and legs.
default 
defaultMy cancer has gone but left with this awful condition which needs to be controlled every day.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen in hospital was given a sheet of paper with dos and 
defaultdonts
default 
defaultabout 
defaultlymphoedema
default. 
defaultThese were very upsetting re: not have very hot bath, not to shave legs, not to get stung on leg due to contacting 
defaultceluitis
default,
default not to have injections in legs etc.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy cancer nurse who was on the telephone at my beck and call was marvellous as was my Doctor, nothing was too much trouble for them both to help me in any way.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultHad
default pain in groin and was
default 
defaulttold to telephone 
defaultlymphoedema
default department in Dorchester
default 
defaultHospital.
default 
defaultYou leave a message and
default 
defaultsomeone gets back to you straight away as this condition can be very serious if things go wrong.
default 
defaultHad appointment
default 
defaultand had legs measured and told had 
defaultlymphoedema
default and stockings were ordered as did not want tights as very hard to put on and have arthritis coming in
default 
defaultfingers.
default 
defaultWas not impressed with the nurses manner, which was hard luck
default, wear your compression garments and what
default’
defaults the matter with them, and
default 
defaultyou just have to get on with it. 
defaultI go every 6 months and earlier if need be, have my legs measured to see if condition has got worse and every time I come away I feel really down and cry.
defaultI feel like an old woman trussed up with all that I have t
defaulto wear to keep the fluid moving.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the 
defaultlymphodema
default department there are hundreds of leaflets on breast care but a 
defaulthandful
default about the condition
default 
defaultin your legs.
default&#xa0;
defaultI am a member of 
defaultlymphoedema
default support group ( yearly subscription fee) and surf the net for any information and guidance for help for this condition.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultMy daughter was talking to her friend about my condition and she recommended a friend of hers who does massage for this condition.
default 
defaultShe has been my life saver, told me so many things to do to help my condition.
default 
defaultI go to her privately every month for massage which is keeping it under control.
default 
defaultI would go more 
defaultfrequently
default but lost my job after my operation and cannot afford to go more regularly as it costs £70 but I get a discount
default 
defaultfor £50.
default 
defaultBefore Christmas had a very stressful time with my Mother in Law and sadly she died.
default 
defaultI had fluid build up all around my breasts which was so painful and needed to wear vest like compression to push fluid away.
default 
defaultApparently
default stress can cause this 
defaultand Christine my
default 
defaultmassage lady was really worried about my 
defaultcondition
default as it can affect your breathing.
default 
defaultI
default 
defaultnow wear bra to bed to help this condition.
default&#xa0;
defaultI hate the summer as its harder to hide my compression garments and its very uncomfortable if I do not wear them and the fluid builds up
default causing more stress.
default&#xa0;
defaultLymphoedema
default is an awful condition and I would not wish it on my 
defaultworst
default enemy.
