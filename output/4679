defaultWritten evidence submitted by Valerie Hunterdefault&#xa0;
defaultEducation Select Committee   -   Academy Inquiry
default&#xa0;
default1.  Are academies as successful as they make out – or is it spin and propaganda ?
default[This is about Harris, mostly in Croydon, but no doubt applies to other academy chains.]
default&#xa0;
defaultPrimary Schools
default2.  
defaultDictatorship, hypocrisy, bullying, manipulation by Michael Gove, 
defaultDfE
default, Harris and even Ofsted.
defaultMichael Gove insisting that Harris is the only sponsor acceptable to him, although the majority of parents at 
defaultRoke
default, 
defaultColeraine
default Park and 
defaultDownshill
default [and others elsew
defaulthere] did not want them as sponsor.  Handing over schools with no subsequent control !        Dictatorship.
default&#xa0;
default3.  
defaultDfE
default do not look at their own verified statistics, when quoting their rhetoric.
default'Academy sponsors are assessed vigorously to ensure they have 't
defaulthe necessary capacity and experience to bring about improvements.'
defaultSo how do they explain that with 
defaultRiddlesdown's
default help (
defaultRoke's
default preferred sponsor), 
defaultRoke's
default grades went up from 64% to 80% - and that with Harris's help Peckham Park went DOWN from 90%  to 61 %.
default     Hypocrisy !
default&#xa0;
default 4.  Although they denied it, 
defaultDfE
default bullied and threatened these three schools.  [See Google -Press Release from 
defaultColeraine
default Park Primary Governors, for example]
default&#xa0;
default5.  Harris just come into the schools and alter what they like, irrespective o
defaultf the wishes of parents.
defaultHarris are accused of deliberately manipulating pupils' attainment data, and using American resources  [skip rope etc],  and letters home have included incorrect grammar and spelling.
defaultExercises also incorrect !  This is Harris's 'e
defaultxceptional primary team'?
default&#xa0;
default6.  Ofsted is even more worrying.
defaultOne inspection (20 min) said the children were bored, another that they were enjoyed the school.
defaultOne said they improved under 
defaultRiddlesdown
default, but not enough !  See above re Peckham Park!
defaultOne said th
defaultat children with special needs were falling behind at the school, and the lack of support provided.     So the '
defaultexceptional primary team'
default now helping 
defaultRoke
default are providing LESS support !
defaultThe academy management are accused of trying to force out SEN pupils by 
defaultwithdrawing all one-to-one help in order to improve the school's league table ratings, literacy homework apparently cut and pasted from AMERICAN SOURCES - ['The children jumped rope at recess'], incorrect grammar and spelling in letters home, manipulating 
defaultdata on children's attainment tests, and much more, including children in tears.
default(http://insidecroydon.com/2013/10/29/harris-primary-reduces-sen-support-and-adjusts-   
default&#xa0;default7.  League table success apparently being more important to Harris than children who ndefaulteed the most help.  This is why Sponsor chains should not take over primary schools.default                         --------------------------------------------
default&#xa0;
default8.  The fifth Primary school taken over by Harris, (and the
default third to object
default !)  was 
defaultRoke
default in Croydon.  
default.
defaultFACT OR FICTION
default ?
default&#xa0;
default9.  By now, 
defaultDfE
default must have known how Harris was doing with its FIRST primary school take-over.
defaultBut defaultDfEdefault IGNORED  their own verified statisticsdefault !
default&#xa0;
default10.  The first Harris take-over was Peckham Park, presumably r
defaultequested because the SATS were 64%.
defaultIn January 2013, 
defaultDfE
default published the first SATS % grades.    [Harris Peckham Park was the
default only
default primary that had been open long enough for
default comparison
default statistics]
defaultPeckham Park school – last results before closure  - 90%
defaultHarr
defaultis Peckham Park – results – 61% !!!
defaultAnd expected progress went DOWN  from 95% for both English and Maths for community school to 90% for English and 79% for Maths for Harris !
default&#xa0;
default11.  This '
defaultevidence
default' of worse SATs  under Harris therefore
default did
default NOTdefault show 'necessary improvements
default' to results at all!
defaultIt shows that
default Harris DID NOT have the 'necessary capacity and experience to bring about improvementsdefault'.  Quite the reverse !  
defaultIf this was the result after a year with their FIRST primary
default, how could they cope
default with the other three they already had – let alone take on 5 more later that year.
default&#xa0;
default12.  When challenged by 
defaultRoke
default about this appalling drop in 
defaultin
default SATS % at Peckham Park, the response at a meeting was 'Could have been worse'  !!!!!
defaultA further comment as writt
defaulten answer to a number of questions stated   '2011 year group were a relatively able group – 2012 were less able'.
default&#xa0;
default13.  This must apply to MOST schools whose grades went down for one year (
defaultRiddlesdown
default for example a drop of 10%  for GCSE/Equivalents, NOT 2
default9% as Harris Peckham Park), but they are called 'failing' !     But Harris Merton went
default down 13%default !!     Harris failing ?
default&#xa0;
default14.  A 29% drop in SATS at a
default school
default would have had an immediate take-over on the cards – but not for a Harris Academy.     Instead,
default knodefaultwing these results, defaultDfEdefault still forced defaultRokedefault to become a Harris Academy against the wishes of most parentsdefault.        [ A cynic could suggest that Harris wanted this school for  a feeder for its 
defaultPurley
default one, instead of 
defaultRiddlesdown
default.]
default&#xa0;
default15.  The Ofsted Reports for H
defaultarris Peckham Park  January 2013 (
defaulta year and a quarter after being taken over)
default gave '
defaultREQUIRES IMPROVEMENTdefault' [3] for '
defaultAchievement of pupilsdefault', '
defaultQuality of Teachingdefault' and '
defaultLeadership and Managementdefault'.
defaultAnd exactly the
default same
default 'requires improvement' grades for
default Harris
default 
defaultChafford
default Hundred
default  (the second primary taken over by Harris) in November 2012.
default'Your Thurrock  2
defaultnd
default January 2013 'Ofsted has told Harris Primary that it requires improvement, or risks being put in
default Special Measures
default' !!    Follow-up Report 19
defaultth
default March still cr
defaultitical.
defaultSO WHAT HAPPENED TO HARRIS'S 'EXCEPTIONAL PRIMARY TEAM'default ?
default&#xa0;
default16.  'Consultation' revealed that 94% of parents did not want to be taken over,  but if they had to become an academy, 81% did not want Harris as sponsor.
default&#xa0;
default17.  With 
defaultRoke
default, for the third 
defaulttime in a row, Harris had been
default forced
default on parents against their will – consultation ignored.
default&#xa0;
default18.  'The outstanding team of teachers and leaders were not in place when the SATS
default [Peckham Park]
default were prepared and taken, and have the expertise needed to give 
defaultRo
defaultke
default the support it needs.'
defaultWhere were they then that Peckham
default Park reduced by so much under Harris, and 
defaultChafford
default Hundred risked going into special measures ?
defaultHow could Harris be allowed to take over  more schools when they hadn't got this team in place for t
defaulthe first one to improve in over a year ? [They told 
defaultRoke
default that there would be
default evidence of acceleration
default of children's progress in the first two terms !
default Not
default  
defaultDETERIORATIONdefault after four terms for Peckham Park and one at 
defaultChafford
default Hundred !!]
default   How many 'extra' teams are NOT in place for the other 4 schools to be taken over in 2013/14 ?
default&#xa0;
default19.  When 
defaultRoke
default asked about 'LONG TERM experience' – the reply was '
defaultWe have recruited a team
default 
defaultof outstanding teachers
default led by Sir Robin Basher who have proven go
defaultod and outstanding teaching and outstanding schools'.
defaultBut Sir Robin had recently joined.  
defaultWas that long-term experience  on Primary schools !
defaultThey also responded  to the 
defaultquestionaire
default from 
defaultRoke
default with
default 'Support from outstanding primary teachers to support impr
defaultovement for 2 to 3 days a week on average.  Regular support from Robin Basher about a day a fortnight.'
defaultAnd 'currently planning 5 primaries including 
defaultRoke
default' – '3 more outstanding Primary Advisory Teachers are being recruited.'
defaultAnd  
default'Can support expansion at
default 8 to 10 additional schools a year.'     
defaultAnd 
defaultDfE
default are letting them !
default&#xa0;
default20.  Lord Nash, the Under-Secretary for the 
defaultDfE
default, in a letter to the local MP. Sir Richard 
defaultOttaway
default who favoured 
defaultRiddlesdown
default for the take-over, stated that Harris is a
default 'strong and
default proven
default sp
defaultonsor'.
defaultAnd with  
default'an exceptional primary team'          
default[He obviously is incapable of reading 
defaultDfE's
default verified statistics too.)
default&#xa0;
default21.  He also writes
default 'The formal consultation is usually started when the proposed sponsor has been identified by the Department
default,
default the governing body has met with, and
default agreed to be sponsored by this sponsordefault.default'     !!!!!!      Not according to defaultColerainedefault Park, defaultDownhillsdefault and defaultRokedefault&#xa0;
default                                 ----------------------------------------

default22.  Secondary Schools
defaultHarris Academies claimed great success in Croydon – BUT IS IT SPIN ?
default&#xa0;
default23.  Harris Crystal Palace
defaultAlready a very academically successful City Technology College – renamed an academy with
default£9m of taxpayers' money funding.
defaultSPINdefault  -  
defaultSaid to have 10 applicants for every place – but 2011/12  figures published in the local papers (I can't find later) show that there were 2110 applications, but only  543
default first
default choices – i.e. the other 1567 (three quarters of the applicants) put down betwe
defaulten 1 and 5 other schools
default in preference
default !    This is deliberately misleading parents.
defaultCounting all 6 choices as popularity, even the most unpopular school in Croydon is over-subscribed
default&#xa0;
default24.   2012 VA score shows Crystal Palace with the
default lowest
default score [998.3] of all Harris Academies and most Croydon schools.
defaultDoes this mean that Crystal Palace concentrated on getting the most pupils with C for English/Maths, and ignored giving effort, encouragement etc to those  who should have got a B or A instea
defaultd.
defaultExclusions. - 2009/10  5
defaultth
default highest out of Croydon's 22 state schools

default&#xa0;
default25.  Harris South Norwood
default£32m of taxpayers' money rebuilt this school with new equipment and facilities giving them a 
defaultgreat advantage over other schools.
defaultSPINdefault  -default  1220 applications, but only 287 first choices – the other 933 wanted SOMEWHERE ELSE
default&#xa0;
default26.  The official yearly intake was 210 pupils,, only it appears that they did not take in other children, in spite of shortag
defaulte of places  for another 4 years    [ in respective years 105, 91, 95, 108.]
default[Did they get funding for the children they would have in the future that helped give additional attention to those already at the school, and boost results ?]
defaultSPINdefault  - The 2011 ve
defaultrified results showed for the first time a breakdown of the 5 A-C GCSE results including Maths and English into two columns – GCSE ONLY and GCSE/Equivalent.
defaultSouth Norwood's figure
default dropped from 75% to 46%default  (29% !!! - the
default biggest
default decrease of Croydon's 27.   
default22 state schools, and 9% higher than the one in second position !
defaultAs the 'Equivalent' figure is the only one published in the local paper, and by Harris, this gives parents a totally misleading impression that 75% were 'good' GCSEs.
default&#xa0;
default 28.  Exclusions 
default:  2009/10 – the most in Croydon : 2010/11 – the 2
defaultnd
default highest  :  2011/12 – the third highest!                                        
default&#xa0;
default29.   
defaultHarris 
defaultPurley
default£18m of taxpayers' money spent on new facilities and equipment.
defaultSPINdefault - Continually referred to by Har
defaultris as underachieving and failing, nothing could be further from the truth.
default Five years or so previously the school had been at rock-bottom, bad 
defaultreputation,so
default would not be academic.   But five years later their CVA improvement score from what they were exp
defaultected to get was in the top 3% in the country and the 2
defaultnd
default highest in Croydon !   [Ignored ]
defaultScience up to 75% from 54%, and all other columns in 
defaultDfE's
default verified performance tables up
default ABOVE
default Croydon average, including 5 A-Cs, Level 1 English/Maths, and Modern
default languages.
defaultThe joint English/Maths up 8% from 18% to 25 % was the
default ONLY
default GRADE BELOW !- AND THE ONLY GRADE TAKEN ANY NOTICE OF!
defaultNational Challenge Inspectors said that the pupils would pass the then required 30% in the summer [they did- 33%] and would conti
defaultnue to rise as the school had more academic  pupils – which they did – but
default Harris unfairly claimed credit that THEY had turned the school around
default !
defaultThe school's final Science figure was 94% in 2009 – up from 27% in 2007, and other subjects continued to rise
default.
defaultThe unpopular jibe was also untrue. September 2008 190 pupils turned up for 180 places !
defaultBut the Council said the school was going to close and be moved to the far north of the borough which accounted for the low first choice for 2009.
defaultSPINdefault -  In 2011 th
defaulte GCSE ONLY grade drop from 61% to 42%, Equivalent. (3
defaultrd
default highest in Croydon).  Again parents misled by higher figure.
defaultIn 2012 
defaultPurley
default only entered an average 6.3 GCSEs  - only Harris Peckham was lower.
default&#xa0;
default30.  Baccalaureate
default – In 2012  South Norwood 4%.  
defaultPurley
default 3%.
defaultMost other Harris academies elsewhere 5% or under !
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default33.  It seems to me that too many academies are more interested in prestige than welfar
defaulte of children.
defaultThe non-academic are just as important.  A child who gets support and improves their score from that expected is more likely to adopt a good attitude to work, and be a success, even if not academically.   This continual 'failing' label is di
defaultsastrous.
