[normal]AFS0083[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Written evidence submitted by Valerie Hunter[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Education Select Committee   -   Academy Inquiry
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.  Are academies as successful as they make out – or is it spin and propaganda ?
[normal][This is about Harris, mostly in Croydon, but no doubt applies to other academy chains.]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Primary Schools
[normal]2.  
[normal]Dictatorship, hypocrisy, bullying, manipulation by Michael Gove, 
[normal]DfE
[normal], Harris and even Ofsted.
[normal]Michael Gove insisting that Harris is the only sponsor acceptable to him, although the majority of parents at 
[normal]Roke
[normal], 
[normal]Coleraine
[normal] Park and 
[normal]Downshill
[normal] [and others elsew
[normal]here] did not want them as sponsor.  Handing over schools with no subsequent control !        Dictatorship.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.  
[normal]DfE
[normal] do not look at their own verified statistics, when quoting their rhetoric.
[normal]'Academy sponsors are assessed vigorously to ensure they have 't
[normal]he necessary capacity and experience to bring about improvements.'
[normal]So how do they explain that with 
[normal]Riddlesdown's
[normal] help (
[normal]Roke's
[normal] preferred sponsor), 
[normal]Roke's
[normal] grades went up from 64% to 80% - and that with Harris's help Peckham Park went DOWN from 90%  to 61 %.
[normal]     Hypocrisy !
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 4.  Although they denied it, 
[normal]DfE
[normal] bullied and threatened these three schools.  [See Google -Press Release from 
[normal]Coleraine
[normal] Park Primary Governors, for example]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.  Harris just come into the schools and alter what they like, irrespective o
[normal]f the wishes of parents.
[normal]Harris are accused of deliberately manipulating pupils' attainment data, and using American resources  [skip rope etc],  and letters home have included incorrect grammar and spelling.
[normal]Exercises also incorrect !  This is Harris's 'e
[normal]xceptional primary team'?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.  Ofsted is even more worrying.
[normal]One inspection (20 min) said the children were bored, another that they were enjoyed the school.
[normal]One said they improved under 
[normal]Riddlesdown
[normal], but not enough !  See above re Peckham Park!
[normal]One said th
[normal]at children with special needs were falling behind at the school, and the lack of support provided.     So the '
[normal]exceptional primary team'
[normal] now helping 
[normal]Roke
[normal] are providing LESS support !
[normal]The academy management are accused of trying to force out SEN pupils by 
[normal]withdrawing all one-to-one help in order to improve the school's league table ratings, literacy homework apparently cut and pasted from AMERICAN SOURCES - ['The children jumped rope at recess'], incorrect grammar and spelling in letters home, manipulating 
[normal]data on children's attainment tests, and much more, including children in tears.
[normal](http://insidecroydon.com/2013/10/29/harris-primary-reduces-sen-support-and-adjusts-   
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.  League table success apparently being more important to Harris than children who n[bold]eed the most help.  This is why Sponsor chains should not take over primary schools.[bold]                         --------------------------------------------
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.  The fifth Primary school taken over by Harris, (and the
[normal] third to object
[normal] !)  was 
[normal]Roke
[normal] in Croydon.  
[normal].
[normal]FACT OR FICTION
[normal] ?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.  By now, 
[normal]DfE
[normal] must have known how Harris was doing with its FIRST primary school take-over.
[normal]But [bold]DfE[bold] IGNORED  their own verified statistics[bold] !
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.  The first Harris take-over was Peckham Park, presumably r
[normal]equested because the SATS were 64%.
[normal]In January 2013, 
[normal]DfE
[normal] published the first SATS % grades.    [Harris Peckham Park was the
[normal] only
[normal] primary that had been open long enough for
[normal] comparison
[normal] statistics]
[normal]Peckham Park school – last results before closure  - 90%
[normal]Harr
[normal]is Peckham Park – results – 61% !!!
[normal]And expected progress went DOWN  from 95% for both English and Maths for community school to 90% for English and 79% for Maths for Harris !
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.  This '
[normal]evidence
[normal]' of worse SATs  under Harris therefore
[normal] did
[normal] NOT[bold] show 'necessary improvements
[normal]' to results at all!
[normal]It shows that
[normal] Harris DID NOT have the 'necessary capacity and experience to bring about improvements[bold]'.  Quite the reverse !  
[normal]If this was the result after a year with their FIRST primary
[normal], how could they cope
[normal] with the other three they already had – let alone take on 5 more later that year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.  When challenged by 
[normal]Roke
[normal] about this appalling drop in 
[normal]in
[normal] SATS % at Peckham Park, the response at a meeting was 'Could have been worse'  !!!!!
[normal]A further comment as writt
[normal]en answer to a number of questions stated   '2011 year group were a relatively able group – 2012 were less able'.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.  This must apply to MOST schools whose grades went down for one year (
[normal]Riddlesdown
[normal] for example a drop of 10%  for GCSE/Equivalents, NOT 2
[normal]9% as Harris Peckham Park), but they are called 'failing' !     But Harris Merton went
[normal] down 13%[bold] !!     Harris failing ?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.  A 29% drop in SATS at a
[normal] school
[normal] would have had an immediate take-over on the cards – but not for a Harris Academy.     Instead,
[normal] kno[bold]wing these results, [bold]DfE[bold] still forced [bold]Roke[bold] to become a Harris Academy against the wishes of most parents[bold].        [ A cynic could suggest that Harris wanted this school for  a feeder for its 
[normal]Purley
[normal] one, instead of 
[normal]Riddlesdown
[normal].]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.  The Ofsted Reports for H
[normal]arris Peckham Park  January 2013 (
[normal]a year and a quarter after being taken over)
[normal] gave '
[normal]REQUIRES IMPROVEMENT[bold]' [3] for '
[normal]Achievement of pupils[bold]', '
[normal]Quality of Teaching[bold]' and '
[normal]Leadership and Management[bold]'.
[normal]And exactly the
[normal] same
[normal] 'requires improvement' grades for
[normal] Harris
[normal] 
[normal]Chafford
[normal] Hundred
[normal]  (the second primary taken over by Harris) in November 2012.
[normal]'Your Thurrock  2
[normal]nd
[normal] January 2013 'Ofsted has told Harris Primary that it requires improvement, or risks being put in
[normal] Special Measures
[normal]' !!    Follow-up Report 19
[normal]th
[normal] March still cr
[normal]itical.
[normal]SO WHAT HAPPENED TO HARRIS'S 'EXCEPTIONAL PRIMARY TEAM'[bold] ?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.  'Consultation' revealed that 94% of parents did not want to be taken over,  but if they had to become an academy, 81% did not want Harris as sponsor.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.  With 
[normal]Roke
[normal], for the third 
[normal]time in a row, Harris had been
[normal] forced
[normal] on parents against their will – consultation ignored.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18.  'The outstanding team of teachers and leaders were not in place when the SATS
[normal] [Peckham Park]
[normal] were prepared and taken, and have the expertise needed to give 
[normal]Ro
[normal]ke
[normal] the support it needs.'
[normal]Where were they then that Peckham
[normal] Park reduced by so much under Harris, and 
[normal]Chafford
[normal] Hundred risked going into special measures ?
[normal]How could Harris be allowed to take over  more schools when they hadn't got this team in place for t
[normal]he first one to improve in over a year ? [They told 
[normal]Roke
[normal] that there would be
[normal] evidence of acceleration
[normal] of children's progress in the first two terms !
[normal] Not
[normal]  
[normal]DETERIORATION[bold] after four terms for Peckham Park and one at 
[normal]Chafford
[normal] Hundred !!]
[normal]   How many 'extra' teams are NOT in place for the other 4 schools to be taken over in 2013/14 ?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19.  When 
[normal]Roke
[normal] asked about 'LONG TERM experience' – the reply was '
[normal]We have recruited a team
[normal] 
[normal]of outstanding teachers
[normal] led by Sir Robin Basher who have proven go
[normal]od and outstanding teaching and outstanding schools'.
[normal]But Sir Robin had recently joined.  
[normal]Was that long-term experience  on Primary schools !
[normal]They also responded  to the 
[normal]questionaire
[normal] from 
[normal]Roke
[normal] with
[normal] 'Support from outstanding primary teachers to support impr
[normal]ovement for 2 to 3 days a week on average.  Regular support from Robin Basher about a day a fortnight.'
[normal]And 'currently planning 5 primaries including 
[normal]Roke
[normal]' – '3 more outstanding Primary Advisory Teachers are being recruited.'
[normal]And  
[normal]'Can support expansion at
[normal] 8 to 10 additional schools a year.'     
[normal]And 
[normal]DfE
[normal] are letting them !
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20.  Lord Nash, the Under-Secretary for the 
[normal]DfE
[normal], in a letter to the local MP. Sir Richard 
[normal]Ottaway
[normal] who favoured 
[normal]Riddlesdown
[normal] for the take-over, stated that Harris is a
[normal] 'strong and
[normal] proven
[normal] sp
[normal]onsor'.
[normal]And with  
[normal]'an exceptional primary team'          
[normal][He obviously is incapable of reading 
[normal]DfE's
[normal] verified statistics too.)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21.  He also writes
[normal] 'The formal consultation is usually started when the proposed sponsor has been identified by the Department
[normal],
[normal] the governing body has met with, and
[normal] agreed to be sponsored by this sponsor[bold].[bold]'     !!!!!!      Not according to [bold]Coleraine[bold] Park, [bold]Downhills[bold] and [bold]Roke[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]                                 ----------------------------------------                           
[normal]    
[normal]22.  Secondary Schools
[normal]Harris Academies claimed great success in Croydon – BUT IS IT SPIN ?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.  Harris Crystal Palace
[normal]Already a very academically successful City Technology College – renamed an academy with
[normal]£9m of taxpayers' money funding.
[normal]SPIN[bold]  -  
[normal]Said to have 10 applicants for every place – but 2011/12  figures published in the local papers (I can't find later) show that there were 2110 applications, but only  543
[normal] first
[normal] choices – i.e. the other 1567 (three quarters of the applicants) put down betwe
[normal]en 1 and 5 other schools
[normal] in preference
[normal] !    This is deliberately misleading parents.
[normal]Counting all 6 choices as popularity, even the most unpopular school in Croydon is over-subscribed
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.   2012 VA score shows Crystal Palace with the
[normal] lowest
[normal] score [998.3] of all Harris Academies and most Croydon schools.
[normal]Does this mean that Crystal Palace concentrated on getting the most pupils with C for English/Maths, and ignored giving effort, encouragement etc to those  who should have got a B or A instea
[normal]d.
[normal]Exclusions. - 2009/10  5
[normal]th
[normal] highest out of Croydon's 22 state schools
[normal]                      2010/11 joint 7
[normal]th
[normal]     -  2011/12 10
[normal]th
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25.  Harris South Norwood
[normal]£32m of taxpayers' money rebuilt this school with new equipment and facilities giving them a 
[normal]great advantage over other schools.
[normal]SPIN[bold]  -[bold]  1220 applications, but only 287 first choices – the other 933 wanted SOMEWHERE ELSE
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26.  The official yearly intake was 210 pupils,, only it appears that they did not take in other children, in spite of shortag
[normal]e of places  for another 4 years    [ in respective years 105, 91, 95, 108.]
[normal][Did they get funding for the children they would have in the future that helped give additional attention to those already at the school, and boost results ?]
[normal]SPIN[bold]  - The 2011 ve
[normal]rified results showed for the first time a breakdown of the 5 A-C GCSE results including Maths and English into two columns – GCSE ONLY and GCSE/Equivalent.
[normal]South Norwood's figure
[normal] dropped from 75% to 46%[bold]  (29% !!! - the
[normal] biggest
[normal] decrease of Croydon's 27.   
[normal]22 state schools, and 9% higher than the one in second position !
[normal]As the 'Equivalent' figure is the only one published in the local paper, and by Harris, this gives parents a totally misleading impression that 75% were 'good' GCSEs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 28.  Exclusions 
[normal]:  2009/10 – the most in Croydon : 2010/11 – the 2
[normal]nd
[normal] highest  :  2011/12 – the third highest!                                        
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29.   
[normal]Harris 
[normal]Purley
[normal]£18m of taxpayers' money spent on new facilities and equipment.
[normal]SPIN[bold] - Continually referred to by Har
[normal]ris as underachieving and failing, nothing could be further from the truth.
[normal] Five years or so previously the school had been at rock-bottom, bad 
[normal]reputation,so
[normal] would not be academic.   But five years later their CVA improvement score from what they were exp
[normal]ected to get was in the top 3% in the country and the 2
[normal]nd
[normal] highest in Croydon !   [Ignored ]
[normal]Science up to 75% from 54%, and all other columns in 
[normal]DfE's
[normal] verified performance tables up
[normal] ABOVE
[normal] Croydon average, including 5 A-Cs, Level 1 English/Maths, and Modern
[normal] languages.
[normal]The joint English/Maths up 8% from 18% to 25 % was the
[normal] ONLY
[normal] GRADE BELOW !- AND THE ONLY GRADE TAKEN ANY NOTICE OF!
[normal]National Challenge Inspectors said that the pupils would pass the then required 30% in the summer [they did- 33%] and would conti
[normal]nue to rise as the school had more academic  pupils – which they did – but
[normal] Harris unfairly claimed credit that THEY had turned the school around
[normal] !
[normal]The school's final Science figure was 94% in 2009 – up from 27% in 2007, and other subjects continued to rise
[normal].
[normal]The unpopular jibe was also untrue. September 2008 190 pupils turned up for 180 places !
[normal]But the Council said the school was going to close and be moved to the far north of the borough which accounted for the low first choice for 2009.
[normal]SPIN[bold] -  In 2011 th
[normal]e GCSE ONLY grade drop from 61% to 42%, Equivalent. (3
[normal]rd
[normal] highest in Croydon).  Again parents misled by higher figure.
[normal]In 2012 
[normal]Purley
[normal] only entered an average 6.3 GCSEs  - only Harris Peckham was lower.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30.  Baccalaureate
[normal] – In 2012  South Norwood 4%.  
[normal]Purley
[normal] 3%.
[normal]Most other Harris academies elsewhere 5% or under !
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]33.  It seems to me that too many academies are more interested in prestige than welfar
[normal]e of children.
[normal]The non-academic are just as important.  A child who gets support and improves their score from that expected is more likely to adopt a good attitude to work, and be a success, even if not academically.   This continual 'failing' label is di
[normal]sastrous.
