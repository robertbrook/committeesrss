[[[Excessive Noise in Helicopters causing Crew ]]]

[[[issues ?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]As I have explained in another note, I worked in the Oil Industry for many years.&#xa0;What always struck me on the big Helicopters like the Super Puma was the very high noise level in the passenger compartment, even whilst wearing a headset and foam ear plugs.&#xa0;From my experience in my early days working in an Oil Refinery Power Station, and later on visiting Oil Platforms, is that even with ear protection, that somehow excessive noise impedes concentration, and possibly spatial awareness.&#xa0;In that helicopters are built to a weight limit (ie flimsy), and that the 15 (ish) seat helicopters have very powerful and noisy engines, and a gearbox or two whirring away, along with the rotor blade vortex noise, I wonder what it is like to be continually exposed to this noise as a Pilot. The crew also have only a plastic windscreen canopy to shield them from noise, along with their headset.&#xa0;In addition, helicopters can create very low frequency noise, some of which can be felt rather than heard, and which is very difficult to attenuate.&#xa0;I would suggest that some sort of study of the effects of these very high noise levels on pilot performance (and potential hearing loss) is carried out, especially at the end of a shift.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
