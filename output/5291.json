"&#xa0;\nPET INDUSTRY FEDERATION RESPONSE TO THE ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO KEEPING PRIMATES AS PETS&#xa0;Background&#xa0;\nThe Pet Industry Federation is the new name for the Pet Care Trade Association. As a Federation it now combines five specialist trade associations under one umbrella group. Federation members are pet industry specialists and \ninclude groomers, pet boarders, pet retailers and manufacturers. We are the only organisation to represent all the different sectors of the pet industry\n&#xa0;\nThe Pet Industry Federation’s \ncombined \nmember\nship numbers\n&#xa0;\naround 1500 businesses, mostly small, medium\n-sized enterprises ranging from pet retailers, dog groomers, kennels &amp; catteries, manufacturers, wholesalers and professional services, which included colleges, publishers, dog walkers and pet sitters.\n&#xa0;\nThe Pet Industry Federation\n&#xa0;\nprovides a quality assura\nnce of businesses in the pet care sector: all members agree to adhere to our charters, representing best practice for the different sectors of the pet trade on joining the relevant association.\n&#xa0;The Pet Industry Federation is dedicated to promoting animal welfare within the pet industry and encouraging responsible pet ownership.  \n&#xa0;\nThe Pet Indus\ntry\n F\nederation recognises that p\nrimates are intelligent animals that \nrequire specialist care in order to be properly cared for in captivity.  They are almost always social creatures (with a few species exceptions) and should not be kept alone.  Their particular husbandry demands and the need for significant amounts of menta\nl and physical stimulation in captivity means the P\net Industry Federation is\n not in favour of these animals being kept alone under normal circumstances and does not support the keeping of primates \nin a \nhome environment\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe Pet Industry Federation does \nho\nwever \nsupport the private ownership of primates housed in appropriate conditions with quality husbandry and behavioural enrichment regimes.   \nEg. \nWhere animals are kept in large indoor/outdoor enclosures as mated pairs or groups.\n&#xa0;\nCurrent Guidelines and Legislation &#xa0;\nThe Pet Industry Federation thinks that the \nDEFRA \nP\nrimate \nC\node of \nP\nractice, the\n A\nnimal \nW\nelfare \nA\nct and D\nangerous \nW\nild \nA\nnimal Act\n combined \nare more than sufficient to assure the welfare of animals.\n&#xa0;\nHowever it may be worth considering that for \nsuch a ‘demanding’ animal type it may be that licencing (outside of DWA)or a system of registering with the Local Authority  may be a potential option.\n&#xa0;\nIf licensing is an option then consideration must be paid to those carrying out the inspection process \nand that inspectors must have a thorough knowledge and understanding of the \nspecies in quest\nion and that local authorities \nshould have sufficient resources for adequate  enforcement\n,\n as we understand that \n compliance\n under the DWA \n is\n low \n1\n&#xa0;\nThe Pet Industry Federation believes the Government needs to remain aware of existing legislation and the practicalities of enforcement.  \n&#xa0;\nImplementing a Ban&#xa0;\nThe Animal Welfare \nAct\n place\nd\n a duty of care on all animal owners.  \nThe Pet Industry Federation \nbelieve\ns\n this is legislative protection for many different types of animal, and that specific exclusions on the ownership of \nP\nrimates would be disproportionate and \nunreasonable\n.\n&#xa0;\nThere\n would need to be an extremely strong argume\nnt on public safety or welfare grounds for \nthe Pet Industry Federation\n to take the position of supporting a \ntotal \nban.\n&#xa0;\nConclusion&#xa0;\nIn conclusion the Pet Industry Federation understands \nthat\n Primates require specific care to satisfy their needs in captivity. This however is not inherently different from requirement levels set out for other animals.\n&#xa0;\nThe Pet Industry Federation \n would not support an outright ban on the keeping of\n P\nrimates in c\naptivity where their welfare needs can be met but would \nsupport \n restrictions on keeping Primates as pets , where \na pet \n is defined as an individual animal or animals kept with\nin a\n  household\n situation\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\nOn animal welfare grounds\n,\n the Pet Ethics Group st\nrongly advises its Pet Industry Federation members against selling any companion or pet primate to members of the general public and largely endorse the RSPCA\n’s statement on keeping primates as pets\n.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n14 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
