[[[Written evidence from Hospedia (PEX 0026)]]]&#xa0;

[[[About Hospedia:]]]Hospedia is the world’s leading operator of Point of Care software and services in healthcare, covering 70,000 beds in 158 sites, delivering Patient Media, Patient Engagement and Clinical Workflow to the bedside.  Hospedia is also the UK’s leading provider of Patient Flow Management software to over 20 hospitals.&#xa0;

[[[Summary: ]]]&#xa0;

[[[Context]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[1.1]]] Hospedia’s services are directly aligned with the Department of Health’s Information Strategy, which aims to transform the way information is used in the NHS, and can play a key role in delivering on the pledge to find £15bn-£20bn of savings in the NHS by 2014, the ambition of a paperless health service by 2018, and serve as a robust response to the Francis Report’s call for a more patient-centered focus.&#xa0;“The driving ambition underlying the challenge to deliver greater productivity and a stable financial position is not only to maintain the quality of services of patients, but to improve it”

[[[Kings Fund, February 2013]]]&#xa0;

[[[1.2]]] Therefore, as Trusts continue to find ways of improving patient care while delivering their annual CIPs, there is a clear need to engage with IT solutions to deliver on these objectives. Hospedia’s point of care services can deliver significant benefits to patients and clinicians, from improvements in patient well-being and reduced length of stay to clinical efficiencies, streamlined workflows and reduced paperwork.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Hospedia’s Services]]]&#xa0;

[[[2.1]]] Hospedia has developed a range of services, which include Electronic Meal Ordering (EMO), Clinical Access, Real Time Patient Feedback (RTPF) and the Extramed Patient Flow Management Systems. These services allow Trusts to deliver clinical support services at the bedside without the need to invest in new IT infrastructure.&#xa0;

[[[2.2]]] In more detail, the individual Deloitte reports identify that NHS Trusts have the potential to deliver on key priorities via one or more of the following services:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Electronic Meal Ordering]]]

[[[ (EMO)]]]

[[[3.1]]] EMO supports not only cost improvement goals but also food wastage reduction and patient experience improvements, such as improved patient nutrition and reduced length of stay. &#xa0;

[[[3.2]]] EMO also reduces the time between order and delivery from 15 hours to just 2 hours, releasing staff time spent printing, distributing and collecting paper menus, instead enabling staff to focus on patient care.&#xa0;

[[[3.3]]] NHS catering managers estimate that reduction in food waste could be as high as 60%. With over £27m worth of hospital food being wasted across the NHS, reducing the number of untouched meals represents a massive economic advantage.&#xa0;

[[[3.4]]] In a recent survey, 85% of patients identified that food and catering services were a significant contributor to their overall satisfaction during a hospital stay. &#xa0;

[[[3.5]]] With EMO, patients are offered an improved choice of meals compared to paper systems, and are able to receive personalised menus based on dietary requirements.&#xa0;“The EMO system means patients get a wider choice of menu, and they order and consume their meals on the same day. This greatly enhances patient experience within this hospital”

[[[Denise Richardson, Hospital Catering Manager, Bournemou]]]

[[[th &amp; Christchurch Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]]]&#xa0;

[[[3.6]]] Hospitals should also regularly evaluate their food services and act on feedback from patients. EMO provides the tools for hospital caterers to gather patient opinion using ordering patterns that are captured electronically.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Clinical Access]]]

[[[4.1]]] As well as delivering financial benefits, investing in Clinical Access also supports patient engagement and involvement at the point of care, improvements in care and also in delivering NHS initiatives such as the drive to become paperless by 2018.&#xa0;

[[[4.2]]] The service provides staff with decision-making information and data capture in real time. It also serves as a platform from which staff can access a range of applications directly at the bedside, including Picture Arching and Communications Systems (PACS), blood results and ordering, e-pharmacy, patient admissions systems, and even patient records, thereby reducing the reliance on paper based processes.&#xa0;

[[[4.3]]] Interviews with NHS Managers confirm that using the service releases the equivalent of 14 members of staff per year, releasing time to be spent on delivering patient care and producing a time saving valued at £335k per annum, while the production saving generated through avoiding the volume of paper currently produced for each in-patient saves £60k. The sites at which Clinical Access is already in use include Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust, Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Real Time Patient Feedback]]]

[[[ (RTPF)]]]

[[[5.1]]] One of the key themes identified by the Francis Report was the importance of listening to patients, in real time, and using that feedback to improve outcomes. &#xa0;

[[[5.2]]] RTPF collects and aggregates patient feedback in real time, providing the opportunity to review the data from hospital-wide results to granular, ward-level feedback, supporting immediacy in responding to the information captured.&#xa0;

[[[5.3]]] Analysis by Picker Institute Europe reveals that the service provides higher response rates providing a more representative view, unbiased data and a respondent profile that includes traditionally hard-to-reach demographics such as young and ethnically diverse patients.&#xa0;“We use Hospedia to deliver the new friends and family survey requirement…This requirement is delivered by the same system Hospedia provide us to capture in-patient surveys – consolidating our feedback real time into one easy to use, organisation-wide system” 

[[[Lynn Thomas, Head of Patient Experience &amp; Public Engagement, Mid Essex Hospitals Trust]]]&#xa0;

[[[5.4]]] Mid Essex Hospitals Trust have been using RTPF since 2011 to deliver in-patient surveys to not only recognise timely opportunities for service improvements but also reward success. The Trust is now also using the service to deliver the Government’s Friends and Family Test requirement.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[InPatient Flow Manager (IPFM)]]]

[[[6.1]]] This service is a software-based system that supports clinical best practice through electronic whiteboards and desktop applications, monitoring patient flow and bed availability in real time. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[6.2]]] It records and tracks the status of each patient, sharing this data between departments, clinical staff and administrative functions. This in turn saves time and improves accuracy, optimising patient journeys, delivering significant savings, and improving patient experience. &#xa0;

[[[6.3]]] As an example, patient information can be input directly into the electronic system, saving 1,000 clinical hours per annum. It also drives a reduction in average length of stay by 13% and the benefit of reduced infection rates through IPFM is equal to 42 QALYs (quality adjusted life years), translating to a value of £864k per annum to patients.&#xa0;“[Hospedia’s] patient flow expertise and understanding of the challenges involved were compelling factors in our decision to purchase. This system allows us to manage beds in real time down to the individual bed level, free up nursing time to focus on patient care and improve our discharge planning”

[[[Director of Nursing, Mid Essex NHS Trust]]]&#xa0;

[[[6.4]]] East Lancashire NHS Trust has used IPFM for the past four years to manage patient flow across 1,000 beds in five hospitals. In 2013 it decided to utilise IPFM to support new CQUIN targets for Dementia Assessments. Within two months of using it, the Trust had completely transformed their performance, consistently over-achieving against the 90% compliance required for each of the three stages of the target, necessary to release the CQUIN funding associated with the improvement of dementia assessments.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Emergency Patient Flow Manager (EPFM)]]]

[[[7.1]]] There are over 20 million admissions at A&amp;E departments each year across the NHS in England and, with pressure on NHS resources rapidly increasing, manual methods of managing patient flows are time consuming and inefficient.&#xa0;

[[[7.2]]] EPFM is designed to replace the traditional whiteboard method of tracking patient flow from A&amp;E through to admission or discharge. &#xa0;

[[[7.3]]] Like the IPFM product, the system records and tracks the status of each patient, sharing this data in real time and avoiding the need to locate available beds by telephoning individual wards.&#xa0;

[[[7.4]]] In an example of the service’s broad utility, the effective management of patient flow can help to reduce elective surgery cancellations, alleviating ward bed unavailability, one of the causes of surgery cancellations. As approximately a quarter of patients attending emergency care are subsequently admitted to hospital, tracking the status of these patients is fundamental in managing bed availability. Therefore the value of reducing surgical cancellations, estimated at a 17% reduction, represents a benefit of £137k per annum.&#xa0;

[[[7.5]]] East Cheshire NHS Trust turned to EPFM to deliver a solution that would help clinical front line staff manage the four hour wait-time target and enable data capture to support payment-by-results income. Through a close working relationship during the implementation and change management process, EPFM has gone beyond the initial offering, delivering enhanced functionality and increasing staff engagement.&#xa0;“The [Digital] Whiteboard is the first time we’ve had a visual clue as to what’s happening in the department. If you see someone who is starting to near breach point you can follow it up and find out why. Everyone is really keen to use it, because it’s actually fun and easy to operate”
