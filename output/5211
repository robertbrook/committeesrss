[normal]Following advice from experts in protein chemistry it became clear that protein (such as that associated with vCJD) has great affinity for the stainless steel used in surgical instruments. This allows these proteins to stick to the surface of instruments such that the standard wash process (as is routine prior to sterilization of surgical instruments) may not be a reliable way of rendering the instrument protein free. This is of particular concern as adherent vCJD protein cannot be rendered non-infectious by all heat based sterilization processes. It appears that this problem can be avoided or at least reduced by ensuring that instruments are moist as they enter the washing phase of the decontamination process. Dry protein is very difficult to wash off but wet protein can be removed with relative ease. Trials have been conducted at Great Ormond Street Hospital London in collaboration with University College Hospital London, Queen Mary University of London and Southampton general Hospital in collaboration with the University of Southampton to assess the practicality of using sprays, gels and sealed polythene bags to maintain instruments in a moist state prior to the washing phase of the sterilisation cycle. As a result of these trials the DH guidance (Choice Framework for Local Policy and Procedures 2013) now suggests that instruments should be kept moist between use and reprocessing.

[normal]A substantial research project has been in process for some time now to look at novel ways to detect protein on surgical instruments. Research centres in London, Edinburgh and Southampton have contributed by developing 3 different methods for protein detection. It has 
[normal]been established from studies in Southampton that the current methods for protein detection are neither sufficiently reliable nor sensitive enough. Higher sensitivity methods should be integrated into the decontamination process to ensure that surgical instruments are free from significant amounts of protein and are therefore much less likely to place patients at risk by exposing them to the infectious prion protein that causes vCJD.

[normal]The Decontamination Science Working Group has recently received presentations relating to novel coatings for surgical and dental instruments being developed by University of Dundee in conjunction with Queen Mary University of London and the University of Southampton. These coatings can be designed to reduce the propensity for protein to adhere to metal thus increasing the reliability with which surgical instruments can be rendered clean and free of contaminating protein. This work is in an early stage but, once suitable coatings have been identified and trialled it is hoped that they could become routine for surgical instruments in high risk areas such as neurosurgery or perhaps for all surgical instruments.

[normal]Researchers at Edinburgh and Loughborough Universities have been investigating novel decontamination processes such as plasma technology. This technology has the potential to be more effective at destroying the protein associated with vCJD than traditional steam based sterilisation but is not yet commercialised. A major research project funded by DH to optimise cold atmospheric plasma technology for decontaminating heat labile endoscopes is being undertaken by the University of Southampton in conjunction with Old Dominion University, USA. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Several commercial organisations have developed enzyme based detergent systems which have the potential to destroy vCJD protein. This is a complex field and it is important that, before adopting any such methods, the data supporting the use of these detergents is accurate and robust. Any chemical must be compatible with existing sterilization processes and must be safe to use. With this in mind a meta-analysis is ongoing to evaluate the data relating to these detergents so that policy makers can be correctly advised on whether such chemicals should be integrated into the decontamination process.
