"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Compass Disability Services (PIC 0010)\nCompass Disability Service\ns\n \nis\n a user led organisation based in Somerset but also operating in different parts of the country providing\n services which promote independent living.\n&#xa0;\nWe carry out consultation work with disabled people and carers in Somerset through our Network project.  We work with local authorities to consult on issues that disabled people may be interested in having their say on.  We also carry out Disability Forums and Discussion Groups inviting speakers to engage with disabled people and carers and give them a chance to have their voice heard.\n&#xa0;\nWe have been asked to carry out consultation work for Somerset County Council on topics such as the ‘Long Term Transport Strategy for Somerset’ in 2010 and the ‘Bus Subsidies Reduction Consultation’ in January 2012.  In addition to this, issues regarding transport ha\nve\n been raised by our members at our disability groups and forums.\n&#xa0;\nThis information is summarised below;\n&#xa0;\nPublic Transport              \nEven in more urban areas such as Taunton, disabled people who \n              \nare wheelchair users have to wait sometimes close to 2 hours for a \n              \npublic transport bus with a ramp which is suitable for them.  \nThere \n              \nis only \n1disabled space for a wheelchair on public transport and \n              \nthere are inconsistencies in staff attitudes in assisting people to \n              \naccess buses. \nBus drivers can ask for other passengers to \n              \ncollapse buggies to a\nssist access but cannot insist, \nthis relies on \n              \nmembers of the public being \n              \nhelpful.\n              \nThere are l\nimitation\ns \nof access\n with\n smaller buses in rural area\ns.\nHospital TransportCommunity Transport                            \nThe cost of community transport schemes has increased and is \n   \n              \nnot necessarily cheaper than taxis. There are als\no problems in \n              \ngetting\n \ntransport, \nother services \nsuch as Slinky are not provided \nin \n              \nall areas of the \nC\nounty\n (\nreport extract \nJan 2009)\n.\n \nIf you have a \n              \nconcessionary pass, depending on \nwhich service \nyou use, you \n              \ncan use your bus p\nass.  \nSlinky is limited to certain areas and it \n              \ndoesn’t cross boundaries\n, they serve the local communities in the \n              \nareas they are based.\n “\nIf one person wants it in the north and then \n              \nanother wants it\n in the south it cannot be done”.\n  \nThese services \n              \nare also in high demand and are often difficult to obtain.\n              \nNo community transport is available in the evenings to provide \n              \ntransport for disabled people to attend groups. This can be a vital \n              \nway of preventing isolation.\n \nTaxis              \nWhen disabled people have to use taxis to get to appointments \n              \nbecause of lack of availability of public transport they need to have \n              \na known company to use as access can vary e.g. the ramps used \n              \nfor powered chairs are not always to the same safety standards.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
