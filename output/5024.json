"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nSophie Chambers\n [PCC Progress 16]\n&#xa0;\nDeclaration\n of interests\n:\nI am a doctoral researcher at Cardiff University studying the i\nmpact\n of Police and Crime Commissioners in two case study areas (South Wales and Avon and Somerset\n) o\nn agenda setting in the context of community safety. I have therefore approached this report from an academic \nperspective,\n looking at examples of collaborative best practice between Commissioners and local authority partners,\n between\n Commissioners and research institutes, and between\n \nCommissioners themselves. \nEvidence submitted is the result of interviews, observations and document analysis in South Wales and Avon and \nSomerset\n, and desk-\nbased research for other force areas. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe ambiguity of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 in outlining the \nroles and responsibilities \nof Police and Crime Commissioners\n has\n led to variation across England and Wales in terms of \nwho is involved in collaboration\n, and on what matters. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nPACE Act 1984 acknowledged that core police and criminal justice agencies are unable to comprehend and prevent crime and disorder issues alone, and thus emphasised the need for agencies to work in partnership\n. \nSince then, both voluntary and statutory partnerships between relevant agencies have been implemented, with varying degrees of success. These partnerships can be argued to have created silos within a fragmented criminal justice ‘system’, in which both overlapping and contradictory priorities, targets and funding streams exist. Police and Crime Commissioner\ns\n are\n well placed\n to better align \nsuch\n partnerships, \nand rejuvenate\n joined-up\n prevention and interventio\nn. \n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe health sector has been identified as a key partner of the police. In \nSouth Wales\n the Commissioner takes an analytical evidence-based approach to the role, looking to the work of \nProfessor \nJonathan Shepherd at a local Accident and Emergency Department who identifies \nthat\n violent incidences i\nn the night-time economy lead\n to pressure on both the police \nand\n health institutions. In \nCardiff\n city centre a small triage facility is \nnow \navailable on weekends, thus reducing the volume of low-severity patients needing transport to Accident and Emergency Department outside the city centre and then using resources there. \nThe triage facility\n is run by staff from the police, health sector, local authorities and third sector\n,\n and the South Wales Commissioner aims to take a similar baseline approach to all Accident and Emergency Departments across \nSouth Wales\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMental health is an issue that \nseveral\n Police and Crime Commissioners have committed themselves to targeting\n, albeit through different collaboration\ns\n. \nThe Commissioner for Greater Manchester\n acknowledges the amount of police time it takes to administer the appropriate response for someone who is suffering from mental health problems, and has invested\n £200,000 of this year’s \nbudget to partnership working wi\nth the NHS to develop innovations aimed at improving the current response.\n \nIn \nStaffordshire\n,\n \nthe \nCommissioner held group meetings with Police Officers, PCSOs and Staff below the rank of Inspector to discuss their day-to-day working lives, and found that issues of mental he\nalth were \nconsistently raised\n. Recording the\n details of every incident involving mental health over an eight week period proved the scale of the issue, and the complexity of agencies involved. Since then, a ‘whole system’ approach has \nbeen \ndeveloped with stakeholders across health, social care and the voluntary sector to ensure a timely and appropriate response, as well as \nbringing mental health professionals \nto the frontline, \nworking alongsid\ne the police\n.\n \nIn \nAvon and \nSomerset\n, the C\nommissioner\n states that 646 people were detained under the Mental Health Act in police cells in 2012/13, and is changing the custody landscape with the aim of having no mental health patients in police cells by April 2014. Care planning is also being improved through collaboration\n with Mental Health liaison and Diversion Services.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Police and Crime Commissioner for\n Northamptonshire\n is one of a few Commissioners who \ncall\n for the integration of \nthe three main emergency response services: \npolice, fi\nre and ambulance. The argument for doing so is that \nit will deliver effective, efficient services of high standard and will save valuable resources to sustain the frontline by handling emergency calls only once\n a\nnd commanding\n resources in a joined-up way.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBoth Northamptonshire and Greater Manchester Commissioners have highlighted the lack of ‘system’ in the Criminal Justice System\n. G\nreater \nM\nanchester\n Commissioner has had pragmatic discussions with the Courts, prosecutors, probation, police and other criminal justice partners about how to improve victim services. The outcomes of these meetings have already been piloted: in one \nlocal \narea the police and probation are now based together to manage offenders\n,\n \nas well as\n improve preventative measures; in another area, \na mult\ni-agency approach \nhas been\n taken to counter organised crime networks, \nresulting in arrests and \nthe \nse\nizure of millions of pounds worth\n of property and drugs. Agencies involved included \nall \nemergency services, councils, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, NHS, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, and the Illegal Money Lending Team, as well as other public bodies, thus extending inve\nstigation into every area of a\n criminal’s life.  \n&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome Police and Crime Commissioners have focussed\n on\n \ngaps in the protection of victims and potential victims, and the impact that private businesses have on these gaps\n. \nIn Northumbria, the Commissioner has recognised that the night-time economy in Newcastle is not a safe place for the vulnerable\n,\n despite work by the local BCU and Safe Newcastle Partnership. To tackle \nviolence again\nst\n women, \nthe Commissioner has facilitated \na training\n course \nfor door supervisors to learn how to assess triggers of vulnerability. The course was developed by Northumbria Police, Safe Newcastle, the local authority safeguarding and licensing teams, Tyneside Rape Crisis and the le\nading local door\n staff company. This company\n ensured that all their staff undertook the train\ning in weeks, and other security\n firms quickly\n followed, with the police present at each step. \nAs a consequence \nof this collaboration, and the\n gap in National Security Industry Training being acknowledged, Northumbria’s programme has become a compulsory part of the national training. \n&#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs well as collaborating with partners from both the public, private and voluntary sectors, some Commissioners are recognising that the Chief Constable of their force is also a partner.\n For example,\n \nthe Commissioner for \nSouth Wales\n refers to the Chief as a partner, recognising it as a mutually challenging relationship but with clear areas of responsibility\n.\n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPolice and Crime Commissioners are also collaborating regionally on specific aspects of policing. \nFive Police and Crime Commissioners in the South West have joined up to collaborate on several aspects of policing, aiming to improve efficiency and remove duplication, increase resilience, and enhance capacity, capability and flexibility. Avon and \nSomerset\n, Wiltshire, Dorset, Devon and \nCornwall\n, and \nGloucester\n have collaborated on a dedicated counter terrorism team, police dogs and some aspects of road safety and also introduced a single, shared special branch IT intelligence system\n. \nIn addition, t\nhese five commissioners have signed their forces up to a new Code of Ethics to help assure the public of standards of policing. The code is aligned with existing police regulations and professional standards and has been influenced by the Code of Ethics put in place when the Police Service of Northern Ireland was established. \n&#xa0;\n10.\n&#xa0; \nThe establishment of the East Midlands \nSpecial Operations Unit\n over a decade \nago\n marked the beginning of collaborative policing\n in\n the area, which is now delivered \nby this unit and the East Midlands Police Collaboration Programme. Since their election, these collaboration arrangements have been overseen by the five Police and Crime Commissioners of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, \nLincolnshire\n, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire. Areas of policing covered by these collaborations include: serious and organised crime, major crime, intelligence, forensics and counter-terrorism, as well the\n organisational support functions\n of IT infrastructure, police legal services, training programmes, fraud and financial investigati\nons and the regionalisation of human resources\n data. \n&#xa0;\n11.\n&#xa0; \nPolice and Crime Commissioners and Chief Constables from Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire have signed up to a ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ and will collaborate on specific operational and organisational functions. These include finance, fleet, estates and facilities, legal, human resources, professional standards, training, ICT, firearms licensing, custody and crime recording.\n The aim of this collaboration is to assist with safeguarding police office numbers and enhance economic efficiency of services. \n&#xa0;\n12.\n&#xa0; \nThe four Welsh Police and Crime Commissioners have formed an ‘All-\nWales\n Commissioners’ group. Meeting quarterly, moving around the force areas, the Commissioners discuss Wales-wide strategic issues and identify common issues where they can work together. They have met jointly with stakeholders in the Drug Intervention Programme, and the Welsh Government Director of Corporate Services and Partnerships, indicating that priority is being given to these topics.\n&#xa0;\n13.\n&#xa0; \nSeveral Police and Crime Commissioners are \ncollaborating with U\nniversities \non\n \nevidence-based research \non local crime and disorder. Police and Crime Commissioner for Northamptonshire is establishing a ‘Police, Crime and Justice Institute’ within a University to bring together research activity and practical translation of research evidence \nwith the aim of\n enha\nncing\n problem solving. In South Wales, the Universities P\nolice Science Institute (UPSI) is a\nn\n innovative partnership \nbetween Cardiff University’s Viol\nence and Society Research Group\n and South Wales Police, \nand is supported by the South Wales Commissioner wit\nh funding of £1.2 million over five\n years.\n The collaboration focuses upon community engagement, intelligence and neighbourhood policing, countering violent extremism and police innovation and reform. \n&#xa0;\n14.\n&#xa0; \nOn the 10\nth\n December 2013 the Home Office invited all Police and Crime Commissioners and Chief Constables to a\nn\n ‘\nInnovation through C\nollaboration\n’ summit\n to review existing collaboration and facilitate further discussion. The agenda for the day \nfocussed\n o\nn the benefits of collaboration, particularly \nvalue for money and improving services, and working on bids for the Police Innovation fund. \n&#xa0;\n15.\n&#xa0; \nPolice and Crime Commissioners appear to be well placed to enhance collaboration\n between and with partnerships and \ncreate innovations in research.\n The regional collaborations between Police and Crime Commissioners demonstrate recognition of needing to do more with less.\n As democratically elected individuals \nPolice and Crime Commissioners have the opportunity to \nspeak openly about areas that require reform or would benefit from a more collaborative approach, and therefore break down organisational silos. \n&#xa0;\nSophie Chambers\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n              \n"
