[normal]Written evidence submitted by the BBC (CLC064)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The most important principle is that our interest in reporting any subject is journalistic, rather than one of raising awareness. As an Independent news organisation it would not be appropriate for us to give advice on how organisations or individuals might seek to raise awareness, particularly in areas of contested scientific and indeed political debate. Our role is to explain these issues to our audiences so that they understand what the debate is about, and the context in which it is taking place. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Of course Climate change is an umbrella phrase covering a very broad waterfront. As the Committee is clearly well aware, even within the science of climate change, some issues are basic physics, some are widely accepted as falling within a narrow range of possibilities, and there are others where fundamental issues are being debated. The last of these would be, in terms of the way we report on a subject under the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines, treated as ‘controversial subjects’. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition, there are numerous political and economic questions relating to how governments, firms and individuals should respond to climate change. Defenders and opponents of all policy-related questions deploy facts and opinions to buttress their arguments as they see fit. Broadly speaking, a policy debate is a ‘controversial subject’, and the BBC will cover the appropriate range of argument as it applies to the policy itself. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have a highly experienced team reporting on these issues, notably
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] our Science Editor and our Environment Analyst – and the BBC’s News Editorial Board receives quarterly updates from the Science Editor on BBC climate change coverage. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BBC coverage has been criticised by some for both giving too much airtime to climate change sceptics and, conversely, for not providing enough coverage of the claims that climate change is happening more quickly, or requires an even more radical or urgent response. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In 2011 the BBC Trust published a report it had commissioned from Professor Steve Jones on the impartiality and accuracy of the BBC’s coverage of science. It covered a range of topics including climate change, his assessment was that the BBC had continued to give undue prominence to climate change sceptics and had not kept pace with the debate: “
[normal]The real discussion has moved on to what should be done to mitigate climate change. Its coverage has been impeded by the constant emphasis on an exhausted subject whose main attraction is that it can be presented as a confrontation”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBC’s management response noted “… 
[normal]that the treatment of a scientific story will depend upon its nature and context. Sometimes it is appropriate to present it as a debate within the scientific community whereas at others a range of views, including from non-experts, is justified given the social, political and cultural context
[normal].” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBC remains committed to the principles, set out in its Charter and Agreement, of due accuracy and impartiality, and to applying them to coverage of all the issues around climate change. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As outlined above, for the BBC this is a matter of reporting and journalistic inquiry,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] and one where our strong reputation for independence is paramount. On that basis, I hope you can understand why we would be highly reluctant for our editorial approach on any issue
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] to be subject to
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] formal examination by a Committee of Parliament, as this would seem to conflict with our guaranteed independence from Government and Parliament as enshrined in the Charter.

[normal]Appendix – Correspondence from [bold]the Director, Editorial Policy &amp; Standards, BBC to the Committee, September 2013[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Many thanks for your letter dated 5 August.  Thank you also for the opportunity to give evidence to your Committee on behalf of the BBC, as part of your inquiry into ‘Climate: Public Understanding and Policy Implications’.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I will respond to the points raised in your letter one by one:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Audience knowledge of climate change[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBC does not measure or monitor our audience’s level of 
[normal]knowledge
[normal] about climate change.  This would not fall within the BBC’s remit and would, in any case, be extremely difficult to quantify.  
[normal]Shuckburgh
[normal] et al notes that less than half of their respondents classed themselves as knowing “a fair amount or a lot about climate change”, and that this represents a significant decrease since earlier surveys.  However, it seems unlikely that this kind of self-assessment indicates the absolute level of knowledge among respondents.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We do however measure our audience’s 
[normal]interest
[normal] in certain subject areas, including science.  For example, we know that 69% of UK adults are interested in science news, and 68% of UK adults think it is important that they personally understand science news.  Health and medical developments are the greatest area of interest for UK adults, followed by news about energy and fuel sources, then followed by interest in the environment and climate change
[normal] . 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BBC’s corporate position on climate change[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As I explained in my evidence to the committee, there is an important distinction between the BBC’s corporate and editorial positions on any subject matter, including climate change.  The BBC has a stated desire to reduce its environmental impacts.  Our approach to this ranges from innovation in our core business of making programmes through to targets aimed at reducing the environmental impact of our operations.  This corporate position has no bearing on our editorial position.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is information about our sustainability strategy and our environment targets here: 
[normal]www.bbc.co.uk/sustainability
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BBC Editorial Guidelines[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Editorial Guidelines (
[normal]www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines
[normal]) set out numerous considerations for content producers.  To ensure our audience is clear about the background and expertise of interviewees on news programmes, content providers must abide by the following guidelines: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We should normally identify on-air and online sources of information and significant contributors, and provide their credentials, so that our audiences can judge their status. (3.4.12)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We should not automatically assume that contributors from other organisations (such as academics, journalists, researchers and representatives of charities) are unbiased and we may need to make it clear to the audience when contributors are associated with a particular viewpoint, if it is not apparent from their contribution or from the context in which their contribution is made. (4.4.14)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Fact checking [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Editors of individual programmes (whether news or otherwise) are responsible for fact checking their content before it is aired.  They do this by following the standards set out in the BBC Editorial Guidelines (Section 3: Accuracy). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Role of the BBC Science Editor [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBC’s Science Editor, David 
[normal]Shukman
[normal], was appointed following the Professor Steve Jones review of the impartiality and accuracy of the BBC’s science coverage.  David’s role is described in some detail in the BBC Executive’s follow up report (December 2012): 
[normal]http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/science_impartiality/science_impartiality_followup.pdf
[normal]. 
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]David regularly engages with colleagues across BBC Science and discusses matters of scientific debate and controversy with them.  However, his role does not extend to fact-checking all science output from BBC News (let alone from the BBC as a whole); this remains the responsibility of the editor in question. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]College of Journalism science training [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As part of the BBC’s response to Professor Jones’ report, the BBC’s College of Journalism set up and runs a course called ‘Reporting Science’, which is open to all staff.  During the course, delegates discuss issues raised by the Jones report, and work on ways to ensure that future BBC science coverage complies with our accuracy and impartiality requirements.  BBC News has made the course compulsory for assistant editors and above (i.e. all those with editorial responsibility for programmes and web pages), and highly recommended for other grades.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As I explained in my evidence to the committee, scientists do not participate in the College of Journalism training, as the debates about science are approached from a journalistic point of view.  However, extensive discussion with scientists and the scientific community took place during the preparation of the course material.  Most notably, we spent an afternoon with the President of the Royal Society and Nobel Laureate, Sir Paul Nurse, and interviewed him about science reporting, how science works, pitfalls and opportunities and so on.   We also interviewed Professor Colin Blakemore and Dr Karol 
[normal]Sikora
[normal], two of the UK’s most eminent scientists.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clips of these interviews are included in the course, and can be viewed on the College of Journalism website 
[normal]http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/journalism/subject-guides/science
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Application of the BBC Editorial Guideline to specific programming (in this case, Sunday Politics)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Regardless of the topic, an impartial interviewer must put forward a range of arguments, perhaps even act as a kind of devil’s advocate, when questioning a minister about government policies.  It may be the case that some arguments heard in the public sphere are misinformed, but that does not mean that they should not be put to politicians.  It is part of the BBC’s function of holding government to account.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBC Editorial Guidelines set out our due impartiality and due accuracy requirements.   In essence, interviews should be conducted on the basis of reasoned argument.  However, so long as ministers have to face arguments based on misunderstandings, even ignorance, they will be given the opportunity to rebut them on the BBC.  This is recognised in the Editorial Guidelines, which say “Accuracy is not simply a matter of getting facts right.  If an issue is controversial, relevant opinions as well as facts may need to be considered.  When necessary, all the relevant facts and information should also be weighed to get at the Truth” (Section 3: Accuracy). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reasoned argument requires knowledge of an issue, and knowledge of the range of arguments deployed.  Production staff on programmes such as Sunday Politics are well used to getting to grips with pretty much all topics of public debate which come up in government.  They have access to the BBC’s in-house specialists and will conduct their own research, which, were appropriate, will include consulting with outside experts and academics.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I do not accept that a scientific line presented by a BBC presenter in order to challenge a Government Minister provides that aspect of science with a level of authority beyond that which it has already acquired within the scientific community.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBC Editorial Guidelines apply equally to BBC online content as much as they do to our on air content 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Meetings with individuals to discuss climate change[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]My meetings with Lord Lawson and Peter Lilley MP provided an opportunity for me to explain the BBC’s approach to impartiality in relation to climate change and how the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines apply to climate science coverage. Both had accused the BBC of bias on these subjects.  As part of my role as Director of Editorial Policy and Standards, I meet a wide range of people in order to explain the BBC’s approach to editorial matters though I am not aware of having met anyone else specifically to discuss accusations of bias in relation to climate change.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BBC written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBC does not intend to provide the Committee with further written evidence.  I would hope that this letter, together with my oral evidence, satisfactorily informs the Committee’s inquiry.
