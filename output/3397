[normal]The provisions in Section 4 (1) a and b of the Immigration and Asylum act 1999 are currently used and therefore, if the Home Office have given the impression that they are moribund to you, this is not the case.

[normal]These provisions are currently used for people who are granted temporary admission on leaving detention. It allows them to receive support on release, when they would otherwise be destitute. Not everyone has a bail hearing and people may be released on temporary admission because the Home Office realised they shouldn't be detained, e.g. if removal directions have not been obtained (it is not restricted to this reason). Temporary admission may be given with conditions e.g. to report at particular times and/or to reside at a particular address. If the person to be released has no support they may not be able to provide an address, which is one of the reasons why it is important that support can be provided under section 4 (1) a and b.

[normal]We understand that this is an issue that comes up at the Asylum Support Tribunal sometimes, and that people are usually successful.  Hazel Allen, the Chief Executive of the Asylum Support and Appeals Project (ASAP) knows more about this issue than us and is intending to submit to your consultation.

[normal]Therefore the powers are certainly in use, so if the Government wish to get rid of them, it would seem more fitting to try to do it through the planned Immigration Bill rather than the Deregulation Bill.
