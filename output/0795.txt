[[[Introduction:]]]Hospitals are seeing increasing number of medical admissions. The increase in numbers is multifactorial with demographic changes accounting for less than half of this rise.As hospitals decrease their bed numbers, they must reduce their length of stay (LoS) to compensate. This LoS needs to drop even further due to increasing admissions. As a consequence of this, elderly patients may leave hospital with poorer functional capacity and fail in the community. This leads to re-admission and the creation of a vicious cycle that may ultimately lead to 24 hour care.The key to assessment of the older person is the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) carried out by the multidisciplinary team including the consultant. Geriatricians are now one of the largest medical specialities in the UK and they provide significant input into acute GIM on call. Over the last few years there has been a shift of resources from secondary care to primary care. A greater emphasis has been placed on preventative care in the community. However, there are challenges set in the most at risk population in primary care. These are:(i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Multiple co-morbidity(ii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Polypharmacy(iii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Cognitive impairment/dementia(iv)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Assessment of capacity(v)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Legal and ethical issues(vi)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Carer support(vii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Palliative and End of life careGeneral practitioners have been set up to provide preventative care, with the creation of Quality Outcome Frameworks (QoFs). However, the evidence to say that QoFs have a significant effect in improving care is limited (Cochrane data base Sept 2011). Good primary care also involves the rational use of hospital based resources which is achieved through the GP gate keeping role. Unfortunately, the new GP contract and the loss of normal out of hours care means that for a significant part of the week an elderly person will not be looked after by their primary health care team.Intermediate care (IC) was first described in the literature in 1985, and over the years many different models of intermediate care have been proposed/developed. The evidence for supporting intermediate care is variable and the studies are small, with different outcomes being looked at and with differing methodologies being used. Therefore this makes generalisable conclusions problematic in suggesting that intermediate care can be used to stem hospital admissions.There is, however, clearly an opportunity to shift focus more into the community. Hospital clinics in all specialties are full of patients on long term follow up for ‘review and monitoring’. This can only be successful if there are clear pathways for patients and properly supportive networks across the care sectors.
