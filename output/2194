[normal]B[bold]edfordshire Association of Town &amp; Parish Councils[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Bedfordshire Association of Town &amp; Parish Councils (BATPC) advises, supports, trains and represents parish and town councils in Bedfordshire. 113 of 116 parish and town councils in Bedfordshire are in membership of our Association. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We wish to make two general points: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Although BATPC accepts that there is legislation which is no longer of practical use and acknowledges the benefit of some provisions within the draft De-Regulation Bill it does not believe that a Minister should have the power to repeal or revoke such legislation without consultation with local and/or other appropriate authorities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Experience has shown that decisions taken centrally can sometimes have unintended consequences at local level. For example - the Localism Act abolished the Standards Board regime, including the dispensation to discuss setting a precept embedded in the 2007 Model Code of Conduct. An unintended consequence of this was that some advised parish and town councillors they would need a dispensation to set a precept for their own area; others thought not. Brandon Lewis MP was obliged to write to all Local Authority Leaders explaining that the Government had intentionally sought to move to a lighter touch regime which focused on openness and transparency and that in his opinion such dispensations were unnecessary.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To prevent unintended consequences a Minister should not have the power to repeal or revoke any legislation unless the local or other appropriate authority has been consulted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BATPC acknowledges the importance of economic growth but believes that the duty on persons exercising certain regulatory functions to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth should also require them to have regard to local community interests. For example trading restrictions on out-of-town retail sites are still needed if Town Centres are to remain vibrant.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our comments on particular clauses are as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Para 12[bold] - BATPC supports the proposals which give added protection to recorded rights of way.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Para 13[bold] - BATPC supports the provisions which give unrecorded rights of way further protection from extinguishment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Para 34 [bold]â€“ BATPC welcome and strongly supports the proposal to exempt the provision of entertainment consisting of the exhibition of a film at community premises from being defined as the provision of regulated entertainment for the purposes of this Act. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We hope the above evidence will assist the Joint Committee with its pre-legislative scrutiny.
