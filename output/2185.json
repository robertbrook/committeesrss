"&#xa0;\nRMP 09&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Consumer Futures&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;About Consumer Futures&#xa0;\nConsumer F\nutures (previously Consumer Focus)\n is the statutory consumer watchdog \nfor \npostal services \nacross the \nUnited Kingdom, of energy across Great Britain and of water\n in Scotland. It has a wider role in applying learning and insight across other regulated markets.\n \nWe use evidence, analysis and argument to put consumers at the heart of policy-making and market b\nehaviour.\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;Consumer Futures \nworks\n to protect and promote the interests of consumers in \nregulated markets\n. Our role is not only to consider current issues facing consumers, but to look ahead to the potential for problem\ns\n or opportunities \nand \nidentify action to be taken\n.\n&#xa0;\nAs the designated universal service provider, \nRoyal Mail provides an essential service to consumers and businesses across the UK. The arguments for private or public ownership must be judged in terms of what is the best way to\n maintain and improve that service.\n&#xa0;\nWhether in private or public ownership, consumers and businesses needs for value and \nquality services from Royal Mail are the same.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPostal services across the UK face significant challenges from the\n incre\nasing use of digital technology;\n the consequential reduction in letter volu\nmes and increase in parcel mail;\n \nand the changing needs of users.\n Growth\n in market competition presents \nrisks and opportunities for Royal Mail. Whether in the public or privat\ne sector, understanding and responding to consumer needs and changing behaviour will be crucial to effectively competing in the market and sustaining a universal postal service.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOFCOM’s primary duty, \nto secure the universal postal service, should not be c\nonflated with protecting the financial position of Royal Mail. It will be nece\nssary to ensure that Royal Mail \nprovides an efficient service\n. \nOFCOM must apply rigorous monitoring and assessment processes to ensur\ne consumers are not left liable \nfor the price\n of corporate failure. Exercising its duties in securing the universal service; promoting competition; assessing affordability; and ensuring vulnerable consumers, especially in remote and rural locations, have access to this essential service is incumbent \nupon OFCOM regardless of the nature of the ownership of Royal Mail.  \n \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail’s \ncontractual \nrelationship with Post Office Ltd (POL) is only one facet of an environment in which \nPOL will \nincreasingly \nneed to be able to offer commercially competitive pr\noducts and services which meet the needs of consumers\n, at a time and place of their convenience\n.\n The contract between Royal Mail and POL is not altered by any change in Royal Mail ownership.  \n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUntil relatively recently, Royal Mail had enjoyed a dominant position in the \npostal services\n market which provided a relatively secure revenue base for its operations. However, full liberalisation of the mail market in 2006, electronic substitution \nof letters and changes in the composition of mail volumes have altered the landscape\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUpstream competition, where mail is collected and sorted by an access operator\n and then delivered via Royal Mail\n, has grown at a far greater rate than end-to-end\n competition\n (\ncollection, sorting and \ndelivery\n by another postal operator\n). In 2011, \npostal regulator, \nOFCOM noted that around 40 per cent of mail volumes, excluding parcels, were currently \ncollected\n and sorted\n \nby access operators but delivered by Royal Ma\nil. This was in sharp contrast with end-to-end competitors who delivered less than 1 per cent of letters and large letters\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite \nTNT UK commencing, in April 2012, the expansion of its \naccess operation to \noffer its customers end-to-end \nservices \nin \nWest London\n,\n with reported delivery volumes as of\n December \n2012 \nat an average of 345,000 items per week\n,\n \ni\nnformation provided by PostNL \nto OFCOM, to facilitate its analysis of end-to-end competition, highlights that, due to cash constraints, it would need\n €50 to €80 million of external investment in order to be able to complete a full rollout of end-to-end services in the UK\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is no\n information \navailable \npublicly \nidentifying\n if and when Post NL might realise \nits\n desired investment and ambition\n for\n a\n full rollout of end-to-end services in the UK\n.\n There is, however, no expectation from the regulator that those plans will be achieved in the short to medium term with\n OF\nCOM\n stat\ning\n \nthat \n‘under current projections TNT Post’s market share is expected to be \nlow in the early years of its [business] plan’\n and that\n,\n \nas the \nbusiness model has yet to be tested\n, it is\n therefore \n‘\nnecessary to recognise there is a degree of uncertainty around TNT Post’s business plan’\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile e\nnd\n-\nto\n-\nend competition has a \nsignificantly \ngreater impact on Royal Mail revenues \nthan access competition – with \nRoyal Mail \nstill \nretain\ning some \n85 to 90% of revenue\ns\n from access mail\n - \ncompetition \nacross\n the postal market can provide \ndistinct \nbenefits to \nconsumers\n. \nT\nhe initial competitive entry \nby TNT\n UK\n \nhas already demonstrated \none of the\n benefits of competition\n – Royal \nMail \nrecently \nannounced significant investment in barcode technology which will allow business customers to electronically track delivery of their le\ntters\n, \na value-added service originally offered by\n TNT UK in its West London operations\n.\n \nValue-added, competitive and innovative products which appeal to business customers, and therefore helps \nretain\n \nor win\n their custom, assists in securing the financial\n viability of a universal service for residential and business consumers alike. \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDecline in mail volumes is well documented. In 2010, the updated review\n of the postal services sector carried out by Richard Hooper for the Department for Business, Innovati\non \nand Skills noted that in 2005 the average Royal Mail daily mail bag contained 84 million addressed letters, packets and parcels but that by 2010 this was down to 71 million items. The following year, OFCOM identified that \nthe UK postal sector had seen the steepest decline in volumes of any \nEuropean country, falling by 25% since 2006, with Royal Mail volumes now approximately 62 million items per day\n.\n The updated review by Richard Hooper also notes that \n‘Royal Mail predicts\n a further decline in Royal Mail addressed inland letter traffic volumes of over 20% between 2010/11 and 2015/16’\n.\n Royal Mail’\ns \nrecent \npreliminary results for 2012-2103 report an 8% drop in addressed letter volumes from 2011-2012 \nwith \nsome\n 14,079 million \naddressed letters \nhandled by Royal Mail in \nyear\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail has nevertheless recorded an increase in parcel volumes and revenues. Figures from \nthe 2012-13\n preliminary \nresults\n show\n an increase from 1,016m parcels \nin 2011-12\n to 1,081m\n parcel\ns\n in 2012-13\n, \nan increase of 65m.\n Parcel revenue figures \ndepict\n a 13% year-on-year increase between 2011-12 and 2012-13, rising to some £2,979m of the total £7,766m UK Parcels, International &amp; Letters (UKPIL) business. \nWhile not sufficient to offset decline in other mai\nl volumes, internet retail distribution has provided positive growth for parcel carriers. \n&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRapid change and innovation is however taking place in both the mode of delivery for some retail products which had contributed to growth in parcel volumes – such a\ns books, audio &amp; video content which are being digitally downloaded\n or streamed\n in ever greater numbers – and in providing greater convenience of delivery for other, non-digitisable, products – such as clothing\n and e\nlectronic equipment\n – with the expansion\n of click &amp; collect services and pick-up point services. \n&#xa0;\n2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile parcel volumes and revenue have increased for Royal Mail in this more competitive sector of the \npostal\n market, innovations and changing consumer behaviour in relation to the delivery of retai\nl products purchased online presents further risks to Royal Mail’s delivery volumes, which could in turn weaken growth or reduce income or profits in \ndelivery\n revenues.\n&#xa0;\n2.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe capability, capacity and drive to innovate are critical components for any market \nplayer looking to offer a consumer-focussed postal service. Retaining postal communication and delivery as a credible choice in an increasingly digital world also requires the availability of value-for-money, affordable products and services which meet the\n needs and demands of consumers and business customers.  \n&#xa0;\n2.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur research report, Sense and Sustainability\n, interrogated residential and SME consumers’ needs from the postal service over the medium-term. We found that residential consumers expect greater innovation in terms of the delivery options for packets and parcels, including extending the number of pick\n up points, longer opening hours and more convenient locations – including pre-specified locations such as pubs or corner shops. SME consumers would like to see a range of delivery options offered, as is currently the case with all major courier companies,\n such as timed deliveries. \n&#xa0;\n2.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt will be incumbent upon Royal Mail to be able to respond to these challenges in order to continue to fulfil its role as the designated universal service provider. It will need to offer innovative, cost-effective products and \ndelivery solutions and maintain a dynamic approach \nto a changing market and evolving consumer needs. Failure to adapt and respond to these challenges could have an adverse impact on the sustainability of the universal postal service and the ability of Roya\nl Mail to deliver that service.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail is subject to a declining market share of a declining \nletters \nmarket. Against this backdrop, Government identified securing a sustainable universal postal service as th\ne central tenet of its postal policy and primary duty of the postal services regulator. Adopting the recommendations of the Hooper review, Government enacted the strategy it would employ and actions it would take in pursuit of this objective via the Postal\n Services Act 2011, including specifically allowing for private investment in Royal Mail; the transfer of the historic R\noyal Mail pension \ndeficit to Government; and reform of the regulatory framework.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Postal Services Act, 2011, also explicitly sets o\nut the minimum services that must be included in a universal postal service. The requirements set out in \nSection 31 of \nthe Act are for provision of:\n              \n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail\n, as the sole designated universal service provider,\n \nis obliged to provide \nthese services as a minimum. It\ns \ncontinuing \nability to do\n so\n \nis \na significant consideration for OFCOM \nand was an important feature of the debate surrounding recent legislative a\nnd regulatory changes.\n \nThe new regulatory framework\n \nspecifically p\ne\nr\nmits\n OFCOM\n \nto take \nproportionate \nsteps to \nprotect the \nsustainability\n \nof the universal service or \naddress any “unfair”\n financial burden on a universal service provider\n in its provision\n of the universal service\n.\n It should however be noted that there is no definitive analysis\n from OFCOM\n, as yet, as to whether \nprovision of \nthe universal postal service is a net cost \nor net profit for\n Royal Mail\n or \nany assessment of the\n indirect impact \nof providing the universal postal service \non the \nprofitability of Royal Mail\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM\neasures available \nto OFCOM\n to protect the universal service, \nshould that\n be deemed necessary, \ninclude\n:\n imposition of General Universal\n Service Conditions (GUSC) on other end-to-end competitors\n \n– conditions such as \nan\n \nobligation to deliver a minimum \nnumber of days \nper week to each address\n in the area of operation or imposition of a minimum geographic coverage requirement on a given operator;\n the creation of a Universal\n Service c\nompensation fund\n – where contributions could \nbe \nrequired\n from other postal operators or \nfrom \nadditional \ncharges p\naid by \nconsumers\n; \nalteration of the \nobligations requiring Royal Mail to provide other operators with \naccess \nto its delivery network or imposing ‘access’ conditions on other postal operators obliging them to allow Royal Mail, and others, access to their del\nivery network; and \nthe tendering out of\n \nelements of the universal service which were found to be a financial burden on the current designated universal service provider\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOFCOM\n \nalso has a general duty to encourage competition in postal services, providing\n that does not interfere with its primary duty to safeguard the universal service, with a view to delivering better outcomes for consumers.\n \nOf note, in \nrespect\n of consideration of its primary and additional duties following notification from TNT UK about i\nts trial end-to-end delivery \nservice, OFCOM stated that \n‘On the basis of the evidence provided to us and the analysis we have conducted, we do not consider it necessary to exercise our regulatory powers now to impose any new conditions (including the impos\nition of General Universal Service Conditions) for, or in connection with, securi\nng the universal postal service’\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCompetition \nin the provision of postal services has opened the door to innovation and\n choice for consumers and business customers. While \nthere has been some concern expressed publicly that competition in the postal services market could lead to adverse impacts on Royal Mail, and its ability to deliver the universal postal service, the suite of measures available to OFCOM to safeguard the un\niversal service are capable of mitigating any potential adverse impacts.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsumer \nFutures would\n,\n in fact\n,\n caution that ill-considered use of these measures could lead to less favourable outcome\ns\n for consumers through, for instance, the stifling or restriction of competition in the postal services market or the creation of a perverse incentive on Royal Mail to not address inefficiencies as competitors providing lower cost services could find thems\nelf liable for providing subsidy to Royal Mail, thereby forcing them to either keep prices artificially high to avoid the subsidy situation or increase prices to afford payment of a subsidy\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSpecific\n concern\ns\n \nhave also been \nexpressed \nthat\n competitive pre\nssure may see Royal Mail seek to \nwithdraw from \nelements of the universal service \nwhich \nit has been s\nuggested are loss making – such as \ndaily \ndeliveries to remote or rural areas – or to rebalance tariffs in a way which rai\nses prices for rural consumers. However, \nas mentioned above in section 3.2, \nt\nhe\n existence of a uniform tariff and six-day-a-\nweek collection and delivery\n service as part of the \nminimum requirements of the \nuniversal postal service\n is enshrined in \nprimary leg\nislation.\n Were Royal Mail to find itself financially burden\ned\n by these specific requirements of the universal service then OFCOM is able, as mentioned in section 3.4 above, to take steps to ensure these requirements are met. \n \n&#xa0;\n3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOFCOM’s primary duty\n, and th\ne tools and mechanisms available to it, \nto secure the universal postal service and\n ensure the mini\nmum requirements of the service are\n met\n,\n \nare not \naltered\n by, and have no impact upon, the \nnature of the \nownership of Royal Mail.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile OFCOM’s primary duty to secure a sustainable universal postal service is welcome, protection of the universal postal service should not be conflated with protecting Royal Mail’s revenues. OFCOM is required to have regard not only \nto the fin\nancial sustainability \nof the universal service but also its efficient provision. It also has a duty to ensure that the\n uniform tariff for\n universal postal service \nproducts \nis\n affordable\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile Royal Mail is the\n \nsole \ndesignated\n universal service provider, its economic viability remains a significant factor in sustaining the universal postal service. The Royal Mail modernisation programme, which began in 2006-07, has seen action taken to decrease costs and increase efficiency but\n as OFCOM notes, \n‘Since volumes have started to decline in 2006, Royal Mail has in most years been unable to reduce costs at a sufficient pace to offset the rate of decline in its revenues’\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoyal Mail’s \nmost recent financial statements \nshow that in the UK Parcels, International and Letters (UKPIL) business, \nsignificant investment continues to be made in pursuit of \nmodernisation with e.g. the deployment of automation equipment. However, these \nstatements\n also show that\n the \nmodernisation pr\nogramme is not \ndelivering the anticipated\n \ncost savings in other expenditure areas. For example, people costs \nincreased by 4.6%\n \nbetween 2011-12 and 2012-13 over a period when there was also a 46% increase in “property and project” costs\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnless \nable to deliver efficiency \ngains that exceed the effect of volume decline,\n Royal Mail is likely to fi\nnd itself in a vicious cycle of \nha\nving\n to \nincrease\n prices\n \nfor consumers \nwhich in turn is likely to \nfurther \nsuppress demand, \nleading to additional \nvolume de\ncline. Unit costs would increase \nwhich subsequently puts\n \neven \ngreater\n \nupward pressure on prices.\n The continued viability of an \naffordable univ\nersal service would be at stake\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRigorous\n monitoring and analysis of the progress of the modernisation programme in driving efficiencies must be undertaken \nby OFCOM \ntogether with the application of robust \npressure on\n Royal Mail to make efficiency gains\n. C\nonsumers \nshould not have to \nface increased\n prices \nor reduced standards \nas a result of corporate failure\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOFCOM\n \nwill also need to carefully scrutinise and continuously monitor \nthe effects of price rises on the affordability of mail services, pa\nrticularly for those \nconsumers \nwho rely on the postal service. \nThe impact of any substantial increase in price could accelerate \nthe switch away from using mail\n in turn putting greater strain on the financing of the universal postal service, or cause those who can least afford any increa\nse and cannot use alternate means\n – such as low-income, low-internet users – to \nbear a disproportionate amount of the cost\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nn April 2012\n,\n OFCOM\n reformed the price control framework for\n \nRoyal Mail with\n \nmost price controls removed. As a result of evidenc\ne and representations from Consumer Focus and \nothers at the time, \nOFCOM\n extended the\n safeguard cap on Second Cl\nass Standard Letters to include \nLarge Letters, packets and parcels up to 2kg\n sent Second Class,\n in \nan attempt\n to ensure there would always be a\nt \nleast o\nn\ne\n affordable \noption \nfor consumers. T\nhere\n remains, however, \nsignificant scope for \nfurther \nprice rises for \nthese additional products now covered by the safeguard cap.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn establishing the safeguard cap, \nOFCOM \nassessed that the price parameters did\n n\not raise affordability concerns for small business or residential customers\n. However, with \nsome vulnerable consumer\n \nsegments \nmore \nliable to rely\n \non postal services – and \ntherefore\n more captive to price rises and more negatively\n impacted by them – than \nothers\n,\n OFCOM will require to be proactive in assessing whether price rises in stamps and basic mail products are causing financial difficulty across \nthe diversity of \nconsumer and SME segments\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhether Royal Mail is in public or private ownership, \nOFCOM\n must \nremain v\nigilant in its monitoring of prices and efficiencies to ensure that Royal Mail is not \npermitted to raise\n prices without making the \ncost \nefficiencies necessa\nry to ensure the sustainability \nof the universal\n postal\n service.\n Consumer needs and a thorough understanding of\n \nconsumer behaviour \nmust be at the centre of regulatory policy development\n \nwith\n any proposed changes \nconsidered in \nthe context of their direct and indirect impacts on consumers\n and on the \nsustainability \nof a \nu\nniversal \npostal \nservice\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFollowing f\normal separation of Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd \n(POL) \nin April 2012, \nwith each forming a separate legal entity, \ntheir relationship is now governed by commercial contracts. A financially \nsignificant\n \ncontractual\n arrangement remains between \nthe two organisations \nin respect of \nretail postal services and in respect of \nmail access \nand distribution \npoints.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOFCOM specify\n certain mail access and distribution requirements, \nwithin the conditions imposed on Royal Mail as the designated universal ser\nvice provider\n,\n in order to meet the legislative requirements relating to the collection \nand delivery of mail. Royal Mail fulfils aspects of those \nconditions \nvia the Mails Distribution Agreement \nwith \nPOL\n.\n Additionally, Royal Mail is the only postal operator to use POL, and therefore local Post Office branches, as either a retailer of postal se\nrvices or as an acceptance or collection point for postal items.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile not a party to the contract, Government has\n \nstated\n that the Mails Distribution Agreement \n‘will continue in force for a period of at least ten years from its commencement date – 26 Mar\nch 2012’\n.\n It has also confirmed that there is provision for a review of the terms of the agreement, five years into its duration, and that either party \n‘may seek a review of the agreement’s terms ... where there has been a material adverse effect on POL o\nr Royal Mail\n’\n. \nFurthermore, Governm\nent has also confirmed that there are limited circumstances, reflecting contractual law and practice, under which the agreement could be terminated by either party – such as persistent or material breach of the agreement\n by the other party\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPressures already exist on POL to modernise their offering in the postal service market with increased competition in both the retail \npostal services sector\n and\n the parcel acceptance and collection sector\n. \nAdditional challenges \nalso exist for POL\n \n– for \nexample, \nthe current contract with the Department for Work &amp; Pensions for the payment of welfare benefits and pensions \nthrough post office branches \nis scheduled to end in 2015, with a possible extension to 2017. Any new contract fo\nr the provision of these payment services would be subject to procurement regulations and open competition.\n&#xa0;\n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRegardless of the nature\n of, or any change in, \nthe ownership of Royal Mail, POL will need to \nbe able to \nrespond to \nthese\n pressures\n and challenges\n and offer commercially competitive products and services which meet the needs of consumers and their desired quality and convenience\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
