[[[Additional follow up written evidence from Public Health England (PHE0022)]]]

[[[Information requested from Public Health England]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I am writing to provide the further information I promised the Committee during the oral evidence session on 19 November.  I undertook to provide further information in relation to:&#xa0;The Committee also expressed an interest in hearing from me on PHE’s views on NHS England’s proposals in relation to NHS allocations policy.  I will write separately on this issue following the discussions we have scheduled with NHS England in the next few days.&#xa0;

[[[PHE’s Knowledge and Intelligence Service]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]On 1 April 2013 the regional Public Health Observatories (PHOs) transferred along with the specialist observatories and the National Cancer Intelligence Network into PHE as a single Knowledge and Intelligence service for England.&#xa0;The historical role of the PHOs remains fundamentally unchanged and is now carried out by PHE’s eight Knowledge and Intelligence Teams.  We are building on the highly regarded work of our predecessor organisations to ensure we have a knowledge service to ensure decisions we make about health are based on the best information and evidence available and allow us to secure the best possible outcome.&#xa0;PHE continues to produce a range of interactive resources, reports and profiling tools to help local government and the health service understand health need, make comparisons with other areas and make informed decisions.  A flavour of our work is given by the brief description of some of our key products set out in Annex A.&#xa0;All of our resources remain accessible on-line through PHE’s website: (www.gov.uk/PHE) and our data and knowledge portal (www.datagateway.phe.org.uk) which allows access to resources across the 140 legacy sites that previously supported the full range of our products.  All legacy sites will be migrated to a new single site.  We are currently working with our users to identify their needs and with the Government Digital Service on the design of the new site. &#xa0;PHE will work closely with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to ensure access to high quality public health evidence and advice.  NICE is responsible for setting quality standards for health, social care and public health. PHE will ensure full integration of evidence resources from the NICE evidence service into the PHE Knowledge service.  Our Knowledge service will also include evidence and guidance from other sources such as the National Screening Committee and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and immunisation.

[[[&#xa0;]]]If any members of the Committee have any queries about the Knowledge and Intelligence Service, our products, or information needs, please contact our Chief Knowledge Officer, Professor John Newton (john.newton@phe.gov.uk) who would be delighted to help.

[[[The Evidence on the impact of Minimum Unit Pricing]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]There is strong evidence to support alcohol Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) as an effective strategy to reduce alcohol consumption and alcohol related harms.  The largest impacts would be experienced by hazardous drinkers with somewhat smaller impacts on moderate drinkers.&#xa0;The latest modelling work by the experts at the University of Sheffield, published in July this year, looks at the impact on consumption and alcohol related harms of a minimum unit price of 40p, 45p and 50p.  Their key findings are set out in the table below, and their full report can be found at (here). &#xa0;

[[[PHE’s review of the h]]]

[[[ealth impacts of shale gas extraction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]In relation to our discussion on the health impact of shale gas extraction there were three points the Committee wanted me to comment further on.&#xa0;The first was the request to see the evidence that we considered as part of our review.  The full list of references is set out at Annex B.  We used the best available international information about the process of shale gas extraction to estimate the likely emissions from shale gas extraction, as operated in the context of the UK regulatory environment, and evaluate any health risks associated with those emissions.  Although shale gas extraction is itself a relatively new process, the substances involved in any emissions, and many of the industrial processes are not new and their risks are well characterised.  For that reason we were able to draw firm conclusions about risk in relation to chemical and radiological emissions, albeit with some caveats.&#xa0;The Committee expressed concerns over the nature of some of the chemicals that may be used in shale gas extraction.  The UK will adopt a risk-based approach to the use of chemicals, and will assess the requirements for each development proposal on a site-by-site basis.  Any chemicals proposed for use in shale gas extraction fluid need not only to be publically disclosed, but will also be risk assessed prior to use by the Environment Agency, with subsequent peer review by the joint agencies groundwater directive advisory group (which includes PHE).&#xa0;I would also like to provide further information on the origin and governance of the report.  Our predecessor, the Health Protection Agency (HPA), initiated the review in early 2012 in response to requests for advice on the potential health impacts of shale gas extraction from a wide range of stakeholders including Local Authorities, Directors of Public Health, NHS bodies and members of the public.  The HPA proposal for a review, and its proposed scope, was endorsed by a range of UK public health bodies and environmental regulators.  On  1 April 2013 PHE took on the functions of the HPA.  PHE agreed the review should continue, and that PHE would publish the results.  Any other decision would have called into question the ability of our scientists to contribute to public debate on the basis of the evidence.&#xa0;We consider the findings of our review to be valid and robust within the scope of the draft report, and note that they are consistent with the conclusions reached in a recent Royal Society report into hydraulic fracturing (see link http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/shale-gas-extraction/report).&#xa0;

[[[PHE Workforce]]]&#xa0;The committee requested additional information on the detailed breakdown of PHE’s workforce.  These are set out in Annexes C &amp; D. We employ a wide range of scientific, technical, professional and medical staff, on an equally diverse range of activities.  These range from specialised roles in reference laboratories, high containment facilities, pathology testing for the NHS and vaccine production to the delivery of screening programmes and public health support to Local Authorities and the NHS.  We would be happy to provide further details of our activities and their impact. I hope this further information is of help to the committee.  We stand ready to provide any further material you may find helpful.  I would like to thank the Committee for the opportunity to talk to you about what PHE does, and look forward to continuing our conversation.&#xa0;December 2013
