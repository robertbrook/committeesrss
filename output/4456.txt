[[[Written evidence from Eating Better: for a fair, green, healthy future]]]&#xa0;

[[[Introduction:]]]&#xa0;Eating Better: for a fair, green, healthy future is a UK alliance that is raising awareness of the need for food policies that put sustainable food consumption at the heart of solutions to national and global food security challenges.&#xa0;We are calling for action by governments, the food industry and all those who can make a difference to help people move towards eating less meat and more food that’s better for us and the planet, as part of the vital task of creating sustainable food and farming systems.&#xa0;Launched in July 2013 with the endorsement of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Eating Better’s growing support includes 36 national organisations and partner networks spanning the breadth of health, environment, social justice, animal welfare, international development, resource use, sustainable business and faith perspectives. (see Appendix 1)&#xa0;Eating Better encourages a culture where we place greater value on the food we eat, the animals that provide it and the people who produce it.&#xa0; Eating Better supports farmers who produce meat in a sustainable way. Eating Better has called for a global conversation about meat consumption, which has as its goal a world in which everyone values and has access to healthy, humane and sustainable diets.&#xa0; High meat consuming countries and individuals have reduced their consumption in line with health recommendations and greenhouse gas reduction targets.&#xa0; Meat is produced humanely and sustainably, its production provides sustainable livelihoods, environmental benefits and it is consumed in quantities consistent with good health and global resource use capacity.&#xa0;We welcome the Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs Committee’s Inquiry into food security.  Our submission has been prepared in consultation with our supporting organisations and partner networks.  &#xa0;Our response addresses Q1: How best to improve UK (and EU) food security, including using resources more efficiently and Q7: Ways of increasing self sufficiency in products for which the UK has a comparative advantage.&#xa0;

Policy-makers should recognise that more proactive measures affecting the demand and production of meat may be required should current trends in global consumption continue to rise.” (page 22)&#xa0;

[[[or addressing consumption is compelling]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ‘Most of the world’s people consume more milk and meat than necessary, and many consume more than is healthy. Obtaining calories and protein through animal products is also highly inefficient from a resource use standpoint. … We project an 82 percent increase in meat consumption between 2006 and 2050, and holding down growth in consumption by the world’s upper and growing middle class would reduce land demands and greenhouse gas emissions…..Yet this menu item may be necessary not to close the food gap but just to keep it from growing larger. … High-consuming regions will probably need to eat less meat just to provide room within the FAO projections for billions of people in low-consuming regions to eat a little more.’

To enable consumers to make informed decisions, Defra needs to do more work on what are the most sustainable methods of livestock production, and the balance to be struck between animal welfare, biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions, and the need to conserve inputs such as water.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;This submission has been coordinated by: Sue DibbCoordinatorEating Better: for a fair, green, healthy futureEmail: sue@eating-better.orgWebsite: www.eating-better.org&#xa0;December 2013
