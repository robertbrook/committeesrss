default&#xa0;defaultAFS0074defaultWritten evidence submitted by the Anti Academies Alliance (AAA)default1. Introductiondefault1.1 The Anti Academies Alliance is a national campaign group that supports local campaigners
default opposed to academy conver
defaultsion. (More details about our work can be found at 
defaultwww.antiacademies.org.uk
default )
default. Whilst we have views on 
defaultall 
defaultthe questions asked in the terms of reference
default, we have chosen to focus on 2 main
default points raised with u
defaults by local parents
default in recent weeks
default. These relate mainly to the process of academy conversion – forced or ‘voluntary’.
default We have included 
default3 
defaultappendices which are 
defaultreports/statement
defaults relating to
default recent academy conversion processes. We have included them 
defaultwith som
defaulte editing and with names redacted
default.
default They are the thoughts of b
defaultusy parents
default often working without adequate information. Their voices should be heard.
default1.2 The AAA remains opposed to academy conversions. We are not opposed to schools – once they have become aca
defaultdemies. We want every school to flourish. Howeve
defaultr 
defaultwe continue to reject the political ideology that lies behind academy conversion – voluntary or forced. In essence academy conversion is about a ‘supply-side revolution’
default (a
defaults the 2009 Tory party manifesto 
defaultnoted). It seeks to open up the public sector to private interests. Yet there remains no credible evidence that this leads to sustained improvement in schools. Th
defaultus th
defaulte Secretary of State’s political ideology is trumping evidence based policy. It is aliena
defaultting parents and staff, but worse still it threatens 
defaultthe best interest of this and future 
defaultgeneration
defaults of children
default.
default The sobering experience of two decades of market driven reforms in Sweden should be 
defaultenough to
default persuade the government to halt these reforms. 
defaultRegrettably, the Coalition is unwilling to listen at the moment. We hope the Select Committee can help make them take note.

default point about t

default’
default in narrowing the
default gap for disadvantaged children
default using the 
defaultavailable
default. She was not able to find any evidence to suggest that it does narrow the gap. Indeed her brief survey shows that some academies a
defaultre limiting opportunities by reducing the proportion of children with SEN. 
default2.2
default 
defaultBy c
defaultomparing the percentages of the SEN figures for ac
defaultademies between 2008 and 2010 it is possible to see
default that, on average, a
defaultcadem
defaulties are reducing the proportion
default of children wh
defaulto have special needs.

defaultin special needs are: 
defaultSt Aidan's Academy, -21%; Harris Academy, South Norwood, -15%; Havelock Academy, - 15%; New Line Learning, - 12%.
default2.4
default 
defaultWhy are SEN numbers falling in academies? Is it a change in intake? The AAA believes i
defaultt is likely that these figures
default are the consequence of the failure to ensure academies were 
defaultadequately 
defaultcovered by the SEN 
defaultlaw and 
defaultregulations. Although this has now apparently been corrected, the AAA
default has received
default complaints from parents about academies ‘weeding out’ SEN students, includ
defaulting those with disabilities. The 
defaultdanger is that ‘
defaultautonomy
default’ may allow academies to
default conti
defaultnue to do this
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3default. The process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors default3
default.1 
defaultOur second concern relates 
defaultto the
default process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors
default. The current process is undemocratic, dismissive of other stakeholder views and a centrally co
defaultntrolled – rather than locally-
defaultcontrolled pr
defaultocess.
default3
default.2 
defaultT
defaulthe Secretary of State
default is riding roughshod over the views of 
defaultlocal 
defaultstakeholders rather than seeking to ‘win’ an educational argument by engaging in genuine consultation and democratic decision making. There is a presumption that academy conversi
defaulton is always the best solution. The 
defaultmanner in which unaccountable brokers pressurise governors to ‘opt for’ academy status has been described to us as like having a ‘gun put to your head’. 
defaultIn these cases, ‘forced’ academy conversion becomes ‘voluntary’. As
default the process lacks both genuine accountability and any transparency, parents are often suspicious of the conversion process.
default3
default.3 
defaultAcademy conversion can actually be a distraction
default for school improvement
default. 
defaultThe time and effort of meeting brokers and potential s
defaultponsors can ta
defaultke the school leadership away from
default the vital task of improving teaching 
defaultand 
defaultlearning. 
default3
default.4 
defaultThere are also concerns about the way Interim Executive Boards (IEBs) are used. It seems that they are sometimes populated with employees/representativ
defaultes of the proposed sponsors. We believe this creates potential conflicts of interest over the decision to convert.
default Similarly there 
defaultis 
defaultconcern
default that academy chains are cherry picking certain 
defaultschools 
defaultfor ‘takeover
default’. Sometimes i
defaultt appears 
defaultthat 
defaultit is not always 
defaultthe schools that are most in need of improvement but schools that are already improving
default that become academies
default. 
default Whilst sponsor can choose whether to take over a school – schools cannot choose whether or not to be taken over. 
default3
default.5 
defaultFinally there are concerns about the experience, viability and accountability of academy chains. There a huge numbers of new chains. Often these are single individual head teachers who ‘morph’ into chains by taking over a couple of local school. They becom
defaulte executive heads and some label themselves CEOs. Their focus becomes building the business. In other cases foreign venture capital lies behind
default head teachers, former council and government education officers. They combine to create companies that have very
default little public face and seemingly no accountability to local people or OFSTED.
default3.6 
defaultIn light of these concerns, the AAA would like to make the following r
defaultecommendations: 
defaultWe believe the
default Select committee should urge the government to
default take immediate steps to:

default joined to

default Primary School” group whose aim is to stop the forced academisation
default of the school. The school was placed in special measures in May 2013, and as a result is being forced down the Academies route by the Department of Education. The Group have set up campaign pages on Social Media, arranged an on-line petition and have been
default busy collecting signatures from the local community. 
default 
defaultOn 2 December 2013, the Group arranged a protest for the visit of the DfE Acade

defaultttended the full meeting

defaultCouncil
default, to seek the support of not just the ruling Labour Group, but also the support of the Conservative members also. The Labour Group offered their support and has promised to investigate the scope for a ballot of parents on the issue. Other
default than support from the Chair of Governors who is a Conservative Councillor, the Group have received no other support from Conservative Councillors, and the local Conservative MP has publicly made his support for the forced academy conversion of the school.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a Group we are extremely concerned that the conversion would have detrimental effects on the children’s education. 
default 
defaultWe want the voice of the parents to be respected and to retain our democratic right to have a say in the running of the school and for
default the school to remain part of the local community, offering a fully inclusive education service and we are fighting to ensure that the parent's voices are heard, understood and respected. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe do not believe that there is evidence that forcing the school t
defaulto become an Academy will raise standards any further and that the school should be run by educators and not through a private sponsor. We do not believe that there is evidence that forcing the school to become an academy will raise standards any further. W
defaulte believe that the leadership of the school has stepped up to the challenges following the previous Ofsted inspection and that significant improvements have been made and will continue to be made through a School Improvement Plan which will aim to remove i
defaultt from the special measures category. Key Stage One results in 2013 show an upward trend from 2012 figures and are comparable to national figures. The numbers of children reaching level 3 at Key Stage One are even higher than national figures. The predicte
defaultd grades for Key Stage Two for the next academic year are expected to be the best results in the school’s history. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is understood that Ms 
default******* 
default will return to the school on January 28 2014 to hand over official papers for the Governors to sign which
default will allow transition to be progressed, and the Group are planning further activity prior to this meeting.

defaultAn Ofsted inspection in June 2013 saw the school downgraded from good to inadequate and a school that requires special measures.

default This was discovered on the first day of

default&#xa0;

default- Director of Education &amp; 
defaultDiocese.
default&#xa0;
default It was fairly well attended and parents were looking for 
defaultwhom
default to be held to account.
default&#xa0;
default As a new parent with no real history of the school I sat quietly only offering one comment at the end which was that all UK teachers cannot suddenly be rubbish and I questioned if Ofsted were always fit for their purpose.
default&#xa0;
default The 
defaultHead
default spoke about the Rapid Action Plan etc and the next steps the school would take.
default&#xa0;
default A couple of parents said the governors should stand down and one questioned the LA's position in all this.
default&#xa0;
default The meeting felt 'staged' and when the word 'academy' was raised i
defaultt was quickly brushed over.
defaultSo I started looking in to the Academies Bill, the amount of primary schools in special measures etc.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSince 6/9 I
default&#xa0;
defaultvisited the Head numerous times concerned that the school may be pursuing academy status.
default&#xa0;
default I was consistently adv
defaultised to go through the Chair of Governors but this proved difficult as she appeared to be too busy to get in touch. Eventually she did ring
default&#xa0;
default-
default she told me that if there was a fight to be had she would have it, that she had lived in the area years and cared 
defaultmuch about the school.
default&#xa0;
default She went on at length about the reasons the previous Head had left wanting to pursue his career etc.
default&#xa0;
default (Gossip says the previous Head did not want to leave and was pushed into doing so - wanted to write a letter to the parents to tel
defaultl them but governors said no and did so themselves).
default&#xa0;
default He is now at
default another C of E School in 
default*******
default.
default&#xa0;
default I told her I didn't see why it should 
defaultbecome
default an academy and she indicated that she wasn't a fan of the government agenda but left me with the distinct imp
defaultression that there was nothing to be done.
default&#xa0;
default I 
defaultsincerely
default told her that in that case I would be happy to support the school as my concerns were raised and I would like to keep an eye on the progress.
default&#xa0;
default And this was how I felt.
default&#xa0;
default Until a couple of day later whe
defaultn my curiosity was aroused again and I looked into it some more.
default&#xa0;
default So I pestered via the poor Head to get some meetings set up to discuss the pros and cons of academy status - my main concern being the parents were unaware of any of this.
default&#xa0;
default Eventually, 3 inf
defaultormation sessions were held on the week commencing the 21/10 - chaired by the rep of the s
defaultponsor to be Canon 
default******* 
defaultfrom C of E 
default******* 
defaultAcademies
default Trust.
default&#xa0;
default I was told they took so long to organise as they were waiting for the Canon to have free dates.
default&#xa0;
default I at
defaulttended one of the meetings and asked if they had 
defaultvoted to become an academy- 
default******
default* 
defaultsaid
default yes.
default&#xa0;
default I asked if this was because otherwise they would be forced - again she said yes. The meetings were very poorly attended and barely advertised -
default&#xa0;
defaultjust a 
defaultline in
default t
defaulthe school newsletter.
default&#xa0;
default So no consultation was 
defaultachieved
default here.
defaultI have made various requests such as looking at the minutes, to meet with the Chair etc all of which have been constantly blocked.
default&#xa0;
default The Head has told me a few weeks ago that she is in the middle 
defaultand yet I have been forced to go to her as an initial contact.
default&#xa0;
default It was only after writing a letter to the Chair requesting a response re a 
defaultmeeting
default within seven days (or further action) that a meeting was arranged.
default&#xa0;
default A complaint was sent to 
defaultGove that was sig
defaultned for (by 
default*******
default) at midday on 18/11 and one also to the Chair - no response as yet.
default&#xa0;
default At the meeting I asked if they could publish the 
defaultcontents
default of the meetings so at least all parents could benefit from what had been said - they said they could - we are
default still waiting.
default&#xa0;
default I offered to help explain to the parents - Chair muttered should all go through the govs.
default&#xa0;
default In Chairs response letter to a meeting she advised me the minutes were ready for me to view via the school office by 
defaultappointment
default. So I made an app
defaultoi
defaultntmen
defaultt keen to look prior to meeting the Chair.
default&#xa0;
default All there was available was the 10th Oct extraordinary 
defaultgovernors
default meeting minutes - where 6 govs voted unanimously for academy status.
default&#xa0;
default It stated that a 
defaultacademy
default order would be requested 
defaultetc.
default and DfE
default broker held a question and answer session.
default&#xa0;
default So I went to m
defaulteet the Chair and Canon 
default******
default* 
defaulton
default 5th Dec at the church having viewed these minutes on 3rd Dec.
default&#xa0;
default I asked for a consultation for the parents as 
defaultthere
default has not been one and was told until the academy
default order is released and funding agreed no more can be said.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe 
defaultChair threw a comment
default at the end which was both unhealthy and unprofessional and it was obvious 
defaultto me
default that she was exasperated by my challenging the governor's power.
default&#xa0;
default She 
defaulttold
default me 
defaultultimately
default i
defaultt is 
defaultthe
default 
defaultgovernor’s
default 
defaultdecision
default and I told her I understood this and also understood pressure she may be under but felt strongly it is only decent to inform the parents and the 'info sessions' were held well after 
defaultdecision
default had been made.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThis gives me no fai
defaultth in the future management of the school whatever route it takes.
default&#xa0;
default This, is allowed to steam roll ahead is a major blow to local democracy.
default&#xa0;
default The parents haven't had their views sought, respected or even considered - and it isn't just the parents it's the 
defaultfuture parents - there is no parental voice in this at all and there should be!
