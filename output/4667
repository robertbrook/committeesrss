[normal]&#xa0;[bold]AFS0074[bold]Written evidence submitted by the Anti Academies Alliance (AAA)[bold]1. Introduction[bold]1.1 The Anti Academies Alliance is a national campaign group that supports local campaigners
[normal] opposed to academy conver
[normal]sion. (More details about our work can be found at 
[normal]www.antiacademies.org.uk
[normal] )
[normal]. Whilst we have views on 
[normal]all 
[normal]the questions asked in the terms of reference
[normal], we have chosen to focus on 2 main
[normal] points raised with u
[normal]s by local parents
[normal] in recent weeks
[normal]. These relate mainly to the process of academy conversion – forced or ‘voluntary’.
[normal] We have included 
[normal]3 
[normal]appendices which are 
[normal]reports/statement
[normal]s relating to
[normal] recent academy conversion processes. We have included them 
[normal]with som
[normal]e editing and with names redacted
[normal].
[normal] They are the thoughts of b
[normal]usy parents
[normal] often working without adequate information. Their voices should be heard.
[normal]1.2 The AAA remains opposed to academy conversions. We are not opposed to schools – once they have become aca
[normal]demies. We want every school to flourish. Howeve
[normal]r 
[normal]we continue to reject the political ideology that lies behind academy conversion – voluntary or forced. In essence academy conversion is about a ‘supply-side revolution’
[normal] (a
[normal]s the 2009 Tory party manifesto 
[normal]noted). It seeks to open up the public sector to private interests. Yet there remains no credible evidence that this leads to sustained improvement in schools. Th
[normal]us th
[normal]e Secretary of State’s political ideology is trumping evidence based policy. It is aliena
[normal]ting parents and staff, but worse still it threatens 
[normal]the best interest of this and future 
[normal]generation
[normal]s of children
[normal].
[normal] The sobering experience of two decades of market driven reforms in Sweden should be 
[normal]enough to
[normal] persuade the government to halt these reforms. 
[normal]Regrettably, the Coalition is unwilling to listen at the moment. We hope the Select Committee can help make them take note.
[normal]2[bold].[bold] T[bold]he effectiveness of [bold]‘[bold]academisation[bold]’[bold] in narrowing the gap[bold] [bold]for disadvantaged children[bold]2.1
[normal] 
[normal]O
[normal]ne of our vo
[normal]lunteers attempted to ans
[normal]wer this
[normal] point about t
[normal]he effectiveness of 
[normal]‘
[normal]academisation
[normal]’
[normal] in narrowing the
[normal] gap for disadvantaged children
[normal] using the 
[normal]available
[normal]. She was not able to find any evidence to suggest that it does narrow the gap. Indeed her brief survey shows that some academies a
[normal]re limiting opportunities by reducing the proportion of children with SEN. 
[normal]2.2
[normal] 
[normal]By c
[normal]omparing the percentages of the SEN figures for ac
[normal]ademies between 2008 and 2010 it is possible to see
[normal] that, on average, a
[normal]cadem
[normal]ies are reducing the proportion
[normal] of children wh
[normal]o have special needs.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal] 
[normal]Some individual academies stand 
[normal]out in ter
[normal]ms of the reduction
[normal] of those who were statemented or on school action plus: 
[normal]Harris Academy, East Dulwich - 12.4%; John Madejski Academy, -18.3%; Paddington Academy, -19.3%; Havelock Academy, -10.6%.
[normal] Those whi
[normal]ch stand out for an overall reduction
[normal] 
[normal]in special needs are: 
[normal]St Aidan's Academy, -21%; Harris Academy, South Norwood, -15%; Havelock Academy, - 15%; New Line Learning, - 12%.
[normal]2.4
[normal] 
[normal]Why are SEN numbers falling in academies? Is it a change in intake? The AAA believes i
[normal]t is likely that these figures
[normal] are the consequence of the failure to ensure academies were 
[normal]adequately 
[normal]covered by the SEN 
[normal]law and 
[normal]regulations. Although this has now apparently been corrected, the AAA
[normal] has received
[normal] complaints from parents about academies ‘weeding out’ SEN students, includ
[normal]ing those with disabilities. The 
[normal]danger is that ‘
[normal]autonomy
[normal]’ may allow academies to
[normal] conti
[normal]nue to do this
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]. The process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors [bold]3
[normal].1 
[normal]Our second concern relates 
[normal]to the
[normal] process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors
[normal]. The current process is undemocratic, dismissive of other stakeholder views and a centrally co
[normal]ntrolled – rather than locally-
[normal]controlled pr
[normal]ocess.
[normal]3
[normal].2 
[normal]T
[normal]he Secretary of State
[normal] is riding roughshod over the views of 
[normal]local 
[normal]stakeholders rather than seeking to ‘win’ an educational argument by engaging in genuine consultation and democratic decision making. There is a presumption that academy conversi
[normal]on is always the best solution. The 
[normal]manner in which unaccountable brokers pressurise governors to ‘opt for’ academy status has been described to us as like having a ‘gun put to your head’. 
[normal]In these cases, ‘forced’ academy conversion becomes ‘voluntary’. As
[normal] the process lacks both genuine accountability and any transparency, parents are often suspicious of the conversion process.
[normal]3
[normal].3 
[normal]Academy conversion can actually be a distraction
[normal] for school improvement
[normal]. 
[normal]The time and effort of meeting brokers and potential s
[normal]ponsors can ta
[normal]ke the school leadership away from
[normal] the vital task of improving teaching 
[normal]and 
[normal]learning. 
[normal]3
[normal].4 
[normal]There are also concerns about the way Interim Executive Boards (IEBs) are used. It seems that they are sometimes populated with employees/representativ
[normal]es of the proposed sponsors. We believe this creates potential conflicts of interest over the decision to convert.
[normal] Similarly there 
[normal]is 
[normal]concern
[normal] that academy chains are cherry picking certain 
[normal]schools 
[normal]for ‘takeover
[normal]’. Sometimes i
[normal]t appears 
[normal]that 
[normal]it is not always 
[normal]the schools that are most in need of improvement but schools that are already improving
[normal] that become academies
[normal]. 
[normal] Whilst sponsor can choose whether to take over a school – schools cannot choose whether or not to be taken over. 
[normal]3
[normal].5 
[normal]Finally there are concerns about the experience, viability and accountability of academy chains. There a huge numbers of new chains. Often these are single individual head teachers who ‘morph’ into chains by taking over a couple of local school. They becom
[normal]e executive heads and some label themselves CEOs. Their focus becomes building the business. In other cases foreign venture capital lies behind
[normal] head teachers, former council and government education officers. They combine to create companies that have very
[normal] little public face and seemingly no accountability to local people or OFSTED.
[normal]3.6 
[normal]In light of these concerns, the AAA would like to make the following r
[normal]ecommendations: 
[normal]We believe the
[normal] Select committee should urge the government to
[normal] take immediate steps to:

[normal]whose children attend

[normal]* 
[normal]Community
[normal] Primary School in 
[normal]******
[normal]* 
[normal]have
[normal] joined to
[normal]gether to create the “Save 
[normal]******* 
[normal] Primary School” group whose aim is to stop the forced academisation
[normal] of the school. The school was placed in special measures in May 2013, and as a result is being forced down the Academies route by the Department of Education. The Group have set up campaign pages on Social Media, arranged an on-line petition and have been
[normal] busy collecting signatures from the local community. 
[normal] 
[normal]On 2 December 2013, the Group arranged a protest for the visit of the DfE Acade
[normal]mies Broker advisor 
[normal]*******
[normal], who was attending a meeting with Governors to outline the conversion process. MORE than 100 d
[normal]emonstrators assembled outside the School to gre
[normal]et Ms 
[normal]******
[normal]* 
[normal]and
[normal] just as she arrived they broke out into chants, including “Academy, no way”, “What do we want, 
[normal]consultation” and “We love 
[normal]*******
[normal]”. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On 11 December 2013 the Group a
[normal]ttended the full meeting 
[normal]of 
[normal]******
[normal]* 
[normal]Council
[normal], to seek the support of not just the ruling Labour Group, but also the support of the Conservative members also. The Labour Group offered their support and has promised to investigate the scope for a ballot of parents on the issue. Other
[normal] than support from the Chair of Governors who is a Conservative Councillor, the Group have received no other support from Conservative Councillors, and the local Conservative MP has publicly made his support for the forced academy conversion of the school.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As a Group we are extremely concerned that the conversion would have detrimental effects on the children’s education. 
[normal] 
[normal]We want the voice of the parents to be respected and to retain our democratic right to have a say in the running of the school and for
[normal] the school to remain part of the local community, offering a fully inclusive education service and we are fighting to ensure that the parent's voices are heard, understood and respected. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We do not believe that there is evidence that forcing the school t
[normal]o become an Academy will raise standards any further and that the school should be run by educators and not through a private sponsor. We do not believe that there is evidence that forcing the school to become an academy will raise standards any further. W
[normal]e believe that the leadership of the school has stepped up to the challenges following the previous Ofsted inspection and that significant improvements have been made and will continue to be made through a School Improvement Plan which will aim to remove i
[normal]t from the special measures category. Key Stage One results in 2013 show an upward trend from 2012 figures and are comparable to national figures. The numbers of children reaching level 3 at Key Stage One are even higher than national figures. The predicte
[normal]d grades for Key Stage Two for the next academic year are expected to be the best results in the school’s history. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is understood that Ms 
[normal]******* 
[normal] will return to the school on January 28 2014 to hand over official papers for the Governors to sign which
[normal] will allow transition to be progressed, and the Group are planning further activity prior to this meeting.

[normal]******* 
[normal]School, 
[normal]*******
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An Ofsted inspection in June 2013 saw the school downgraded from good to inadequate and a school that requires special measures.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This was discovered on the first day of 
[normal]term early in September.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Two days later on 4th September a Post Ofsted Inspection
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Parent
[normal] Meeting was held.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Prese
[normal]nt were - Revd
[normal]*******
[normal], Chai
[normal]r of Governors, 
[normal]******* 
[normal]- Head, 
[normal]******* 
[normal]- Head of Education Performance and Intervention, 
[normal]******* 
[normal]- Senior 
[normal]Advisor
[normal] 
[normal](LA) and Canon 
[normal]******* 
[normal]- Director of Education &amp; 
[normal]Diocese.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It was fairly well attended and parents were looking for 
[normal]whom
[normal] to be held to account.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] As a new parent with no real history of the school I sat quietly only offering one comment at the end which was that all UK teachers cannot suddenly be rubbish and I questioned if Ofsted were always fit for their purpose.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The 
[normal]Head
[normal] spoke about the Rapid Action Plan etc and the next steps the school would take.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] A couple of parents said the governors should stand down and one questioned the LA's position in all this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The meeting felt 'staged' and when the word 'academy' was raised i
[normal]t was quickly brushed over.
[normal]So I started looking in to the Academies Bill, the amount of primary schools in special measures etc.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Since 6/9 I
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]visited the Head numerous times concerned that the school may be pursuing academy status.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I was consistently adv
[normal]ised to go through the Chair of Governors but this proved difficult as she appeared to be too busy to get in touch. Eventually she did ring
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal] she told me that if there was a fight to be had she would have it, that she had lived in the area years and cared 
[normal]much about the school.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] She went on at length about the reasons the previous Head had left wanting to pursue his career etc.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] (Gossip says the previous Head did not want to leave and was pushed into doing so - wanted to write a letter to the parents to tel
[normal]l them but governors said no and did so themselves).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] He is now at
[normal] another C of E School in 
[normal]*******
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I told her I didn't see why it should 
[normal]become
[normal] an academy and she indicated that she wasn't a fan of the government agenda but left me with the distinct imp
[normal]ression that there was nothing to be done.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I 
[normal]sincerely
[normal] told her that in that case I would be happy to support the school as my concerns were raised and I would like to keep an eye on the progress.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] And this was how I felt.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Until a couple of day later whe
[normal]n my curiosity was aroused again and I looked into it some more.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] So I pestered via the poor Head to get some meetings set up to discuss the pros and cons of academy status - my main concern being the parents were unaware of any of this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Eventually, 3 inf
[normal]ormation sessions were held on the week commencing the 21/10 - chaired by the rep of the s
[normal]ponsor to be Canon 
[normal]******* 
[normal]from C of E 
[normal]******* 
[normal]Academies
[normal] Trust.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I was told they took so long to organise as they were waiting for the Canon to have free dates.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I at
[normal]tended one of the meetings and asked if they had 
[normal]voted to become an academy- 
[normal]******
[normal]* 
[normal]said
[normal] yes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I asked if this was because otherwise they would be forced - again she said yes. The meetings were very poorly attended and barely advertised -
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]just a 
[normal]line in
[normal] t
[normal]he school newsletter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] So no consultation was 
[normal]achieved
[normal] here.
[normal]I have made various requests such as looking at the minutes, to meet with the Chair etc all of which have been constantly blocked.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The Head has told me a few weeks ago that she is in the middle 
[normal]and yet I have been forced to go to her as an initial contact.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It was only after writing a letter to the Chair requesting a response re a 
[normal]meeting
[normal] within seven days (or further action) that a meeting was arranged.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] A complaint was sent to 
[normal]Gove that was sig
[normal]ned for (by 
[normal]*******
[normal]) at midday on 18/11 and one also to the Chair - no response as yet.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] At the meeting I asked if they could publish the 
[normal]contents
[normal] of the meetings so at least all parents could benefit from what had been said - they said they could - we are
[normal] still waiting.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I offered to help explain to the parents - Chair muttered should all go through the govs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In Chairs response letter to a meeting she advised me the minutes were ready for me to view via the school office by 
[normal]appointment
[normal]. So I made an app
[normal]oi
[normal]ntmen
[normal]t keen to look prior to meeting the Chair.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] All there was available was the 10th Oct extraordinary 
[normal]governors
[normal] meeting minutes - where 6 govs voted unanimously for academy status.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It stated that a 
[normal]academy
[normal] order would be requested 
[normal]etc.
[normal] and DfE
[normal] broker held a question and answer session.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] So I went to m
[normal]eet the Chair and Canon 
[normal]******
[normal]* 
[normal]on
[normal] 5th Dec at the church having viewed these minutes on 3rd Dec.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I asked for a consultation for the parents as 
[normal]there
[normal] has not been one and was told until the academy
[normal] order is released and funding agreed no more can be said.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]Chair threw a comment
[normal] at the end which was both unhealthy and unprofessional and it was obvious 
[normal]to me
[normal] that she was exasperated by my challenging the governor's power.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] She 
[normal]told
[normal] me 
[normal]ultimately
[normal] i
[normal]t is 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]governor’s
[normal] 
[normal]decision
[normal] and I told her I understood this and also understood pressure she may be under but felt strongly it is only decent to inform the parents and the 'info sessions' were held well after 
[normal]decision
[normal] had been made.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]This gives me no fai
[normal]th in the future management of the school whatever route it takes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This, is allowed to steam roll ahead is a major blow to local democracy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The parents haven't had their views sought, respected or even considered - and it isn't just the parents it's the 
[normal]future parents - there is no parental voice in this at all and there should be!
