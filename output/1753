[normal]BNI0016[bold]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Ulster Bank Ltd[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1. Structure and Governance[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Ulster Bank was founded in 1836 to provide a reliable banking service for merchants in Belfast
[normal]. It has for over 150 years been an all-Ireland business and has been central to the economy of the island. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The bank is a member of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS) and operates as Ulster Bank Ltd in Northern Ireland as a direct subsidiary of the N
[normal]ational Westminster Bank plc. Ulster Bank Ireland Ltd in the Republic of Ireland is a subsidiary of Ulster Bank Ltd. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ulster Bank serves 1.9 million customers on the island of Ireland. 
[normal]It is the leading retail and business bank in Northern Ireland
[normal] – with 
[normal]710
[normal],000 customers in the province –
[normal] 670,000 personal banking and 40
[normal],000 business banking customers. The bank has a
[normal] Retail Banking division which
[normal] has the largest share of the personal banking market in the province at 25% and a Business
[normal] Banking division whi
[normal]ch has a significant share 
[normal]of the Northern Ireland bu
[normal]siness banking market at 30%. In the face of intense competition from other banks and building societies, Ulster Bank has a 20
[normal]% share of t
[normal]he new mortgage lending market and it has
[normal] the largest branch netw
[normal]ork of any bank in Nort
[normal]hern Ireland, with 79 branches.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The management structure of Ulster Bank Group is structurally similar to comparable businesses within the RBS Group (see Appendix 1). Ulster Bank Group is headed by Chief Executive, Jim Brown and an E
[normal]xecutive Committee team of nine colleagues (four of whom are based in Belfast - the Managing Directors of Business Banking and Retail Banking for the entire island of Ireland, the Head of Human Resources and the Chief Operating Officer).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Chief Executi
[normal]ve of Ulster Bank Group is a member of the RBS Group’s
[normal] 
[normal]Management Committee, which is responsible for reviewing strategy and monitoring performance in relation to the business of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc and its subsidiaries.
[normal] 
[normal]Strategy, risk a
[normal]ppetite, pricing and products are governed by Ulster Bank – although it seeks to leverage group systems and product capability where possible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The bank also has standalone governance structures. The Board of Ulster Bank Ltd has a chair from Northern Irela
[normal]nd who is based in Dublin, two non-executive directors from the Province, three non-executive directors from the Republic of Ireland, two representatives from RBS and an independent member from the United Kingdom (UK). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In Northern Ireland, Ulster Bank ha
[normal]s appointed a specific head of Ulster Bank Northern Ireland, 
[normal]Ellvena
[normal] Graham. She heads a leadership forum that focuses on the strategy, performance and development of the business in Northern Ireland.
[normal] 
[normal]This is an explicit recognition of the critical role U
[normal]lster Bank plays in Northern Ireland society and, in particular, in helping 
[normal]drive
[normal] forward the province’s economy. The Head of Ulster Bank Northern Ireland regularly briefs the Board on strategy and activity in the province.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Access to Finance, particula[bold]rly for small to medium enterprises[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]A successful and thriving business sector is an importa
[normal]nt driver of economic growth. Ulster Bank has always
[normal] recognise
[normal]d it has
[normal] a key role to play in supporting business development across Northern Ireland
[normal] and it has
[normal] the 
[normal]right combination of products 
[normal]to help companies
[normal],
[normal] large and small
[normal],
[normal] achieve their ambitions
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ulster Bank believes in the quality and 
[normal]potential of small businesses in Northern Ireland
[normal] and it 
[normal]provide
[normal]s
[normal] the
[normal]m with the
[normal] support they need.
[normal] In Ulster Bank’s six business centres, there are 258 full-time employees dedicated to Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) businesses in Northern Ireland. 
[normal]During 2012, the bank approved
[normal] £18
[normal]1 million in new lending to 
[normal]business customers
[normal]. 
[normal]88% of businesses th
[normal]at appl
[normal]ied for credit in 2012 were 
[normal]granted facilities.
[normal] 
[normal]Over the past 12 months, 
[normal]Ulster Bank 
[normal]has 
[normal]helped more than 2,000 start-ups, supporting new enterprise, business development and job creation.
[normal] 
[normal]In the year to date, Ulster Bank has
[normal] signed up in excess of
[normal] 800 start-up customers. 
[normal]In the past seven months, the bank has also identified 25
[normal] new business development managers
[normal] who 
[normal]ar
[normal]e dedicated to 
[normal]seeking
[normal] new business opportunities and working with firms to help them grow and are put through regular credit trainin
[normal]g.
[normal] 
[normal]The bank was the fir
[normal]st 
[normal]in Northern Ireland
[normal] to join the Bank of England's Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS). Ulster Bank supported the National Loan Guarantee Scheme and it has also dominated the provision of the Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme (EFG) in the province (see Section 5 for full stati
[normal]stics). 
[normal]Ulster Bank
[normal] provide
[normal]s
[normal] positive practical and relevant support tailored to meet the needs and 
[normal]demands of the market. In 2011, the bank launched its
[normal] start up campaign to support new and emerging customers and
[normal] in turn support the growth of local economies. Ulster Bank offers support and mentoring to businesses through its unique 
[normal]Smallbusinesscan
[normal] online network which regularly attracts over 20,000 users each month.
[normal]Ulster Bank tailors its product range to suppor
[normal]t 
[normal]customers
[normal], with 
[normal]a range of funding options available to SMEs, including: the
[normal] EFG scheme which 
[normal]provide
[normal]s
[normal] working capital wh
[normal]ere normal lending is not avail
[normal]able due to lack of security
[normal].
[normal]The bank works 
[normal]with customers to examine other funding options to help 
[normal]c
[normal]ashflow
[normal] including invoice discounting and asset finance solutions.
[normal] Ulster Bank has an independent appeals system in place to address those who are declined lending.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the 
[normal]agri
[normal]-
[normal]food sector, Ulster Bank
[normal] sanctioned during 2012 
[normal]more than £40 million
[normal] of new 
[normal]facilities
[normal] and consequently its
[normal] net lending to agriculture (
[normal]ie
[normal] the amount lent after all repayme
[normal]nts had been received) 
[normal]grew by 1% year-on-year. 
[normal]The bank demonstrated its
[normal] commitment to the
[normal] 
[normal]agri
[normal]-food
[normal] sector 
[normal]through the creation of a £10 million
[normal] Weather Fund 
[normal]to help farmers cope with the 
[normal]heavy s
[normal]now at the end of March. It is also the principal sponsor of Northern Ireland’s main agricultural showpiece event, the 
[normal]Balmoral
[normal] Show which an estimated 100,000 people attended this year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ulster Bank believes there is a
[normal] particular challenge in Northern Ireland around accessing venture capital that needs to be addressed. Northern Ireland’s banks, along with Government, have shouldered the role of financing most start-ups in the absence of significant equity funding. This 
[normal]may in part be due to the l
[normal]imited opportunities for substantial V
[normal]enture 
[normal]C
[normal]apital
[normal] returns in a small
[normal]er 
[normal]economy
[normal] dominated by the public sector and reliant on UK
[normal] subvention. But there has also been a lack of ambition from local investors when it comes to developing
[normal] V
[normal]enture 
[normal]C
[normal]apital funded growth plans. This may be explained by 
[normal]a lack of peer examples and an unwillingness to give up
[normal] equity in family businesses. This
[normal] cultural difference may also be a by-product of The Troubles
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) acknowledged the problem in its ‘Getting Growth Finance Growing’ report last year. In a climate where bank lending to sustainable sectors
[normal] 
[normal]has not st
[normal]opped, the CBI said there needed to be greater access to private sources of capital. Northern Ireland is too dependent on bank and public financing and lags considerably behind other regions of the UK on equity financing which will be essential if the prov
[normal]ince is to develop the kind of first class knowledge economy the Stormont Executive is aiming for.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The CBI noted the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) reported private equity accessed by its members in Northern Ireland fell from £163 million in 2
[normal]010 to just £21 million in 2011. In Scotland, the BVCA’s members accessed £179 million in private equity in 2010 and £393 million respectively, while in Wales private equity accounted for £78 million and £127 million. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Legacy Issues[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Ulster Bank is addres
[normal]sing the issue of companies with problem debt – much of which is an overhang from the property boom on the island – through our Global Restructuring Group (GRG) which works with companies with debts of over £1 million and our Specialised Relationship Manag
[normal]ers (SRM) whose primary focus is to support SME customers with exposures under £1 million and help return their businesses back to good health. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In Northern Ireland, the bank has a legacy portfolio of £5.8 billion of primarily property related lending, ma
[normal]naged by a team of 143 GRG and SRM employees.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In all cases, both teams seek consensual solutions with customers on a case by case basis. 
[normal]Unfortunately, it
[normal] is not always possible to achieve agreement. In these circumstances, the bank has to take difficult 
[normal]decisions which may, regrettably, include the appointment of an insolvency practitioner. This is not a decision Ulster Bank takes lightly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Over the past 18 months, however, GRG has helped protect 5,500 jobs 
[normal]and is on course to return £200 million of North
[normal]ern Ireland exposure across numerous trading businesses, to the mainstream bank during 2013. GRG has also provided approximately £50 million of additional finance to the Corporate and SME sector in NI to provide development and trading finance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. [bold]Lack of effectiveness of national i[bold]nitiatives to help aid economic [bold]recovery [bold]Ulster Bank has a strong record
[normal] of participation in incentive schemes that the Government has made available to all UK
[normal] licensed banks. In particular, the bank has embraced the Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS), lending £100 million to more than 650 customers since it was launched in mid-September 2012. The FLS is a good method of providing affordable fina
[normal]nce to businesses across Northern Ireland.
[normal]Alth
[normal]ough all
[normal] the
[normal] main lenders in N
[normal]orthern 
[normal]I
[normal]reland
[normal] participate in the Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme
[normal] (EFG)
[normal], Ulster Bank has dominated the provision of EFG 
[normal]funding 
[normal]in the N
[normal]orthern 
[normal]I
[normal]reland market
[normal] since the launch of the scheme in 2009, accounting for 77% 
[normal]of all financing 
[normal]by value.
[normal]Ulster Bank believes EFG has an important role to play in accessing finance for new investment opportunities. The bank has suggested that Government should re-visit the 
[normal]level of the net cap, increasing it to at least 33%. This would recognise the fundamental difference between Northern Ireland’s economy and the rest of the UK - Northern Ireland has a much greater reliance on the public sector and a preponderance of micro 
[normal]businesses. Ulster Bank also believes Government should develop a co-ordinated marketing initiative with banks to promote EFG and should consider marketing and aligning the scheme to specific business sectors.
[normal]6[bold]. Lack of availability of detailed regional l[bold]ending data[bold]With regards to business lending, Ulster Bank completes a monthly Bank of England return through RBS 
[normal]Group 
[normal]which shows our lending figures. However, one of the challenges in Northern Ireland is the lack of consistency in the definition of new l
[normal]ending across banks. For example, while Ulster Bank may not count renewals as a new loan, its competitors may count it. Therefore, if regional lending data is to be effective, there needs to be an agreed common definition of what constitutes new lending. 
[normal]In Northern Ireland, the British Bankers Association is working with banks and the Northern Ireland Executive on relevant data to inform the local business landscape. Whilst Ulster Bank is supportive of this principle, before committing to the publication,
[normal] like the other banks, it will require assurances around data protection, customer confidentiality, consistency of definition and ensuring commercially sensitive information is secure. 
[normal]7[bold].[bold] Access to banking in rural communities[bold].
[normal]Ulster Bank recognise
[normal]s the importance many of its customers place in face to face contact with staff and it is cognisant of the important role branches play in the commercial heart of a community.
[normal]However, throughout the world, banks – and other retail sectors – are witnessing
[normal] significant changes in customer behaviour. More people are availing of online, telephone and mobile banking services and branch usage is declining. The trend is no different at Ulster Bank which is also witnessing a significant shift in customer behaviour
[normal]. Customers now do more than twice as many transactions through new digital mobile phone and Internet banking channels as they do in branches.
[normal]This has meant Ulster Bank, like all UK, Irish and international banks, has had to adjust to changing customer ne
[normal]eds and that has inevitably led to an ongoing review of our branch network. With 79 branches, Ulster Bank still has the largest branch network in Northern Ireland and is committed to continuing to provide branch banking services to personal and business cu
[normal]stomers in both rural and urban locations. The bank has 246 free to use ATMs across Northern Ireland. In addition, current account customers (including basic account holders) are able to check their balance and withdraw cash from post offices. Ulster Bank 
[normal]customers are able to use any branch to carry out their banking, not only their account holding branch. As result of the change in customer behaviour, Ulster Bank has since March 2013 made our Anytime Banking apps, Internet centre and contact centre availa
[normal]ble to SMEs. The contact centre has been operating 24 hours, seven days a week. 
[normal]In June 2013, Ulster Bank closed seven branches and four part-time sub offices in Northern Ireland. As a matter of course full due diligence will be carried out before we make
[normal] any future decisions on specific branches.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Closing any branch is never easy but in reaching a decision, Ulster Bank looks at its geographic branch coverage across the province and the proximity of other branches to the location being considered for closu
[normal]re. Ulster Bank looks at customer numbers, footfall and the number of transactions going through an individual branch. Consideration – and engagement with relevant stakeholders – is also given in decision-making to the needs of specific customer groups – f
[normal]or example, benefit recipients, vulnerable customers, elderly and young customers
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]During the recent branch closures, as part of Ulster Bank’s engagement with impacted customers, it
[normal] wrote to its customers at least 12 weeks in advance to inform them that their branch
[normal] was closing and to advise them of the details of their new branch including the nearest free to use ATM. During this process, branch managers also identified and met indi
[normal]vidual vulnerable customers, so they could put in place steps that would meet those customers’ banking needs. Ulster Bank will replicate this approach for any future closures, and in addition, it will seek to strengthen its measures for vulnerable customer
[normal]s with an education programme to help them register and use our online, telephone and mobile banking services. This will include holding open master classes and individual customer meetings in branches in the period prior to closure to provide face-to-face
[normal] support to help customers use Anytime Banking services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ulster Bank will also continue to ensure that, where possible, 
[normal]staff
[normal] from branches that have closed are moved to other branches in their locality to maintain some continuity for customers who like t
[normal]o see a familiar face in their branch.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ulster Bank
[normal] recognise
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]that for some customers in rural locations, telephone or online banking
[normal] is not a
[normal]lways viable. To that end, the bank will be reintroducing in Northern Ireland a mobile banking van service to ext
[normal]end face-to-face banking services to customers and communities where branches close. Ulster Bank will continue to give consideration to other inclusive services for our customers, particularly those in rural areas.
