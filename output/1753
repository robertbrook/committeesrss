default1. Structure and Governancedefault&#xa0;
defaultUlster Bank was founded in 1836 to provide a reliable banking service for merchants in Belfast
default. It has for over 150 years been an all-Ireland business and has been central to the economy of the island. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe bank is a member of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS) and operates as Ulster Bank Ltd in Northern Ireland as a direct subsidiary of the N
defaultational Westminster Bank plc. Ulster Bank Ireland Ltd in the Republic of Ireland is a subsidiary of Ulster Bank Ltd. 
default&#xa0;
defaultUlster Bank serves 1.9 million customers on the island of Ireland. 
defaultIt is the leading retail and business bank in Northern Ireland
default – with 
default710
default,000 customers in the province –
default 670,000 personal banking and 40
default,000 business banking customers. The bank has a
default Retail Banking division which
default has the largest share of the personal banking market in the province at 25% and a Business
default Banking division whi
defaultch has a significant share 
defaultof the Northern Ireland bu
defaultsiness banking market at 30%. In the face of intense competition from other banks and building societies, Ulster Bank has a 20
default% share of t
defaulthe new mortgage lending market and it has
default the largest branch netw
defaultork of any bank in Nort
defaulthern Ireland, with 79 branches.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe management structure of Ulster Bank Group is structurally similar to comparable businesses within the RBS Group (see Appendix 1). Ulster Bank Group is headed by Chief Executive, Jim Brown and an E
defaultxecutive Committee team of nine colleagues (four of whom are based in Belfast - the Managing Directors of Business Banking and Retail Banking for the entire island of Ireland, the Head of Human Resources and the Chief Operating Officer).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Chief Executi
defaultve of Ulster Bank Group is a member of the RBS Group’s
default 
defaultManagement Committee, which is responsible for reviewing strategy and monitoring performance in relation to the business of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc and its subsidiaries.
default 
defaultStrategy, risk a
defaultppetite, pricing and products are governed by Ulster Bank – although it seeks to leverage group systems and product capability where possible.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe bank also has standalone governance structures. The Board of Ulster Bank Ltd has a chair from Northern Irela
defaultnd who is based in Dublin, two non-executive directors from the Province, three non-executive directors from the Republic of Ireland, two representatives from RBS and an independent member from the United Kingdom (UK). 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn Northern Ireland, Ulster Bank ha
defaults appointed a specific head of Ulster Bank Northern Ireland, 
defaultEllvena
default Graham. She heads a leadership forum that focuses on the strategy, performance and development of the business in Northern Ireland.
default 
defaultThis is an explicit recognition of the critical role U
defaultlster Bank plays in Northern Ireland society and, in particular, in helping 
defaultdrive
default forward the province’s economy. The Head of Ulster Bank Northern Ireland regularly briefs the Board on strategy and activity in the province.
default&#xa0;
default4. Access to Finance, particuladefaultrly for small to medium enterprisesdefault&#xa0;
defaultA successful and thriving business sector is an importa
defaultnt driver of economic growth. Ulster Bank has always
default recognise
defaultd it has
default a key role to play in supporting business development across Northern Ireland
default and it has
default the 
defaultright combination of products 
defaultto help companies
default,
default large and small
default,
default achieve their ambitions
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultUlster Bank believes in the quality and 
defaultpotential of small businesses in Northern Ireland
default and it 
defaultprovide
defaults
default the
defaultm with the
default support they need.
default In Ulster Bank’s six business centres, there are 258 full-time employees dedicated to Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) businesses in Northern Ireland. 
defaultDuring 2012, the bank approved
default £18
default1 million in new lending to 
defaultbusiness customers
default. 
default88% of businesses th
defaultat appl
defaultied for credit in 2012 were 
defaultgranted facilities.
default 
defaultOver the past 12 months, 
defaultUlster Bank 
defaulthas 
defaulthelped more than 2,000 start-ups, supporting new enterprise, business development and job creation.
default 
defaultIn the year to date, Ulster Bank has
default signed up in excess of
default 800 start-up customers. 
defaultIn the past seven months, the bank has also identified 25
default new business development managers
default who 
defaultar
defaulte dedicated to 
defaultseeking
default new business opportunities and working with firms to help them grow and are put through regular credit trainin
defaultg.
default 
defaultThe bank was the fir
defaultst 
defaultin Northern Ireland
default to join the Bank of England's Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS). Ulster Bank supported the National Loan Guarantee Scheme and it has also dominated the provision of the Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme (EFG) in the province (see Section 5 for full stati
defaultstics). 
defaultUlster Bank
default provide
defaults
default positive practical and relevant support tailored to meet the needs and 
defaultdemands of the market. In 2011, the bank launched its
default start up campaign to support new and emerging customers and
default in turn support the growth of local economies. Ulster Bank offers support and mentoring to businesses through its unique 
defaultSmallbusinesscan
default online network which regularly attracts over 20,000 users each month.
defaultUlster Bank tailors its product range to suppor
defaultt 
defaultcustomers
default, with 
defaulta range of funding options available to SMEs, including: the
default EFG scheme which 
defaultprovide
defaults
default working capital wh
defaultere normal lending is not avail
defaultable due to lack of security
default.
defaultThe bank works 
defaultwith customers to examine other funding options to help 
defaultc
defaultashflow
default including invoice discounting and asset finance solutions.
default Ulster Bank has an independent appeals system in place to address those who are declined lending.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the 
defaultagri
default-
defaultfood sector, Ulster Bank
default sanctioned during 2012 
defaultmore than £40 million
default of new 
defaultfacilities
default and consequently its
default net lending to agriculture (
defaultie
default the amount lent after all repayme
defaultnts had been received) 
defaultgrew by 1% year-on-year. 
defaultThe bank demonstrated its
default commitment to the
default 
defaultagri
default-food
default sector 
defaultthrough the creation of a £10 million
default Weather Fund 
defaultto help farmers cope with the 
defaultheavy s
defaultnow at the end of March. It is also the principal sponsor of Northern Ireland’s main agricultural showpiece event, the 
defaultBalmoral
default Show which an estimated 100,000 people attended this year.
default&#xa0;
defaultUlster Bank believes there is a
default particular challenge in Northern Ireland around accessing venture capital that needs to be addressed. Northern Ireland’s banks, along with Government, have shouldered the role of financing most start-ups in the absence of significant equity funding. This 
defaultmay in part be due to the l
defaultimited opportunities for substantial V
defaultenture 
defaultC
defaultapital
default returns in a small
defaulter 
defaulteconomy
default dominated by the public sector and reliant on UK
default subvention. But there has also been a lack of ambition from local investors when it comes to developing
default V
defaultenture 
defaultC
defaultapital funded growth plans. This may be explained by 
defaulta lack of peer examples and an unwillingness to give up
default equity in family businesses. This
default cultural difference may also be a by-product of The Troubles
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) acknowledged the problem in its ‘Getting Growth Finance Growing’ report last year. In a climate where bank lending to sustainable sectors
default 
defaulthas not st
defaultopped, the CBI said there needed to be greater access to private sources of capital. Northern Ireland is too dependent on bank and public financing and lags considerably behind other regions of the UK on equity financing which will be essential if the prov
defaultince is to develop the kind of first class knowledge economy the Stormont Executive is aiming for.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe CBI noted the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) reported private equity accessed by its members in Northern Ireland fell from £163 million in 2
default010 to just £21 million in 2011. In Scotland, the BVCA’s members accessed £179 million in private equity in 2010 and £393 million respectively, while in Wales private equity accounted for £78 million and £127 million. 
default&#xa0;defaultLegacy Issuesdefault&#xa0;defaultUlster Bank is addres
defaultsing the issue of companies with problem debt – much of which is an overhang from the property boom on the island – through our Global Restructuring Group (GRG) which works with companies with debts of over £1 million and our Specialised Relationship Manag
defaulters (SRM) whose primary focus is to support SME customers with exposures under £1 million and help return their businesses back to good health. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn Northern Ireland, the bank has a legacy portfolio of £5.8 billion of primarily property related lending, ma
defaultnaged by a team of 143 GRG and SRM employees.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn all cases, both teams seek consensual solutions with customers on a case by case basis. 
defaultUnfortunately, it
default is not always possible to achieve agreement. In these circumstances, the bank has to take difficult 
defaultdecisions which may, regrettably, include the appointment of an insolvency practitioner. This is not a decision Ulster Bank takes lightly.
default&#xa0;
defaultOver the past 18 months, however, GRG has helped protect 5,500 jobs 
defaultand is on course to return £200 million of North
defaultern Ireland exposure across numerous trading businesses, to the mainstream bank during 2013. GRG has also provided approximately £50 million of additional finance to the Corporate and SME sector in NI to provide development and trading finance.
default&#xa0;
default5. defaultLack of effectiveness of national idefaultnitiatives to help aid economic defaultrecovery defaultUlster Bank has a strong record
default of participation in incentive schemes that the Government has made available to all UK
default licensed banks. In particular, the bank has embraced the Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS), lending £100 million to more than 650 customers since it was launched in mid-September 2012. The FLS is a good method of providing affordable fina
defaultnce to businesses across Northern Ireland.
defaultAlth
defaultough all
default the
default main lenders in N
defaultorthern 
defaultI
defaultreland
default participate in the Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme
default (EFG)
default, Ulster Bank has dominated the provision of EFG 
defaultfunding 
defaultin the N
defaultorthern 
defaultI
defaultreland market
default since the launch of the scheme in 2009, accounting for 77% 
defaultof all financing 
defaultby value.
defaultUlster Bank believes EFG has an important role to play in accessing finance for new investment opportunities. The bank has suggested that Government should re-visit the 
defaultlevel of the net cap, increasing it to at least 33%. This would recognise the fundamental difference between Northern Ireland’s economy and the rest of the UK - Northern Ireland has a much greater reliance on the public sector and a preponderance of micro 
defaultbusinesses. Ulster Bank also believes Government should develop a co-ordinated marketing initiative with banks to promote EFG and should consider marketing and aligning the scheme to specific business sectors.
default6default. Lack of availability of detailed regional ldefaultending datadefaultWith regards to business lending, Ulster Bank completes a monthly Bank of England return through RBS 
defaultGroup 
defaultwhich shows our lending figures. However, one of the challenges in Northern Ireland is the lack of consistency in the definition of new l
defaultending across banks. For example, while Ulster Bank may not count renewals as a new loan, its competitors may count it. Therefore, if regional lending data is to be effective, there needs to be an agreed common definition of what constitutes new lending. 
defaultIn Northern Ireland, the British Bankers Association is working with banks and the Northern Ireland Executive on relevant data to inform the local business landscape. Whilst Ulster Bank is supportive of this principle, before committing to the publication,
default like the other banks, it will require assurances around data protection, customer confidentiality, consistency of definition and ensuring commercially sensitive information is secure. 
default7default.default Access to banking in rural communitiesdefault.
defaultUlster Bank recognise
defaults the importance many of its customers place in face to face contact with staff and it is cognisant of the important role branches play in the commercial heart of a community.
defaultHowever, throughout the world, banks – and other retail sectors – are witnessing
default significant changes in customer behaviour. More people are availing of online, telephone and mobile banking services and branch usage is declining. The trend is no different at Ulster Bank which is also witnessing a significant shift in customer behaviour
default. Customers now do more than twice as many transactions through new digital mobile phone and Internet banking channels as they do in branches.
defaultThis has meant Ulster Bank, like all UK, Irish and international banks, has had to adjust to changing customer ne
defaulteds and that has inevitably led to an ongoing review of our branch network. With 79 branches, Ulster Bank still has the largest branch network in Northern Ireland and is committed to continuing to provide branch banking services to personal and business cu
defaultstomers in both rural and urban locations. The bank has 246 free to use ATMs across Northern Ireland. In addition, current account customers (including basic account holders) are able to check their balance and withdraw cash from post offices. Ulster Bank 
defaultcustomers are able to use any branch to carry out their banking, not only their account holding branch. As result of the change in customer behaviour, Ulster Bank has since March 2013 made our Anytime Banking apps, Internet centre and contact centre availa
defaultble to SMEs. The contact centre has been operating 24 hours, seven days a week. 
defaultIn June 2013, Ulster Bank closed seven branches and four part-time sub offices in Northern Ireland. As a matter of course full due diligence will be carried out before we make
default any future decisions on specific branches.
default&#xa0;
defaultClosing any branch is never easy but in reaching a decision, Ulster Bank looks at its geographic branch coverage across the province and the proximity of other branches to the location being considered for closu
defaultre. Ulster Bank looks at customer numbers, footfall and the number of transactions going through an individual branch. Consideration – and engagement with relevant stakeholders – is also given in decision-making to the needs of specific customer groups – f
defaultor example, benefit recipients, vulnerable customers, elderly and young customers
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultDuring the recent branch closures, as part of Ulster Bank’s engagement with impacted customers, it
default wrote to its customers at least 12 weeks in advance to inform them that their branch
default was closing and to advise them of the details of their new branch including the nearest free to use ATM. During this process, branch managers also identified and met indi
defaultvidual vulnerable customers, so they could put in place steps that would meet those customers’ banking needs. Ulster Bank will replicate this approach for any future closures, and in addition, it will seek to strengthen its measures for vulnerable customer
defaults with an education programme to help them register and use our online, telephone and mobile banking services. This will include holding open master classes and individual customer meetings in branches in the period prior to closure to provide face-to-face
default support to help customers use Anytime Banking services.
default&#xa0;
defaultUlster Bank will also continue to ensure that, where possible, 
defaultstaff
default from branches that have closed are moved to other branches in their locality to maintain some continuity for customers who like t
defaulto see a familiar face in their branch.
default&#xa0;
defaultUlster Bank
default recognise
defaults
default 
defaultthat for some customers in rural locations, telephone or online banking
default is not a
defaultlways viable. To that end, the bank will be reintroducing in Northern Ireland a mobile banking van service to ext
defaultend face-to-face banking services to customers and communities where branches close. Ulster Bank will continue to give consideration to other inclusive services for our customers, particularly those in rural areas.
