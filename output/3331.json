"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dr Fenton F. Robb (IPC0004)&#xa0;\n              \nIPCC \nAR5 \nis unashamedly presented, not as the outcome of scientific observation, but as a compilation of \nthe\n opinions\n of a close community of experts\n. This is made abundantly clear in \nSection \nA Introduction paragraph 3.\n As the unadulterated facts of the matter are\n not available, this invites, indeed demands, \ncriticism ad hominem.\n \n&#xa0;\nThus, i\nt is legitimate\n, indeed essential,\n to examine the nature of the experience and learning of those pu\nrporting to be expert in this methodology\n and to expose them to criticism \nby examining the following \nissues\n:\n&#xa0;\n (a) This is a new discipline and few have been able to accumulate sufficient experience to qualify them as ‘experts’.\n What is an expert climatolo\ngist?\n&#xa0;\n \n(b) Climatologists form a closely-knit peer group that shares an interest in promoting public alarm and provoking continued research.\n \n&#xa0;\n \n(c) \nIt may be that, centred on UEA, several climatologists may be political activists who share a belief in \n‘\np\nost-normal science\n’\n which sees ‘scientific research’ not as a search for ‘truth’, but as a vehicle for the achievement of personal and collective \ngoals\n. \n&#xa0;\n (d) \nClimatology is in effect a subset of the ‘Futurology’\n and cannot be subjected to the test of fal\nsification until after the future has been experienced. Thus it is crucial to discover why so many of \nthe \nIPCC \nmodels failed to anticipate the stability of the\n climate over the past 15 years. AR5 offers \nseveral \nhypotheses about variables that were not exam\nined adequately in the models. No credence can be given \nto\n su\nc\nh \nexcuses unless and until there is evidence to support them \nbut\n asking for more evidence promotes the expenditure of more public money in pursuit of a research methodology so dependent on exper\ntise as \nit may b\n fatally flawed.\n&#xa0;\n (e) \nThroughout the papers great emp\nhasis has been placed on trends from \nthe past\n to the present and the inference is that these will continue unabated indefinitely.\n But the future need not be like the past and \nin the instance of a highly complex and non-linear systems extrapolations from past trends are more likely as not to be misleading. \nA point to this effect as made in AR1.\n&#xa0;\n (f) The definition of ‘climate scientist’ as one who believes that there is AGW and\n who engages in research, not to seek the causal relations that give rise to the phenomenon but engages in research about \nits\n \neffect, rather than its causes precludes dissent about the founding hypothesis – that catastrophic global warming is taking place \nas a result of human activity. So ‘all true climate scientist agree’ and those who dissent are not climate scientists.\n&#xa0;\n (g) Despite previous assessments providing the opinion that ever increasing temperatures were on the way, AR5 reverts to a prognosis si\nmilar to that of the First Assessment. Surely this must mean that there is less cause for alarm.\n \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
