"&#xa0;\nNorthumberland County Council – Written evidence&#xa0;SUBMISSION FOR AMENDMENTS TO SCHEDULE 6 (ASCERTAINMENT OF RIGHTS OF WAY) PARAGRAPHS 2\nThe proposal is to amend the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to omit “or is reasonably alleged to subsist” in subsection (3\n)(\nc)(\ni\n).\nThe Council believes that this proposal should be rejected and the words “or is reasonably alleged to exist” be left in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.\nReason\nThe proposal would put an additional burden on a Local Authority when determining an application for a Definitive Map Modification Order based on user evidence and lengthen the process.\nCurrently Modification Orders will be made because the evidence is reasonably alleged. The test of balance of probability is then met when objections to an Order are received and a Public Inquiry is held to consider the evidence.  The Public Inquiry provides an ideal opportunity for the applicant and objectors to present their evidence more fully and to cross examine the other party.\nIf a Local Authority can only make an Order if it is satisfied that the evidence is on the “balance of probability” it will have to expend more time and effort in evaluating the evidence and questioning the user evidence providers prior to a determination.\nIt could be argued, in cases where there is a clear conflict between user evidence and rebuttal evidence supplied, that the only way of properly evaluating this evidence would be for the surveying authority to hold its own mini ‘public inquiry’ with witnesses called and cross-examined.  This would place a significant and unnecessary burden on local authorities.  Furthermore, where the finding from this ‘public inquiry’ was that public rights had been shown to exist (on a balance of probabilities) and a Modification Order then made, objections received, and the Order submitted to the Secretary of State for determination, this is likely to result in a second public local inquiry.\nSUBMISSION FOR AMENDMENTS TO SCHEDULE 6 (ASCERTAINMENT OF RIGHTS OF WAY) PARAGRAPHS 2\nNorthumberland County Council proposes that a further amendment should be made to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, Section 53, Duty to keep definitive map and statement under continuous review.\n The proposal is to add a new sub paragraph – Section 53(3\n)(\nc)(iv):\n“that a highway shown in the map and statement as a highway of a particular description should be removed from the map and statement because the highway is a carriageway predominately used by motor vehicles in the preceding 5 years.\nReason\nThe proposal is made by the Council because of an anomaly caused by Masters v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (CA)[2000] EWCA \nCiv\n 249, [2001] QB 151, [2000] 4 ALL ER 458 (BBE)\nPrior to Masters, the Council may have used Section 53(3)(c)(iii) to remove from the Definitive Map and Statement a section of public footpath or public bridleway, the route of which, was along a stretch of carriageway used predominately by motor vehicles and on the Council’s List of Streets as a highway maintainable at public expense.  Masters precluded the use of this section to deal with such an anomaly because the Judge found that \nthe word \"particulars\" contained in the section referred to details such as the position and width of the public path and any limitations or conditions affecting the public right of way. This leaves an anomaly whereby significant stretches of highway, which are acknowledged to have full and predominant vehicular rights and are maintainable by the Highway Authority, are also recorded on the definitive map and statement.\n  \nOTHER MATTERS\nThere are no transitional arrangements proposed to manage applications for amendments to the definitive map and statement where the Local Authority has received the application and is in the process of either:\n&#xa0;\nThe following answers are in response to the questions raised by the Joint Committee on the Draft Deregulation Bill and are restricted to those parts of the bill concerned with Public Rights of Way\n&#xa0;\nGENERAL\nQ4 Does the draft bill achieve its purpose of reducing the regulatory burden on business, organisations and individuals effectively and fairly?The impact of the proposals will be mixed and will not simply reduce the regulatory burden fairly.\nLocal Authorities will find that additional burden results from the need to determine applications on the balance of probability rather than reasonably alleged (see first submission above).\nThe process and procedure of Modifications by consent will increase landowner and local authority burden.\nThe proposal for a local authority, rather than the applicant, to identify and serve notice on landowners shifts the regulatory burden to the Local Authority.\nThe proposal in relation to the cut-off date and the protection of unrecorded rights of way from extinguishment places an additional burden on local authorities.\nThe proposal to allow applicants’ recourse to the Magistrates Courts may place additional burdens on the Courts and Local Authorities.\nIt is more accurate to state that overall the Bill, once enacted, will largely replace one regulatory procedure with another and generally transfer regulatory burden from Central Government (DEFRA and the Planning Inspectorate) to Local Authorities and the Magistrates Courts.\n&#xa0;\nQ8 Have the measures set out in the draft Bill been subject to adequate cost-benefit analysis on the basis of consultation with those affected?There has been some consultation but it would be stretching a point to say that the results are comprehensive in terms of the understood meaning of cost-benefit analysis.\n&#xa0;\nDavid Brookes\nInfrastructure Records Manager\nSustainable Transport\nNorthumberland County Council\n&#xa0;\n12 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
