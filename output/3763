[normal]Written evidence submitted by Martin Matthews, National Leader of Governance[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Overview[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I was designated as a National Leader of Governance by the National College
[normal] for teaching and Leadership
[normal] in April 2012 having served as a Greater Manchester Governor Champion 
[normal]2009-11
[normal]. In the next few years I will have served more years as a governor (cumulatively) than I have been alive. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]There are consistent and continuing concerns expressed in many schools regarding issues in the academy programme, particularly academy chains. Governors remain unconvinced of the value of academisation to many primary schools. Governors are the decision makers in this situation unless it is a forced conversion due to underperformance. The heart of the concern is what benefit the child in the classroom would gain from their school becoming an academy. 
[normal]I have no comment on this aspect.
[normal]The position where a school is being compelled to become an academy should never be reached. The Local Authority (LA) should be clear well in advance of what measures are required to prevent children’s education deteriorating to this point. The deterioration will have been observed year on year and LA’s should be taking prompt action. There is a significant reluctance in some LA’s to impose Interim Executive Boards (IEB
[normal]’s
[normal]) to replace failing governing bodies. This issue should be tackled quickly and LA’s encouraged to 
[normal]use their powers sooner. This should be part of an overall graduated response. If LA’s are seen to be not using these powers the DfE should remove them.
[normal]There are academy chains rapidly becoming “too big to fail”
[normal],
[normal] this position is avoidable.
[normal] A 
[normal]maximum number of students/schools per academy chain
[normal] should be set
[normal]. Larger chains should be broken up.
[normal]LA’s should imaginatively execute their monitoring functions. Monitoring functions should equally apply to all categories of school. Reporting to the DfE should be
[normal] standardised,
[normal] transparent and prompt.
[normal]The role of academy chains in the education landscape will continue to develop. There are a number of factors 
[normal]which give cause for concern.
[normal]Academy status remains an unconvincing option for 
[normal]circa 
[normal]16,000 of the 
[normal]circa 
[normal]17,000 primary schools in England. Special factors which apply to primary schools are numerous. 
[normal]Factors include:
[normal]Alternatives to academisation are rarely explored. The variety of options is much wider than academy or maintained school. Options include:
