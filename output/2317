[normal]Children nowadays have the ability to access large quantities of very useful information effectively replacing the large and space-taking encyclopaedias of 
[normal]days passing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What 
[normal]ruin
[normal]s the good that we appreciate is the low down, corrupting content that even adults are safer without.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As a parent of four children I would welcome a large padlock on all content that was unsuitable to children
[normal], the key to which would also be locked aw
[normal]ay.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please c
[normal]ould the Government
[normal] 
[normal]urgently
[normal] developing a secure firewall and
[normal] legislate 
[normal]a
[normal] mandatory
[normal] download
[normal] that blocked such 
[normal]content 
[normal]and the o
[normal]wners of computers that feel they must 
[normal]defile
[normal] themselves, would have to apply to a 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment watchdog?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Why do les
[normal]s than half of our parents have blocks on home computers?
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]f the parents arenâ€™t bothered, 
[normal]pity help
[normal] the children.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I appeal to the pity there is in th
[normal]e
[normal] House
[normal],
[normal] to have the heart to get this cracked.
