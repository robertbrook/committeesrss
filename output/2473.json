"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Link Group LimitedLink Group \nLimited \nis \nScotland’s 3\nrd\n largest housing association. The Link group of companies consists of the parent company, Link Group Limited\n which is\n the Registered Social Landlord (RSL), and 4 o\nper\nating subsidiaries comprising Link Housing Association (LHA), \nLinkLiving\n and self governin\ng RSLs \nLarkfield\n Housing Association and Horizon Housing Association.  Link provides housing and support services to approximately 10,000 customers in 26 of Scotland’s 32 local authority areas, mainly in the Scottish central belt.\n \nOur submission focuses o\nn the implications of the changes for landlords and claimants\n,\n particularly vulnerable groups\n,\n and includes feedback from each of the Link group of companies. \nStatistical data:Our own analysis of information received from our tenants suggests that approx\nimately 85% of them will be affected by one or more of the welfare reform measures\n.\nDemand for our in-house Welfare Benefits and Money Advice Service has increased by 42% in the previous 12 months.\nApproximately 61% of our tenants are on full or partial Ho\nusing Benefit. \nApproximately \n40% of our tenants have digital access at home. \n68% of Horizon tenants have a disability, with 38% living in housing \nwhich has been \npurpose built or adapted for their needs.\nAffected by the social size criteria: 19% of workin\ng age Horizon tenants \n                                                               18% of working age \nLarkfield\n tenants\n              \n              \n              \n              \n     6% of working age Link tenants \n43% of working age Horizon tenants affected live in and need housing built to wheelchair use\nr standard (there is clearly a disproportionate impact on disabled people\n)\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn terms of impacts on Link we \ncan confirm the\n following:\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncreased rent arrears: \nWe expect rent arrears to increase in the future due to the following:\n \nLink’s current rent arrears remai\nn\n relatively\n steady with no significant increase caused by the introduction of the social size criteria\n. However\n this has only been achieved by significant investment in staff resources to support our affected tenants.  \n \n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncreased transaction costs: At th\ne current time\n,\n 61% of our tenants are on full or partial Housing Benefit, which incurs a negligible bank transaction cost. Under Universal Credit it is anticipated that approximately 80% of UC claimants will have their rent paid directly to them and will \nthen pay this to Link. Assuming that every tenant paid their rent in a single payment each month this will equate to approximately 74,000 bank transactions per annum at an average cost of £0.50 per transaction. We are aware from the DPDP that tenants often\n make a number of smaller payments towards their rent each month as they juggle household budgets to meet other bills. The number of bank transactions and \ntherefore the associated costs are likely to be higher than this. Link \nhas had to increase the number\n of licences to allow staff to accept credit card payments and we expect that the number of required licences will increase further as the demand for this facility increases. There is a cost associated with each licence.\n \n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncreased staff resources: Support\ning tenants to manage \nthe various aspects of welfare reform is already proving difficult a\nnd the required resources will increase as further Welfare Reform measures are rolled out. The following activities do/will require additional staff resources:\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHousing (Scotland) Act 1987: Link must comply with the requirements of the Housing \n(Scotland) \nAct\n 1987 \nwhen allocating properties. We are concerned that \nthe requirements of the Act are inconsistent with the under-occupancy legislation\n,\n particularly in relation to bedroom size, which \nprescribes\n that 2 children of the same gender must share a room\n even if it\n may only be suitable for single occupancy.  \nWe are\n facing challenges to ensure that our Allocations Policy meets the needs of all of our tenants\n regardless\n \nof whether or not they \nreceiv\ne\n HB.\n \n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncreased Void Costs and Stock Profiles: V\noid costs \nincrease where\n the property available \ndoes\n not suit the needs \nof the \nprospective tenant who bids for \nit\n. This is of particular concern in hard\n-\nto\n-\nlet areas or where there \nare\n a limited number of properties of a particular size. \nWe are aware of and concerned at the limited availability of one-bedroom properties availa\nble\n with a reported shortfall of 20% across Scotland\n. \nLarkfield\n HA has a stock \nportfolio\n of 394 properties but only 12 of these are 1 bedroom.\n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBusiness viability:  \nIn general, there are fears throughout the RSL sector that both lender and credit-rating \nconfidence will be adversely affected by the DWP proposals and this might well have a knock-on effect on the terms and conditions imposed by lenders in future. Link itself will be in the same position as any other goods and services provider i\n.\ne\n.\n if we don\n’t receive sufficient and appropriate payment for those services from our customers, then we can’t cover costs and viability will be threatened.\n \n&#xa0;\n7)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPrivate Sector Leasing:Link currently manages the largest Private Sector Leasing (PSL) scheme in Scotland on\n behalf of \nthe \nCity of Edinburgh Council and provides temporary accommodation for 1\n,\n750 tenants who are deemed to be in priority housing need.\nTenants housed in temporary accommodation often present with multiple vulnerabilities\n and may have chaotic lifestyles. It is likely that they will not have the ability to manage their finances to pay their rent themselves.  It is unreasonable to expect them to keep control of what rent they owe to which landlord and arrange these payments \nonce their Universal Credit payment is received. \nWhilst it is understood that consideration will be given by DWP to the tenant’s vulnerabilities in order to make payments of rent to the landlord, we are concerned that the processes and administration requ\nired to set these up will be onerous on housing staff. It is therefore recommend\ned\n that the default position for tenants in temporary (private or local authority) accommodation \nis for them to\n have their rent paid directly to the landlord. \nAs previously noted\n,\n tenants accessing temporary accommodation are often extremely vulnerable and may have chaotic lifestyles, thus facing considerable risks to their health and \nwell-being if required to share. In order to be sustainable\n,\n the shared tenancies are also likely to require intensive housing management and support from an increased number of specialist staff. There are further concerns that the processes involved in ma\ntching individuals to share will result in delays in securing suitable accommodation and pose significant challenges for staff involved. \nTemporary accommodation has to be flexible and reactive to homelessness needs\n. I\nf the size criteria restriction is applied, Link \nis\n likely to be in a position where \nwe are\n unable to house those presenting as homeless\n.\n \nWe \nwill also see an increase in void periods \nas\n it would be unreasonable to place people in accommodation they will no\nt be able to afford due to shortfalls in benefit entitlement. It is not feasible to manage temporary accommodation in this way as the need for one\n-\nbedroom properties far outweighs their availability. This is likely to increase homelessness and potentially \na return to rough sleeping. It also increases the cost for the provider due to potential increase in void periods.\nA standard rate may not cover the actual costs of delivering the scheme so managing agents will\n withdraw from future provision. We believe that the management fee should be paid based on actual service delivery costs, which are scrutinised as part of the tendering process. The administration, claim processes and uncertainties over payment will pose \ndifficulties for Link.   \nIn addition to the specific points raised, our expectation is that the cumulative impacts will likely result in an increase in \nthe \ncost of providing temporary accommodation due to the additional administration involved, the increa\nsed need for specialist housing staff, the shortage of suitable \naccommodation and the increase in void periods whilst tenants are matched and suitably-sized accommodation is sourced.\nIt is likely to increase the number of legal actions and evictions; due \nto the increase in arrears it will limit future housing options or consideration for re\n-\nreferral to our service. This will lead to an increase in homelessness, more pressure on services, but with greater limitations on what can be offered.\n Also, given the \nrelatively high rents in the scheme and the higher risk of non-payment of rent, landlords’ \ncashflow\n problems may lead to bankruptcy and resultant further homelessness.\nLandlords have not been willing to accept lower rental offers for larger properties whic\nh would meet the benefit cap so we are left with no alternative but to hand them back, reducing the stock of properties suitable for large families.    \nAn example of how a tenant is currently affected by the benefit cap.1 adult and 5 children in a 4 bedr\noom property. The household income comprises Income Support £339.46 (includes amounts for the children) and Child Benefit £73.90.\nThe total income from benefit for this family is £701.81 per week which includes the Housing Benefit award of £288.46 weekly.\nAs the benefit cap amount is £500 weekly for this family, they will have to find £201.81 each week to contribute towards their rent.\nThis tenant is seeking employment of 16 hours per week paid at \nthe \nminimum wage of £6.19 per hour. She would then be entitl\ned to Working Tax Credit and child care costs of up to £339.87 per week. Child Tax Credits of £271.27 per week, Child Benefit of £73.90 and Housing Benefit of £261.51 per week.\nTotal benefit income is £946.55 which is £244.74 more than when solely in recei\npt of benefit.\n \nWhere are the savings?\nWhilst we appreciate the need to encourage people to access employment, it is likely that the pressure to find and sustain employment when a family is experiencing homelessness will place additional stress on the house\nhold. \n&#xa0;\nIn terms of impacts on tenants and in particular vulnerable groups we are concerned about the following.\n8)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStock Profiles: Link Housing Association operates a choice\n-\nbased letting system\n.\n \nW\ne are aware that limited availability of smaller \nproperties i\ns proving challenging for many people registered with us. This is particularly problematic for people trying to access temporary accommodation through the homeless route.\n9)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisabled Tenants: Disabled tenants who have had their properties adapted to meet thei\nr needs are penalised if they have an extra bedroom yet there w\nill\n often be a significant cost to adapt a smaller property. There is already considerable pressure on adaptation budgets so accessing funds for additional adaptations \nmay\n prov\ne\n problematic. \nHo\nrizon HA ha\ns\n received a mutual exchange request from a disabled tenant \nwho wants to move to a smaller property, which would require adaptation. Whilst the cost of this will be met by Scottish Government Stage 3 funding it demonstrates the false economy of \nthe social size criteria as we recognise that this will result in a cost to the welfare budget but will increase costs to the RSLs and Scottish Government. \n \n   \n10)\n&#xa0; \nService Charges for Adaptations: Under Universal Credit the costs associated with special equipment and adaptations will be deemed as ineligible service charges. We understand that the support for these costs will be withdrawn completely with no transitional protection. \nThese costs will t\nherefore have to be fully met by the tenant\n,\n many of whom will struggle to cover this additional expenditure\n.\n \nT\nhis is another threat to the ability of disabled people to live independently.  \n  \n 11)\n&#xa0; \nDHP:  Whilst we are aware of and actively pursue claims for D\niscretionary Housing Payments for our tenants affected by the under-occupancy legislation\n,\n we are concerned at the inconsistencies in the decision\n-\nmaking process and the negative impacts on the health of our tenants\n. Our tenants report that their health is\n affected by the\n stress and anxiety resulting from \nuncertainties caused by \nthe short term and discretionary nature of the award\ns\n.\n To date only 15% \no\nf Horizon HA’s tenants\n in general needs housing\n and 31% of tenants who live in purpose built or adapted hous\ning have been awarded a DHP. Awards range from 3 months to 1 year and some local authorities take DLA into account in considering income available and others do not. \n12)\n&#xa0; \nTenant \nhealth and well-being: As well as the impacts of DHP\n,\n our t\nenants are al\nso \nreporti\nng deterioration in their mental health with increased levels of stress and anxiety\n for the following reasons:\nThe Scottish Government Welfare \nR\neform Corporate Partnership Group Health Briefing Paper\n of\n August 2013 reports that the NHS \nis\n aware of and predict\ned\n exactly the \nhealth issues our tenants are \nreporting\n.\n  \n \n   \n13)\n&#xa0; \nOther Issues: 27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
