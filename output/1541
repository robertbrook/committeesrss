defaultBiochar is the charcoal-like solid product of heating biomass in very low-oxygen 
defaultconditions. Biochar usually contains a lot of carbon which is tightly fixed in molecules that are resistant to microbial breakdown, meaning that the carbon persists in soil for hundreds to thousands of years  - long enough to be a useful way of reducing th

default concentration in the atmosphere. Biochar is also a soil improver – it adds nutrients, modulates the pH, helps to store moisture in dry soils, increases the microbial activity, changes the soil structure, and so on. Biochar can make a major contribution to

defaultThe British Biochar
default Foundation (BBF) CIC
default. was founded in 2013 to represent the wide range of individuals, groups, companies and other organisations in the UK which have an interest in biochar. The BBF has 197 individual members (as of August 2013) and the members come from research and developme
defaultnt, private sector, consultancy, public sector, nature and conservation bodies, community groups and charities. In June 2013, 110 BBF members participated in the BBF’s inaugural event in Oxford.  In August 2013, a new Board has been established and will me
defaultet for the first time in September. The aim of the BBF is to represent the emerging biochar sector in the UK in all its diversity. Our submission reflects the opinions of the BBF Board.

defaultBiochar is a solid 
defaultcharcoal
default-like
default 
defaultmaterial, 
defaultobtained from thermochemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment that is used for the long-term storage of carbon in the environment and for soil improvement. Because the carbon in 
defaultbiochar is derived from CO
default2
default through photosynthesis, there is the potential for biochar to be a carbon-negative energy generation 
defaulttechnology
default, through beneficial use of the energy produced during its manufacture.

default (In this note, we will convert all carbon and non-CO

defaultThe wide range is explained by uncertain

defaultfor calculating the CO

defaulteq benefits of biochar across its life-cycle and published in the Biochar Quality Mandate (2013). 
defaultThe UK government has
default 
defaultno policy on encouraging biochar, though some government agencies such as the Environment Agency, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and WRAP have expressed s
defaultupport for re-using wastes more
default 
defaultproductively
default 
default through biochar production. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhether the 
defaultUK
default will benefit from biochar depends upon: a) the biochar sector taking off globally, b) the 
defaultUK
default supporting an active involvement in the sector.  It will come as no sur
defaultprise to the Committee, that we are firmly of the view that (a) will happen and that (b) is highly desirable. The 
defaultUK
default has expertise in soil science, soil amendments, agricultural research (arable, livestock, 
defaulthorticulture) and pyrolysis engineering and techn
defaultology which, together, constitute the key
default resources and capabilities required to enable successful biochar innovation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBiochar is not only about carbon 
defaultstorage, it is
default also a way of improving soil fertility and crop productivity. 
defaultDespite a high variabilit
defaulty of UK field trial results, there are examples of statistically significant yield gains
default in barley and grasslands (Jones et al., 2012; Hammond et al., 2013). 
defaultFurther R&amp;D is underway to understand the optimum crop-soil-weather-management regimes required 
defaultfor biochar benefits in the UK. At the global scale, a recent meta-analysis of 371 independent studies reported that the addition of biochar to soils resulted, on average, in increased above ground productivity and crop yield (Biederman &amp; Harpole, 201
default3
default)
default. 
defaultR
defaultecent research in China and Australia has been testing blends of biochar and synthetic chemical fertilizer and this has been showing some impressive crop yield increases, suggesting that the way forwards is to use smaller amounts of biochar more productive
defaultly. 
default 
defaultThere is reasonable evidence that biochar allows the more efficient utilisation of added nutrients, especially nitrogen. The same 
defaultcrop yield may be obtained with a lower synthetic fertiliser input as a consequence, reducing: costs, associated GHG emis
defaultsions from fertiliser manufacture and potential nitrate run-off pollution: all-in-all 
defaultcompetitive low carbon farming.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt present
default charcoal production is 
defaultdeployed around the world at small
default scale, and there are several manufact
defaulturers of medium scale devices.  
defaultHowever the larger scale plant, for continuous production of biochar, syngas and/or bio-liquids
default,
default  is not at a high technology readin
defaultess level due to lack of demand hence investment. 
defaultUnti
defaultl such time as there are reliably operating pyrolysis plants at the right cost, biochar will not be deploye
defaultd  on any large scale.
default 
defaultThere are, nonetheless, pioneering companies which are developing clean, efficient and controllable biochar production at smal
defaultl to large scales
default (e.g. Pyrreg and Black is Green)
default. 
defaultTo develop such technical systems requires sufficient 
defaultinvestment by the private sector, including firms with the necessary technical and engineering competencies. This investment will occur when one or mo
defaultre of the fo
defaultllowing happen: 
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultOnce re
defaultliable larger scale systems have been deve
defaultloped, the costs of producing biochar 
defaultin the UK
default 
defaultare likely to range from £-100/t to £400/t.  
defaultThe negative figure 
defaultwould be where organic waste streams are used, with a gate fee  for waste
defaults input to the production pl
defaultant 
default(Shackley et al., 2011). The average production cost across a wide range of feedstocks (including organic wastes) is £118 per tonne biochar. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe marginal abatement cost for carbon (MACC) ranges from £200 per tCO
default2
default to £-150 per tCO
default2 
default(ibid.), with an 
defaultaverage value of £57 per tCO
default2
default (ibid.). If only clean non-waste feedstocks are considered both production cost and MACC are may be 1/3 higher. The MACC value is competitive with energy technologies such as CCS (geological variant) and offshore renewables, t
defaulthough the levelised cost of electricity generation is higher than conventional biomass (depending on how efficiently li
defaultquids and gases are utilized
default and 
defaulton the 
defaultefficiency of heat recovery in conventional biomass utilisation
default).  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe agronomic value of bioch
defaultar wi
defaultth current applications is 
defaultunlikely to be as high as 
defaultthe average biochar production cost (
default£118 per tonne
default)
default. As a rule of thumb, one tonne of biochar abates one tonne of CO
default2
defaulteq.
default 
default DEFRA has set the shadow cost of carbon at between £25 and £60 per tonne C
defaultO
default2
defaulteq and, if we take a nominal value of £40 per tonne CO
default2
defaulteq
default reduction
default, this would 
defaultrequire 
defaulta
default minimum agronomic value of £7
default8 per t
defaultonne biochar 
defaultto cover production costs.  This is feasible 
defaultin certain niche applications; biochar production costs will in any case be a lot lower than 
default£118 per tonne
default in many instances. 
defaultFor instance, if a biochar is used with a negative production cost, it would, in principle, be possible to return a profit from b
defaultoth carbon abatement and agronomic dimensions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is
default 
defaultno carbon credit available for biochar. The EU ETS does not include biochar and pyrolysis is unlikely to quality for entry into the EU ETS. The non-traded sector does not permit carbon off-setting o
defaultptions, so biochar cannot be included. Without carbon financing, successful  
defaultlarge scale
default development deployment of biochar is much less likely. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRegulation is a further possible barrier to biochar development and deployment in the UK.  This is because of 
defaultthe high level of complexity surrounding regulation of soil amendments and use of wastes.  These issues have been thoroughly addressed in the Biochar Quality Mandate (BQM),
default a document prepared by a consortium of regulators, scientists and with input from t
defaulthe industry and technical experts, 
defaultwhich is c
defaulturrently undergoing revisions. 
defaultBoth SEPA (201
default2
default) and the Environment Agency (2013) have issued Regulatory Position Statements (RPS) 
default(
defaulton the manufacture and use of biochar from specified wastes
default 
default(mostly untreated w
defaultood wastes) (WST-PS-031). 
default&#xa0;
defaultSafety issues arise from the potential risks introduced by toxicants in the biochar (heavy metals, organic molecules), from pyrolysis operations that are dirty and produce particles and fugitive emissions of gases
default such as carbon monoxide, methane and nitrous oxide (greenhouse gases) and from the unsustainable sourcing of biomass. Other minor health and safety issues concern application of a dusty material to soil requiring good practice such as wetting and wearing 
defaultface masks, etc.  All these issues have been addressed in gu
defaultidance and assessment documents 
defaultincluding those of the International Biochar Initiative (IBI), the European Biochar Certificate (EBC) and the BQM for the UK context in particular. The bottom-line 
defaultis that if biochar is sourced from carefully managed feedstocks, is produced from modern controlled pyrolysis equipment and is properly tested prior to soil addition, safety concerns can be adequately addressed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSeveral 
defaultcountries have provided incentives for biochar RD&amp;D, in particular China and the USA. Schemes in China have been promoting removal of straw from fields for use as a biochar feedstock rather than straw burn
defaulting in
default 
defaultfield which causes air pollution.  Pyrolysis
default can be included in existing 
defaultrenewable bioenergy
default incentive schemes 
defaultthrough electricity generation from syngas (
defaultin the UK
default via ROCs and FiTs
default), though more mature technologies such as direct biomass combustion 
defaultare 
defaultlower risk.  
defaultB
defaultiochar is an energy dense by-pr
defaultoduct, reducing the generation of bioenergy from a given mass of
default biomass compared to combustion, even though the overall carbon abatement of pyrolysis-biochar is greater
default than that from direct combustion
default. 
defaultCurrent 
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultIn Japan, biochar has been officially rec
defaultognised and permitted as a soil amendment since 198
default4
default. In April 2013,  
default Switzerland 
defaultbecame the first European country to 
defaultofficially permit biochar production and use in soil, adopting the requirements of the European Biochar Certificate. 
default&#xa0;defaultThe 
defaultkey value of biochar is in carbon sequestration, where carbon
default 
defaultis removed from the atmosphere for
default 100’s to 1000’s of years. T
defaulthe atmosphere 
defaultalready 
defaultholds 400ppm
default yet the safe level is believed to lie somewhere between 350 and 45
default0ppm with no let-up in CO
default2
default emis
defaultsions to atmosphere. 
defaultTherefore regardless of actions to decarbonise the UK’s energy system it is necessary to also remove CO
default2 
defaultfrom the atmosphere to reduce present concentrations to a safe level. Biochar provides a relatively safe and cheap method of doing
default this, which can be deployed at various scales and at speed should it be so desired.  The UK potential
