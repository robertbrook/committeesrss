[normal]Biochar is the charcoal-like solid product of heating biomass in very low-oxygen 
[normal]conditions. Biochar usually contains a lot of carbon which is tightly fixed in molecules that are resistant to microbial breakdown, meaning that the carbon persists in soil for hundreds to thousands of years  - long enough to be a useful way of reducing th
[normal]e CO
[normal]2
[normal] concentration in the atmosphere. Biochar is also a soil improver – it adds nutrients, modulates the pH, helps to store moisture in dry soils, increases the microbial activity, changes the soil structure, and so on. Biochar can make a major contribution to
[normal] the 
[normal]UK
[normal]’s decarbonisation ambitions – especially in relation to the land-use, agricultural and bioenergy sectors – while enhancing the long-term health of soils. 
[normal]The 
[normal]potential
[normal] role of biochar in reducing carbon is between 
[normal]3.5 to 22 million tonnes CO[bold]2[bold] abate[bold]ment per year[bold]

[normal])
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]However, biochar is a relatively new idea and much work remains to be done on making the underpinning technologies reliable and economically viable and on de
[normal]monstrating the value of biochar in agricultural and other settings.  The UK Government can assist by establishing a carb
[normal]on offsetting value for biochar 
[normal]allowing trading into the EU ETS  (as is already allowed for CO
[normal]2
[normal] capture and geological storage) and/or
[normal] allowing biochar to contribute to meeting company or organizational carbon
[normal] emission reduction
[normal] targets.

[normal]The British Biochar
[normal] Foundation (BBF) CIC
[normal]. was founded in 2013 to represent the wide range of individuals, groups, companies and other organisations in the UK which have an interest in biochar. The BBF has 197 individual members (as of August 2013) and the members come from research and developme
[normal]nt, private sector, consultancy, public sector, nature and conservation bodies, community groups and charities. In June 2013, 110 BBF members participated in the BBF’s inaugural event in Oxford.  In August 2013, a new Board has been established and will me
[normal]et for the first time in September. The aim of the BBF is to represent the emerging biochar sector in the UK in all its diversity. Our submission reflects the opinions of the BBF Board.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Biochar is a solid 
[normal]charcoal
[normal]-like
[normal] 
[normal]material, 
[normal]obtained from thermochemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment that is used for the long-term storage of carbon in the environment and for soil improvement. Because the carbon in 
[normal]biochar is derived from CO
[normal]2
[normal] through photosynthesis, there is the potential for biochar to be a carbon-negative energy generation 
[normal]technology
[normal], through beneficial use of the energy produced during its manufacture.
[normal] A study undertaken for DEFRA and DECC in 2009
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]Shackley and Sohi, 2010
[normal])
[normal]

[normal] (In this note, we will convert all carbon and non-CO
[normal]2
[normal] greenhouse gases into units of CO
[normal]2
[normal] equivalence or CO

[normal]The wide range is explained by uncertain
[normal]ty regarding the quantity of available biomass feedstocks, with the very high scenario implying that a reasonable percentage of suitable, sustainable biomass feedstocks are directed towards biochar production.

[normal]A methodology has been d
[normal]eveloped
[normal], based upon 
[normal]adapting 
[normal]existing
[normal] 
[normal]LCA tools, 
[normal]for calculating the CO
[normal]2
[normal]eq benefits of biochar across its life-cycle and published in the Biochar Quality Mandate (2013). 
[normal]The UK government has
[normal] 
[normal]no policy on encouraging biochar, though some government agencies such as the Environment Agency, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and WRAP have expressed s
[normal]upport for re-using wastes more
[normal] 
[normal]productively
[normal] 
[normal] through biochar production. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whether the 
[normal]UK
[normal] will benefit from biochar depends upon: a) the biochar sector taking off globally, b) the 
[normal]UK
[normal] supporting an active involvement in the sector.  It will come as no sur
[normal]prise to the Committee, that we are firmly of the view that (a) will happen and that (b) is highly desirable. The 
[normal]UK
[normal] has expertise in soil science, soil amendments, agricultural research (arable, livestock, 
[normal]horticulture) and pyrolysis engineering and techn
[normal]ology which, together, constitute the key
[normal] resources and capabilities required to enable successful biochar innovation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Biochar is not only about carbon 
[normal]storage, it is
[normal] also a way of improving soil fertility and crop productivity. 
[normal]Despite a high variabilit
[normal]y of UK field trial results, there are examples of statistically significant yield gains
[normal] in barley and grasslands (Jones et al., 2012; Hammond et al., 2013). 
[normal]Further R&amp;D is underway to understand the optimum crop-soil-weather-management regimes required 
[normal]for biochar benefits in the UK. At the global scale, a recent meta-analysis of 371 independent studies reported that the addition of biochar to soils resulted, on average, in increased above ground productivity and crop yield (Biederman &amp; Harpole, 201
[normal]3
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]R
[normal]ecent research in China and Australia has been testing blends of biochar and synthetic chemical fertilizer and this has been showing some impressive crop yield increases, suggesting that the way forwards is to use smaller amounts of biochar more productive
[normal]ly. 
[normal] 
[normal]There is reasonable evidence that biochar allows the more efficient utilisation of added nutrients, especially nitrogen. The same 
[normal]crop yield may be obtained with a lower synthetic fertiliser input as a consequence, reducing: costs, associated GHG emis
[normal]sions from fertiliser manufacture and potential nitrate run-off pollution: all-in-all 
[normal]competitive low carbon farming.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At present
[normal] charcoal production is 
[normal]deployed around the world at small
[normal] scale, and there are several manufact
[normal]urers of medium scale devices.  
[normal]However the larger scale plant, for continuous production of biochar, syngas and/or bio-liquids
[normal],
[normal]  is not at a high technology readin
[normal]ess level due to lack of demand hence investment. 
[normal]Unti
[normal]l such time as there are reliably operating pyrolysis plants at the right cost, biochar will not be deploye
[normal]d  on any large scale.
[normal] 
[normal]There are, nonetheless, pioneering companies which are developing clean, efficient and controllable biochar production at smal
[normal]l to large scales
[normal] (e.g. Pyrreg and Black is Green)
[normal]. 
[normal]To develop such technical systems requires sufficient 
[normal]investment by the private sector, including firms with the necessary technical and engineering competencies. This investment will occur when one or mo
[normal]re of the fo
[normal]llowing happen: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]Once re
[normal]liable larger scale systems have been deve
[normal]loped, the costs of producing biochar 
[normal]in the UK
[normal] 
[normal]are likely to range from £-100/t to £400/t.  
[normal]The negative figure 
[normal]would be where organic waste streams are used, with a gate fee  for waste
[normal]s input to the production pl
[normal]ant 
[normal](Shackley et al., 2011). The average production cost across a wide range of feedstocks (including organic wastes) is £118 per tonne biochar. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The marginal abatement cost for carbon (MACC) ranges from £200 per tCO
[normal]2
[normal] to £-150 per tCO
[normal]2 
[normal](ibid.), with an 
[normal]average value of £57 per tCO
[normal]2
[normal] (ibid.). If only clean non-waste feedstocks are considered both production cost and MACC are may be 1/3 higher. The MACC value is competitive with energy technologies such as CCS (geological variant) and offshore renewables, t
[normal]hough the levelised cost of electricity generation is higher than conventional biomass (depending on how efficiently li
[normal]quids and gases are utilized
[normal] and 
[normal]on the 
[normal]efficiency of heat recovery in conventional biomass utilisation
[normal]).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The agronomic value of bioch
[normal]ar wi
[normal]th current applications is 
[normal]unlikely to be as high as 
[normal]the average biochar production cost (
[normal]£118 per tonne
[normal])
[normal]. As a rule of thumb, one tonne of biochar abates one tonne of CO
[normal]2
[normal]eq.
[normal] 
[normal] DEFRA has set the shadow cost of carbon at between £25 and £60 per tonne C
[normal]O
[normal]2
[normal]eq and, if we take a nominal value of £40 per tonne CO
[normal]2
[normal]eq
[normal] reduction
[normal], this would 
[normal]require 
[normal]a
[normal] minimum agronomic value of £7
[normal]8 per t
[normal]onne biochar 
[normal]to cover production costs.  This is feasible 
[normal]in certain niche applications; biochar production costs will in any case be a lot lower than 
[normal]£118 per tonne
[normal] in many instances. 
[normal]For instance, if a biochar is used with a negative production cost, it would, in principle, be possible to return a profit from b
[normal]oth carbon abatement and agronomic dimensions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is
[normal] 
[normal]no carbon credit available for biochar. The EU ETS does not include biochar and pyrolysis is unlikely to quality for entry into the EU ETS. The non-traded sector does not permit carbon off-setting o
[normal]ptions, so biochar cannot be included. Without carbon financing, successful  
[normal]large scale
[normal] development deployment of biochar is much less likely. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Regulation is a further possible barrier to biochar development and deployment in the UK.  This is because of 
[normal]the high level of complexity surrounding regulation of soil amendments and use of wastes.  These issues have been thoroughly addressed in the Biochar Quality Mandate (BQM),
[normal] a document prepared by a consortium of regulators, scientists and with input from t
[normal]he industry and technical experts, 
[normal]which is c
[normal]urrently undergoing revisions. 
[normal]Both SEPA (201
[normal]2
[normal]) and the Environment Agency (2013) have issued Regulatory Position Statements (RPS) 
[normal](
[normal]on the manufacture and use of biochar from specified wastes
[normal] 
[normal](mostly untreated w
[normal]ood wastes) (WST-PS-031). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Safety issues arise from the potential risks introduced by toxicants in the biochar (heavy metals, organic molecules), from pyrolysis operations that are dirty and produce particles and fugitive emissions of gases
[normal] such as carbon monoxide, methane and nitrous oxide (greenhouse gases) and from the unsustainable sourcing of biomass. Other minor health and safety issues concern application of a dusty material to soil requiring good practice such as wetting and wearing 
[normal]face masks, etc.  All these issues have been addressed in gu
[normal]idance and assessment documents 
[normal]including those of the International Biochar Initiative (IBI), the European Biochar Certificate (EBC) and the BQM for the UK context in particular. The bottom-line 
[normal]is that if biochar is sourced from carefully managed feedstocks, is produced from modern controlled pyrolysis equipment and is properly tested prior to soil addition, safety concerns can be adequately addressed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Several 
[normal]countries have provided incentives for biochar RD&amp;D, in particular China and the USA. Schemes in China have been promoting removal of straw from fields for use as a biochar feedstock rather than straw burn
[normal]ing in
[normal] 
[normal]field which causes air pollution.  Pyrolysis
[normal] can be included in existing 
[normal]renewable bioenergy
[normal] incentive schemes 
[normal]through electricity generation from syngas (
[normal]in the UK
[normal] via ROCs and FiTs
[normal]), though more mature technologies such as direct biomass combustion 
[normal]are 
[normal]lower risk.  
[normal]B
[normal]iochar is an energy dense by-pr
[normal]oduct, reducing the generation of bioenergy from a given mass of
[normal] biomass compared to combustion, even though the overall carbon abatement of pyrolysis-biochar is greater
[normal] than that from direct combustion
[normal]. 
[normal]Current 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]In Japan, biochar has been officially rec
[normal]ognised and permitted as a soil amendment since 198
[normal]4
[normal]. In April 2013,  
[normal] Switzerland 
[normal]became the first European country to 
[normal]officially permit biochar production and use in soil, adopting the requirements of the European Biochar Certificate. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The 
[normal]key value of biochar is in carbon sequestration, where carbon
[normal] 
[normal]is removed from the atmosphere for
[normal] 100’s to 1000’s of years. T
[normal]he atmosphere 
[normal]already 
[normal]holds 400ppm
[normal] yet the safe level is believed to lie somewhere between 350 and 45
[normal]0ppm with no let-up in CO
[normal]2
[normal] emis
[normal]sions to atmosphere. 
[normal]Therefore regardless of actions to decarbonise the UK’s energy system it is necessary to also remove CO
[normal]2 
[normal]from the atmosphere to reduce present concentrations to a safe level. Biochar provides a relatively safe and cheap method of doing
[normal] this, which can be deployed at various scales and at speed should it be so desired.  The UK potential
[normal] for biochar is estimated at 
[normal]3.5 to 22[bold] million tonnes CO

[normal] compared to combustion improves as the full life-cycle impacts are incorporated, this being due t
[normal]o the indirect effects of biochar in the soil. The l
[normal]argest contribution to pyrolysis-biochar carbon 
[normal]abatement (40–50%) is from stabilised feedstock carbon. The next largest contribution is from the indirect impacts of biochar in the soil (lower crop 
[normal]fertiliser requirement, lower soil N

[normal]O emissions, increased SOC, etc): these hypothesised impacts are based only upon a few studies and stand in need of far better evidence. The indirect impacts account for 25–40% of CA, the proportion changing with the si
