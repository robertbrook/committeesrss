default&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Public Law Project (PLP) is an independent legal charity that was set up in 1990 with the aims of increasing the accountability of public decision-makers; enhancing the quality of public decision-making; and improving access to justice. It carries out 
defaultits aims through training, research, casework and policy work. PLP is widely recognised as a national centre of expertise in public law, and earlier in 2013 was awarded the 
defaultSpecial Rule of Law A
defaultward
default by Halsbury’s Laws.
default&#xa0;
defaultPLP submitted a response to the cons
defaultultation Judicial Review: Proposals for Further Reform. That response is available on our website at:

default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis consultation is the third in the space of a year seeking to restrict access to judicial review. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis documen
defaultt is intended to summarise our position, with particular focus on that which is informed by PLP's empirical research.
default&#xa0;
defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;defaultThe Government's proposals represent a politically motivated and cynical attack on access to justice. The reforms proposed will have the effect of making it more difficult and more expensive to challenge unlawful actions of public bodies. Their effect, ind
defaulteed their intended effect, will be to insulate executive action from judicial scrutiny, thus weakening the rule of law. The impact assessments make no effort to distinguish between meritorious and unmeritorious claims – the intention is simply to reduce th
defaulte number of challenges to Government. The constitutional significance of the proposed reforms 
defaultis clear but unacknowledged
default.

defaultOverarching Observationsdefault&#xa0;
default(1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMisstatement of constitutional position
default&#xa0;
defaultThe consultation paper makes reference to Parliament 
defaultand the 
defaultelected government
default being best placed to identify what is in the public interest (paragraph 24). This is a fundamental misunderstanding of our constitutional settlement. Under traditional constitutional theory Parliament is sovereign. This means that the ex
defaultecutive must act in accordance with the will of Parliament, as expressed through statute. If the executive steps outside of the authority granted to it by legislation, it does so in contravention of Parliament’s will. When this happens, judicial review is 
defaultthe mechanism by which Parliament’s will is enforced: the courts ensure that the executive acts lawfully, in accordance with the powers granted to it by Parliament. If access to judicial review is restricted, the people's ability to ensure that the executi
defaultve acts lawfully and thus preserve the sovereignty of Parliament is restricted.  It is plainly in the public interest for the executive to be required to act in accordance with the law. It is authoritarian governments that seek to suppress 
defaultthe means of 
defaultleg
defaultitimate challenge.

defaultEncroaching politicisation of the role of Lord Chancellor  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Lord Chancellor has a statutory duty to uphold the rule of law (Const
defaultitutional Reform Act 2005, s.17)
default.  As the CRA 2005 recognises in section 1, the rule of law is a con
defaultstitutional principle, and it is not political
default.
default Judicial review is the mechanism by which this principle is upheld. It is therefore both inapt and inappropriate for the Lord Chancellor to characterise judicial reviews, and the role of those bringing them,
default as political tools
default.
default Both the principle and the mechanism by which it is enforced must be kept above the vagaries of 
defaultpolitical cut and thrust. Nor should 
defaultenforcement of
default the law
default be equated with red tape
default.
default Executive commentary such as that footnoted here is
default of deep concern.

defaultMisleading data and lack of evidence
default&#xa0;
defaultIn PLP’s response to 
defaultJudicial Review: Proposals for Reform 
defaultand 
defaultTransforming Legal Aid: Delivering a more credible and efficient system
default we raised serious concerns about the lack of credible evidence b
defaultase for the proposals contained therein. Those concerns remain, a
defaultnd are if anything intensified.
default The Government has employed misleading and inaccurate statistics to attempt to convince the public that there is a problem which must be solved. 
defaultI
defaultn the context of the 
defaultconstitutional significance of the proposals, and the 
defaultunprecedented politicisation of judicial review referred to above, the 
defaultlack of a reliable evidence base for the proposals is a cause for alarm
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultStandingdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe proposal to change the
default rules on standing is an attempt to use restrictive procedural rules to 
defaultrestrict 
defaultaccess to the courts. It runs contrary to decades of case law that emphasises the constitutional role of charities, NGOs, pressure groups and responsible citizens in bringing 
defaultjudicial reviews in the public interest. 
defaultA chilling feature of 
defaultthe proposal is the unashamed admission that it is aimed at preventing 
defaultmeritorious
default challenges to executive decision-making (see paragraph 178 of the consultation paper, which acknowledges that 
defaultthese cases have a higher success rate than judicial reviews brought by individuals).
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther 
defaultthe proposal 
defaultfails to acknowledge the fundamental role played by judicial review in promoting proper decision-making. Leaving aside the obvious point that ‘prope
defaultr decision-making’ is lawful decision making, independent research has shown the beneficial effect that judicial review can have on decision-makers.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposal ignores the 
defaultcrucial importance of judicial review in enabling the court to carry out its 
defaultcon
defaultstitutional 
defaultduty 
defaultto prevent abuse
defaults
default of 
defaultState 
defaultpower. There is a public interest in 
defaultthe court’s role remaining unimpeded
default. It is for precisely this reason that the current rules on standing for judicial review are flexible
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe current “sufficient interest” 
defaulttest (contained in s
default.
default31(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981) was introduced following a recommendation of the Law Commission that the older ‘person aggrieved’ test be replaced because the courts had been interpreting that test too narrowly. (Law Comm. Cmnd. 6
default407 (1976), para 48; Law Comm. Working 
defaultPaper (no 40) (1971) pp 95-101).
default The Law Commission strongly felt that a broader and more flexible approach to standing was needed. The Law Commission subsequently recommended that those adversely affected by a decisi
defaulton ‘should normally be given standing as a matter of course’ and that the court should have ‘a broad discretion to allow ‘publi
defaultc interest and group challenges’ (Law Comm No 226, Para 5.22
default)
default.
default The rules thus reflect a considered and evidence-based position. N
defaultothing approaching this level of consideration or evidence is advanced in the consultation paper.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe consultation fails to identify 
defaultany
default evidence in support of the central assertion that judicial reviews are being used to seek publicity or otherwise hinder the process of proper decision-making. 
defaultBoth
default case 
defaultstudies 
defaultused in the consultation paper (at p
defaultp
default.
default 6-
default7) 
defaultrelate to
default application
defaults
default in which pe
defaultrmission was granted
default. Indeed, in the free school example,
default the Defendant 
defaultappears to have 
defaultadmitted breach
defaulting
default its statutory duties.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government asserts that around 50 applicable claims are issued each year, with 20 being granted permission, 13 being heard
default at a final hearing and 6 being successful for the claimant (paragraph 78). These figures are based on a “manual analysis of case level information” which “due to uncertainties in recording and interpretation” is “largely illustrative” (footnote 38). These
default figures are insufficiently precise to make a cogent case for reform.
default&#xa0;
defaultBy contrast, analysis by Public Law Project and the University of Essex
default concluded that challenges brought by NGOs in respect of wider public interest matters are few and far between. P
defaultLP’s database contains extensive details on 502 civil JR final hearing decisions heard in a 20 month period between July 2010 and February 2012.  In this sample, 77% of the claims were brought by individuals. The next largest group of claimants consists of
default corporations/legal persons (15%). A variety of interest groups and charities, were the claimants in 16 cases, comprising just 3% of the sample.
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, it is far from clear what the Government's proposal would actually mean in practice. We set out in ou
defaultr consultation response the various pitfalls of seeking to draw any principled distinctions between categories of potential public interest litigant.  
defaultThis was in the context of
default the Government's stated attempts to limit the role of NGOs and charities
default. Howe
defaultver we are greatly concerned
default that the proposed restriction would 
default- in addition to its effect on the work of NGOs - 
defaulthave the potential to prevent any individual 
defaultclaimants 
defaultfrom challenging a policy 
defaultor practice of wide application 
default– however unlawful - to the 
defaultextent that th
defaulte
default policy 
defaultor practice 
defaultdoes not direct affect the
defaultm
default. The current rules on standing have been developed to enable such challenges to be brought
default in the public interest
default. 
defaultWhile under the proposed restricted test for standing, claimants 
defaultmight have st
defaultanding to challenge a decision 
defaultdirectly 
defaultrelating to them
default, it is doubtful, and at best worryingly unclear, 
defaultwhether they would also have standing to challenge wider, systemic 
defaultpractic
defaultes.
default 
default 
defaultProcedural Defectsdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe proposal to change the test that the court wo
defaultuld apply in cases where claimants 
defaultbring procedural 
defaultchallenge
defaults would not achieve the Government’s stated aim of preventing delay to “perfectly reasonable decisions or actions”. Where decisions or actions are “perfectly reasonable”, judicial review challeng
defaultes will, in any event, be filtered out of the system at the permission stage. The only cases that would be caught by the proposal are those where the decision or action being challenged has been reached by an unlawful decision-making process. The proposed 
defaulttest 
defaultwould result 
defaultin 
defaultthe court 
defaulthaving to put itself 
defaultin the shoes of the decision maker
default in considering whether the decision would be “highly likely” to have been the same but for the procedural defect
default.
default This is a role in which the court has no competence, and 
defaultwhich is not conducive to good public decision-making. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is however in the public interest that decision-makers know when they have gone wrong – this will not happen if issues of remedy are dealt
default with at the permission stage without any judicial determination of the lawfulness of the procedure that has been followed. 
defaultFurther
default, the proposals would incentivise defendants to raise the “no difference” argument at the permission stage to avoid a full he
defaultaring
default: this would result in
default an increased need for oral 
defaultpermission 
defaulthearings (which will be longer), lengthier pleadings, and more extensive case preparation, all of which will drive up costs for the parties and take up valuable court time.
default Front-loading cos
defaultts at the permission stage 
defaultwould further aggravate the chilling effect on legally aided claimants’ representatives already anticipated if the Govern
defaultment’s legal aid proposals are 
defaultimplemented. Taken together, the increased uncertainty and costs 
defaultat permissio
defaultn 
defaultwould inevitably impact on legally aided claimants’ representatives’ willingness and ability to act
default. This phenomenon is liable to be a serious impediment to access to justice
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCosts – Generaldefault&#xa0;
defaultJudicial review is properly distinguishable from normal civ
defaultil litigation in various ways, including the fundamental inequality of arms/power between the parties, differences in its purpose, and 
defaultconsequent
default 
defaultdifferences in procedure. The courts have developed special costs rules to reflect these distinctions, which w
defaultere amongst those considered in a major review of civil costs rules by Lord Justice Jackson, published in 2009
default.
default Putting forward a package of costs reforms across the civil regime, Jackson LJ made specific reference to the special case of judicial review, 
defaultand the public interest in ensuring that the judicial review court could be accessed without disproportionate financial risk. He concluded that in judicial review cases the costs system needed rebalancing 
defaultin favour of claimants
default, and made recommendations to
default that effect (the introduction of Qualified One Way Costs-Shifting (QUOCS)).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government took forward those of Jackson LJ's recommendations that favoured defendants (abolishing recoverability of CFA success fees and ATE insurance premiums) 
defaultbut
default 
defaultdeclined to introduce QUOCS for judicial review. The Government could point to no principled basis on which to justify its decision to do so. But now, having already rebalanced the costs system in favour of defendants (including itself) it asserts that it 
defaultis necessary to go further still. There is simply no basis for it to do so.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government's proposals do nothing to address wasteful action on the part of defendants such as not responding or responding late to pre-action correspondence, failing to pro
defaultvide any or any adequate disclosure, or unjustifiably resisting permission or defending proceedings. Any genuine attempt to consider ‘rebalancing’ the costs of judicial review would address these issues.
default&#xa0;
defaultProtective Costs Ordersdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe proposal to limit the 
defaultavailability of protective costs orders (“PCOs”) is an attempt to use financial disincentives to prevent organisations acting in the public interest from accessing the courts. It will act as a complete bar to NGOs, charities and campaigning groups being ab
defaultle to bring judicial reviews in most cases, including those where the court considers that it is in the public interest for the organisation to bring the case. The proposal fails to 
defaultproduce
default any evidence
default of
default problems with the current practice of granting PCO
defaults in accordance with the 
defaultCorner House
default criteria.   
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther joint research conducted by PLP and the University of Essex
default,
default reveals that during the 20 month period between July 2010 and February 2012 there were only seven cases decided by the Administrative Court at final hearing in which a PCO had been granted, of which four were environmental cases (and outwith these proposa
defaultls – paragraph 156). This leaves only three PCOs out of 502 cases over a 20 months period. This plainly suggests that the Government’s assessment of the scale of the problem it perceives is exaggerated, and militates strongly against the proportionality of
default the proposal.
default&#xa0;
defaultThird Partiesdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe proposal to expose third parties to a costs risk will deter expert interventions in public interest cases from all but the most well-resourced parties
default (those representing well-resourced financial interests will continue t
defaulto be able to bear the costs risk that interventions will attract if the proposal is implemented)
default. The courts and our most senior judges have identified how helpful such interventions are
default and seeking to deter them from being made risks undermining the qual
defaultity of judicial decision-making in relation to public interest issues.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is no evidence that third party interventions 
defaultcreat
defaulte a problem to be solved at all, or that they add much if at all to the overall costs of the case, or that the existing rules a
defaultnd practice are inadequate.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultCosts Riskdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe proposals to increase the costs risk for both claimants and their legal representatives, by restricting payment of legal aid in judicial review cases in which permission to apply for judicial review is not 
defaultgranted, by seeking to make claimants liable for all of the defendant’s costs where permission to apply for judicial review is refused, and by seeking to increase the circumstances in which the court is able to make wasted costs orders will have the effect
default of 
defaultpreventing meritorious cases from being brought, and will allow unfair, unlawful and unreasonable government decision-making to go unchallenged.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government repeats its 'concern' that weak judicial reviews are being publicly funded. In our response
default to 
defaultTransforming Legal Aid: Delivering a more credible and efficient system, 
defaultPLP analysed the statistics on which the Government then relied in support of a proposal to cut funding for judicial review
default.
default 
defaultOur analysis showed that this was concern was unfound
defaulted, with only 13% of legally aided cases ending at permission without benefit to the client. We said then, as we say now, that the figures do not support an assertion that publicly funded claimant lawyers are bringing weak cases.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposal to increase 
defaultthe costs and risks to claimants and their representatives suffer
defaults
default from the same fundamental flaw as the Government’s past and present proposals for restricting legal aid payments to claimants’ representatives; namely, they proceed on the false basis (at p
defaultaragraph 150) that 
defaultit is claimants’ representatives that
default are best placed to assess prospects of success. In fact, it 
defaultis invariably
default the defendant who is best placed to assess the merits of the vast majority of claims for judicial review because it is the de
defaultfendant (not the claimant’s representative) that has access to all the relevant information about how a decision was reached. However in many cases there will be credible legal arguments on both sides, 
defaultwhich require adjudication by the court
default. It simply doe
defaults not follow that a claimant who fails to obtain permission has by definition acted improperly. It is merely illustrative of the uncertainty characteristic in public law
default, with the lack of any pre-issue disclosure
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultUnder the present system, 
defaultlegally aided 
defaultclaimant
defaults
default 
defaultmust 
defaultsatisf
defaulty
default the LAA that their claim
defaults
default 
defaultare 
defaultsufficiently meritorious to attract funding
default. 
defaultThe weakness of the Government’s 
defaultcase 
defaultis illustrated by the lack of confidence shown in the L
defaultAA
default to accurately merits test applications for judicial review
default. No reason is given why additional resources could not be diverted to the LAA to enable weak cases to be sifted out before they are issued (to the extent it is claimed that this does not happen already), with consequent saving of public funds. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe modif
defaultication the Government now proposes offers very little comfort – it does nothing to reduce the uncertainty over whether legal representatives will be paid
default – indeed it increases it - 
defaultand is unlikely to benefit claimant lawyers in most cases. There is much s
defaultcope for uncertainty about the manner in which the exhaustive criteria will be applied by the LAA and the discretion is likely to operate in a very narrow range of cases. The costs of attempting to secure payment 
default– which are at risk for solicitors - 
defaultwill b
defaulte disproportionate.
default&#xa0;
defaultCosts of Oral Hearingsdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe existing approach to costs is flexible and allows judges to do justice on a case by case basis. The current approach reflects the fact that attendance at an oral hearing is optional for a defendant, who will
default already have set out their opposition to the claim in detailed terms.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultWasted Costs Ordersdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Government observes that Wasted Costs Orders (WCOs) against claimants’ legal representatives are rarely made (paragraph 147). It does not identify any cases where a WCO should have been made, but was not. It is unclear why there is a need for reform of
default the current system of WCOs and no evidence is provided to illuminate this. WCOs already penalise legal representatives for improper, negligent or unreasonable conduct, and the 
defaultcourts have made it clear that there are important public policy reasons why pu
defaultrsuing a weak case 
defaultshould never – for that reason –
default 
defaultresult in a WCO. The proposal will have a disproportionate and unfair impact on judicial review claimants of limited financial means.
default default&#xa0;defaultWeak cases in judicial review proceedings are already liable to be d
defaultealt with by an award of costs against the losing party (not the representative) in the normal way, at the permission stage which identifies and filters out weak cases. A wider use of WCOs will be pursued by defendants against the legal representatives of 
defaultclaimants without financial resources, as defendants will not be able to recover costs from such claimants even if they obtain an order for costs against them. The result is therefore to discourage legal representatives from bringing judicial review claims
default on behalf of those of limited means. This is a matter of particular concern given the crucial role judicial review performs in safeguarding the fundamental rights of minorities, including those without financial resources
default.
