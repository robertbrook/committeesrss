&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by the Public Law Project (JRR 0026)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Public Law Project (PLP) is an independent legal charity that was set up in 1990 with the aims of increasing the accountability of public decision-makers; enhancing the quality of public decision-making; and improving access to justice. It carries out 
[normal]its aims through training, research, casework and policy work. PLP is widely recognised as a national centre of expertise in public law, and earlier in 2013 was awarded the 
[normal]Special Rule of Law A
[normal]ward
[normal] by Halsbury’s Laws.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]PLP submitted a response to the cons
[normal]ultation Judicial Review: Proposals for Further Reform. That response is available on our website at:

[normal]tp://www.publiclawproject.org.uk/resources/147/public-law-project-response-to-judicial-review-proposals-for-further-reform-consultation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This consultation is the third in the space of a year seeking to restrict access to judicial review. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This documen
[normal]t is intended to summarise our position, with particular focus on that which is informed by PLP's empirical research.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Government's proposals represent a politically motivated and cynical attack on access to justice. The reforms proposed will have the effect of making it more difficult and more expensive to challenge unlawful actions of public bodies. Their effect, ind
[normal]eed their intended effect, will be to insulate executive action from judicial scrutiny, thus weakening the rule of law. The impact assessments make no effort to distinguish between meritorious and unmeritorious claims – the intention is simply to reduce th
[normal]e number of challenges to Government. The constitutional significance of the proposed reforms 
[normal]is clear but unacknowledged
[normal].

[normal]Misstatement of constitutional position
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The consultation paper makes reference to Parliament 
[normal]and the 
[normal]elected government
[normal] being best placed to identify what is in the public interest (paragraph 24). This is a fundamental misunderstanding of our constitutional settlement. Under traditional constitutional theory Parliament is sovereign. This means that the ex
[normal]ecutive must act in accordance with the will of Parliament, as expressed through statute. If the executive steps outside of the authority granted to it by legislation, it does so in contravention of Parliament’s will. When this happens, judicial review is 
[normal]the mechanism by which Parliament’s will is enforced: the courts ensure that the executive acts lawfully, in accordance with the powers granted to it by Parliament. If access to judicial review is restricted, the people's ability to ensure that the executi
[normal]ve acts lawfully and thus preserve the sovereignty of Parliament is restricted.  It is plainly in the public interest for the executive to be required to act in accordance with the law. It is authoritarian governments that seek to suppress 
[normal]the means of 
[normal]leg
[normal]itimate challenge.

[normal]Encroaching politicisation of the role of Lord Chancellor  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Lord Chancellor has a statutory duty to uphold the rule of law (Const
[normal]itutional Reform Act 2005, s.17)
[normal].  As the CRA 2005 recognises in section 1, the rule of law is a con
[normal]stitutional principle, and it is not political
[normal].
[normal] Judicial review is the mechanism by which this principle is upheld. It is therefore both inapt and inappropriate for the Lord Chancellor to characterise judicial reviews, and the role of those bringing them,
[normal] as political tools
[normal].
[normal] Both the principle and the mechanism by which it is enforced must be kept above the vagaries of 
[normal]political cut and thrust. Nor should 
[normal]enforcement of
[normal] the law
[normal] be equated with red tape
[normal].
[normal] Executive commentary such as that footnoted here is
[normal] of deep concern.

[normal]Misleading data and lack of evidence
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In PLP’s response to 
[normal]Judicial Review: Proposals for Reform 
[normal]and 
[normal]Transforming Legal Aid: Delivering a more credible and efficient system
[normal] we raised serious concerns about the lack of credible evidence b
[normal]ase for the proposals contained therein. Those concerns remain, a
[normal]nd are if anything intensified.
[normal] The Government has employed misleading and inaccurate statistics to attempt to convince the public that there is a problem which must be solved. 
[normal]I
[normal]n the context of the 
[normal]constitutional significance of the proposals, and the 
[normal]unprecedented politicisation of judicial review referred to above, the 
[normal]lack of a reliable evidence base for the proposals is a cause for alarm
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Standing[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The proposal to change the
[normal] rules on standing is an attempt to use restrictive procedural rules to 
[normal]restrict 
[normal]access to the courts. It runs contrary to decades of case law that emphasises the constitutional role of charities, NGOs, pressure groups and responsible citizens in bringing 
[normal]judicial reviews in the public interest. 
[normal]A chilling feature of 
[normal]the proposal is the unashamed admission that it is aimed at preventing 
[normal]meritorious
[normal] challenges to executive decision-making (see paragraph 178 of the consultation paper, which acknowledges that 
[normal]these cases have a higher success rate than judicial reviews brought by individuals).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Further 
[normal]the proposal 
[normal]fails to acknowledge the fundamental role played by judicial review in promoting proper decision-making. Leaving aside the obvious point that ‘prope
[normal]r decision-making’ is lawful decision making, independent research has shown the beneficial effect that judicial review can have on decision-makers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The proposal ignores the 
[normal]crucial importance of judicial review in enabling the court to carry out its 
[normal]con
[normal]stitutional 
[normal]duty 
[normal]to prevent abuse
[normal]s
[normal] of 
[normal]State 
[normal]power. There is a public interest in 
[normal]the court’s role remaining unimpeded
[normal]. It is for precisely this reason that the current rules on standing for judicial review are flexible
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The current “sufficient interest” 
[normal]test (contained in s
[normal].
[normal]31(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981) was introduced following a recommendation of the Law Commission that the older ‘person aggrieved’ test be replaced because the courts had been interpreting that test too narrowly. (Law Comm. Cmnd. 6
[normal]407 (1976), para 48; Law Comm. Working 
[normal]Paper (no 40) (1971) pp 95-101).
[normal] The Law Commission strongly felt that a broader and more flexible approach to standing was needed. The Law Commission subsequently recommended that those adversely affected by a decisi
[normal]on ‘should normally be given standing as a matter of course’ and that the court should have ‘a broad discretion to allow ‘publi
[normal]c interest and group challenges’ (Law Comm No 226, Para 5.22
[normal])
[normal].
[normal] The rules thus reflect a considered and evidence-based position. N
[normal]othing approaching this level of consideration or evidence is advanced in the consultation paper.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The consultation fails to identify 
[normal]any
[normal] evidence in support of the central assertion that judicial reviews are being used to seek publicity or otherwise hinder the process of proper decision-making. 
[normal]Both
[normal] case 
[normal]studies 
[normal]used in the consultation paper (at p
[normal]p
[normal].
[normal] 6-
[normal]7) 
[normal]relate to
[normal] application
[normal]s
[normal] in which pe
[normal]rmission was granted
[normal]. Indeed, in the free school example,
[normal] the Defendant 
[normal]appears to have 
[normal]admitted breach
[normal]ing
[normal] its statutory duties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Government asserts that around 50 applicable claims are issued each year, with 20 being granted permission, 13 being heard
[normal] at a final hearing and 6 being successful for the claimant (paragraph 78). These figures are based on a “manual analysis of case level information” which “due to uncertainties in recording and interpretation” is “largely illustrative” (footnote 38). These
[normal] figures are insufficiently precise to make a cogent case for reform.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]By contrast, analysis by Public Law Project and the University of Essex
[normal] concluded that challenges brought by NGOs in respect of wider public interest matters are few and far between. P
[normal]LP’s database contains extensive details on 502 civil JR final hearing decisions heard in a 20 month period between July 2010 and February 2012.  In this sample, 77% of the claims were brought by individuals. The next largest group of claimants consists of
[normal] corporations/legal persons (15%). A variety of interest groups and charities, were the claimants in 16 cases, comprising just 3% of the sample.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally, it is far from clear what the Government's proposal would actually mean in practice. We set out in ou
[normal]r consultation response the various pitfalls of seeking to draw any principled distinctions between categories of potential public interest litigant.  
[normal]This was in the context of
[normal] the Government's stated attempts to limit the role of NGOs and charities
[normal]. Howe
[normal]ver we are greatly concerned
[normal] that the proposed restriction would 
[normal]- in addition to its effect on the work of NGOs - 
[normal]have the potential to prevent any individual 
[normal]claimants 
[normal]from challenging a policy 
[normal]or practice of wide application 
[normal]– however unlawful - to the 
[normal]extent that th
[normal]e
[normal] policy 
[normal]or practice 
[normal]does not direct affect the
[normal]m
[normal]. The current rules on standing have been developed to enable such challenges to be brought
[normal] in the public interest
[normal]. 
[normal]While under the proposed restricted test for standing, claimants 
[normal]might have st
[normal]anding to challenge a decision 
[normal]directly 
[normal]relating to them
[normal], it is doubtful, and at best worryingly unclear, 
[normal]whether they would also have standing to challenge wider, systemic 
[normal]practic
[normal]es.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Procedural Defects[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The proposal to change the test that the court wo
[normal]uld apply in cases where claimants 
[normal]bring procedural 
[normal]challenge
[normal]s would not achieve the Government’s stated aim of preventing delay to “perfectly reasonable decisions or actions”. Where decisions or actions are “perfectly reasonable”, judicial review challeng
[normal]es will, in any event, be filtered out of the system at the permission stage. The only cases that would be caught by the proposal are those where the decision or action being challenged has been reached by an unlawful decision-making process. The proposed 
[normal]test 
[normal]would result 
[normal]in 
[normal]the court 
[normal]having to put itself 
[normal]in the shoes of the decision maker
[normal] in considering whether the decision would be “highly likely” to have been the same but for the procedural defect
[normal].
[normal] This is a role in which the court has no competence, and 
[normal]which is not conducive to good public decision-making. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is however in the public interest that decision-makers know when they have gone wrong – this will not happen if issues of remedy are dealt
[normal] with at the permission stage without any judicial determination of the lawfulness of the procedure that has been followed. 
[normal]Further
[normal], the proposals would incentivise defendants to raise the “no difference” argument at the permission stage to avoid a full he
[normal]aring
[normal]: this would result in
[normal] an increased need for oral 
[normal]permission 
[normal]hearings (which will be longer), lengthier pleadings, and more extensive case preparation, all of which will drive up costs for the parties and take up valuable court time.
[normal] Front-loading cos
[normal]ts at the permission stage 
[normal]would further aggravate the chilling effect on legally aided claimants’ representatives already anticipated if the Govern
[normal]ment’s legal aid proposals are 
[normal]implemented. Taken together, the increased uncertainty and costs 
[normal]at permissio
[normal]n 
[normal]would inevitably impact on legally aided claimants’ representatives’ willingness and ability to act
[normal]. This phenomenon is liable to be a serious impediment to access to justice
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Costs – General[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Judicial review is properly distinguishable from normal civ
[normal]il litigation in various ways, including the fundamental inequality of arms/power between the parties, differences in its purpose, and 
[normal]consequent
[normal] 
[normal]differences in procedure. The courts have developed special costs rules to reflect these distinctions, which w
[normal]ere amongst those considered in a major review of civil costs rules by Lord Justice Jackson, published in 2009
[normal].
[normal] Putting forward a package of costs reforms across the civil regime, Jackson LJ made specific reference to the special case of judicial review, 
[normal]and the public interest in ensuring that the judicial review court could be accessed without disproportionate financial risk. He concluded that in judicial review cases the costs system needed rebalancing 
[normal]in favour of claimants
[normal], and made recommendations to
[normal] that effect (the introduction of Qualified One Way Costs-Shifting (QUOCS)).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Government took forward those of Jackson LJ's recommendations that favoured defendants (abolishing recoverability of CFA success fees and ATE insurance premiums) 
[normal]but
[normal] 
[normal]declined to introduce QUOCS for judicial review. The Government could point to no principled basis on which to justify its decision to do so. But now, having already rebalanced the costs system in favour of defendants (including itself) it asserts that it 
[normal]is necessary to go further still. There is simply no basis for it to do so.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Government's proposals do nothing to address wasteful action on the part of defendants such as not responding or responding late to pre-action correspondence, failing to pro
[normal]vide any or any adequate disclosure, or unjustifiably resisting permission or defending proceedings. Any genuine attempt to consider ‘rebalancing’ the costs of judicial review would address these issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Protective Costs Orders[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The proposal to limit the 
[normal]availability of protective costs orders (“PCOs”) is an attempt to use financial disincentives to prevent organisations acting in the public interest from accessing the courts. It will act as a complete bar to NGOs, charities and campaigning groups being ab
[normal]le to bring judicial reviews in most cases, including those where the court considers that it is in the public interest for the organisation to bring the case. The proposal fails to 
[normal]produce
[normal] any evidence
[normal] of
[normal] problems with the current practice of granting PCO
[normal]s in accordance with the 
[normal]Corner House
[normal] criteria.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Further joint research conducted by PLP and the University of Essex
[normal],
[normal] reveals that during the 20 month period between July 2010 and February 2012 there were only seven cases decided by the Administrative Court at final hearing in which a PCO had been granted, of which four were environmental cases (and outwith these proposa
[normal]ls – paragraph 156). This leaves only three PCOs out of 502 cases over a 20 months period. This plainly suggests that the Government’s assessment of the scale of the problem it perceives is exaggerated, and militates strongly against the proportionality of
[normal] the proposal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Third Parties[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The proposal to expose third parties to a costs risk will deter expert interventions in public interest cases from all but the most well-resourced parties
[normal] (those representing well-resourced financial interests will continue t
[normal]o be able to bear the costs risk that interventions will attract if the proposal is implemented)
[normal]. The courts and our most senior judges have identified how helpful such interventions are
[normal] and seeking to deter them from being made risks undermining the qual
[normal]ity of judicial decision-making in relation to public interest issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is no evidence that third party interventions 
[normal]creat
[normal]e a problem to be solved at all, or that they add much if at all to the overall costs of the case, or that the existing rules a
[normal]nd practice are inadequate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Costs Risk[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The proposals to increase the costs risk for both claimants and their legal representatives, by restricting payment of legal aid in judicial review cases in which permission to apply for judicial review is not 
[normal]granted, by seeking to make claimants liable for all of the defendant’s costs where permission to apply for judicial review is refused, and by seeking to increase the circumstances in which the court is able to make wasted costs orders will have the effect
[normal] of 
[normal]preventing meritorious cases from being brought, and will allow unfair, unlawful and unreasonable government decision-making to go unchallenged.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Government repeats its 'concern' that weak judicial reviews are being publicly funded. In our response
[normal] to 
[normal]Transforming Legal Aid: Delivering a more credible and efficient system, 
[normal]PLP analysed the statistics on which the Government then relied in support of a proposal to cut funding for judicial review
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Our analysis showed that this was concern was unfound
[normal]ed, with only 13% of legally aided cases ending at permission without benefit to the client. We said then, as we say now, that the figures do not support an assertion that publicly funded claimant lawyers are bringing weak cases.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The proposal to increase 
[normal]the costs and risks to claimants and their representatives suffer
[normal]s
[normal] from the same fundamental flaw as the Government’s past and present proposals for restricting legal aid payments to claimants’ representatives; namely, they proceed on the false basis (at p
[normal]aragraph 150) that 
[normal]it is claimants’ representatives that
[normal] are best placed to assess prospects of success. In fact, it 
[normal]is invariably
[normal] the defendant who is best placed to assess the merits of the vast majority of claims for judicial review because it is the de
[normal]fendant (not the claimant’s representative) that has access to all the relevant information about how a decision was reached. However in many cases there will be credible legal arguments on both sides, 
[normal]which require adjudication by the court
[normal]. It simply doe
[normal]s not follow that a claimant who fails to obtain permission has by definition acted improperly. It is merely illustrative of the uncertainty characteristic in public law
[normal], with the lack of any pre-issue disclosure
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Under the present system, 
[normal]legally aided 
[normal]claimant
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]must 
[normal]satisf
[normal]y
[normal] the LAA that their claim
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]are 
[normal]sufficiently meritorious to attract funding
[normal]. 
[normal]The weakness of the Government’s 
[normal]case 
[normal]is illustrated by the lack of confidence shown in the L
[normal]AA
[normal] to accurately merits test applications for judicial review
[normal]. No reason is given why additional resources could not be diverted to the LAA to enable weak cases to be sifted out before they are issued (to the extent it is claimed that this does not happen already), with consequent saving of public funds. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The modif
[normal]ication the Government now proposes offers very little comfort – it does nothing to reduce the uncertainty over whether legal representatives will be paid
[normal] – indeed it increases it - 
[normal]and is unlikely to benefit claimant lawyers in most cases. There is much s
[normal]cope for uncertainty about the manner in which the exhaustive criteria will be applied by the LAA and the discretion is likely to operate in a very narrow range of cases. The costs of attempting to secure payment 
[normal]– which are at risk for solicitors - 
[normal]will b
[normal]e disproportionate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Costs of Oral Hearings[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The existing approach to costs is flexible and allows judges to do justice on a case by case basis. The current approach reflects the fact that attendance at an oral hearing is optional for a defendant, who will
[normal] already have set out their opposition to the claim in detailed terms.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Wasted Costs Orders[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Government observes that Wasted Costs Orders (WCOs) against claimants’ legal representatives are rarely made (paragraph 147). It does not identify any cases where a WCO should have been made, but was not. It is unclear why there is a need for reform of
[normal] the current system of WCOs and no evidence is provided to illuminate this. WCOs already penalise legal representatives for improper, negligent or unreasonable conduct, and the 
[normal]courts have made it clear that there are important public policy reasons why pu
[normal]rsuing a weak case 
[normal]should never – for that reason –
[normal] 
[normal]result in a WCO. The proposal will have a disproportionate and unfair impact on judicial review claimants of limited financial means.
[normal] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Weak cases in judicial review proceedings are already liable to be d
[normal]ealt with by an award of costs against the losing party (not the representative) in the normal way, at the permission stage which identifies and filters out weak cases. A wider use of WCOs will be pursued by defendants against the legal representatives of 
[normal]claimants without financial resources, as defendants will not be able to recover costs from such claimants even if they obtain an order for costs against them. The result is therefore to discourage legal representatives from bringing judicial review claims
[normal] on behalf of those of limited means. This is a matter of particular concern given the crucial role judicial review performs in safeguarding the fundamental rights of minorities, including those without financial resources
[normal].
