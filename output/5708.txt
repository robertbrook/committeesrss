[[[Jiří Król]]], Deputy CEO, Head of Government and Regulatory Affairs, AIMA&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q57 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] Good afternoon. I think you were sitting at the back listening and you will pretty well know how these things proceed. You are extremely welcome here, first of all, Mr Parker, from the NFU, and Mr Hale and Mr Król from the Alternative Investment Management Association. The questions will be pretty obvious. Some are directed to the NFU and some to you, but if you feel that you have something to contribute to the answers, please come in and say so; on the other hand, if you agree with what is being said, I do not think there is any point in saying it a second or third time.We will start. I will ask the first question, and I will ask the Lord Wrigglesworth to ask the second question. This one is quite clearly to Mr Parker, originally: could you give us an overview of why businesses are set up as partnerships in the agricultural sector? What types of partnerships are used and what are the implications for the sector of the clauses in the draft Finance Bill?

[[[Michael Parker]]]: By way of background, in excess of 90% of farm businesses are unincorporated. Probably in the region of 40% trade through a partnership. Primarily, that is through a general partnership. There is very little use of LLPs in our industry. The partnership structure is a particularly suitable one for farming businesses, which tend to be family businesses, often intergenerational and with several generations included within the same partnership. It is quite a simple structure to operate through. There is less formality compared to a limited company and it probably provides greater flexibility in terms of rewarding different partners for their changing contributions to the partnership over a long career. Also, perhaps some of the benefits of limited companies are not necessarily relevant. They are not necessarily looking to offer equity to external investors and there may be limited need for a limited liability. There are some mixed partnerships, as I think has been alluded to in earlier evidence from other people. Often, that is for a commercial reason or an historic reason; some of these have existed for many years. In some cases, there are land-tenure issues as to why you would not fully incorporate a business. That is pretty much my overview.

[[[The Chairman:]]] What is the effect of the draft clauses in the Finance Bill on the agricultural sector?

[[[Michael Parker]]]: It is primarily the mixed-partnership legislation that could have an impact. It is really dependent on how the legislation is interpreted. We have gone from original proposals, which seemed to have a motive test that one of the main reasons for the business structure was tax avoidance, to something which is more around whether it is reasonable to assume that a tax advantage has been arrived at. It really depends upon how the legislation is interpreted on mixed partnerships.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Can you give examples of where you think the proposals would be damaging to agriculture?

[[[Michael Parker]]]: It creates uncertainty. If you have a mixed partnership with a corporate partner in it, you are potentially within the legislation. You will have to justify what the corporate member is doing in return for the profit allocation, and that leaves you open to having to incur costs and advice, and justifying that, even in purely commercial arrangements.

[[[Q58 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Wrigglesworth:]]] Do you accept that structures involving partnerships in businesses are being used for tax-avoidance purposes? How should the Government attack tax avoidance if some structures are being used for that purpose?

[[[Michael Parker]]]: Yes, I accept that there are some that will be using this business structure in that way. It depends a little on how you define tax avoidance: whether you define that as lost tax or whether you include deferral of tax on profits. There has been mention of some businesses seeking to retain profits for working capital and there has also been talk about disparity between income tax rates and corporation tax rates. It rather depends on what we are talking about there. If we are talking about tax lost, I would perfectly agree with that. Unfortunately, this legislation includes even deferral, where there is not going to be tax loss because, when the profits are extracted, higher-rate tax will be due. There is a potential issue there.

[[[Lord Wrigglesworth:]]] Do you think that the current proposals are weighted too much towards counter-avoidance and do not pay enough care and attention to the business case for it?

[[[Michael Parker]]]: They are fairly widely drawn, so that they do, perhaps, have the potential to limit a business’s ability to retain and invest profits. We have seen the gap between corporation tax and income tax rates widen. We have seen, certainly in farming, agricultural buildings allowances abolished and we have seen reductions in capital allowances, and farming is particularly capital intensive, which makes it far more difficult to continue to invest at the same level. That is not to say that that is the reason why the majority of mixed partnerships exist in farming. The majority are commercially driven and historic where land ownership has been fragmented, or land tenure, in some cases.

[[[Q59 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Baroness Drake:]]] I come to the issue of the tests proposed in the draft legislation for determining whether partnership profits or losses can be reallocated by the HMRC. Mr Parker, starting with you, the farmers’ group submission stated that the proposed tests are extremely subjective and, as a result, are not well targeted. Perhaps you could elaborate on why you think they are not sufficiently targeted.

[[[Michael Parker]]]: The original statement seemed to suggest that it would not affect businesses where the driver for the structure was commercial. It potentially does now or, at the very least, it will mean you have to justify what the corporate partner’s role in the business is and whether the profit that it receives is commensurate with what it brings to the partnership.

[[[Baroness Drake:]]] There are four specific criteria, but are they equally untargeted in your view or are there particular ones within those four?

[[[Michael Parker]]]: I would have preferred to have seen a tax-motive test as the first thing as to whether the legislation should apply to the business. That is one of the main issues, because it brings uncertainty. As I said, in the majority of cases, the profit share would be justified, but it is potentially going to be necessary to do that.

[[[Baroness Drake:]]] If the company’s share of the partnership profits is not excessive, will they not be safe?

[[[Michael Parker]]]: Yes, it would only be if they were judged to be excessive. That leaves quite a lot open to debate in terms of what a realistic return for that business is and what that business brings to the partnership.

[[[Baroness Drake:]]] Do other members of the panel want to comment on that particular provision?

[[[Paul Hale]]]: The same issues are relevant to partnerships operating in a wide variety of businesses. In each case, there is going to be an issue in identifying whether the reward to the corporate member, which, on the face of it, in the legislation, is couched in terms of a return on money at interest equal to the amount of capital that the corporate entity is putting into the business, is excessive or not. There are going to be questions on what the appropriate rate of return is. It is introducing a lot of uncertainty into businesses where there is no excessive tax-avoidance motive. There may be what the Government clearly is trying to regard as some form of tax-avoidance motive, in that you try to accumulate working capital for the business in a form that attracts corporation tax at 20%-odd rather than personal income taxes. You can have a big debate over whether that is tax avoidance or acceptable tax mitigation.

[[[Q60 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Bilimoria:]]] Just following on from that, could you give us an overview of the role of partnerships in the sector that your association represents, Mr Król and Mr Hale, and the relevance of the Finance Bill?

[[[Paul Hale]]]: Would it be helpful if I just gave you a little bit of background about AIMA?

[[[Lord Bilimoria:]]] Yes, please.

[[[Paul Hale]]]: That will then lead into some of the questions, and certainly some of the ones that you were putting to the accountancy bodies earlier. By way of background, AIMA is the global trade association for the hedge fund industry. Its role is to provide leadership to the industry and it represents all of the practitioners. That includes hedge fund managers, fund of hedge fund managers, prime brokers, legal and accounting firms, investors, fund administrators and independent fund directors. We have more than 1,400 corporate members in over 50 countries and are represented in all of the major financial centres globally. Manager members account for approximately $1.3 trillion, which is roughly 50% of the worldwide hedge fund industry’s assets under management. That is our global position. Our members in the UK represent about 28% of the entire membership, and we have currently 395 UK-based members. 67% of those—two thirds or about 260—are managers. They collectively manage somewhere between $500 billion and $700 billion of assets. We believe that about 60% of those 263 managers are established as LLPs, with perhaps a handful as a limited or general partnership, so this legislation is very relevant to our members.There are some further background details, which I will give you very briefly, because they are definitely relevant to the matters you are considering. These managers carry on the business of investment managers; that is, they manage investments held by funds, the shares or interests in which are marketed to investors, or else they manage institutional managed accounts for insurance companies and pension funds et cetera. The managers do not, themselves, hold monies or assets, which is the role in the structure of prime brokers, depositaries or custodians, and the managers are not funds themselves. They are regulated by the FCA. Under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, which is coming into force, many, if not all, of these asset managers will be classed as alternative investment fund managers, and the funds they manage as alternative investment funds—these are often referred to by the lovely acronyms AIFMs and AIFs. This means that the managers will be potentially subject to the regime imposed under the AIFMD on variable remuneration, which will require that receipt of a significant proportion of variable remuneration must be deferred. That will be between 40% and 60% of variable remuneration—in most cases, we believe it will be 60%—with at least a three-year or up to a five-year, perhaps, deferral period. Half of all variable remuneration, whether received up front or deferred, will have to be received in the form of equity interests—in practice, equity in the fund—and that must be retained for at least six months.The AIFMD is in the process of coming into effect but many managers are already operating similar deferment regimes for business reasons, not least because there are investor pressures. Even if the managers are not required under the rules in the directive to operate this deferral regime, because they pass a series of proportionality tests, they may fall into other regimes under other directives or under voluntary arrangements, which will require them to operate these deferral arrangements.The consequence is that, in these Finance Bill proposals, the parts that are of relevance to our members are those on the position of salaried members of LLPs, those which relate to the allocation of profits within partnerships with mixed membership, and, in particular, the provision that you were discussing earlier with the accountancy bodies, which relate to AIFM businesses. That part of the schedule is an easement—it is not a tax-raising provision at all—and is being developed with a considerable amount of input from our organisation to provide a solution to a problem that arises because of the AIFMD deferral regime. We are happy to talk further on that to a specific question, if you wish.

[[[Jiří Król]]]: The AIFMD is currently being implemented in the EU and the UK. Some of the uncertainties that previous speakers have mentioned as it relates to remuneration or profit shares have become doubly more complex, because rules on remuneration under the AIFMD itself are not quite clear as to whether profit shares count or not as remuneration or as profit shares. That goes for various forms of management companies. So there is an extra, added complexity for managers who are now preparing to implement AIFMD as well as preparing for the changes that this legislation is likely to bring.

[[[Q61 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Bilimoria:]]] If I may just build on this and ask some really specific questions, you have said very clearly that you have a particular interest in the changes that will affect the AIFM sector. To what extent were you involved in discussing the proposals with HMRC subsequent to the issue of the consultative document in May 2013?

[[[Paul Hale]]]: Very considerably. In the period from early June to the end of September, we had, I think, three substantial meetings of two hours or more with a considerable team of HMRC, HMT and FCA representatives. We had a telephone conversation as well, which was a good hour or so, and a considerable amount of email correspondence. That resulted in the development of what is now the AIFM business part of the schedule.

[[[Lord Bilimoria:]]] It seems that the pronounced effect on the firms in your sector came as a surprise to HMRC. Is that correct? Did they listen to the points that you made on behalf of the sector? Are you satisfied with the outcome?

[[[Paul Hale]]]: It should not have been a surprise to HMT, HMRC and the FCA, because the very point had been identified in submissions made to the FCA in relation to the introduction of the AIFMD. It had been made in liaison meetings with HMT and HMRC, and I am afraid to say that the right channels of communication, quite clearly, had not been present. That was over a period of, perhaps, a year to 18 months prior to the consultative document coming out.To give, following that brickbat, very much credit, though, to HMRC, HMT and the FCA, when we went to our first meeting with them, the atmosphere and the attitude that they had changed very rapidly when they realised that we had a valid point and one that needed to be addressed. It was perhaps sealed when we described the point, which, effectively, is that, if the deferral has to be made of the whole of the remuneration—the 100% of variable—the manager who has been lucky enough to receive this amount of money has, perhaps, 20% in cash and 20% of that amount in fund equities, which he cannot redeem for six months, but he has a tax bill equal to 47% of that amount, which is due in approximately a year’s time—maybe less. Further, if he loses remuneration, he still has the tax bill. When the FCA representative confirmed, more or less with the one-word answer “Yes”, when HMRC asked “Is that a correct interpretation of the effects of the deferral rules?”, there was a considerable amount of willingness to find a solution to this. The effort spent on this must have been a considerable part of the workload of Richard Rogers at HMRC and his team over those few months. In that sense, yes, we made the point and it was listened to, but I am afraid it was not one that should have been new to them, because it had been communicated clearly to them.

[[[Lord Bilimoria:]]] Is this what you see as a justification for a different outcome for your members when other partnerships—for example, in the agricultural sector, we have just heard—see the need to retain profits for business expansion?

[[[Paul Hale]]]: This part of the schedule—the AIFM business—addresses a very particular problem, which is the cash flow and tax liability position of members of an AIFM business. It does not enable hedge fund managers to retain cash for working capital or to indulge in any other sort of scheme. As I said, it is not a tax-raising measure. The key point of the arrangement, which, I am afraid, the representative of the accountancy professions did not fully grasp, is that the tax on the variable remuneration can, if the business and the member elect to go within the scheme, because it is voluntary, be raised if the profits are deemed for tax purposes to be accruing to the business itself—the LLP—even though it is not a person for tax purposes. The LLP then has a tax liability on that amount equal to 45%, and the LLP pays that tax.When the profits vest in the partner in whom they are originally intended to go to, in perhaps three years’ time, that partner is treated at that point as receiving the gross amount of the profits, which includes a tax credit for that 45%. Those profits are treated as arising to him as the profits of the trade in that later year of assessment. The amount of tax that he pays will then depend on what the tax rate is at that period. If we have a Government that has put it up to 50% from 45%, he suffers. He can also bring into account any reliefs like pension payments, gift aid or trading losses that are available. So, we have had a payment on account and then a realignment when the deferred profits adjust, and everybody, give or take the vagaries of life, is happy.If the profits have not vested, then, from a tax point of view, that is it: the amount is treated as a capital sum. If it is reallocated by the LLP to other partners, they get it—a share of the 55 that is left out of the 100—and there is no further tax liability, but the tax credit that was paid on it cannot be recovered. Again, that reflects what the position is under current law: that, if a partnership, say, has retained an amount of money and not distributed it to its partners, the partners will have paid tax on that. If it then decides it does not need this money but will reallocate it to particular partners, they have no tax liability on it, because it is an amount of capital within that partnership. That is a very convenient and easy way of resolving the issue of how to deal with lost, unvested deferred remuneration. If you wanted to be more rigorous, as it were, and trace through the tax credit and see how the profits vest through into other partners who get this at second, third or fourth hand, remember the deferral periods of up to five years. You could have a paper trail going through various deferral rounds and taking you for 20 years, and that was not appealing to the industry or to the Revenue as an exercise.

[[[Q62 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Bilimoria:]]] Could I just ask one more question on this area? Did it surprise you that much of the yield from the package of legislation affecting partnerships comes from firms in your sector—about £680 million out of the total yield of just over £1 billion? Where does this yield come from and were your firms not paying tax on profits, or paying tax at a lower rate?

[[[Paul Hale]]]: You will have to ask HMRC how they arrive at those figures. I would also point out that, although we are the Alternative Investment Management Association—we represent hedge funds—there are other industries in the alternative investment management sector, such as private equity firms, infrastructure businesses and real estate firms which could be included in the alternative investment sector, as referred to in the budget estimates that were put out. The Revenue will have their reason for believing that there is that money there. It seems a lot from our point of view.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Does it surprise you that it is thought to be £680 million?

[[[Paul Hale]]]: I have no reason for knowing whether that figure is accurate or not, or how it is arrived at, in terms of its accuracy.

[[[Lord Bilimoria:]]] Just to clarify, are you saying that a lot of this could be from people who are not your members?

[[[Paul Hale]]]: I am saying that I do not know where it is coming from, but it could be, because there are or have been arrangements out there for the avoidance of tax using corporate members. That is why the profit-shifting rules have been brought in. They are capable of being used by businesses across a wide range. Who knows? It may be that some of the City law firms or the accountancy firms have also implemented them. Hedge fund businesses have made money; therefore, the opportunity to look at using these schemes would be there. However, what the likely take would be if the rules are implemented and are effective, I have no way of assessing.

[[[Jiří Król]]]: Just to clarify, the Government always mentions AIFM business, and the AIFM Directive covers the entirety of asset management business which is non-UCITS. UCITS is another horrible acronym, which covers, basically, mutual funds and retail funds. Any non-retail asset manager, including, as Paul has said, funds that are retail but do not meet UCITS directive requirements—unit trusts, real estate funds and private equity—is within the AIFM sector, so we do not know whether there are any more detailed estimates on the different sub-sectors within the HMRC calculations.

[[[Baroness Drake:]]] I would like to pursue a small point, Mr Hale. It is your comment about you having no idea where the £680 million came from or how it was determined. Does that imply a comment on the impact assessment and how these things were assessed? Do you have any input into that assessment?

[[[Paul Hale]]]: We are dealing with a tax avoidance measure here, so HMRC will be working from information that they have, which is confidential, because it is the affairs of taxpayers. It will be their analysis of what abuses are out there, how widespread they are and, very importantly, what scope there is for that abuse to swell and be taken up by more and more people, if it is not checked. Unless that sort of detail is released, it is very difficult for persons in our position to make any judgment as to whether it is an accurate figure or not. I think they say that their figures have been verified by the OBR or somebody.

[[[Baroness Drake:]]] Previous commentators have commented that they do not like the quality of the impact assessment. You are saying that you could not know what the quality of that is, because it is based on privileged information and you would not have access to it.

[[[Paul Hale]]]: Yes, and also what it must be based on is the projected profits of businesses. For asset managers, those profits are very closely correlated to their success in producing investment returns for their clients. If the markets go up, it is easier to make money; if the markets are awkward, it is harder to make money. There is implicitly some sort of investment return forecast in those figures. It is not apparent, on the face of it, what that might be.

[[[Q63 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] I wonder if you could help us, perhaps, in another way. It is intriguing to us, as a Committee, to investigate, and you quite rightly gave us a very clear view as to how taxation works within your industry. You do not have any great information to tell us about the £680 million, which we understand, but am I right in concluding from what you said to us that, so far as these new proposals are concerned, there is not a substantial difference in the amount of tax your members will be paying under the new system?

[[[Paul Hale]]]: I may have misunderstood your question. The specific AIFM business proposal is an easement. It is not a tax-raising measure; it enables managers to comply with certain requirements, or voluntary versions of those regulatory requirements, without being in a predicament that Mr Micawber would recognise. The other parts of the legislation will be revenue-raising, or potentially revenue-raising, within our industry, because the salaried partners’ provisions will require that some businesses at least will have to look at particular partners—particular members of the LLPs—and decide whether they pass these tests. Our suspicion is that there will be very many businesses not affected by it; in principle, it is going to affect smaller businesses less because it will be easier to show that people have a significant influence. If you are six partners, even if one is ever so junior, it is possible to say he has a significant influence. The other provisions on reallocation of profits—and that is part of the chapter that has other strains in it, which, I think, are not likely to be relevant—are directed at particular schemes. To the extent that those schemes have been used within our industry or any other industry, if those provisions are effective they will have the consequence of producing a tax take from those firms that would otherwise use them, which is more consistent with what it should be.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is very helpful.

[[[Q64 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Joffe:]]] How open and responsive do you think the consultation process has been? Do you think that you have had adequate opportunity and time to make your case?

[[[Paul Hale]]]: One of the problems with the consultation procedure, which follows a fairly rigid process, is that, in fact, it was undertaken, rightfully, conscientiously by HMRC. They started going out and talking to interested bodies about these proposals very early, which was the correct thing to do, because they are complicated and significant and they affect a large part of the economy. As a result of that and the comments they were getting, HMRC and HMT realised that various parts of those proposals would need to be changed. For instance, on the salaried partners’ provisions, originally there was a two-tier test—a sort of filter, if you like. The first filter was: is this partner, under ordinary law, an employee of the LLP? We were not involved in the discussions on that, so this is hearsay, but a number of members of our organisation who were have contacted us, so it is not bad hearsay. The message that came through to the Government very quickly on that was that that test does not get anywhere, because it is not going to filter out more than, say, 1% of the partners the Government was interested in, because the tests of employment are really not very appropriate to deciding whether someone is a partner or not.So you were left with the second tier of tests. That tier of tests, as framed in the consultative document, was widely seen as impractical, and it was in response to that that the Revenue went away and reformulated the current three conditions we have. Those conditions may or may not be useful but they were being formulated, and there was a good deal of input from a good number of interested parties. It may be that the Revenue was talking mainly to people in the City and to City-based institutions, like the Chartered Institute of Taxation and so on, and was not talking more widely around the country, but it really was the case that, by the time we put in our response to the consultation, which closed on about 8 or 9 August, we were really replying to a consultation on a series of proposals that had been altered in quite a lot of important respects. You may regard that as an effective consultation, because the Revenue were hearing things, listing things and acting on them. In some ways, it is also a waste of time because a lot of points were being made at the expense of a good deal of paper and a good deal of effort on parts of respondents that had already been addressed and were no longer part of the proposal.

[[[Jiří Król]]]: To add a comparative point, the UK Government’s consultation procedure is incredibly open and is much more thorough than what we experience in other jurisdictions. We see that there is willingness to engage and willingness to listen, even though, in the end, we may not be happy with the results because there may be political decisions taken and policy will go left rather than right. In that respect, we would definitely commend the engagement. In particular, for the first time, we have seen the FCA, HMRC and HMT working closely together on something that is quite complex, and that is the interaction between the regulatory rules coming from Brussels, where the FCA may not have full scope of flexibility in terms of how they interpret the rules and how they can work with the industry, and the tax authorities, to produce something that, at least, is not extremely harmful; to produce something that, as Paul said, is an easement and makes the regime practicable for our members.

[[[Lord Joffe:]]] That is a comforting response, but what is your view of the assessments made by the Government of the impact of the proposed tax changes on business in your sector?

[[[Jiří ]]]

[[[Król]]]: The biggest point, and the biggest complaint, that we have heard from our membership, first and foremost, has been the uncertainty. The fact is that we are facing enormous changes, and not just within our sector; the entire financial market is being overhauled, and it would be nice to have something stable on the tax side for businesses to be able to plan for, and something solid to rely on for the next several years. In that respect, there was a big complaint about the overall business climate that some of these profound changes are going to effect. 

[[[Paul Hale]]]: The Government had, at the time of the budget, launched its UK investment management strategy, one of the key issues in which was a certainty of taxation regime, and consultation about taxation proposals, and so on. Then, 30 seconds after, it produces this consultation document on partnerships that has a tremendous disruptive effect on the industry. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] I wonder if we could ask the same questions of Mr Parker, as to the consultative arrangements and agriculture.

[[[Michael Parker]]]: The consultation was very open. We, as an industry group, managed to get a meeting with HMRC. We were able to give some views, and make the point that just because a partnership is a mixed partnership does not mean that there is a tax advantage. For example, a mixed partnership does not have an annual investment allowance on plant and machinery, which could be an issue for some farming businesses. We were also able to give examples of where mixed partnerships that are commercially driven historically came into being and the land tenure points. I agree, really, that whether those points went any further than being listened to is another matter. It seems as though there had been a decision in terms of how the policy was going to be implemented and how the legislation would be formed, and it was just a question of evaluating whether there are unforeseen consequences, as there may be in industries such as ours. 

[[[Q65 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] I wonder if I could ask one final question. Do you think the Government does enough to monitor and evaluate whether the tax changes it has introduced meet their policy objectives, and if not, what more should they do? 

[[[Paul Hale]]]: There are, perhaps, two different types of tax change here that need to be considered. The first, which is really what we have been talking about today, is anti-avoidance measures. Those are effectively monitored, because HMRC has identified an abuse and told the Government it needs to be dealt with. Having introduced the legislation, they will continue to monitor tax returns, disclosures of tax schemes et cetera to try and determine whether it has been effective or not, so in that sense that monitoring is continuous. Some form of public report to say, “Yes this has been successful; hey, look, we think we have saved £X billion from being lost” may or may not be necessary.The other sort of tax change out there is a measure that would be designed to influence behaviour, or encourage investment, or something like that. There is a much stronger case for having a more formal system for reviewing that. Presumably, the Treasury does internally wish to know whether a measure that has been promoted has been successful. Presumably, where it has been promoted at the behest of an interested body, they will be monitoring it. So, if you have some sort of relief for building wind farms or producing films in the UK, interest groups will be getting input from their members as to whether it is working or not. Now, there is always going to be a time lag in finding out how effective something like that is, because tax returns come in, say, a year after the profits have been earned against which the relief is being claimed, and then they are considered. You are always going to have a timescale of two or three years before the results are known. However, presumably, if a measure has been introduced for a policy reason like that, then there should be a mechanism of evaluating whether it has been successful. It would be interesting for the general public to know whether the relief has been put to good use or not.  

[[[Q66 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Baroness Drake:]]] I will try to make this very brief. Mr Hale, of the three economic tests—variable profits, influence over management and capital contribution—which will pose the greatest challenge to your members? 

[[[Paul Hale]]]: To go in reverse order, as it were, the capital test is very likely to be of absolutely no help. Hedge fund management businesses, because they do not hold client money, and as I said at the beginning, because they are not trading their own assets, have a very low regulatory capital requirement. It may be something like 13 weeks’ expenses. If things go well in a hedge fund, the financial rewards are very great and the variable remuneration therefore could well be expected to be more than four times the amount of capital that the individual has put in. The variable remuneration, in some businesses, would be an issue. It is not quite clear how that is defined and operated in practice. There is, as drafted, a definite link to the overall profits of the business. In a lot of businesses, you will have people who are remunerated, to some extent, by the results of their own income stream. The accountancy bodies touched on that earlier. However, you could well have a situation in a fund management business where you have, perhaps, three funds and three separate teams that are largely responsible for each fund. Their remuneration will be tailored to those particular funds’ performance, rather than to the performance of the business as a whole. Now, you may be able to come up with an arrangement in your partnership agreement that says your remuneration will be assessed by looking at the profits of the business as a whole, and deciding what proportion of that profit you will get in terms of performance units. Performance units will be geared to what you have done in your own part of the business. Is that getting close enough to the parties being affected substantially by the whole profits of the business or not? I do not know. The draft guidance the Revenue has published is not particularly helpful on that point. Then, finally, there is significant influence. It is clear that significant influence does not mean the ability to control the business; it means the ability to make your voice heard and have your opinions taken into account. The Revenue suggest in their guidance that if you have a management board of 10 they would regard, in principle, all of those 10 as having significant influence. If you have more than 10 on the board, some of those people would not have significant influence. That characteristic is going to be one that will help clarify the position of a lot of members in hedge fund management businesses, because—and again, I do not have the figures on this—my experience is that a lot of the businesses are 10 partners or less. However, there will be some businesses where you have a large number of partners and/or distinct income or profit streams within the business, where there will be more of an issue. 

[[[Q67 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Can I just ask, Mr Parker, on the more general question of monitoring and evaluating things, whether you think the Inland Revenue are satisfactory from your point of view? Do they do a good job?

[[[Michael Parker]]]: Certainly, it is desirable to continue to evaluate post&#x2011;implementation, to see whether impact assessments are accurate, whether implementation costs for HMRC and the taxpayers have been fully taken into account, and also whether there are unintended consequences. Has it only affected its policy target or have there been others that have been brought into the legislation, and has that affected levels of investment, particularly for certain industries or those that were not the intended target of the policy? 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you all very much for coming. I do not say this at the end of every session, but I think I have learned something today that I did not know before, and that, in itself, as far as I am concerned, makes it very valuable. You certainly were very helpful to the Committee and I am very grateful to you for coming. Thank you very much indeed.
