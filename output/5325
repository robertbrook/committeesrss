[normal]Dear Mr Sinton,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As Chairman of the New City Initiative, I feel compelled to write to you on behalf of our members, many of whom are limited liability 
[normal]partnerships, about the proposed changes to the taxation of partnerships contained in the draft Finance Bill 2014.  The New City Initiative believes the proposed legislation on partnership tax throws up a number of concerns which could sound the death knel
[normal]l for investment management partnerships.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It may even produce an own goal for the UK tax authorities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yours sincerely
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]The NCI is a think tank that offers an independent, expert voice in the debate over the future of financial 
[normal]regulation.
[normal]Founded in 2010, NCI counts amongst its members some of the leading independent asset management firms in the City and the continent. The NCI gives a voice to independent, owner-managed firms that are entirely focused on and aligned with the in
[normal]terests of their clients and investors.
[normal]Over the last decade, an old fashioned “client-centric” approach has enabled entrepreneurial firms in the Square Mile and beyond to emerge as a growing force in a financial industry dominated by global financial gian
[normal]ts. Now, more so than ever, these firms play a key role in preserving the stability and long-term focus of the financial sector, 
[normal]which is of benefit to society at large.
[normal]Today The New City Initiative is comprised of 43
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]leading independent asset management 
[normal]firms from the UK and the Continent, managing approximately £350 billion and employing several thousand people.
