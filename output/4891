defaultNobel Prize winning psychologist, Daniel Kahneman, 
defaultargues that people are prone to apply causal thinking inappropriately; to situations that require statistical reasoning. Statistical thinking derives conclusions about individual cases from properties of categories and ensembles. Unfortunately, System 1 do
defaultes not have capability for this mode of reasoning: System 2 can learn to think statically, but few people receive the training. He writes that psychology of causality was the basis of the decision to describe psychological processes by metaphors of agency,
default with little concern for consistency (pp77)
default 
default(Kahneman, 2011)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor argues that engineers do get trained in the use of statistics and probability, but they do not appreciate the errors they introduce into their reasoning when they confound intentional and physical causality.  Several examples of this nature emerge f
defaultrom the consideration of 
defaultscientific 
defaultliterature 
defaultsince Rene Descartes time. Arthur Schopenhauer (1813) gives an example of heat, a property of matter, being the cause of rising quicksilver in a thermometer as an example of physical causality(pp155)
default 
default(Schopenhaeur, 1813/2006)
default.   Arthur Schopenhauer (1813) refuted Rene Descartes’s 
defaultontological argument for God by saying that the immensity of God is a logical reason, from which it follows, that God needs no cause; whereas Rene Descarte
defaults confounds the two 
defaulttogether and obviously has no clear consciousness of the difference between reason and cause
default. 
defaultProperly speaking however, it is his intention which mars his insight
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Descartes error of dualism between the world of objects (soulles
defaults bodies) and world of mental subjects (bodies less souls) makes appearance in the writings of Daniel Kahneman drawing upon writings of Paul Bloom (pp77)
default 
default(Kahneman, 2011)
default. 
defaultPsychologist Paul Bloom
default writes on his website that t
defaulthe
defaultre is considerable evidence that adults are natural dualists--we see
default 
defaultthe world as Descartes did, as containing physical things (or bodies) and social entities (or souls). I am interested in how this common-sense dualism emerges in development, and the impl
defaultications that it has for domains such as morality and religion.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultManagers and engineers, author speculates, without the background in design of systems, are prone to confound
default reasoning about
default intentional and physical 
defaultcausation. This can be treated as a rep
defaultresentative bias which appears in reasoning over human error frequently in accident investigations (pp149)
default 
default(Kahneman, 2011)
default. 
defaultEvery policy decision on risk and safety involves assumptions about human nature, in particular about 
defaultchoices that people may make and the consequences of choices for themselves and society. The Exhibition 
defaultRoad 
defaulthas become safer because there is less chance of interaction between pedestrians and motorised vehicles
default because British vehicles drivers use a para
defaultllel road after hundred million pound investment, but few exemplary organisations think otherwise
default. Managers and engineers who made decisions on planning and delivery of technological projects and associated activities rarely appear on the radar of the acc
defaultident investigator
default 
defaultinvestigating a particular rare event in operations that 
defaulthas 
defaultled to fatalities.
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor did not find evidence that Danish Roads afford any more safety to cyclists than British Roads 
defaultfrom the limited information available 
defaulton the Web
default article
default.
