"Written evidence submitted by Friends, Families and Travellers (LAI 0022)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe are a nati\nonal organisation working with Gypsies and Travellers.\n&#xa0;\nMany of our clients have no sites on which to stop and therefore have no option but to camp wherever they can.  They are some of the most vulnerable members of society and can be subject to faulty dec\nision making on evictions by local authorities.\n&#xa0;\nWe a\nre concerned that the proposed L\negal \nA\nid reforms will mean that that Legal Aid Providers will no longe\nr be willing to take on Judicial R\neview cases because they will not be able to risk the fact that the\n case will be run pro bono without any guarantee of payment.  This will lead to situations where people, such as Gypsies and Travellers, will be evicted despite the fact that the local authority or public authority are acting unlawfully and where local and\n public authorities in general will have immunity to act in unlawful ways in the most serious of situations without the individual concerned having recourse to a realistic method of challenging that decision or that action.\n&#xa0;\nWe additionally would like to s\ntate that we support all the comments in the submission of the Community Law Partnership in \nBirmingham\n, with whom we share many Gypsy and Traveller clients.\n&#xa0;\n26 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n&#xa0;\n"
