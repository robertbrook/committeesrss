[normal]We are committed to working with government departments, stakeholders and industry in helping to manage the coastal and marine environment
[normal] and acknowledge the important part this designation process has played in this. The Crown Estate supports all the key objectives of the Marine and Coastal Access Act, which includes the designation of a network of well-managed MPAs, and to this end we have provided significant support and data to ensure that the most important sites are recognised and designated. Following designation of MPAs/MCZs, The Crown Estate will continue to be actively involved through the conservation objectives and management measures identification and implementation process. We would welcome the opportunity to be invited by Defra and Devolved Governments to play a key contributing part in the development of the designation process and relevant steering groups going forward as we believe there will be valuable and significant contribution The Crown Estate can make to the designation processes. 
[normal]Section 3 outlines more specific comments related to the questions posed as part of this inquiry. In particular
[normal], the designation processes to date have given rise to a number of general comments and questions. These apply to the process of designation and management of the MCZ network, but also prompt questions which we feel are important to be considered in the designation and subsequent management of MCZs.

[normal]The diverse portfolio of The Crown Estate comprises marine, rural and urban properties across the whole of the United Kingdom 
[normal]valued in total at £8.1 billion (2013 figures). Under
[normal] the 1961 Crown Estate Act, The Crown Estate is charged with maintaining and enhancing both the value of the property and the revenue from it consistent with the requirements of good management. We are a commercial organisation guided by our core values of commercialism, integrity and stewardship. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Crown Estate’s entire revenue surplus is paid directly to HM Treasury for the benefit of UK citizens
[normal]; in 
[normal]2013 this amounted to over £252 million.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our ownership
[normal] comprises virtually the entire UK seabed out to the 12 nautical mile territorial limit, in addition to the sovereign rights to explore and make use of the natural resources of the UK continental shelf, with the exception of oil, coal and gas. We own over half of the foreshore and around half the beds of estuaries and tidal rivers in the United Kingdom. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Crown Estate manages its marine assets on a commercial basis, guided by the principles of sustainable development and social responsibility. We take a consistent approach to the management of our activities around the UK, whilst retaining flexibility to take local factors into account whenever necessary. The Crown Estate can bring to bear an unparalleled level of knowledge and expertise on issues relating to management of the foreshore, the territorial seabed and continental shelf. We have a strong understanding of the needs of a broad range of sea users, as commercial partners, customers and stakeholders.
