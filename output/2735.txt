[[[About the LGA]]]&#xa0;The Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government.  We work with councils to support, promote and improve local government.&#xa0;We are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.&#xa0;The LGA covers every part of England and Wales, supporting local government as the most efficient and accountable part of the public sector.&#xa0;

[[[ roads more resilient]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;18.1&#xa0; A new type of gritting technique, spreading dry salt and salt mixed with brine trialled last winter by Cheshire East Council. The solution is less easily removed by passing vehicles or strong winds and lasts longer without retreatment. &#xa0;18.2&#xa0; Last winter West Sussex County Council deployed a brand new fleet of 26 gritters which use 20 per cent less salt, and are equipped with a GPS system called ‘Coldsnap,’ which makes it possible to monitor gritting throughout the county on a minute by minute basis. It also used an electronic monitoring system so that more salt could be ordered if required.&#xa0;18.3&#xa0; Brighton &amp; Hove City Council acquired a fleet of new gritting wagons, which have better fuel economy, are less polluting, and use a more effective spreader. The council also invested in a new sit-on ‘Unimog’ vehicle for clearing pavements, which will be better for hilly and narrow streets. &#xa0;18.4&#xa0; Hampshire County Council trialled some innovative ‘back to black’ snow plough blades last year which remove more snow by ploughing closer to the road surface. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;21.1&#xa0; Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council published a leaflet sent to thousands of residents, as part of its regular magazine, about winter and council services, including how to clear pavements, drive in snow and the locations of its 300 grit bins. &#xa0;21.2&#xa0; Authorities using a ‘Gritter Twitter’ account included West Sussex County, Sandwell Council Gloucestershire County Council and Solihull Council. This allowed the councils to tell people when roads were being treated, give weather updates and winter driving advice.&#xa0;21.3&#xa0; More than 13,500 residents signed up to Northumberland County Council’s alerts system which used its website, social media like Twitter and Facebook, and smartphone apps to pass on the latest information on weather, school closures, road conditions/closures, flood alerts, bin collections and emergencies.&#xa0;
