defaultQ291default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I welcome you to this meeting of the Scottish Affai
defaultrs Committee. This is our third evidence session 
defaultin our 
defaultinquiry 
defaultinto land reform in 
defaultScotland
default. It would be helpful if for the record you said who you were, what your background was and what your area of expertise was. Is this the first time we have had two professors out of two? No. We have had scor
defaultes of professors before, but we 
defaulthave
default usually
default always had a normal 
defaultmortal with them 
defaultrather than
default exclusively professors.
default              
defaultGraeme Morrice:default We 
defaulthad three
default at one time
default.
defaultChair:default Okay. Tell us who you are
default, then
default.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: 
defaultMy name is Paul Cheshire. I am professor of economic geography at the LSE. I am interested i
defaultn urban economics, land markets and
default land use planning effects viewed from an economic perspective.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: I am David Adams. I am the professor of property and urban studies at the 
defaultUniversity
default of 
defaultGlasgow
default. My interest is in the interaction between planning and property real estate markets, primarily in an urban context. In relation to this inquiry, I am one of the advisers to the Scottish Government’s land reform review group.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ292default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Thank you very much. 
defaultAs you will appreciate, most of 
defaultus here do not have a backgrou
defaultnd in this area of work. Don’t
default feel you will be insulting us by telling 
defaultus very
default 
defaultbasic things. W
defaulte would much rather be told very basic things twice than have them skimmed over. 
defaultGiven the fact that l
defaultand reform in Scotland has traditionally focused on rural
default rather than urban land—w
defaulte 
defaultare interested in both of those—
defaultand the distortions caused by the tax system
default, d
defaultoes it make sense for us to make, however, a substantial differentiation between the 
defaultway in which urban
default land markets
default 
defaultand rural land markets work, or is there a substantial degree of overlap?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: T
defaulthere is a substantial degree of overlap
default if 
defaultyou look at markets in a particular
default way
default,
default which places great emphasis on th
defaulte behaviour and
default strategies of the owner
default. I
defaultt looks at the relationship between the strategies and key players, such as estate agents, so there are ways in which you look at land markets that can be as applicable in urban and rural areas.
default              
defaultHaving said that, the issues are rather 
defaultdifferent. In urban areas, certainly in key settlements in 
defaultScotland
default such as 
defaultGlasgow
default, there is a huge overhang of land 
defaultthat is not being used. It has been 
defaultvacant and derelict for a long period of time. In rural areas
default, such
default la
defaultnd is very rare in terms of 
defaultunused land on the Scottish Government’s vacant and derelict land register, for example, and the issues are much more about ownership structures and the extent to which
default,
default as a result of those ownership structures
default,
default the land is being used to 
defaultsustainable effect or not.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I would come at it from a rather different view. My basic message to you would b
defaulte that all the work
default that
default I
default 
defaulthave done, 
defaultand
default that
default an in
defaultcreasing number of scholars
default around the world have done
default,
default 
defaultreinforces the conclusion that 
defaultland markets are 
defaultamazingly efficient at capitalising almost everything. By “capitalising
default,”
default I mean that the price of land reflec
defaultts everything about its value and
default use, including intangible things like not just cur
defaultrent aircraft noise 
defaultbut expected future aircraft noise. Some very interesting work is g
defaultoing on in 
defaultBerlin
default at the moment. T
defaulthere is a 
defaultproposal for a 
defaultnew airport
default,
default and the proposed flight paths and opening date have been changed over time. Each of those changes is already capitalised into the land markets in 
defaultBerlin
default. I
defaultf you try to help poor farmers by giving them subsidies, it gets capitalised i
defaultnto the price of land. I
defaultf you give
default inheritance tax relief
defaults
default to farmers to try to keep family farms going, it gets capitalised into the price of land and squeezes 
defaultfamily farmers out. I
defaultf you give subsidies to farmers, it gets capitalis
defaulted in the price of rural land. I
defaultf you give planning permission with parti
defaultcular obligations, t
defaulthe expected value of those obligations
default—because it is always in the future—is 
defaultagain reflected in the price of land. This seems remarkably efficient
default,
default given
default that
default 
defaultwe know there is
default a fair degree of
default 
defaultapparent monopoly in land markets
default, but you still have trade
default and it is trade on the margin that really matters. In urban areas
default,
default 
defaultbecause 
defaultlots of houses are changing hands
default,
default the process
default may be rather quicker and 
defaultcomplete than it is in rural areas where the volume of trades is rather less relative to the total stock of land.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ293default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Professor Adams, I presume you agree with tha
defaultt. It is always quite helpful for
default us to have witnesses disagreeing and fighting between themselves, because it then illustrates for us the areas perhaps we need to give further thought
default to
default. If either of you do not say anything about the other’s answer, we will assume that you agree 100%.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: I do not think you can assume that you can get two economists in a room to agree. I do not fully agree with what Prof
defaultessor Cheshire has to say. H
defaulte comes at it from a different mode of economic analysis that has its strengths as well as 
defaultits 
defaultweaknesses. There are a number of issues in what he has to say. First, the difference between price and v
defaultalue needs to be much clearer. For example, o
defaultne of the i
defaultssues
default is 
defaultthe huge difficulties
default in ascertaini
defaultng what the value is, 
defaultthose difficulties 
defaultoften 
defaultbeing the resul
defaultt of not enough price evidence—
defaultin other words, not enough transactions.
defaultIn terms of the transactions in land and how the market works, we often find that 
defaulta lot of the deals are done in a fairly closed way. Land is advertised t
defaulto a very short list of people. I
defaultt is not openly marketed; it is not an open competition; it is th
defaultrough contacts and networks.
default I would take what we call 
defaulta 
defaultmuch more institutional view of the land market than perhaps Professor Cheshire
default takes. For example, the 
defaultbig land agents in Scotland are very important in what one m
defaultight call making the market and the way 
defaultthey lead people on, 
defaultthe way in which 
defaultex
defaultpectations are formed and
default the way in which
default behaviour is changed
default. Y
defaultou might put 
defaultthose two perspectives together
default because, if you take both of them, you might start to get towards 
defaultthe truth. I am not saying 
defaultyou should take one and ignore
default the other, but you
default should not necessarily expect 
defaultthat when you get two of us in a
default room we will agree.
defaultChair:default That is helpful.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: As to the issue of price and value, it is yes and no. I do agree that there are some things which clearly have value
default 
defaultwhich
default 
defaultit is 
defaultdifficult to put prices on. W
defaulthat is the value of habitat, for example? What is the value of an SSSI? What is the value of something which reduces the chances of gl
defaultobal warming? The problem 
defaultis that 
defaultyou have these very long-ter
defaultm and uncertain outcomes and 
defaultit 
defaultis very difficult to value. I
defaultn that sense
default,
default I am not disagreeing with my 
defaultcolleague. There are some things,
default but 
defaultmost of the things which actually happen, like the value of open space, the value of shooting rights, the value of fishing rights, the value of land for food production, the value of land as a licence to receive subsidies, or the value of land as a licence to receive exe
defaultmption from inheritance tax, are 
defaultpretty well
default 
defaultpriced in the market.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ294default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultProfessor Adams, I want
default you
default to clarify the distinction that you seem to be drawing between value and price. Without getting into metaphysics and the like, I just presume
defaultd
default that the only way in which you could measure 
defaultthe 
defaultvalue of a piece of land, as with a piece of art, was the price somebody was prepared to pay for it. Am I missing a point here?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: No. You are right, but then it depends on how much evidence you have of that. Let’s say you are valuing a semi
default-
defaultdetached hou
defaultse. You would expect
default 
defaultthere to be 
defaulta lot of comparable transactions you can draw on. If you are valuing a highland estate, for example, there will be very few relative transactions, and therefore the task of the valuer becomes much more difficult
default. H
defaultypothetically
default, if
default you sent 10 valuers to do that exercise
default, the research shows that
default you would come up with 10 different answers. The question would be: how different are they? That depends on how particular is the form of property. If it is a semi
default-
defaultdetached house, the differences might not be very much; if it is a highland estate, the differences 
defaultbetween different valuers 
defaultmight be quite a lot.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I am putting no trust in v
defaultaluers whatsoever
default,
default b
defaultoth from pe
defaultrsonal experience but also
default from
default 
defaultacademic s
defaulttudies of how reliable they are. A
defaultll my evidence would be drawn from large-scale statistical studies of transactions, and that is where you c
defaultan get really fine detail. It
default is not just a question of two semi
default-
defaultdetached houses in the same road being rather similar, but you can identify statistically the implic
defaultit price of each attribute. E
defaultvery property is different
default,
default but it is compose
defaultd of a bundle of attributes. If 
defaultyou have got a large sample of transactions
default—a 
defaultcolleague at the LSE has just been analysing 1
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion house transactions to identify the price that is put on green belt land
default—
defaultyou can get very accurate
default statistical evidence, but I would never trust a valuer to give me an accurate answer.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ295default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultProfessor Adams in particular, o
defaultne of the difficulties we have with th
defaultese hearings
default is that when you nod it is not recorded, so you have to say something. Let it be recorded that Professor Adams agreed with the idea that you should never trust a valuer.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: Professor Cheshire is right
default. If you have a large number of transactions in a particular form of property, the kind of econometric analysis that he specialises in becomes far easier. If you are undertakin
defaultg that kind of analysis for, say,
default highland estates, it becomes much more difficult than it would be if you were doing it 
defaultin an urban context for,
default say, semi
default-
defaultdetached houses.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: You can probably do it with a sample of 100 transactions
default, and over time 
defaultyou can get pretty good information
default. I have just done a study of 
defaultLondon
default office mark
defaultets where 
defaultI have identif
defaulti
defaulted
default 650 transactions
default, only 51 of which
default are interesting, and it is 
defaultvery clearly statistically identified.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ296default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default Following on from what you said earlier about everything, including tax and subsidies
default,
default affecting the value or price of land, are you able to tell us what
default 
defaultdistorting effects the taxation regime has on land in 
defaultScotland
default?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: As I understand it
default, 
defaultthe 
defaultinheritance 
defaulttax exemption of agricultural land applies in 
defaultScotland
default as it does in 
defaultEngland
default. That
default clearly has inflated the price of agricultural land in 
defaultEngland
default quite substantially. I have not done the work
default,
default and 
defaultI 
defaultdo not know that anyone h
defaultas done the specific work. M
defaulty guess is that
default,
default if you compare agricultural land prices in 
defaultEngland
default or 
defaultScotland
default with equally productive land in, say, 
defaultFrance
default where you do no
defaultt
default have that, you are looking at something like a factor of four.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ297default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWhen you say “a factor of four
default,”
default does that mean it quadruples?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: It is something like
default. I have not
default got a statistical standard
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ298default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default When you say “a factor of four
default,
default”
default does that mean that the price
default is four times higher than it would otherwise be?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: 
defaultThan it would be without the inheritance tax relief.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ299default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default What about other taxes—
defaultfor example
default,
default capital gains tax? There is forestry exemption.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: It
default works in for
defaultestry as well. It used to be that the
default only reason for 
defaultplanting trees wa
defaults to keep your accountant happy as a very big 
defaultwealth holder.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ300default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default Is it only forestry where capital gains tax exemption applies?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: As I understand it, in 
defaultScotland
default that is true; it
default is only forestry, but it has a significant impact on the value of forestry
default. 
defaultIt also has d
defaultistorting
default effec
defaultts on how forestry is managed because
default I think
default i
defaultt applies to the trees, not 
defaultto 
defaultthe land.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ301default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default Can you expand on what distorting effects it has?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I
defaultt is not 
defaultone of 
defaultmy particular area
defaults
default of expertise. As I
default understand it, it affects 
defaulthow old the timber is before you crop it
default. You
default crop it to maximise your tax exemption rather than your timber yield.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ302default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default So it is the trees themselves rather than the land.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I think 
defaultit 
defaultapplies to the trees rather than the land in the case of forestry in 
defaultScotland
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ303default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default 
defaultAre there any other effects of the
default tax system that distort
default land value
defaults?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Obviously, the
defaultre are agricultural subsidies. T
defaulthe single farm payment does, but it is better than the alternative.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ304default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default What about the move to 
defaultan 
defaultarea-based system? Have you analysed what effect that will have?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I am sorry; you will have to clarify that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ305default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default The common agricultural policy is moving away from the single farm payment to an area-based system.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: 
defaultIf it goes to conservation payments, that is clea
defaultrly in the public interest. T
defaulthat will then negatively affect the price of agricultural land
default,
default because
default,
default by and large
default,
default more environmentally 
defaultfriendly f
defaultorms of farming reduce output of
default saleable food, and therefore tend to reduce income generated from 
defaultfood, but they may increase 
defaultrecreational income. It is a complicated system, and once you press one button it may pop out somewhere else.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ306default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default 
defaultHow complicated is it to carry out quantitative r
defaultesearch to try to work out 
defaultthe distorting effects
default of subsidies or taxation
default?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I am quite an old academic. I have reached the position where I 
defaultthink 
defaultalmost
default every
default well-intentioned intervention 
defaulth
defaultas other consequences which
default have not been foreseen, and 
defaultwhich 
defaultoften completely offset the good intentions of the original intervention.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ307default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That is a very positive thought to leave us with, is it not?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I do not want to be a counsel of despair.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ308default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default Do you regard state intervention as market failure?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: No. You clearly need state intervention in land ma
defaultrkets because there are 
defaultserious endemic problems of market failure in la
defaultnd markets. You
default clearly
default 
defaultdo need policies to preserve national parks, heritage coastline, SSSIs
default and habitat; otherwise, they will just d
defaultisappear. Y
defaultou should do it carefully and bit by bit rather than clapping in an across-the-board poli
defaultcy that
default is one size fits all
default,
default because that will most likely have detriment
defaultal effects
default. I
defaultncremental change is a good idea with things like this. Suck it and see. The move to the single farm payment
default wa
defaults better than the 
defaultsubsidi
defaultes, 
defaultheadage
default 
defaultpayments, 
defaultless favour
defaulted
default a
defaultrea payments
default a
defaultnd so on, which simply intensified
default farming in very bizarre and
default,
default I am afraid
default,
default environm
defaultentally unfavourable ways. T
defaulto go to conservation payments would be a b
defaultetter move, but not all at once:
default go gently.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ309default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default Professor Adams, was there anything you wanted to add?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: No. I broadly concur with what Professor Cheshire has said on the taxation implications.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ310default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI am glad you agree on this, but are you saying to us that the price of land would be a quarter of the price it is at the moment were it not for the inheritance tax exemptions?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: You are 
defaulttaking away my very cautious academic caveats. I have not done the work. That would be my back-of-the-envelope gues
defaults
defaulttimate
default, but 
defaultit is work that could be done.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ311default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default How do you get the figure of a quarter? First, I 
defaultappreciate
default you
defaultr general point that 
defaultthat makes land more valuable than it would otherwise be. 
defaultI can understand that. 
defaultWhy four times rather than 24 times, or 400 times?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: 
defaultL
defaultooking at the starting point
default when this was introduced—i
defaultt is not 
defaultall that old
default—and 
defaultlooking at 
defaultwhat has
default happened to agricultural land prices
default 
defaultrelative to visible agricultural incomes, and how land prices 
defaulthave risen
default relative to incomes
default; 
defaultthe rate of appreciation of agricultural land compared wit
defaulth other sorts of land since 
defaultinheritance tax relief;
default and also the difference between the value of land in Britain w
defaulthere you have this
default tax relief,
default 
defaultcompared 
defaultwith
default other countries where you don’t, on land which is, 
defaultroughly speaking, equally productive
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ312default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIf we came out with a recommendation and had it implemented that inheritance tax relief for agricultural land and rural estate
defaults should be abolished, you
default reckon that the price would fall t
defaulto a quarter of its present level
default.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Again, you are taking away my academic caveats. I would recommend that you commission a piece of good academic work to give you a much better approximation of the answer that I am able to give, but in general I think you should take away inheritance tax relief.
defaultChair:default We will come on to that later on.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ313default&#xa0; 
defaultGraeme Morrice:default 
defaultGood afternoon, gentlemen. 
defaultScottish Land and Estates, which, as you know, is the representative body for landowners in Scotland, told us previously in evidence
default:
default 
default“M
defaultuch is made of the fact that some individuals in Scotland own large landholdings, but large landholdings are equally as common in other countries, especially in countries where the produ
defaultctive value of the land is low.”
default Do you think it is fair to say that the productive value of Scottish land is
default low and that is why large land
defaultholdings are common?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: There is a whole series of historic 
defaultand 
defaultsocia
defaultl reasons why we get large land
defaultholdings in Scotland. If we 
defaulttake just one example, Murray Estates
default goes back to 1563 and
default Mary Queen of Scots. There is an example
default of a large landholding
default that does all sorts of different things and is quite heavily involved in property development in new towns and so on
default and so forth
default.
default 
defaultIn those circumstances, there is a huge var
defaultiety of different sorts of 
defaultrural 
defaultland
defaultowners in 
defaultScotland
default,
default some of whom are
default more active and some of whom 
defaultare 
defaultmore passive. Those reasons are historic, institutional and behavioural
default, as well as th
defaulte reasons
default you mentioned.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ314default&#xa0; 
defaultGraeme Morrice:default Professor Cheshire, do you want to comment on that?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: As a generalis
defaultation, I think it is true. “L
defaultess productive
default”
default may just 
defaultmean “v
defaultery inaccessible
default.”
default In
defaulttrinsically
default, it may
default be quite productive land, but
default,
default i
defaultf it is very inaccessible
default,
default 
defaultthat will make it in some sense less productive; it will earn less revenue. There is a broad statistical association between less productive land 
defaultand larger holdings, whi
defaultch is what you would expect. M
defaulty colleague may hav
defaulte a point 
defaultin 
defaultthat t
defaulthere is a historic
defaultal
default and institutional
default structure to it as well. 
defaultI rather doubt that that is a complete explanation, but you would expect 
defaultthat 
defaultin 
defaultthe highlands of 
defaultScotland
default, 
defaultwith its pretty short growing season
default, you would have
default relatively larg
defaulte land
defaultholdings
default for them
default to be viable.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ315default&#xa0; 
defaultGraeme Morrice:default So it is to do with the topography
default of 
defaultScotland
default,
default in particular
default 
defaultthe h
defaultighlands and islands, and 
defaultth
defaulte issue of super-
defaultsparsity and ru
defaultrality
default.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: And elevation, climate
default and the basic fertility of the soil, but it is also to do with the structure of inheritance
default, 
defaulttraditional land ownership and so on that has come down the years, and the fact that estate duty and inheritance taxes have not worked in quite the way they were expected to. Equally, you have got to put it against the inequality in earnings and incomes. If you have an unequal society
default,
default you are going to have unequal ownership of property.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ316default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default To follow up one point, y
defaultou said that inheritance tax and other taxes had not applied in the way they were intended to. Can you clarify how you thought they were intended to work, and how they are actually working in practice?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: 
defaultWhen they were introduced in the early 20th century I think they were intended to reduce the generational passage of wealth, so you had a more meritocratic outcome. I do no
defaultt think they have. There continue to be
default so many loopholes in the
default system, 
defaultand agricultural land is one
default of them
default. People who are big in buying agricultural land are
default 
defaultmaking their money
default mainly
default in other walks of life
default,
default and they are becoming farmers for tax purposes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ317default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default So
default the answer to that would be 
defaultto apply inheritance tax without exemptions to all land.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: If your aim is to try to reduce the generation
defaultal
default transmission of inequality.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ318default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWhat would 
defaultbe 
defaultt
defaulthe consequences of that for land
defaultholdings in areas like those in
default 
defaultScotland
default?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Over a long period of time, they would tend to become
default less concentrated, but w
defaulthether that is a good thing is another issue.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ319default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You think it would 
defaulttend
default to become less concentrated, 
defaultand 
defaultnot simply rich people losing
default some of their money as a res
defaultult of inheritance tax
default and
default other rich people coming in and buying it and losing it in turn
default. T
defaulthe estates might remain, as it were
default.
default I do not quite follow why you automatically assume that the estates would be broken up.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: It is easier
default to keep something than 
defaultto buy it. It
default is easier to keep something intact over 
defaulttime. B
defaultits will tend to get sold 
defaultoff, so it stays in the families. I
defaultt happened to a lot of the estat
defaultes after the first world war 
defaultwhen there were unexpected deaths
default. You had to 
defaultsell off part of the estate
default, so it 
defaultgot smaller because you had to pay the inheritance tax. The other prob
defaultlem is
default, as I was saying earlier,
default that 
defaultyou plug one loophole and a clever accountant finds another, so it is easier said than done.
defaultChair:default 
defaultThe view 
defaultthat you have of valuers is the one
default we have of accountants and lawyers. We have not examined or considered professors at all
default,
default so at the moment you are fine.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ320default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default 
defaultHow widespread is the agricultural exemption
default from inheritance tax? 
defaultDoes it apply to sporting estates or to forestry?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I think you have to be officially recognised as a farmer only.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ321default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default But does it 
defaultapply to forestry?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: 
defaultForestry is a separate category, so t
defaulthere is a separate tax regime for exemption from capital gains tax primarily in the case of forestry. I am not a tax accountant, but I think it then applies to the timber rather than the land itself, so that is why it affects the cropping age of the timber. It also affects the value of the land.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ322default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default A lot of these estates are owned by trusts. If there is not inheritance tax to pay because it is agricultural land, why did these families see the ne
defaulted to establish trusts 
defaultto keep the land in the family?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Because they did have to pay estate d
defaultuty, and trusts are one way in 
defaultwhich you can avoid paying various forms of inheritance tax.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ323default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default That is tax on the non-farming part of the estate.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: No, because the exemption from inheritance tax specifically for farming is a relatively recent innovation
default; I think it is about 15 or 20 years old.
default&#xa0;defaultQ324default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reid:default So these trusts were set up before then.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: defaultYes
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ325default&#xa0; 
defaultGraeme Morrice:default We were also told by Highlands and Islands Enterprise
default that,
default with regard to the purchase of large tracts of rural land
default,
default the return on investment that is generated as a result is disproportionate to the value attached to the land. Would you agree with that? If so, could you maybe explain how it is disproportionate?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: Could you explain what they said in more detail?
default&#xa0;defaultQ326default&#xa0; 
defaultGraeme Morrice:default According to the note that I have here, that is what they said. I do not know whether anybody else wants to expand upon that.
defaultChair:default I
default read from their
default evidence: 
default“
defaultWith respect to the purchase of large
default tracts of rural land and forestry e
defaultstate
default i
defaultslands, it is our experience that the contemporary value of such land is disproportionate to the return on investment that such assets typically generate. This could be shown as a direct legacy of the economic context and fiscal environment of land ownership over time in 
defaultScotland
default,
default and the legacy which presents a barrier to diversified land ownership 
defaultpatterns in 
defaultScotland
default today.”
default&#xa0;
defaultQ327default&#xa0; 
defaultGraeme Morrice:default I am sorry. I assumed you would have read their comments to the Committee previously.
default 
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: defaultNo.
defaultGraeme Morrice:default defaultDon’t worry about it.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: You have to take account of the value
default of
default the land for
default 
defaulttax avoidance purposes
default. T
defaulthe 
defaultagricultural returns may be relatively low
default,
default but it may still be a
defaultdvantageous to invest in it.
default I do not know.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ328default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default W
defaulte will have to check this, but presumably 
defaultland 
defaultsimply 
defaultas an
default appreciating store of value makes it somewhat more attractive than
default as a productive asset. T
defaulthat is the background to q
defaultuite a lot of the evidence 
defaultwe have had in writing and informally from people
default. I
defaultf you put your money into land it will only appreciate
default,
default almost irrespective of what you do with it.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: There is a body of research that looks at what is called psychic income, which is non-monetary 
defaultincome that gives you ben
defaulteficial feeling, whether
default in terms of status, power or whatever it happens to be. In assessing the returns to landowners and what their motives are for buying highland estates, if we simply look at their financial year-on-year returns
default,
default that is not the whole picture. They are in there for a whole series of other reasons
default, and they may well have a return that to them is not a monetary one.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ329default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That is presumably
default the equivalent of
default conspicu
defaultous consumption, is it not, 
defaultto keep up wit
defaulth the Joneses, as it were? T
defaulthere is nothing much that the Government can do then to affect that element of it, but there is something
default the Government can do
default to affect the inheritance tax regime. It is just a question of whethe
defaultr or not there is anything 
defaultwe ought to be taking into account when making recommendations
default about 
defaultprices being so much higher than what would seem
default to be an objective value. T
defaulthe objective value in those circumstances is based on the productivity of the land, but, as you say, there are other factors. Is there anything in particular
default 
defaultyou would draw our attention
default to in
default academic research that wou
defaultld help quantify that and 
defaulthelp us look at the extent to which that is something that is applicable in the highlands and islands?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: No, because I do not think that kind of mode of analysis has been applied very largel
defaulty to this question.
default I am not aware of anyone who has done a piece of work that could answer the question that you are asking.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: A
defaultn agricultural economist at the 
defaultUniversity
default of 
defaultWales
default,
default 
defaultBangor
default, 
defaulttried to work out the rate of return in agriculture since about 1780. Allowing for the cost of land 
defaultas part of the capital 
defaultemployed in agriculture, his conclusion was that the rate of return, if you looked at it in the long
default 
defaultterm, had not changed over about 200 years. It is very low. The reason is partly the psychic income where there appears to be a ready supply of people who are keen simply to own agric
defaultultural land to be farmers. T
defaulthat tends to push up the price of land at the margin, which means that, if you take account of the value of the land i
defaultn the total cost of farming, i
defaultt pushes down the return.
default              
defaultIf you look at the price of land since, say, 1930, you have periods of very substantial reduction. You can see the anticipation and then entry into the common agricultural policy reflected in the price of land around about 1970. You can see the very bad harvest in the US
default and 
defaultthe 
defaultincrease in 
defaultthe set-
defaultaside acreage in the US
default, at the same time as
default interventions from the USSR
default purchasing in the 1970s pushing up the price of food. That had an almost immediate effect
default on the price of land. I
defaultt is the same with tax relief. Essentially, it is subsidy plus tax relief. That is why the price of land has been rising over time
default. M
defaultaybe people draw false expectations about future prices, because those subsidies 
defaultand the tax relief can go away, in which case
default,
default without doubt
default,
default the price of land would fall.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ330default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can I 
defaultclarify to what extent the assumption that land will grow in value
default,
default and therefore i
defaultt i
defaults a good place t
defaulto put your money, rather than
default, say, fine art or gold bars
default,
default helps drive the price up?
default Is there an extent to which you can say
default, just as you were so specific about 
default“
defaultfour times
default”
default earlier on
default—
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I was very definitely not specific.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ331default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultSpecific
default-
defaultish.
default 
defaultIs 
defaultthere a quantifiable figure you would pick up and say that 20%, 40% or 
default200% of the price is simply because people are using it to store their wealth, as distinct from having it in a bank account, on the assumption that land will appreciate? Can you help us with that at all?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I have not done the calculations. 
defaultYou could commission a relatively cheap bit of work for someone to work out the present value of the capitalised flows of expected subsidies and tax relief 
defaultand what i
defaultt was adding to
default the price of agricultural land. 
defaultOf course, it involves the expectation that these things are going to continue in the future.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ332default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThese unknowns or variables are going to be affecting the amount of income that is drawn from the land in terms of agricultural subsidies and the like. Am I right in thinking that they will also affect the anticipated capital values of the land? Therefore, it is a bit like buying stocks and shares. You are not buying them to do anything with them; you are just buying them to sit there in the expectation not necessarily that you will draw divide
defaultnds from them
default,
default but 
defaultthat 
defaultthey will simply 
defaultgrow. If you want to avoid that sort of speculative bubble, how do the Government address that?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I do not think it is a pure speculative bubble, but it does involve the expectation that subsidies are going to rise rather
default than fall, which is possibly 
defaultoptimistic
default, but it 
defaultalso 
defaultmay
default be, as David said earlier, the
default psychi
defaultc element 
defaultalso
default exists and
default 
defaultmay
default also
default 
defaultbe rising in value
default over time. A
defaults you get richer
default,
default you can afford to engage in the luxury of owning a large amount of grouse shooting, or whatever it 
defaultmay be. There is
default globally
default an increasing
default number of 
defaultvery rich p
defaulteople who may be 
defaulttaking advantage of that.
defaultChair:default We cannot deal directly with snobbery
default by G
defaultovernment action, but presumably we can deal with the question of subsidy and so on. That is helpful.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ333default&#xa0; 
defaultGraeme Morrice:default I am hopeful that you are aware of the policy aims of the Scottish Government’s land reform review group in relation to the topic of land ownership. In general terms, is it possible to achieve the Scottish Government’s aims t
defaulto diversify land ownership, 
defaultand, 
defaultin particular
default,
default to expand community ownership
default,
default without tackling the question of land values?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: It is certainly possible to expand community ownership. There are a number of aspects of that. Top of my list of expanding community ownership would be to simplify the whole process, because it is remarkably complicated under the current legislation for the community right to buy to be effective. Part of the remit of the land reform review group is to look at the processes by which that community right to buy can be
default registered and then exercised.
defaultHaving said that, you then have to fund any community buy-out. That is partly ab
defaultout the Scottish land fund and G
defaultovernment funding; it is partly about
default,
default in some cases
default,
default c
defaultharitable funding, lottery funding
default and so on
default and so forth
default; 
defaultbut it is also about the short time scale in which cash has to be raised to fulfil the community buy-out.
default Clearly, if 
defaultthe capitalisation of taxation incentives to which
default Professor
default&#xa0;
defaultCheshire
default referred were 
defaultnot there and land were cheaper, it would become a lot easier, but, irrespective of going down that line, there i
defaults a lot you can also do
default to promote community ownership, 
defaultin terms of both 
defaultspeeding up the process and the amount of money that is available under the current system.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I largely agree, but it i
defaults not an either/or. T
defaulthe more expensive land is
default,
default the more 
defaultconcentrated ownership
default tends to be and 
defaultthe more damaging 
defaultagricultural practices will be 
defaultto the environment. The argument that you need agricultural subsidies to safeguard the environment is the exact opposite of reality. What you need are conservation subsidies to preserve the environment. The cheaper the price of land, the easier it is for smaller people to enter the market, whether they are community groups or 
defaultjust 
defaultsmaller land owners.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ334default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan I seek a view on the question of state aid rules? Professor
default&#xa0;
defaultAdams, you mentioned the question of raising the money and so on. We have had a couple of sessions where people have been telling us about the difficulties of state aid rules. We are not entirely clear at the moment whether or not these are bein
defaultg used as camouflage, or 
defaultthings to hide behind
default, 
defaultrather than genuine difficulties in purchasing. Can you give us a bit of assistance 
defaultwith 
defaultthat?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: That is not an area in which I would claim specific expertise, but I think there is a ge
defaultneral
default issue of the risk-averse nature of the bureaucracy. If you stand back a little and think about the objectives of community ownershi
defaultp
default, they are quite different 
defaultfrom the way in which land has been held in 
defaultScotland
default over a long period of time. That 
defaultrequires people to take risks. I
defaultt requires communities to take risks because they have responsibilities as a result, but 
defaultit also requires people within G
defaultovernment agencies to take risk
default,
default and perhaps push out the boat further than they wo
defaultuld to make things happen and, i
defaultf they do not break the rules
default,
default they certainly bend them. 
defaultA
defaults well as looking in detail at the specifics of state aid, maybe it is just as important to look a
defaultt the cul
defaultture within the G
defaultovernment organisations that are responsible for interpreting those rules.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ335default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That certainly echoes 
defaultthe sentiment we were expressing la
defaultst week, or whenever we held our
default last session. That is very helpful. You have emphasised the difficulties of the bureaucratic process
default, and
default there is the issue of raising money and so on. Presumably, the question of land price is an enormous barrier to community land ownership, notwithstanding these tinkerings, as it were
default.
default Unless there is an unlimited pot of money, which is then caught by the state aid rules presumably, not much progress can be made while land retains its existing price level.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: If we are getting down to the level of individual buy-outs, for example, there is a process within the statute 
defaultof an independent
default valuation being commissioned on behalf of the Scottish Government. The aim is to identify what would be open market value for which the community has to stump up the cash. Coming back to what I was saying
default earlier, 
defaultit is quite a difficult task for a valuer 
defaultto take
default maybe
default 
defaulta small piece of land that the community wants to buy
default—perhaps
default it is
default part of a much larger estate—and say definitely what 
defaultthe 
defaultopen market value is. The tendency of the whole process 
defaultis to give a more cautious 
defaultand
default higher estimate of open market value than would probably be the case if you had a public auction of that single piece of land for the particular purpose that t
defaulthe
default particular community body wanted to buy it for.
default There is 
defaultdifficulty within the statutory process of trying to judge what open m
defaultarket value is for a product 
defaultwhich there are very few transactions to compare against.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ336default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Presumably, i
defaultf the Government 
defaultannounce
defaultd
default tomorrow that 
defaultthe 
defaultinheritance tax allowance and so on was being abolished
default,
default the valuations bein
defaultg arrived at would be much
default lower, almost a quarter.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: The valuers could make an estimated adjustment
default. T
defaulthey would feel much happi
defaulter 
defaultto see some transaction evidence over a period of time.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ337default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default 
defaultIt is interesting to take that argument further. Y
defaultou are talking about coming up with an open market value but in a market which effectively is dysfunctional
default,
default because it is massively affected by subsidies and hi
defaultdden taxation. In terms of 
defaultgetting to a point where you are getting good value for the public purse, surely you have to deal with the market issues; otherwise, you deal with the bureaucracy of 
defaulta 
defaultcommunity buying a piece of land 
defaultand
default make that easier, but, at the end of the day, you are still left with a 
defaultprice, a 
defaultvaluation of the market, or otherwise, that is massively inflated by the system. Surely, from the point of view of getting proper value for money for what is effectively public money that you are handing over to buy this
default property, you should be dealing with the market
default,
default which is distorting the value of the property that you are then handing money over to buy.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: The market value of land is what they pay in the market. That will reflect the capitalised values of these subsidies and other things we have been talking about. It is asking
default a lot
default too much
default of valuers to give you any reasonably sensible valuation of what the land would be worth in the absence of those. At one stage
default,
default most of what we were paying farmers for environmental aspect
defaults was essentially for their for
defaultgone subsidy
default 
defaultfor not producing food. The problem is that we were paying out 
defaultof
default two pockets at the same time. Take away the tax breaks and subsidie
defaults and c
defaultonvert the subsidies into conservation payments, which would have real community value but would also support farmers’ income, and the price of land will fall. If you did that
default,
default there would immediately be a lot of land coming
default 
defaulton 
defaultto 
defaultthe market because a lot of it is being held simply because it provides a way of shielding wealth against tax.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ338default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default 
defaultTo use your analogy, that is precisely what we are doing here
default. We are 
defaultpaying out of both pockets
default. We
default are paying communities to help them 
defaultto 
defaultbuy the land but also paying the subsidies
default which inflate the market value of the land.
default 
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: 
defaultT
defaulthe money you are giving communities
default to buy the land is
default to compensate people for money you are already giving them through the tax break. It is a problem of policy failure rather than
default of
default market failure.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ339default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThat is 
defaulta very good way of putting it. On t
defaulthe question of the community wanting to purchase land
default, i
defaults there anything about the parcels of land that communities tend to want to buy 
defaultthat distinguishes them from other land? To some extent, land is land, but maybe it tends to be in particular locations
default. Is there anything 
defaultwe ought to be aware of that it wou
defaultld be useful for us to consider?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: In some cases, it is whole estates that communities 
defaulthave wanted to buy out 
defaultin order 
defaultto remove the
default landlord and control the estates
default themselves
default;
default in other cases, it is small plots of land on the edge of a village, o
defaultr whatever it happens to be. B
defaultut the community right to buy also applies to all settlements
default with populations 
defaultunder 10,000
default. In Nei
defaultlston
default,
default the community bought out a bank building and turned it into 
defaulta community 
defaultcentre. S
defaulto
default,
default 
defaultacross the piece, 
defaultthe pieces of land or property that communities might be interested in purchasing
default are quite varied
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ340default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default B
defaultut there is nothing in that which
default in a sense ought to lead us towards a particular policy prescription.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: 
defaultAs to 
defaultthe po
defaultlicy prescription,
default in terms of the community right to buy
default,
default the legislation is devolved under the
default Land Reform Act,
default t
defaulthe Scottish land fund and so on. The
default immediate legislation
default is
default for the Scottish Parliament. If changes of the taxation regime indirectly made that easier, that would probably
default be welcome
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ341default&#xa0; 
defaultGraeme Morrice:default 
defaultIn your view, is it proper for G
defaultovernment to intervene in land markets with the aim of reducing the price of land?
default              
defaultChair:default I take it that is a hard one.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: 
defaultI think it is proper for G
defaultovernments not to intervene in ways that increase the price of land.
defaultGraeme Morrice:default That is a good answer.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ342default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default defaultT
defaulthey already do.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: 
defaultAs they presently do.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ343default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThey could quite easily withdraw from the market by changin
defaultg a whole number of things 
defaultthey are presently doing. I understand that.
defaultMdefaultike Crockart:default 
defaultOr withdraw the intervention
default rather than further
default intervention.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: I think your whole question makes presumptions of how you construct la
defaultnd markets and
default prices. That is the problem with the question, and probably why I hesitated over it. I cannot see
default any mileage in the long term in
default G
defaultovernments wanting to intervene in the way you have said, but there are a number of th
defaultings that G
defaultove
defaultrnments could do. For example, G
defaultovernments have a role 
defaultto play in ensuring much better information within the market. That may or may not have price implications. For example, the question of
default exactly who 
defaultowns the
default land, what price has been paid and
default what the mortgages a
defaultre is a contextual action that G
defaultovernments can take that, 
defaultin certain circumstances
default,
default may well result in price changes. This is quite separate from the debate on taxation, but I do not think that going in and saying, “We are going
default to subsid
defaultis
defaulte land prices 
defaultand try to get prices down that way
default,”
default is correct. The other way round—removing subsidies that may be keeping prices high—may well be appropriate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ344default&#xa0; 
defaultGraeme Morrice:default 
defaultCan I look at the options? From the evidence
default that
default we have received to date, there appear to be three ways in which public policy could influence land values: first, reforming the system of tax reliefs and subsidies; secondly, regulation of the land markets; and, thirdly, fiscal measures such as land taxes to moderate or reduce land prices. From your own research, which of these three options do you think would be the most effective in reducing land values?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: 
defaultCan I add a fourth?
default              defaultGraeme Morrice:default Of course. I was going to ask later on whether there
default are any other options that 
defaultperhaps 
defaultyou 
defaultmight like to share with us.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: This is particularly applicable within urban areas, but I suspect it is applicable to a lesser exte
defaultnt within rural areas. W
defaulthere you have people holding on to land and not doing much about it
default, 
defaultbecause there are very few holding costs 
defaultfor keeping land unproductive, o
defaultne could introduce various measures 
defaultto bring that land for
default sale. They could 
defaultbe direct or indirect.
defaultIn my view, o
defaultne of the huge problems
default we have in
default urban Scotland is that we have large areas of land, some of which has been vacan
defaultt
default, or under the same ownership
default,
default f
defaultor a long period of time. What G
defaultovernments could perhaps do most productively is e
defaultnsure that that land came to
default market. That does two things. First, it gets us away from all these estim
defaultates of value; it gives us 
defaultreal hard price evidence, and that probably means some write-down of owners’ expectations
default, because there are 
defaultexpecta
defaulttions of value in urban areas. Secondly, i
defaultt also helps to produce new opportunities within urban areas. I have argued that strongly in urban areas. There may be parts of rural 
defaultScotland
default where that applies 
defaultas well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ345default&#xa0; 
defaultGraeme Morrice:default How 
defaultdo you dampen expectations of owners in terms of future potential value?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: You need to be pretty direct about it.
default Y
defaultou have to take the view that there comes a point where holding on to land without doing much about it is not in the public interest. Whether you define that as two, three, five or 10 years is an open question, but at that point there needs to be a procedure by which that land can be put to public auction. Whether it is public land or private land does not matter. Some of the land is held by public authorities
default. T
defaulthe majority of land is held by private bodies
default. We 
defaultdo not even know who holds
default some of
default it. If we put that land to public auction, we start to get a more realistic assessment
default of what prices probably
default are,
default reflect
defaulting
default today’s economic circumstances
default, and that is a stimulant 
defaultto new activity.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ346default&#xa0; 
defaultGraeme Morrice:default 
defaultHow do you bring about that situation? Obviously, you would have to make that mandatory.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: Yes. 
defaultI have published a paper on this. You would need to have a legislative procedure
default with all the safeguards you would suggest. These are what we call hard core vacant sites. It is not land that has
default been vacant for a year or two; it has been vacant through one boom and slump and the next boom
default,
default and nothing has happened. In many parts of 
defaulturban 
defaultScotland
default,
default we need structural change. Part of that structural change is an acceptance that l
defaultand values are not as they were
default and
default,
default in order to get that structural change
default,
default we need hard evidence through transactions. I think the best way to do that is a public procedure by which you can force that land to public auction.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ347default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultBefore Professor Cheshire comes in,
default can I clarify something? Y
defaultou mentioned increasing the costs of holding land. What did you have in mind?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: 
defaultIn some jurisdictions
default,
default there is what they c
defaultall a vacant land tax. If you have a piece of land that
default has been sitting idle for a number of years
default,
default a tax is imposed on it, and there are arguments for and against that. I think it is a fairly indirect mechanism. You can say that you tax land to raise the holding cost of keeping it vaca
defaultnt. It
default would take a long time 
defaultfor that 
defaultto work through
default. A 
defaultmore direct mechanism is to have almost an inverse compulsory purchas
defaulte order. It is not the state acquiring it but the state saying
default,
default 
defaultafter a period of time
default, “Y
defaultou
default’ve
default had your chanc
defaulte to make use of this land. You haven’t
default made use of it. This now has to go to auction and someone else can
default have it.”
default&#xa0;
defaultQ348default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Surely, in those circumstances
default,
default you can quite easily h
defaultave a carousel of owners. I
defaultt is not held by the same group, trust or structure for any length of time
default, but after six months it is
default sold to another front company and it keeps rotating.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: 
defaultYou could deal with that through the terms of the contract and the property rights to give an implied option to the public authority
default 
defaultthat
default,
default if someone bought it and
default 
defaultdid noth
defaulting for a period of three years
default for ex
defaultample, it would
default then vest in the
default public authority. 
defaultThat would probably not need to be exercised, but you would have to put something in the contract to avoid precisely the problem you mention.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I am not 
defaultentirely 180 degrees away from what has just been said, but I would be more cautious
default. There are holding costs which
default vary according to the type of land holder. Historically, one of the problems might have been
default with
default pub
defaultlic authorities where there wa
defaults no cost penalty to them and they simply were not behaving as if this was an asset which was potentially worth something. There may be some land tie
defaultd up in that way, but privately 
defaultheld land has got a cost which is the opportunity cost of doing something with it. It may be that the owner expects the future value to be higher and there is an optional demand process going on
default. It may also be
default,
default 
defaultin some former industrial
default areas
default,
default that the remediation costs 
defaultof the land mean that it 
defaultis not worth doing anything with
default it, 
defaultunless you get quite substantial public assistance to remediate it.
default              
defaultWhen you come to rural land, it is
default very dangerous territory. What is land that is not having anything done with it? Is 
defaulta nature reserve
default an area of land that is having nothing done with it
default? I
defaults it a habitat
default 
defaultthat you are not wanting to develop in any way? I can
default certainly see an argument
default f
defaultor a vacant land tax. C
defaultoming back to
default 
defaultthe tax relief that exists for agricultural land
default, 
defaultI can see an argument for rateable values being applied to
default such
default land
default,
default certainly in England
default—I 
defaultam not quite sure about the situation in Scotland
default—where 
defaultagricultural land is exempt from local taxation.
default That seems an odd state of 
defaultthe world. 
defaultI can see that you can’t
default charge a very high 
defaultrateable value
default,
default but 
defaultif there were 
defaultsome rateable value. Of course, 
defaulton the margin you 
defaulthave things that are farmed.
default I know that in 
defaultScotland
default you have areas where maybe you could do some sort o
defaultf very extensive farming but the land may be held by absentee landowners who
default ar
defaulte really doing nothing at all. Therefore, s
defaultome nominal rate on vacant land, even rural vacant land, might be justifiable. That would get capitalised into the value of the agricultural land
default.
default If you were liable for paying those rates, the value of land would fall.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ349default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Professor Adams, can I pick up a point you made about not knowing who holds the land? Is there a way in which that ought to be addressed?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: If I can give you some precise figures on that, there is almost 11,000 hectares of vacant and derelict land in 
defaultScotland
default. According to the Scottish Government’s statistics,
default the ownership of 12% of that is 
defaultunknown to the local authority. That is in a country where we have the register of sa
defaultsines and
default the Land R
defaultegistry. 
defaultWe have very good historic records of land ownership. According to the Scottish Government’s statistics, 
defaultlocal authorities have 
defaultno idea who owns 
default12% of the vacant and derelict land in Scotland
default.
default That is the kind of problem we face in trying to make land markets work.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ350default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultHow should that be dealt with?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: There are issues around land registration and the speed of moving over to the new system. They are issues that the land reform review group has been asked to consider. No doubt
default,
default there will be ideas on that coming out of the land reform review group. There is a question as to whether
default,
default in the modern age
default,
default where you can get so much information from the internet
default,
default we should
default have 
defaulta 
defaultsystem t
defaulthat, if y
defaulto
defaultu wanted to
default 
defaultcheck who owns a piece of land
default, there would be quite efficient publicly 
defaultkep
defaultt
default 
defaultregister
defaults, 
defaultso 
defaultt
defaulthere is no doubt
default, and
default 
defaultyou could very easily find out who owned that piece of vacant land in your community
default,
default and you could at least send them an e-mail and ask whether they would be interested in selling. That is one of the problems at the moment.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ351default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultT
defaulthere is no reason why the relevant authority, which
default presumably
default would be the Scottish Government or local authority, should not have the opportunity to compulsorily purchase land for which there is no identifiable owner, and then the money is not handed up unless the owner appears.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: 
defaultLocal authorities have that power. If we look across 
defaultScotland
default, the n
defaultumber of local authorities which
default are skilled, experienced and undertake compulsory purchase regularly is very small now. 
defaultIt has been whittled down from the
default position
default 
default30 or 40 years ago. 
defaultDundee
default is a very good example of an authority that has used compulsory purchase to undertake a major city centre redevelopment. People point to Dundee and say
default, “T
defaulthis is how it can be done.
default”
default Most Scottish local authorities are not really in that league. They do not have the skills and certainly 
defaultdon’t have 
defaultthe finance. Compulsory purchase is uncertain legally and financially.
default There are 
defaulta lot of constraints to put local authorities off going down that l
defaultine, particularly with 
defaultall the financia
defaultl cutbacks. My view is that an auction may be a way to try to
default get some of the markets to work themselves a bit better
default,
default without necessarily having to rely on lo
defaultc
defaultal authority compulsory purchase.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ352default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIn the event that an owner could not be identified, their land would be sold at auction and they would get the proceeds if they ever appeared. Is that roughly the way in which this would work?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: 
defaultThere are ways in which the local authority can deal with that. I am not sufficiently
default knowledgeable about
default what the local authority would
default then do with the proceeds
default—
defaultwhether they would have to hold on to them for someone to turn up an
defaultd say they owned it, or 
defaultwhether 
defaultthey could deal with it in another way.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ353default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Presumably, it is reasonable for us to expect the Scottish Government’s commis
defaultsion, to which you are an advise
defaultr, to resolve all these matters since all these are devolved at the moment. We are a bit hesitant to intrude into things that are devolved. Where it is appropriate, we will do it if it ties in with what we are looking at, but presumably this is something they ought to resolve when they report in April.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: The group 
defaulthas a fairly broad remit from the Scottish Government
default, as you will know and 
defaultwill 
defaulthave seen. It is charged with a whole range of issues that relate primarily to devolved matters, and it will be coming forward with a report in response to that remit.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ354default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Is that a yes or no? I was saying it was reasonable for us to expect that they will come back and resolve this. I am not quite sure whether or not you agree.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: It depends on what you mean. I cannot say that the land reform review group will resolve it as you think it shou
defaultld be resolved. I am not a member of the group; I am advising it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ355default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIt is reasonable for us to expect them to resolve it in some way, not necessarily the way we would want.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: Let’s put it this way: I think you will find they will try to address it.
defaultChair:default That is helpful.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ356default&#xa0; 
defaultGraeme Morrice:default I had finished my line of questioning, but what was flagged up was the interesting
default stat
default with regard to vac
defaultant land. You said that
default 12%, which is about one eighth, of that land does not have an identified owner. You are saying that local authorities will not be aware of who owns that land, if indeed it is owned at all. Are ther
defaulte any other bodies out there which
default would be awa
defaultre of that, apart from the land
defaulto
defaultwners themselves? T
defaulthat is a remarkably high figure.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: It is. 
defaultAs a gross figure,
default 
defaultthe ownership of 
defaultjust over 1,300 hectares of vacant and derelict land in 
defaultScotland
default, 
defaultaccording to the Scottish Government’s survey
default, is
default unknown to the local authority.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ357default&#xa0; 
defaultGraeme Morrice:default And, therefore, not known by any public body.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: 
defaultW
defaultith quite a bit of digging within the registers
default, some of that
default might be discoverable. I have not drilled down below that, but I was surprised by that figure.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ358default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Professor Cheshire, do you want to comment on this exchange?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: This is 
defaulta level of detail where I probably do not h
defaultave anything very useful to offer.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ359default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default To be fair, that does not always stop some of our witnesses commenting. That is a remarkable degree of self-restraint.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Having said that, of course I will say something. I just happened to be in a discussion the other day when roughly this sort of conversation was going on. They were identifying ownership
default,
default but failing to identify options. Sometimes it may be owned land or land that is not owned, but there may be a third party, or even fourth party, that has an option on certain rights associated with that land, like future development rights.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ360default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Presumably, i
defaultf somebody has an option over a piece of land that is derelict and lying unused and it comes up for auction, they have the opportunity to step in beforehand either to exercise that option at that stage or participate in the auction.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: The option would be registrable, so you would discover it by the normal search processes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ361default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default In that case, if you identify it
default,
default 
defaultit
default would not apply to any of the land for which there is no identifiable owner, since presumably you will have an idea of what the option is against it, so to speak.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: I am not sure of the technicalities of that. I am just trying to think it through. You would expect, if there was an option on land, that it would be one where the outright owner as well as the option holder were known.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ362default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I am aware from my experience in 
defaultGlasgow
default that there are blocks of air where tenements have been demolished and they have been unable to identify the owner. The tenement has collapsed, so theoretically somebody still owns that block of air, but they managed to find a way round it and move on. To what extent are these difficulties a bit like the Gordian knot? If there was a will to address them, they could be addressed relatively straightforwardly.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: Let me take you to a study that we did of major redevelopment sites in Aberdeen
default, Dundee and two English cities
default—
defaultNottingham and Stoke. These were areas of at least two hectares, so they were substantial sites. We did the study in the 1990s and looked at 80 in detail. Last year we went back. How many of those 80 had now been developed? Forty
default-
defaultthree had been fully developed; 20 had been partially developed; and 17 were in exactly the same condition as they were in the mid-1990s. That exemplifies the issue that in many of these cities you have areas of vacant derelict land that has been in exactly the same condition for decades.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ363default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYes, b
defaultut is it not the case that there would almost be no economic use to which some of these derelict sites could be put? I know of areas where the community is devastated, but, unless a local authority or public body wants to step in and build something on that on an uneconomic basis, there is absolutely no way in which the market will be able to identify any profit that can be made from developing it.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: That is a very important point. It is not just an either/or; it is a gradation of what the costs are of remediating and servicing the land and what the value of the land would be were it developed. This is very variable. A city which has got outward movement of population, for example, may have very substantial areas of land which essentially have no economic viability, unless there is major public intervention. My view is that that public intervention needs to have a very good case to justify it. I am not saying it cannot have a case, but it is not necessarily the case that it is worth intervening.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: I disagree to some extent with what is being said.
defaultChair:default Oh, good.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: The reason I do that is two
defaultfold. First, different potential users have different profit expectations. Those profit expectations turn into the way
default that
default they appraise potential schemes for development. When we are talking about whether particular pieces of land are viable we need to ask: viable for whom? They may not be viable for a large multinational company; they may be viable for a small local housing association, for example, because of the different ways the development appraisal is undertaken, the different profit ratios and so on. In some parts of urban Scotland
default,
default the answer is not multinational companies coming in; it is encouraging local enterprise, local community organisations, local co
default&#x2011;
defaultoperatives and local housing. Some of the lessons from rural 
defaultScotland
default in terms of community initiative are quite easily transferable to urban 
defaultScotland
default, if the land was available.
default              
defaultThe other matter comes back to what I have written about, which is unrealistic price expectations. If the market were working as Professor Cheshire says and it was a nice, perfect one, we would not have this situation. I come back to the difference between expectations and price. Part of the problem you might have in making the economics work is getting landowners in urban areas to be prepared to sell at more realistic prices that would encourage all sorts of things to happen. I take the view that the land market in urban areas is very dysfunctional, and part of the result of that—it is not the only cause—is extensive land vacancy.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I am sceptical of the evidence of dysfunctionality. The problem is that any action is about something that is going to happen quite a long time in the future. It requires investment now if you are going to develop or remediate a piece of land, but your returns are quite a long time in the future. Yo
defaultu also 
defaulthave 
defaultto negotiate a G
defaultovernment process, planning process and so on, so there is an awful lot of uncertainty associated with these things. If the holding costs are low, which is a possible argument for a vacant land tax, it simply may make commercial sense to sit on land for a very long time.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ364default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I think we now have a much greater understanding of what we do not understand. That is progress. We are now moving to the known unknowns to some extent. Can I come to the question of the Mirrlees review? Do you agree with the observation in that review that tax reliefs in the 
defaultUK
default are more generous than in other countries and push up the price of agricultural land?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Yes, but not all other countries. It is a continuum. Many countries have no tax reliefs, but we have a series of tax reliefs and subsidies. All European countries have got common agricultural policy payments. Not all of them have inheritance tax relief; not all of them have rate relief.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ365default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I used to be told at 
defaultschoo
defaultl
default,
default for my big sums tests, “Show working.” Can you prove it? Is there evidence? I understand the point you are making. What evidence can you point to that we can take to somebody else as a justification for arguing a policy change?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I am sorry; I missed that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ366default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I understand the point you were making that tax reliefs are more generous and push up the price of agricultural land. I just want to be clear that there is firm evidence for that, and 
defaultthat 
defaultyou can show us how you have reached that conclusion.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: In 
defaultBritain
default,
default you can show quite clearly that
default,
default when you introduce agricultural subsidies and they have been increased
default,
default that has been capitalised into the price of agricultural land. When inheritance tax relief was introduced, over a relatively short time
default,
default 
defaultit
default was capitalised into the price of agricultural land. You can compare the price of agricultural land in Britain with similarly productive land in, say, France where you have common agricultural policy support but a lower regime of tax advantages associated with it, and you see a lower price for agricultural land. That is not 100% proof. You could commission better proof, but you would have to do the research. As far as I am concerned, I am convinced that that is the case. If you look at historical patterns of agricultural land, you can get those back to the early 20th century. If you go into historical statistics, you can get them back to the 18th
default&#xa0;
defaultcentury. 
defaultYou can see these things going through during the Napoleonic wars; you can see the opening up of the British lamb market to 
defaultNew Zealand
default lamb with refrigeration, and that is reflected in land prices.
defaultChair:default Excellent. Our report would be greatly assisted by being able to quote reference to Napoleonic land prices in support of any particular policy prescription. We will leave our advisers to make sure they can manage to work that in somewhere.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ367default&#xa0; 
defaultMike defaultCrockart:default I have a question that goes back to
default fiscal and
default tax interventions to deal with the dysfunctional market or policy, whichever way you want to look at it. Earlier 
defaulton, 
defaultyou seemed to be saying that
default,
default in general
default,
default interventions do not work; they have unexpected consequences, and, to be frank, we should probably take away some of the ones we have. But you have just said that the potential for a vacant land tax as an intervention might be a way of dealing with some of those things.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: If you want to bring forward development. It was a conditional statement. It depends on what your policy objectives are. Broadly, there are reasons for having comparable tax treatment for all productive assets. Land is a productive asset. You might argue that there are social dimensions to land use, but there are certainly environmental issues associated with land use which suggest you should have a particular tax treatment to favour certain categories. In general, the lower the prices of agricultural land
default,
default the more variety of ownership and the more environmental benefits you will get.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ368default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default What is your view of a land value tax, or is the problem there in defining what the value is?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: You are back to taking with one hand and giving back with the other. Why have the tax break in the first place, which, apart from anything else, is leading people who have no association with land or farming to become quite extensive agricultural land controllers?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ369default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default That is the rural side of things. Would it be different on the urban side where you do not 
defaulthave the same distortion
default?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Here I disagree with my colleague. It seems to me that the enormous distortions in the urban market arise from the planning system and the separation of use categories. You are allocating supply for different uses independently of market prices and generating distortions at quite incredible levels. For example, agricultural land to the north of 
defaultOxford
default is worth about £10,000 a hectare. If you can get permission to build houses on it, it is worth about £8
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion a hectare.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: That
default point in relation to the difference between agricultural and urban land is entirely correct. I have slightly different figures, but the point is correct. Within the kinds of urban areas I am talking about, which are the industrial areas of Scotland that have undergone huge structural change, it is not very hard to persuade the planners to give you permission for whatever you want to do. In those areas—we are
default a million miles from the south-
defaulteast of England—the huge constraint is not planning. They will welcome you with open arms. There has been criticism of the way 
defaultGlasgow
default has regenerated over a period of 20 or 30 years. The arms have been too open there. There is not a lot of evidence in those areas that the constraint is primarily a planning one.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I have done research on this. You can look at a paper in 
defaultT
defaulthe
default&#xa0;
defaultEconomic Journal
default in 2008
default,
default where we estimated the regulatory cost in about 20 office centres across Europe. While 
defaultGlasgow
default was lower than, say, 
defaultBirmingham
default, which is fairly shocking, it still stood out. All British office centres, with the single exception of 
defaultNewcastle
default, had very substantial regulatory costs associated with their restrictiveness. Like Glasgow—this is from the top of my head
default, from memory
default—it was equivalent to about a 200% tax on the costs of construction associated with the supply restriction.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ370default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Professor Adams, you are about to disagree.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: The areas I am talking about are not primarily in the centre of 
defaultGlasgow
default; they are in the inner city of 
defaultGlasgow
default. There are one or two pieces of land in the centre of Glasgow, which I know well, where often owners are holding out for the next boom to come, but, irrespective of some disagreement with Professor Cheshire’s work and his methods, I am not arguing about office centres
default, I am arguing 
defaultabout large areas of often vacant de
default&#x2011;
defaultindustrialised land in British cities.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I do not have detailed knowledge of the Scottish situation, but across most of England
default,
default housing is so valuable because of the restriction on supply that it is crowding out other uses. If you look at the price of land zoned for industry relative to land zoned for housing, there is a big discontinuity there. There is a similar discontinuity at the boundary between land zoned for offices compared with land zoned for housing. Certainly, in most English cities
default,
default housing 
defaultis essentially crowding
default out any marginal commercial use, and therefore is increasing the costs of commercial use of land.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: As to the areas I am talking about, you could come with a housing scheme, industrial scheme or commercial scheme—whatever it happened to be—and in most cases Glasgow city council would fall over and sign up. These are very different places from many parts of 
defaultEngland
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ371default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can I pick up a point about the size of land holdings, and whether or not the taxation treatment deals with them differently? We have been told by Scottish Land and Estates that “there is generally a level playing
default field in relation to reliefs…
defaultregardless of size of landholding.” Is that a fair assessment?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I do not know.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: I do not know the answer to that one either.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ372default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Agricultural land benefits from inheritance tax at 100%. Another witness has told us that relief from inheritance tax for businesses is “common in the developed world
default.”
default Do you agree with that?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I think that is an overstatement. There are cases whe
defaultre there is a degree of relief—
defaultfor example
default, family businesses—
defaultbut it is not an either/or. There is a variation across countries in the extent to which there may be relief from tax for small businesses in an inheritance context, but I think the issue of agricultural land is an outlier in that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ373default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Is 
defaultthat, 
defaultagricultural land in the UK 
defaultis 
defaultan outlier?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ374default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default When we are doing international comparisons about how agricultural land is treated for inheritance tax, the 
defaultUK
default would be an outlier among those and would be seen to be much more generous in terms of what it permitted people to carry without the impact of inheritance tax.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I am not saying there is not another country in the world, but
default,
default in general, if you look across OECD countries, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ375default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Is there clear evidence to support that? Again, would 
defaultyou 
defaultbe able to refer us to something, if one of our advisers gets in touch with you
default?  I
defaults 
defaultthat not just a feeling, and h
defaultas comparative research already been done on that?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I could not cite a specific piece of evidence. I know about some individual countries, but I am not going to offer to do your research for you.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ376default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We are here. We just thought we would try to pick your brains.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Which I am happy to have done.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ377default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Professor Adams, do you want to comment on those 
defaultfew
default points?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: No. It is not something in which I have as much expertise as Professor Cheshire, so I would defer to what he has to say.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ378default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Land occupied for agriculture, forestry and hunting, shooting and so on is all de-rated at the moment. Given that the c
defaulturrent business rate is 46p
default in the pound, if we applied the charge to agriculture, forestry, hunting and shooting would that have quite a substantial impact on the capital value of that land? I am presuming, from what you have said before, that you think it would.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: It would, and I think we should be very careful how we proceed. 
defaultAs I was saying earlier, g
defaulto very cautiously. You can easily end up with a tax which means that the market value of agricultural land is negative, which is not a result you probably want. 
default&#xa0;defaultQ379default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default defaultI
defaults negative?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: In the sense 
defaultof 
defaulth
defaultow 
defaulty
defaultou 
defaultare 
defaultgoing to treat the rate
defaultable value of agricultural land.
default My position is that it should be cautiously set at a low rate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ380default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default At a low poundage. We have valuations at the moment. Irrespective of whether or not we trust valuers, we can reach valuations on estates and they can be charged, not necessarily at the ex
defaultisting business rate of 46p
default in the pound, but certainly at a low rate and building it up as and when. The substance of your evidence, I think, is that almost all that increase in taxation would be reflected in the price.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Correct.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ381default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default As the tax rose, the price would fall, and 
defaultthen 
defaultthere is an issue for either the local authority or somebody else as to what balance they strike.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Yes, and it would provide a mild financial incentive for people to make the best of their land, so to speak.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ382default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Professor Adams, do you agree with that?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: I do not disagree with that. I am happy to leave that to Professor
default&#xa0;
defaultCheshire.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ383default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Were we wanting to drive down the price of land, ending de-rating would be one of the easiest ways of doing it.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I would start with inheritance tax relief and see what happened, 
defaultthen 
defaultmove to a vacant land tax, if you wanted that, and then move to agricultural re-rating, which is a very modest step.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ384default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I can see a possible difficulty about vacant land tax on the basis of what is “vacancy
default,”
default particularly in rural areas
default: is
default a single sheep per
default million acres vacant
default 
defaultor not? 
defaultPresumably, you then get into all sorts of complicated rules.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: You can apply a vacant land tax only to urban land.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ385default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default In rural areas
default,
default you would not have any equivalent.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: It would be agricultural rating, because you would have your vacant land with a single sheep on 1,000 acres. That land would then be charged an agricultural rate.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: There are clear definitions from the Government’s survey of exactly what vacant and derelict land is. They need some adapt
defaultat
defaultion, but that would provide the basis for any further policy action.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ386default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default I would like to address questions on the Valuation Office Agency particularly to Professor Cheshire. Since 2011
default,
default that agency has stopped collecting and publishing land price indices. Among others, you were quite vocal in your concerns about that. Why is it so important to have that information?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: The information was less than perfect, but it was the only source that existed. There
default are lots of different sources—
defaultfor example
default,
default the house price indices. There 
defaultwas only one source of publicly 
defaultavailable data on land prices. We differ in where we were in the spectrum of 
defaultvaluation
default. My view is that markets yield very valuable information about where shortages are, but where you have a relative restriction on supply compared with demand—there may be good reasons
default for that restriction
default; 
defaultfor example
default,
default you do not want people to build in areas of outstanding natural beauty, national parks or wherever it may be—unless you have information on land markets, you cannot use the information which land markets are generating to guide where you should be releasing more land for development.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ387default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default The indices are purely a pointer; they show areas that we need to look at more closely, so it is not indicating anything in itself.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: It is indicating something in itself
default—
defaultthat there is an excess demand for land in that location relative to some other location. Whe
defaultre we observe that the price of
default 
defaultland north of Oxford, or within the green belt part of Greater London, is £8
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion to £10
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion a hectare, that is not just the land market telling you something; it is screaming that there is a real shortage of housing in that area, if it is at a price that is available for housing land. This is not 
defaultScotland
default, but guidance issued on the national policy planning framework says that land prices should be used as indicative measures to allocate land for development. That came out in October, but all the data had been abolished a year previously.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ388default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default Your specific concerns are around housing.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Because that is the single most important use, but it also supplied data on agricultural land. It is very valuable to have a long series. That series had been available for a very long period. Even if it was not absolutely right, you could see trends over time and make comparisons across areas and regions, and that has been lost.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ389default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default More generally, would it be useful in giving assistance in exactly the sort of thing we are trying to do, which is to develop our policies particularly dealing with land reform?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Without land price data of a systematic sort, you are essentially scrabbling around in the dark. It is absurd that we do not have land data; it is worse than absurd. You cannot even value company assets. There are 
defaulta 
defaultlot of companies that own land as part of their asset values. We have no way of objectively assessing those.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ390default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default Companies do it.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: With increasing difficulty, but you cannot challenge them because there is no official data series on what has been happening to the price of land.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ391default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default There was a big debate around the Post Office estate, but valuations were done that put nominal values on it.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: You can commission specific valuations, but you have no check against some third party quasi-objective source of evidence, so they may or may not be good, but they are one-off; they are not an ongoing basis. How can we challenge some big developer 
defaultthat
default says that their landholdings are worth 
defaultx
default if there are no data on land prices out there?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ392default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default 
defaultI meant Royal Mail, not the Post Office. Are there other aspects of information, data or transparency, such as patterns of land tenure and occupation, that are important, particularly in being able to develop evidence-based policy
default in this area
default?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Historically, Scotland has been much more open about price data for property than England, but there seems to me no reason at all why there should not be publicly accessible data on all transactions in land, including ownership, price and other characteristics of the land, particularly the exact geo-location of the land, because without that you cannot really assess the value of the land in terms of its composite characteristics.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ393default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default Professor Adams, do you want to comment?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: An a
defaultbsolutely fundamental role for G
defaultovernment
defaults
default to play is to make sure this information is available. The key characteristic of the Valuation Office data is that they were independent; they were not
default acting on behalf of, or
default trying to produce an index from a selective number of clients. The position was that they had full access to data because of the particulars delivered, and it was then published. To go back to my point, they were not estimates; they were published as price data. If there is one thing
default that
default G
defaultovernments can do to improve the functioning of land markets it is to have decent information systems. I concur entirely about knowledge of the owner and the price being public. It is absolutely essential; otherwise, the difficulty of values or estimates getting out of line with prices becomes worse. Anything that this Committee could do to have that data series reinstated
default,
default I would applaud.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: It is absolutely amazing that a modern, allegedly civilised, country does not have any public data on land prices or land ownership. If you think back to the banking crisis of 2007, part of that came out of a mis-valuation of real estate assets. 
defaultIt’s—I’m
default lost for words.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ394default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default That was prior to these indices not being done.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: Of course, there were other failures in the system, but you cannot even begin to be worried about what is going on with the value of real estate assets unless, as my colleague said, you have a publicly available quasi-objective source of data.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ395default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can I ask whether or not there is any other information—data, patterns of land tenure and so on—that it is valuable to have and we do not have at the moment? You mentioned beneficial ownership, for example. Is there anything else that we ought to seek to have established as an information source in the public sector?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: In relation to urban land, there could be much better public knowledge on contamination, for example, because that clearly has a knock
default&#x2011;
defaulton price effect. It is not easy to do. There have been attempts to do it, but one needs to have a system that puts together various pieces of information that affect prices offered and paid in the market, and in urban areas contamination may be one of those.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ396default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Presumably, that would require somebody going out to assess it. I can see how, when a piece of land is being examined for purchase/sale, 
defaultand somebody gets it tested, then t
defaulthe information becomes available and it should be held in the public domain, but are you suggesting there would be an automatic process by which the public sector started collecting this information? I can see an
default expense
default argument against that right away.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: There might be certain parts where that would be useful, in the same way that there are geological surveys on which areas have had coal mining in the past. That is going to undermine development prospects. You might take that approach. It certainly would not be a blanket coverage, but there might be areas where that would be useful. In other places
default,
default there are simply surveys that have already been done which could be made more public.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ397default&#xa0; 
defaultGraeme Morrice:default I wanted to touch briefly on the issue of urban land reform. Professor Adams, you have written about the urgent need for urban land reform. Could you define what you mean by this? What are the key issues that need to be addressed?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: The tie-up between urban land reform and rural land reform is all about property rights. The issue would be: who owns and exercises the property rights? Property rights are conditioned by statute, custom and so on
default and so forth
default. Previously, one is starting to question whether a property right that enables you to hold land indefinitely, which I talked about a moment ago, is in the public interest, but let’s move on from that.
default              
defaultAnother issue is where you are trying to put together a major redevelopment site. Whether it is in the city centre or the edge of the city does not really matter. Particularly in urban areas
default,
default we will often fin
defaultd many different property right 
defaultholders with different ownership interests. It is a patchwork. Either the local authority comes in and compulsorily purchases the whole lot—the evidence tells us that that happens very rarely—or the private developer operates secretly over a period of time, gradually trying to assemble it, which is a very inefficient way of doing it.
default              
defaultOne issue that has come up in my paper is the suggestion that in those kinds of circumstances we adopt the legislation that applies in 
defaultHong Kong
default, for example. They have a similar problem but it is much more evident because they have a lot of multi-storey buildings. Imagine a multi-storey building in 
defaultHong Kong
default with 100 different owners and trying to get that together for redevelopment. Many of those buildings are past their sell-by date and you could put something more viable there.
default              
defaultUnder our system
default,
default the private developer would have to negotiate individually with all 100 owners, or the local authority 
defaultwould put in a
default compulsory purchase order 
defaultand
default buy them all out. The legislation introduced in 
defaultHong Kong
default is such that the private owner simply has to buy up 90% and at that point can go for what you might regard as a privatised form of compulsory purchase. I will not go into the details of that, but that is basically what it is. It is the same sort of principle as company acquisition.
default              
defaultThe advantage of it is that previously there was a reason to be the last person to sell. If you were the 100th person and he had bought all 99, you could hold him to ransom. You do not know where you will be in the queue. You might be very happy being the 89th because you can still hold him to ransom, but you do not want to be the 90th or 91st person to sell because your bargaining power has gone. In that kind of arrangement
default,
default you have redefined the property right to overcome what is primarily an issue of market failure. You have said, “We will deal with that issue of market failure without necessarily going through a big compulsory purchase. We will deal with it by trying to deal with the way the market operates.” That is an example of what one could do in terms of urban land reform. It would be reform of property rights to speed up redevelopment without the need for compulsory purchase.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ398default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Professor Cheshire, do you want to add anything to that?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: A classic problem of land markets is land assembly and the hold-out problem, as it is called, which has been described. I have one slight worry, which you would have to pay attention to. It is easy in 
defaultHong Kong
default where you are dealing with a vertical structure because it is defined before you start, but, if you are talking about land assembly, what is 90%? Ninety per cent
default.
default of what? In some sense, the intended developer would have to identify the area over which they were wishing to assemble ahead of time.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: You would probably need to tie that up with at least some acknowledgement by the public authority early on that the area identified by the developer was a suitable one for redevelopment, but it could be done. You could set up the system in such a way, so that is an example where you could make the market work a lot better.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ399default&#xa0; 
defaultMike Crockart:default I have a very quick question about the community right to buy. At the moment
default,
default it is very much a rural matter. There are conditions attached to it about the size of the community. We have heard evidence in this inquiry that that should be made universal so it could be brought in
default in
default an urban situation. What is your view of the extension of that right to buy?
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: The Scottish Government ran a consultation precisely on that point. The consultation responses were overwhelmingly in favour of extending the right to buy to urban areas. I think the principle is one that has quite broad support. There were very few people arguing against it. T
defaulthe issue is obviously 
defaultoperationalising
default it. How do you define the community in an urban area? That is not insurmountable. You might need to take small rather than large distances; you may need to define the community in different ways. For example, there are community councils
default in urban areas
default that represent parts of urban areas, so there are a number of ways in which it would be possible to identify the community so it was not one or two individuals.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ400default&#xa0; 
defaultLindsay Roy:default My apologies, gentlemen. I had another commitment this afternoon, so I am acting as 
defaultswee
defaultper.
default I am sorry I missed your evidence. The scope of this inquiry is quite wide. In relation to the operation of land markets, are there topics or questions that you think we should pay particular attention to, in addition to those that you have discussed today? In other words, are there any answers you have prepared to questions that you thought we might have asked but have not so far asked?
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I think we have covered quite a lot of the ground over which I think I have expertise. The basic issue is capitalisation and how relatively effective land markets are at capitalising all sorts of what one might think are extraordinarily intangible values, like expected future aircraft noise, local graffiti or quality of fishing. All of this is reflected in land prices. That was the basic message I wanted to get across, and that applies to these tax incentives, tax breaks and subsidies as well.
defaultProfessor Adamsdefault: Although I disagree with the application of a number of the ideas that Professor Cheshire is putting forward, the fundamental principle is that the way land markets in this country work is very directly conditioned by law and policy. It is possible for Parliament and 
defaultthe Government
default to make major changes to the operation of land markets by setting the context slightly differently. We should not think of land markets as
default something natural that appear
default from the sky like the weather. Land markets are constructed through social 
defaultrelationships but also through G
defaultovernment policy and legislation. All that can reconstruct land markets in a different way.
defaultProfessor Cheshiredefault: I entirely agree. Property rights are not given by God; they are defined by law, and exactly how they are defined is reflected in the prices people will pay in land markets. Coming back to the issue of 12% of land under uncertain ownership, I suggest it is very likely that that land would sell at a discount because of the uncertainty of ownership.
defaultChair:default Colleagues, are there any final points? As I indicated earlier, I now have a much greater understanding of what I do not entirely understand, but at least you have, very valuably, pointed us in the right direction. Thank you very much.
