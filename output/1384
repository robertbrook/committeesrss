[normal]Written evidence submitted by Chris [bold]Hodrien[bold] (CCS04)[bold]Author Background:    I am a minority co-owner, technical consultant and business development representative for the Timmins CCS process, an advanced, patented, elegant British-owned flexible low-energy CCS process capable of use for both pre and post-combustion capture in both powerplants and general industry, with some particularly good near-term synergies in the petrochemical industry. I am also a lead spokesman on CCS within the 
[normal]Claverton
[normal] Energy Group   
[normal]www.claverton-energy.com
[normal]  , a leading (&gt;500-member) web-based think-tank of energy professionals on clean energy  issues. I have also liaised with DECC working staff  on  CCS policy issues. I also teach CCS (including bio-CCS) at Warwick and Birmingham Universities.
[normal]The capture step of CCS has been well-proven (with a wide variety of proprietary technologies) in the UK and global natural gas industries. I am a very experienced Chemical Process Engineer with 40 years of cutting-edge R&amp;D Project Leader and Consultant experience in that industry, including both gas processing and underground gas storage methods. I wrote my first report on optimising the efficiency (reducing energy losses) on CO2 capture (in UK and US gasworks) back in 1974! CO2 capture, transport and storage is generally seen (for over 50 years) as a technical ‘non-problem’ (just a cost item) in the natural gas, oil refining and petrochemical industries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Key points:[bold]1.
[normal]              
[normal]The slow development of CCS in the UK for the last decade since the 2003 Energy Act is largely a direct result of the UK’s decarbonisation regulatory subsidies and ‘de-risking’ (early technology energy-market protection) ‘playing-table’ being vastly tilted in favour of non-fossil RE sources by DECC for political policy reasons in order to meet inappropriate and legally-binding % RE targets agreed earlier by (and partly championed by UK HMG) at EU level.  This is despite the IEA, IPCC and other independent (non-CCS) international agencies concluding that fossil fuels with ‘mature’ CCS systems would deliver the same level of decarbonisation at over 30% lower costs per tonne of CO2 saved,  at 
[normal]all 
[normal]stages of decarbonisation through to 80% in 2050,and 
[normal]especially
[normal] in the early pre-2030 stages with more limited ‘fleet’ % CO2 reductions. (other well-proven lower-risk non-RE options such as fuel switching, large industrial CHP and end-use fossil energy savings of all types are cheaper still). 
[normal]2. 
[normal]              
[normal]The new CfD and CPF (Carbon Price Floor) measures in the current draft Energy Bill go some way towards redressing this glaring historic imbalance, but more needs to be done. The  
[normal]relative
[normal] generosity vs.RE etc of such long-term market adjustment mechanisms for very long-lived fossil-with- CCS plant are vastly more important as an incentive to create an entire viable new CCS industry than a one-off capital grant towards one or more limited-life, part-scale demonstration plants, and have been missing in the last 10 years of UK energy policy. 
[normal]3. 
[normal]              
[normal]All 
[normal]three key tenets of the fundamental  thinking on global fossil resource depletion  underlying the above RE targets (viz,:  that  coal and gas were rapidly running out; that they would rapidly become too expensive to purchase, especially imports LNG; and that they were ‘impossible’(?)  to decarbonise) has now been shown  to be comprehensively flawed, demanding a need for a complete re-balancing of national, EU and global energy policy in favour of fossil fuels 
[normal]with CCS. The IEA forecast that even crude oil production (the most heavily depleted form) will continue to increase globally until at least 2035. The effect of quite a simple recent HMG tax change in the North Sea has been dramatic in revitalising new investment. The resulting larger-than-
[normal]assumed
[normal] use of fossil fuels over next 30-40 years makes the large-scale use of CCS 
[normal]imperative[bold] and the creation of  a large ‘full-chain’ CCS industry and supply chain 
[normal]an urgent policy priority[bold], both in the UK, EU and globally.
[normal]4. In view of declining total DECC department budget, the only practical mechanism for rebalancing is a large scale transfer of incentives funds (and market protection) from current RE-based instruments /targets to CCS instruments. 
[normal]5. It is simply unreasonable and illogical to expect (at least in absence of a very high ‘Norway-style’ carbon tax bigger than the CPF) high-cost and risk low-carbon plant of 
[normal]any
[normal] type to be able to compete against existing  paid-for high-carbon unabated plants in an open trading energy market. One of the obvious successes of the UK RE incentives programme of the last 10 years was the fair  protection of these vulnerable  low-carbon power sources from this market competition risk via the purchase Obligation clause of the RO mechanism, with ramping total purchase requirements and penalty clauses. By contrast, the currently proposed un-tried CfD mechanism, whatever its 
[normal]theoretical
[normal] ‘economic efficiency’, is an un-tried gamble. We have already seen indirect market-based mechanisms go completely ‘off the rails’ (due to unforeseen  market developments, much like the fate of the now-derided EU ETS CO2 trading mechanism) in the recent adverse UK powerplant coal/gas burn ratio swing, temporarily ‘de-railing’ DECC’s power sector ramped CO2 reduction targets . A mandated CCS-specific quota, greatly reduced EPS CO2 limit or RO-type quota mechanism would each provide more certainty of meeting the agreed new CCS roll-out target rates.
[normal]6. The prospects for CCS in the UK have been further crippled by an obsessive focus on CCS in the 
[normal]coal
[normal]-fired 
[normal]power
[normal] plant sector (largely based on existing-plant retrofit thinking) by DECC, notably on the 
[normal]post[bold]-capture option, for policy reasons, yet:
[normal]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The likelihood of any significant number of coal plant retrofits 
[normal]in the UK[bold] is actually low because of the limited residual life of the current oal fleet – this principle was already ‘tested’ for 
[normal]much lower-cost[bold] SO2 and NOx cleanup retrofits under the EU LCPD and IED Directives, resulting inc. 50% voluntary plant closures instead –the % ‘take-up’ for costlier CCS will be still lower. The great majority of proposals for the DECC CCS Demo Competition were new-builds;
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]....but 
[normal]new-
[normal]build coal plant will be marginalised in the UK; the current level of the EPS limit continuing to permit low-cost  
[normal]un
[normal]abated gas plant more or less guarantees it;
[normal]6.3  The 
[normal]post
[normal]-combustion capture application (for either coal or gas fuel) , at atmospheric pressure  and with a dilute  (low % of CO2), dirty, free-oxygen-containing   gas stream of huge absolute volume flow  breaks all the well-known fundamental process engineering principles for efficient ,low-cost, well-proven gas separation (by 
[normal]any
[normal] separation technology option)  - i.e. the high cost of post-capture CCS is no surprise at all to trained process engineers. By contrast, the generic  
[normal]pre
[normal]-combustion capture in gasification ‘IGCC’ (Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle powerplants 
[normal]and
[normal] in a wide range of other  
[normal]high-pressure
[normal] , clean-gas, O2-free industrial processing in the oil refinery, petrochemical,  natural gas and future synthetic fuels sectors (collectively known as ‘the process industries’) (as opposed to the 
[normal]low
[normal] pressure steel and cement 
[normal]technologies usually discussed) is 
[normal]almost identical to[bold] the type of low-cost, fully-proven CO2 separation 
[normal]already[bold] well-proven in these same sectors for technical uses (usually involving CO2 venting to atmosphere, to date) .  Furthermore, for new-build, gasification-based powerplant options have a far lower non-CO2 pollutants footprint and water use than conventional combustion powerplant, while also capable of producing a range of attractive saleable co-products inc’ synthetic liquid transport fuels (‘synfuels’) , synthetic methane fuel gas (aka ‘SNG’, Synthetic Natural Gas, hydrogen, fertilisers, and inert (non-leachable, 
[normal]unlike 
[normal]powerplant ash) construction aggregates which fully sequester the heavy-metals content from the original feedstock. Furthermore, some gasifier designs are fuel-flexible or even biomass or waste-specific, being able to utilise:
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]a wide range of biomass types, which combined with CCS (so-called ‘BECCS –Bio-Energy with CCS’) could deliver  
[normal]affordable[bold], near-term C-
[normal]negative[bold]* technology –surely ‘the holy grail’ of decarbonisation policy, 
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]a wide and varying range of low-value and troublesome ‘residual’ (Post-recycling) waste materials , including difficult oil refinery residuals, making a major contribution to national waste  landfill diversion and energy-from-waste (EfW) targets at much higher efficiency and lower ‘footprint’ than incinerators.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.  The above unfortunate focus on coal powerplant applications has totally distorted the CCS development area. The key carbon capture step (typically about 80% of total ‘chain’ costs)  is a piece of process engineering involving gases, and all the decades of key expertise in it reside within the above-named 
[normal]non
[normal]-power industrial sectors and their specialist process designers and suppliers. Yet virtually the whole of CCS industrial policy development and industrial advice to DECC is coming from power sector sources,  and those key expert process-industry companies  are notable for their near-absence (despite them already being visibly the companies of choice for conducting the proper detailed ‘FEED’ design studies for the CCS Demonstration projects) , most notably in the recent CCS Cost Reduction Task Force (CRTF) convened by the CCSA on DECC’s behalf, and also inthe type of consultancy organisations DECC are commissioning to provide key CCS cost data and advice. As a result, the bulk of the output of such groups –and even the commissioned UK academic programmes –continues to be heavily biased to the least-favourable coal (and gas) powerplant post-capture application. Still worse, there is a danger that the special needs 
[normal]and cons
[normal]traints of this specific application may subvert the superficially more ‘generic’ policy, technical and funds prioritisation advice being given.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.  Most remarkably, not only is the high-pressure CCS capture step technology already well-proven in the oil refinery, petrochemical,  and natural gas sectors (about 
[normal]15[bold] proprietary processes are already available with normal full commercial guarantees), but many scores of such plant already exist (paid-for) in daily operation in the UK!  All they lack to become a full CCS chain is an affordable shared CO2 pipeline infrastructure and CO2 disposal sinks. DECC’s current ‘electro-centric’ CCS policy approach has almost completely overlooked this existing ‘low-hanging fruit’. However, there are two (minor) policy problems:
[normal]a) they have an inherently more dispersed pattern of smaller units (CO2 sources) than for powerplant, implicitly requiring a more expensive CO2 pipeline cost element (i.e. needing higher subsidy of that minor 
[normal]element[bold]) the cost of which however is small relative to the overall savings 
[normal]from the already-existing capture plant (i.e. ‘winners and losers’ which require regulatory re-balancing). Such sources are already being included as 
[normal]a subsidiary
[normal] in DECC thinking  for powerplant-led CO2 ‘cluster’ pipelines, but in view of all the powerplant CCS problems enunciated above, what we need instead is process  industry-
[normal]led 
[normal]pipeline 
[normal]cluster thinking.
[normal]b) These industries do not primarily sell to individual customers and therefore
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. As admitted on DECC’s own CCS web-pages, all the key 
[normal]elements of[bold] a CCS chain are individually technically well-proven in one application or another (but usually 
[normal]non
[normal]-powerplant).  CO2 capture units are used on their own throughout the process industries in large numbers. In the US EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) industry, 
[normal]now over 30 million[bold] tonnes/yr of CO2 is transported through a 5000km high pressure pipeline network, most new-built within the last 10-15 years, but some for 
[normal]over 30[bold] years.  Vast volumes of natural gas are stored underground daily (and repeatedly safely withdrawn and reinjected!) all over the global natural gas industries using at least three different major types of geological containments.  CO2 is a component of all natural gases and oilfields, so it’s technical and safety properties both above and below ground are very well understood from many decades of oil and gas experience. The corollary that a key policy and funding focus must be full-sized commercial demonstrations of the integrated chain in the real UK market in 
[normal]all [bold]the targeted CCS use sectors (NOT just power!) is quite correct. It is however also pointed out/claimed that none of the 8 current global full-scale (typically &gt;
[normal]1 million[bold] tonnes/year CO2), full-chain CCS commercial operations (generally beyond mere ‘demonstrations’ now) ‘are a powerplant’. This simply reinforces my key points above about the poor economics of the powerplant application. But it also misses a key policy ‘blind-spot’, highlighted in the next paragraph.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.The obsessive DECC decarbonisation policy focus for the last 10 years solely on the power sector, and on direct ‘electric-RE’ (wind, solar, wave etc)  and 
[normal]on
[normal]-site CCS use on powerplants only (the so-called ‘Electrification’ doctrine), including the current EMR market reform  and Energy Bill process,  has missed a key fundamental truth of the modern UK energy industry. This is that the largest (and growing) single contributor to UK power generation is gas-fired plant. What this implies is that:
[normal]a) the gas and power grids are inextricably linked and overlapped, therefore market reform and decarbonisation/RE policy  should consider the two industries 
[normal]as an integrated whole[bold],
[normal]b) any of the 8 global CCS demo’s processing  a fuel gas or other transportable energy source (as most do) could ‘become a powerplant’ (sic) simply by feeding the product gas to even an existing conventional gas Combined Cycle (CCGT) powerplant –there is no need for direct technical on-site integration or re-design, since gas and liquid fuels are transportable. i.e. all 8 are potentially powerplants! The little-known large SACROC Plant (presented at a CCS seminar in Edinburgh this March) has been continually capturing and recycling CO2 for oil EOR 
[normal]for 30 years[bold]. In the specific case of the huge Great Plains SNG Plant operated by Dakota Gasification in North Dakota, 
[normal]one of the largest single energy facilities in the USA[bold], this has been turning about 
[normal]3 million[bold] tonnes/year of low-grade local lignite (using 
[normal]British[bold]-supplied catalysts in one key step) into clean high-pressure SNG for the US gas grid daily since 1984,and has been capturing 50% of all its CO2 (about 
[normal]1.5 million[bold] [bold]T[bold]/Y) and selling it through a new 200-mile pipeline for EOR Oil recovery in Canada. But quite a significant fraction of this SNG product, via the gas grid, is used to fuel remote 
[normal]gas-fired powerplants[bold], and for many years! So the ‘not a powerplant’ cachet is technically meaningless.     
[normal]The current Energy Bill is regulating and reforming half an equation[bold], leaving a large ‘elephant in the room’. Nowhere is this more important than in CCS, where it turns out that the high pressure, oxygen-free CCS processes 
[normal]involved in fuel gas processing and manufacture are at least an order of magnitude cheaper per tonne of CO2 than CCS on powerplants. In other words, a gas-fired powerplant can be partially decarbonised, more efficiently and cost-effectively, via its fuel supply, most particularly via the manufacture  of low-C SNG fuel gas from partially biogenic feedstocks (including lower-cost, technically-difficult bio-wastes) as described in 6.3 i) and ii) above,  and without any of the multiple resulting problems involved in housing CCS plant on-site (including potential partial loss of the operational flexibility 
[normal]that will be so vital to[bold] balancing the wildly fluctuating outputs from DECC’s  planned wind and other RE fleets).  But DECC have apparently never asked that question.  Mr Anthony Day (consultant’s) parallel submission to this Call puts detailed numbers to such an SNG production scheme, based on a mix of well-proven British current and ‘heritage’ technology, and I warmly commend it to the Committee as an outstanding cost-effective and fully-practical decarbonised (low-C) flexible energy technology with an extensive range of end-uses via the paid-for gas grid, which in my experienced professional opinion is worthy of priority policy support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. From an industrial policy point of view, the UK relinquished any 
[normal]plant technology and manufacturing[bold] (as opposed to mere site hosting) lead in the leading RE sources of large-scale windfarms and solar decades ago. However thanks to its long nationalised-industry fossil fuel and process heritage (including the academic sector), and the global immaturity of the sector, CCS is one of the few clean energy technology areas in which the UK could credibly become a significant global player. However this vital potential lead has been frittered by 8 years of HMG policy vacillation and is rapidly ebbing away unless more resolute action is taken to create a functioning, rapidly-growing UK CCS industry and supply chain (using incentives funding diverted from less cost-effective and fundamentally technically unnecessary RE activities –see 1,3 and 4 above).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. Another issue that has increased CCS costs and held it back in UK is the inexplicable, nonsensical  arbitrary performance target of 90% CO2 capture target set by DECC for both the CCS Demo plants and all R&amp;D activities. This onerous target is 
[normal]particularly
[normal] technically challenging to achieve in a plant with varying output (ramping, cycling) and during startups/shutdowns as required for real UK grid operation.  But the UK  EPS CO2 regulation permits 420 grams/kWh (tonnes/MWh) (unabated natural gas CC powerplant equivalent) , which is equivalent to only 60% capture even for 100% coal feedstock, and even less with biomass blends! This artificial restriction (which exceeds 
[normal]2050[bold] power-sector fleet targets!) should be disbanded immediately.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13. Further cost reduction opportunities are being lost because of existing DECC policy and incentives mechanisms focus on simplistic ‘single-technology’ solutions. Whereas some of the best low-cost ‘low-hanging fruit’ is in hybrid applications such as hybrid fossil/biomass fuelled plant with partial CCS, and in flexible co-production of electric power with another product such as fuels and chemicals – ‘the Prius of large decarbonised energy production’.  But most of these would not qualify for full incentives under the ‘over-rigid’ qualification rules currently built into the planned EMR decarbonisation incentives process. Notably, Summit Power of the US is already developing a large power/fertiliser co-production complex in Texas, but did not offer this efficient combination for the ‘Caledonian Power’ DECC CCS Demo Plant bid.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14. The combination of large scale (partial) biomass fuelled energy conversion and CCS technology, BECCS, offers a unique credible affordable, low-risk route to a near-future practical C-negative 
[normal]technology, far superior in both cost and risk to most other C-negative technology proposals such as Direct Air Capture (DAC) which again, breaks fundamental chemical engineering design principles (but several orders of magnitude worse than for powerplant post-capture). Given the huge potential strategic global importance of such a capability, it deserves a high priority in both direct RD&amp;D funding and in well-designed full-scale, longer-duration decarbonisation market incentives that fully reward CO2 removal beyond zero, ideally at an enhanced incentive rate.
