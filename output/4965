defaultThis response pertains solely to the potential exemption of biodegradable bags from the proposed carrier bag tax and the potential damage this will have on the current UK plastic reprocessing sector.
defaultChase Plastics Ltd has been reprocessing polythene film plastic for 50 years and has seen the rise and fall and rise again of the degradable lobby many times since the 1980s.  Each time our industry has had to point out the pitfalls of promoting degradable bags as the environmental option when it simply is NOT.
defaultChase Plastics Ltd is a member of the BPFRG and also is a member of the specific Films Working Group from this organisation.  We attended the Defra roundtable workshop where we clearly stated that degradable polymer of any type is NOT recyclable except in total isolation from all other polythene film in the waste stream.  Sadly within days the carrier bag tax had been announced and more alarmingly the suggestion that biodegradable bags should carry an exemption.
defaultForgive the basic nature of this response but due to a family bereavement I only have today to submit this response.  However I wish simply to add our support to other more in depth submissions.

defaultIf Government really want to meet their environmental agenda and serve the UK reprocessing sector, which is grossly disadvantaged by other problems with legislation which encourage the export of UK waste packaging, then it should consider an exemption for reprocessed carrier bags.  This would immediately give much needed end markets for UK plastic reprocessors  which would in turn help deliver the UK target, and the even greater European target which may be around the corner.  These bags would be fit for reuse, not ridiculously light weighted so they break before you get your shopping home. 
defaultChase Plastics Ltd would strongly urge this committee to consider a really joined up approach to our environmental problems and outcomes.  You have an opportunity to prevent a well intentioned but misguided error, but you also have the opportunity to offer a huge boost to UK plastic reprocessing by giving the exemption to the best environmental option…..the reprocessed plastic bag.
