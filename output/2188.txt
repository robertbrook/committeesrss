[[[Scottish Law Commission – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[EVIDENCE TO THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE DRAFT DEREGULATION BILL]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.              This is the response of the Scottish Law Commission to the call for written evidence by the Joint Committee on the draft Deregulation Bill.&#xa0;2.              This response concerns the provisions in the Bill giving Ministers a power to disapply legislation that they consider to be no longer of practical use:  namely clauses 50-57.&#xa0;3.              The Scottish Law Commission was established by the Law Commissions Act 1965 to promote the reform of the law of Scotland.&#xa0;4.              In carrying out its functions, the Commission operates as an independent public body.  As such, the Commission provides advice and recommendations to UK Ministers (as regards reserved areas of Scots law) and to Scottish Ministers (as regards devolved areas of Scots law).&#xa0;5.              One of the Commission’s functions as set out in section 3(1) of the Law Commissions Act 1965 is to keep the law under review ‘with a view to its systematic development and reform, including in particular … the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary enactments’.  The Commission has therefore always carried out work with a view to proposing the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary legislation.  This function is commonly referred to as statute law repeals.&#xa0;6.              The statute law repeals work is carried out jointly with the Law Commission for England and Wales.  The Law Commission for England and Wales have a specialist statute law repeals team in place, and take the lead in preparing proposals for repeals.  The Scottish Law Commission assists in preparing the proposals, and addressing the Scottish implications of proposed repeals.  The 19 Commission Reports with draft Bills submitted since 1965 have all been joint Reports between the Commissions.  All 19 Reports have been implemented and work is now underway on a 20th Report.&#xa0;&#xa0;7.              The Scottish Law Commission has seen the written response of the Law Commission for England and Wales to the call for written evidence on the draft Deregulation Bill; and were consulted on the preparation of that response.  This Commission endorses the terms of that response: namely the information provided, the concerns expressed about the relevant provisions in the Deregulation Bill; the alternative proposal put forward; and the answers to the questions raised by the Committee.&#xa0;&#xa0;Malcolm McMillanChief Executive&#xa0;16 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;2&#xa0;
