[normal]Green Lanes Protection Group – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Deregulation Draft Bill ('the Bill') - Clauses 12-19[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I write on behalf of GLPG
[normal] to express support for the proposal by GLEAM dated 19 Aug 2013 concerning an appeal provision for TROs.  We rely on the reasons already given and have nothing to add.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]GLPG has already lodged a submission dated 21 August 2013 in support of the proposals by PDGLA for reclassification of UUCRs and unsealed BOATs as restricted byways. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]GLPG now offers evidence (attached) of the damage caused by off-
[normal]roading
[normal] on green lan
[normal]es, notably in
[normal] cases where TROs have been refused by the local authority.  Four photographs are attached.
