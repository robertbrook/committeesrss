[normal]Written evidence from 
[normal]Martyn Underhill
[normal], 
[normal]Police and Crime Commissioner for Dorset [PCC Progress 41]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In relation to the Home Affairs Select Committee enquiry into PCCs, I am grateful to be invited to contribute and respond as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The “KCC” Principle
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]I believe in the KCC Principle, namely:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Keep Cutting Crime AND Keep Catching Criminals
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]Whilst I appreciate the Government have only set one target of cutting crime, I am here to represent the public, and during the election, they made it clear that they were not happy that Dorset Police were detecting less crime than most forces in the country, something that had been the highlight of media comment.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]In response, I adopted the KCC principle for Dorset Police.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]I tasked the Chief Constable to improve the ability to catch criminals, following the 
[normal]Peelian
[normal] principles of not only preventing crime but of detecting crime too. The Force responded positively with a fresh approach to investigating crime. In the last year, crime has reduced by 
[normal]7
[normal]%, and resolved crimes have increased to 26%. 
[normal]  Whilst some of the resolved crime rate has improved because of changes in the Home Office counting rules, equally some of the increase in the detection rate has been due to the improvement in investigations by the Force.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reversing the Marine Section Decision
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]Prior to my election, Dorset Police announced it was closing its Marine Section, to save £600,000. Following extensive dialogue with the coastal communities, I stated that if elected I would reverse this decision and find partnership ways to continue to police the 88 miles of coastline in 
[normal]Dorset
[normal]. As a result, I did two things:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]              
[normal]As a result of my 
[normal]influence
[normal], 
[normal]and through working with the Force, 
[normal]we have more patrols on the water, more available officers for half the cost, and the 
[normal]coastal communities retain a service that they value a great deal. The initiative saved £300,000. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Increasing police visibility
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7
[normal]              
[normal]Police visibility has always been a key driver for the public, even though there is little empirical evidence to show that more officers visibly on the beat reduces or solves crime. 
[normal]1.8
[normal]              
[normal]However, in order to respond to the public value placed on police visibility in our communities, 
[normal]one initiative 
[normal]I undertook against 
[normal]a landscape of reducing 
[normal]budgets was to examine the vehicle fleet.  On my election, approximately 40% of the vehicle fleet was marked.  I found this bemusing.  Most pool and fleet vehicles were unmarked, meaning that the police were driving among the public, without them knowing. I therefore challenged this, and now nearly 60% of all vehicles
[normal] are marked, with an aspiration to reach 80% in the next 18 months.
[normal] 
[normal]The Victims Bureau
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.9
[normal]              
[normal]It is widely accepted that the police could do so much more to keep victims updated.  We also know this is so valued by victims from both national and local victim surveys. I was determined to address this problem to better serve victims of crime.  In November 2012, I announced plans to introduce a Victims Bureau for 
[normal]Dorset
[normal] and I am proud to say that the Bureau was opened by Baroness 
[normal]Newlove
[normal], the Victims Commissioner, in late November
[normal] 2013
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.10
[normal]              
[normal]The Victims Bureau will inform and guide victims through the criminal justice journey, and will expand next year to support those victims who do not wish to report a crime to the police or other agencies. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Multi-Agency Cloud Based Information sharing system
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.11
[normal]              
[normal]The ability to share real time information between all statutory and non-statutory agencies in relation to all issues of risk and harm and public safety is the “Holy Grail” that all agencies, including the police, have pursued for decades. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.12
[normal]              
[normal]In 
[normal]Dorset
[normal], I have used my position as Police and Crime Commissioner to bring key agencies around the table to drive this agenda forward. This clear desire to move forward between all 
[normal]Dorset
[normal] agencies is very exciting, and three clear products that achieve the correct level of security (IL3) have been identified. My office is “pump priming” this initiative, and will lead on securing a platform for not just safeguarding issues, but ASB issues, civil contingencies, and 
[normal]offender management
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The role of commissioners in holding their chief constables to account[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]I have held my Chief Constable to account in several ways. I shall give two examples to elaborate. Both of these challenges relate to the 5
[normal]th
[normal] priority I set in my Police and Crime Plan – Improving Public Satisfaction in the Police.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]The first challenge was over performance relating to the non-emergency number 101, which was clearly failing, because the public and councillors 
[normal]were telling me in their droves. Call waiting times, and abandoned calls from frustrated callers “giving up” were very high. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]My challenge
[normal] to the Chief Constable
[normal] was made in writing, demanding an immediate improvement on behalf of the public. 
[normal] 
[normal]New staff were placed in the call centre, and new software was implemented, meaning that there 
[normal]has been 
[normal]a dramatic improvement in public service
[normal] since my intervention
[normal].  
[normal]Performance in relation to answering non-emergency calls has risen from 54% answered within 30 seconds in July 2013 to 77% in November 2013 (and the proportion of abandoned calls reduced from 13% to 4%).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Equally, the public told me loud and clear that they expected the police to attend vehicle crimes reported to the police. Within weeks of my election, 
[normal]I challenged the Force to address this policy and as a direct result,
[normal] whenever possible operationally, an officer 
[normal]now 
[normal]attend
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]vehicle 
[normal]crime scenes.  This has brought obvious benefits in terms of evidence gathering and public satisfaction in 
[normal]relation to this crime.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The role of [bold]P[bold]olice and [bold]C[bold]rime [bold]P[bold]anels in holding their [bold]C[bold]ommissioners to account[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]The Police and Crime Panel (the Panel) in 
[normal]Dorset
[normal] is becoming an established group that holds me to account. I feel that I have received robust scrutiny over important decisions such as precept rises and fundamental changes to the Police and Crime Plan (PCP).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]The Panel have also requested a “spotlight focus” at each of their meetings on each of the six priorities within my PCP, in turn.  This has proved to be a useful dual purposed opportunity to scrutinise the delivery against the ambitions detailed in the PCP
[normal] and 
[normal]for the Panel to further their understanding of the work being undertaken.  It also shows the Panel the complexities of delivery mechanisms and partnerships that exist in my world. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]The relationship between the OPCC and the officers supporting the Panel is a professional one.  The same can be said for my relationship with the Chairman of the Panel.   We do not always agree with a proposed approach to scrutiny or the area of focus that has been requested, and th
[normal]is healthy critical relationship is useful.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]The Chief Executive and I meet monthly with the Chairman of the Panel and their lead supporting officer to have a frank exchange on the issues that are currently concerning the panel. This meeting also furthers the relationship, in a productive way, 
[normal]promoting 
[normal]the intention of Parliament of holding the PCC to account whilst still supporting the PCC in delivering the PCP on behalf of 
[normal]Dorset
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]I also seek to involve the Panel in a transparent way around key decisions.  For example, the Panel accepted my invitation to have an observer on the two key appointments I have made this year; my new Chief Constable and my new Chief Executive. The Panel member was a valued observer who reported back to the Panel on the process
[normal] and 
[normal]their view of the candidate
[normal]. They 
[normal]played an influential role in the Panel’s deliberations on these decisions.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]I have also hosted “open-days” in my office where I brief the Panel on emerging threats
[normal] and t
[normal]he implementation of key delivery projects
[normal], including
[normal] 
[normal]collaboration.  I have encouraged an open dialogue with the Panel members on issues that they would like the events to cover.  In January 2014 I will be meeting with the Panel in private to have a detailed discussion around precept proposals and the related budget.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]Recent debate on this relationship has raised some interesting ideas and there is one that I would particularly support: I feel that it would strengthen the role of the panel to have the leaders of local authorities as members.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8
[normal]              
[normal]This high calibre councillor scrutiny on behalf of their authority, coupled with the resulting enhanced understanding of the ambitions I have to improve policing and the criminal justice system, would, I believe, be immensely helpful in partnership working. It would also enhance the effectiveness of the Panel, and is an idea that I would support exploring further. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9
[normal]              
[normal]One of my biggest issues has been supporting members through the change. Many failed to understand the different and enhanced role of the PCC in relation to the old system, and training prior to the change would have been useful. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The division of functions and staff between commissioners and chief constables following the Stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Neither the Chief Constable nor I desired a second stage transfer.  However, the Policing Minister’s letter of 3 July 2013 clarified that all transfer plans had to be considered against the following ‘clear principles’:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b. 
[normal]              
[normal]t
[normal]he transfer must adhere to the principles of the Policing Protocol;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c. 
[normal]              
[normal]t
[normal]he plans must set out clear roles and responsibilities between Police and Crime Commissioners and Chief Constables.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]In addition to these requirements from Government, the Chief Constable and I strongly believed that as a matter of principle any workforce split between the two “Corporation Sole” should be kept to an absolute minimum.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]Having reviewed the various options as detailed in the Stage 2 transfers Guidance produced by APCC, APACE and PACCTS we therefore agreed that the transfer scheme for Dorset will consist of the following elements:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a.
[normal]              
[normal]a
[normal]ll staff, with the exception of those already employed within the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner, will transfer to the employment of the Chief Constable;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b.
[normal]              
[normal]t
[normal]he transfer will follow the Cabinet Office Guidelines on Staff Transfers in the Public Sector;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c.
[normal]              
[normal]a
[normal] memorandum of understanding will operate between the two Corporation Sole to ensure effective mutual collaboration and support. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]UNISON, the Police Federation and the Superintendents Association have been engaged in the process.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]I await with interest to see whether this proposal is accepted. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The role of commissioners in budget and precept setting[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]The PCC is the 
[normal]precepting
[normal] and also the grant receiving body for all policing related funding. This therefore gives the PCC control over the allocation of this funding and the commissioning decisions which enables them to target funding to best meet the priorities of the Police and Crime Plan. This can be either through allocation of funding to the Police Force or through the commissioning of services. Control over allocation of funding to the Police Force strengthens the ability of the PCC to hold the Chief Constable to account for delivery of the Police and Crime Plan.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]One of the roles of the Police and Crime Panel is to scrutinise the budget and precept. In terms of precept setting, the PCC is required to notify the Panel of their proposed precept and for them to review and report upon it. In the first instance, the Panel has the power to veto the proposal and can ask it to be raised or lowered. The PCC has to consider this but ultimately can just make a minimal adjustment in line with the Panel’s recommendation (
[normal]eg
[normal] simply changing from 2% to 1.99% would satisfy the rules). It is right and proper that the PCC, the elected individual, has the final say. The PCC is a directly elected individual who is accountable to the public for that decision.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]It is noticeable that some members of Police and Crime Panels are using the policing precept discussions to air the political / budgetary views of their constituent councils rather than considering the policing precept proposal on its own merit. Clearer guidance should be issued to panel members to avoid this. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]              
[normal]The push towards “localism” is currently impeded by the rules around council tax referendum limits. Surveys of local residents suggest significant support for precept increases in excess of the 2% limit but the cost of holding a local referendum in Dorset is estimated at around £1m making it highly prohibitive. Timing of local / national elections in May mean that they also cannot be used for the purpose of a local precept referendum. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]              
[normal]The transfer of Community Safety, Restorative Justice and Victims funding to the PCC is welcomed and will allow for future services to be commissioned to better meet local requirements, increasing positive outcomes whilst focussing on value for money.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing priorities[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]The key issue for PCCs is that they have the power to influence and facilitate in areas totally untouched by Police Authorities.  I have 
[normal]picked
[normal] up the mantl
[normal]e
[normal] to champion several “social” issues, and I 
[normal]would like
[normal] to expand on two
[normal] of these.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Early Intervention
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]Working together with our local authorities we were successful in two of our bids to become national early intervention pilots through the Early Intervention Foundation.
[normal]  I look forward to working alongside the Borough of Poole and Dorset County Council on these joint ventures.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Mental Health
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]Hundreds of people 
[normal]who experience mental ill health 
[normal]are routinely taken into custody suites, and out of hours provision for 
[normal]these 
[normal]people 
[normal]when they are 
[normal]in crisis is poor. 
[normal]  
[normal]Police officers are routinely used as the “service of last resort”. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4
[normal]              
[normal]I led nationally for 
[normal]PCCs 
[normal]by 
[normal]establishing and now 
[normal]chairing the 
[normal]“PCC
[normal] 
[normal]M
[normal]ental 
[normal]H
[normal]ealth 
[normal]W
[normal]orking 
[normal]G
[normal]roup
[normal]”, involving senior representatives from the Home Office, Department of Health, NHS England, MOPAC, ACPO and the Superintendents’ Association
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5
[normal]              
[normal]More locally, 
[normal]I have co-commissioned a mental health triage service in Dorset
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]with
[normal] NHS England
[normal], who will evaluate on our behalf.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.6
[normal]              
[normal]I am determined to lead, where I can, to push this agenda forward.  We must reach a place where 
[normal]health matters such as 
[normal]mental 
[normal]crisis intervention should be dealt with by health professionals.
[normal] It is crucial that there is equal parity in services for both physical and mental health. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Progress on establishing collaboration agreements with other commissioners, poli[bold]cing organisations and partners[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1
[normal]              
[normal]In relation to PCC
[normal]s, the South West 
[normal]is considered 
[normal]to be one of the most aligned and collaborative team of PCCs nationally. We meet every six weeks, we have already approved three different collaborative ventures, and we seek more.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]              
[normal]I do a lot nationally as a PCC, which I 
[normal]believe 
[normal]demonstrates my desire to work with all policing organisations. A summary of these roles, which build bridges across many pieces are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair of the PCC Mental Health Working Group
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Vice Chair of 
[normal]the Official Side - 
[normal]Police Negotiating Board/ /Police Staff Council
[normal]; Member of the 
[normal]Police Advisory
[normal] [bold]Board
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Member of the PCC Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise (VCSE) Group
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Member of the PCC Transforming Rehabilitation Working Group
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Member of the Association of Chief Police Officers Review Working Group
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Future Chair of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Independent Custody Visiting Association
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3
[normal]              
[normal]In relation to partners, my Chief Executive and I have achieved 
[normal]a great deal
[normal] in
[normal] 
[normal]bridging gaps and working with partners. 
[normal]We now 
[normal]sit on the Chief Executive 
[normal]and Leaders 
[normal]G
[normal]roup, and the pan
[normal]-
[normal]Dorset 
[normal]Joint Asset Management Group to 
[normal]secure collaboration by sharing buildings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.4
[normal]              
[normal]I have also 
[normal]carried out
[normal] a lot of work on 
[normal]Bluelight
[normal] Collaboration in Dorset, and I have attended several national meetings with national stakeholders like Sir Ken
[normal] 
[normal]Knight, Tobias E
[normal]l
[normal]lwood MP and 
[normal]the Rt Hon 
[normal]Frances Maude MP to drive through collaboration in an innovative and cost saving way.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.5
[normal]              
[normal]Dorset has several initiatives underway to share buildings and services.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Transparency of and rep[bold]orting by commissioners to date[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1
[normal]              
[normal]I inherited only half a team, mainly ex Police Authority staff, who did not appreciate how to be transparent in the way that elected officials should be. 
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2
[normal]              
[normal]In addition, 
[normal]the electronic processes were
[normal] 
[normal]n
[normal]o
[normal]t there either
[normal] but this is now addressed
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.3
[normal]              
[normal]But we have got there, and I am confident that 
[normal]I 
[normal]and the Force are now as transparent a
[normal]s we could be.  Indeed it was re
[normal]assuring that Bernard Rix (COPACC) stated that my office is one of the best at being transparent nationally. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9.1
[normal]              
[normal]I feel I have highlighted many positives in this submission, and I have highlighted blockages too.
[normal] 
[normal] I am surprised that your questioning has not focussed at all on public engagement, arguably the biggest part of a PCC
[normal]s role.  For democracy to be effective, it has to be visibly effective.  I attend a public forum every two weeks, hold PCC surgeries and I have recruited 
[normal]six voluntary advocates, who are my “eyes and ears” in various communities, including the older community and the Polish
[normal] communities
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.2
[normal]              
[normal]There is so much more that the role of the PCC can achieve, given the time, the right resources and the opportunity.  I believe I make a difference and I will continue to work hard to keep the people of Dorset safe.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.3
[normal]              
[normal]To detail all of the work undertaken in the year is difficult within 3000 words and I am happy to expand on the areas above and other areas I am influencing by appearing before your Committee.
