defaultWritten evidence from 
defaultMartyn Underhill
default, 
defaultPolice and Crime Commissioner for Dorset [PCC Progress 41]
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn relation to the Home Affairs Select Committee enquiry into PCCs, I am grateful to be invited to contribute and respond as follows:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force areadefault&#xa0;defaultThe “KCC” Principle
default&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultI believe in the KCC Principle, namely:
default&#xa0;
defaultKeep Cutting Crime AND Keep Catching Criminals
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultWhilst I appreciate the Government have only set one target of cutting crime, I am here to represent the public, and during the election, they made it clear that they were not happy that Dorset Police were detecting less crime than most forces in the country, something that had been the highlight of media comment.  
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultIn response, I adopted the KCC principle for Dorset Police.   
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultI tasked the Chief Constable to improve the ability to catch criminals, following the 
defaultPeelian
default principles of not only preventing crime but of detecting crime too. The Force responded positively with a fresh approach to investigating crime. In the last year, crime has reduced by 
default7
default%, and resolved crimes have increased to 26%. 
default  Whilst some of the resolved crime rate has improved because of changes in the Home Office counting rules, equally some of the increase in the detection rate has been due to the improvement in investigations by the Force.
default&#xa0;
defaultReversing the Marine Section Decision
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default              
defaultPrior to my election, Dorset Police announced it was closing its Marine Section, to save £600,000. Following extensive dialogue with the coastal communities, I stated that if elected I would reverse this decision and find partnership ways to continue to police the 88 miles of coastline in 
defaultDorset
default. As a result, I did two things:
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default              
defaultAs a result of my 
defaultinfluence
default, 
defaultand through working with the Force, 
defaultwe have more patrols on the water, more available officers for half the cost, and the 
defaultcoastal communities retain a service that they value a great deal. The initiative saved £300,000. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIncreasing police visibility
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default              
defaultPolice visibility has always been a key driver for the public, even though there is little empirical evidence to show that more officers visibly on the beat reduces or solves crime. 
default1.8
default              
defaultHowever, in order to respond to the public value placed on police visibility in our communities, 
defaultone initiative 
defaultI undertook against 
defaulta landscape of reducing 
defaultbudgets was to examine the vehicle fleet.  On my election, approximately 40% of the vehicle fleet was marked.  I found this bemusing.  Most pool and fleet vehicles were unmarked, meaning that the police were driving among the public, without them knowing. I therefore challenged this, and now nearly 60% of all vehicles
default are marked, with an aspiration to reach 80% in the next 18 months.
default 
defaultThe Victims Bureau
default&#xa0;
default1.9
default              
defaultIt is widely accepted that the police could do so much more to keep victims updated.  We also know this is so valued by victims from both national and local victim surveys. I was determined to address this problem to better serve victims of crime.  In November 2012, I announced plans to introduce a Victims Bureau for 
defaultDorset
default and I am proud to say that the Bureau was opened by Baroness 
defaultNewlove
default, the Victims Commissioner, in late November
default 2013
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1.10
default              
defaultThe Victims Bureau will inform and guide victims through the criminal justice journey, and will expand next year to support those victims who do not wish to report a crime to the police or other agencies. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMulti-Agency Cloud Based Information sharing system
default&#xa0;
default1.11
default              
defaultThe ability to share real time information between all statutory and non-statutory agencies in relation to all issues of risk and harm and public safety is the “Holy Grail” that all agencies, including the police, have pursued for decades. 
default&#xa0;
default1.12
default              
defaultIn 
defaultDorset
default, I have used my position as Police and Crime Commissioner to bring key agencies around the table to drive this agenda forward. This clear desire to move forward between all 
defaultDorset
default agencies is very exciting, and three clear products that achieve the correct level of security (IL3) have been identified. My office is “pump priming” this initiative, and will lead on securing a platform for not just safeguarding issues, but ASB issues, civil contingencies, and 
defaultoffender management
default. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultThe role of commissioners in holding their chief constables to accountdefault&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultI have held my Chief Constable to account in several ways. I shall give two examples to elaborate. Both of these challenges relate to the 5
defaultth
default priority I set in my Police and Crime Plan – Improving Public Satisfaction in the Police.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultThe first challenge was over performance relating to the non-emergency number 101, which was clearly failing, because the public and councillors 
defaultwere telling me in their droves. Call waiting times, and abandoned calls from frustrated callers “giving up” were very high. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultMy challenge
default to the Chief Constable
default was made in writing, demanding an immediate improvement on behalf of the public. 
default 
defaultNew staff were placed in the call centre, and new software was implemented, meaning that there 
defaulthas been 
defaulta dramatic improvement in public service
default since my intervention
default.  
defaultPerformance in relation to answering non-emergency calls has risen from 54% answered within 30 seconds in July 2013 to 77% in November 2013 (and the proportion of abandoned calls reduced from 13% to 4%).
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultEqually, the public told me loud and clear that they expected the police to attend vehicle crimes reported to the police. Within weeks of my election, 
defaultI challenged the Force to address this policy and as a direct result,
default whenever possible operationally, an officer 
defaultnow 
defaultattend
defaults
default 
defaultvehicle 
defaultcrime scenes.  This has brought obvious benefits in terms of evidence gathering and public satisfaction in 
defaultrelation to this crime.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe role of defaultPdefaultolice and defaultCdefaultrime defaultPdefaultanels in holding their defaultCdefaultommissioners to accountdefault&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultThe Police and Crime Panel (the Panel) in 
defaultDorset
default is becoming an established group that holds me to account. I feel that I have received robust scrutiny over important decisions such as precept rises and fundamental changes to the Police and Crime Plan (PCP).  
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThe Panel have also requested a “spotlight focus” at each of their meetings on each of the six priorities within my PCP, in turn.  This has proved to be a useful dual purposed opportunity to scrutinise the delivery against the ambitions detailed in the PCP
default and 
defaultfor the Panel to further their understanding of the work being undertaken.  It also shows the Panel the complexities of delivery mechanisms and partnerships that exist in my world. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultThe relationship between the OPCC and the officers supporting the Panel is a professional one.  The same can be said for my relationship with the Chairman of the Panel.   We do not always agree with a proposed approach to scrutiny or the area of focus that has been requested, and th
defaultis healthy critical relationship is useful.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultThe Chief Executive and I meet monthly with the Chairman of the Panel and their lead supporting officer to have a frank exchange on the issues that are currently concerning the panel. This meeting also furthers the relationship, in a productive way, 
defaultpromoting 
defaultthe intention of Parliament of holding the PCC to account whilst still supporting the PCC in delivering the PCP on behalf of 
defaultDorset
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultI also seek to involve the Panel in a transparent way around key decisions.  For example, the Panel accepted my invitation to have an observer on the two key appointments I have made this year; my new Chief Constable and my new Chief Executive. The Panel member was a valued observer who reported back to the Panel on the process
default and 
defaulttheir view of the candidate
default. They 
defaultplayed an influential role in the Panel’s deliberations on these decisions.  
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultI have also hosted “open-days” in my office where I brief the Panel on emerging threats
default and t
defaulthe implementation of key delivery projects
default, including
default 
defaultcollaboration.  I have encouraged an open dialogue with the Panel members on issues that they would like the events to cover.  In January 2014 I will be meeting with the Panel in private to have a detailed discussion around precept proposals and the related budget.  
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultRecent debate on this relationship has raised some interesting ideas and there is one that I would particularly support: I feel that it would strengthen the role of the panel to have the leaders of local authorities as members.   
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default              
defaultThis high calibre councillor scrutiny on behalf of their authority, coupled with the resulting enhanced understanding of the ambitions I have to improve policing and the criminal justice system, would, I believe, be immensely helpful in partnership working. It would also enhance the effectiveness of the Panel, and is an idea that I would support exploring further. 
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default              
defaultOne of my biggest issues has been supporting members through the change. Many failed to understand the different and enhanced role of the PCC in relation to the old system, and training prior to the change would have been useful. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe division of functions and staff between commissioners and chief constables following the Stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011default&#xa0;default4.1
default              
defaultNeither the Chief Constable nor I desired a second stage transfer.  However, the Policing Minister’s letter of 3 July 2013 clarified that all transfer plans had to be considered against the following ‘clear principles’:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultb. 
default              
defaultt
defaulthe transfer must adhere to the principles of the Policing Protocol;
default&#xa0;
defaultc. 
default              
defaultt
defaulthe plans must set out clear roles and responsibilities between Police and Crime Commissioners and Chief Constables.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultIn addition to these requirements from Government, the Chief Constable and I strongly believed that as a matter of principle any workforce split between the two “Corporation Sole” should be kept to an absolute minimum.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultHaving reviewed the various options as detailed in the Stage 2 transfers Guidance produced by APCC, APACE and PACCTS we therefore agreed that the transfer scheme for Dorset will consist of the following elements:
default&#xa0;
defaulta.
default              
defaulta
defaultll staff, with the exception of those already employed within the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner, will transfer to the employment of the Chief Constable;
default&#xa0;
defaultb.
default              
defaultt
defaulthe transfer will follow the Cabinet Office Guidelines on Staff Transfers in the Public Sector;
default&#xa0;
defaultc.
default              
defaulta
default memorandum of understanding will operate between the two Corporation Sole to ensure effective mutual collaboration and support. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultUNISON, the Police Federation and the Superintendents Association have been engaged in the process.   
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default              
defaultI await with interest to see whether this proposal is accepted. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe role of commissioners in budget and precept settingdefault&#xa0;default5.1
default              
defaultThe PCC is the 
defaultprecepting
default and also the grant receiving body for all policing related funding. This therefore gives the PCC control over the allocation of this funding and the commissioning decisions which enables them to target funding to best meet the priorities of the Police and Crime Plan. This can be either through allocation of funding to the Police Force or through the commissioning of services. Control over allocation of funding to the Police Force strengthens the ability of the PCC to hold the Chief Constable to account for delivery of the Police and Crime Plan.
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultOne of the roles of the Police and Crime Panel is to scrutinise the budget and precept. In terms of precept setting, the PCC is required to notify the Panel of their proposed precept and for them to review and report upon it. In the first instance, the Panel has the power to veto the proposal and can ask it to be raised or lowered. The PCC has to consider this but ultimately can just make a minimal adjustment in line with the Panel’s recommendation (
defaulteg
default simply changing from 2% to 1.99% would satisfy the rules). It is right and proper that the PCC, the elected individual, has the final say. The PCC is a directly elected individual who is accountable to the public for that decision.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultIt is noticeable that some members of Police and Crime Panels are using the policing precept discussions to air the political / budgetary views of their constituent councils rather than considering the policing precept proposal on its own merit. Clearer guidance should be issued to panel members to avoid this. 
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default              
defaultThe push towards “localism” is currently impeded by the rules around council tax referendum limits. Surveys of local residents suggest significant support for precept increases in excess of the 2% limit but the cost of holding a local referendum in Dorset is estimated at around £1m making it highly prohibitive. Timing of local / national elections in May mean that they also cannot be used for the purpose of a local precept referendum. 
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default              
defaultThe transfer of Community Safety, Restorative Justice and Victims funding to the PCC is welcomed and will allow for future services to be commissioned to better meet local requirements, increasing positive outcomes whilst focussing on value for money.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultThe effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing prioritiesdefault&#xa0;default6.1
default              
defaultThe key issue for PCCs is that they have the power to influence and facilitate in areas totally untouched by Police Authorities.  I have 
defaultpicked
default up the mantl
defaulte
default to champion several “social” issues, and I 
defaultwould like
default to expand on two
default of these.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultEarly Intervention
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultWorking together with our local authorities we were successful in two of our bids to become national early intervention pilots through the Early Intervention Foundation.
default  I look forward to working alongside the Borough of Poole and Dorset County Council on these joint ventures.
default&#xa0;
defaultMental Health
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default              
defaultHundreds of people 
defaultwho experience mental ill health 
defaultare routinely taken into custody suites, and out of hours provision for 
defaultthese 
defaultpeople 
defaultwhen they are 
defaultin crisis is poor. 
default  
defaultPolice officers are routinely used as the “service of last resort”. 
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default              
defaultI led nationally for 
defaultPCCs 
defaultby 
defaultestablishing and now 
defaultchairing the 
default“PCC

defaultW

defaultG
defaultroup
default”, involving senior representatives from the Home Office, Department of Health, NHS England, MOPAC, ACPO and the Superintendents’ Association
default. 
default&#xa0;
default6.5
default              
defaultMore locally, 
defaultI have co-commissioned a mental health triage service in Dorset
default,
default 
defaultwith
default NHS England
default, who will evaluate on our behalf.
default&#xa0;
default6.6
default              
defaultI am determined to lead, where I can, to push this agenda forward.  We must reach a place where 
defaulthealth matters such as 
defaultmental 
defaultcrisis intervention should be dealt with by health professionals.
default It is crucial that there is equal parity in services for both physical and mental health. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultProgress on establishing collaboration agreements with other commissioners, polidefaultcing organisations and partnersdefault&#xa0;
default7.1
default              
defaultIn relation to PCC
defaults, the South West 
defaultis considered 
defaultto be one of the most aligned and collaborative team of PCCs nationally. We meet every six weeks, we have already approved three different collaborative ventures, and we seek more.
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default              
defaultI do a lot nationally as a PCC, which I 
defaultbelieve 
defaultdemonstrates my desire to work with all policing organisations. A summary of these roles, which build bridges across many pieces are:
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair of the PCC Mental Health Working Group
default;
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultVice Chair of 
defaultthe Official Side - 
defaultPolice Negotiating Board/ /Police Staff Council
default; Member of the 
defaultPolice Advisory
default defaultBoard
default.
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMember of the PCC Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise (VCSE) Group
default;
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMember of the PCC Transforming Rehabilitation Working Group
default;
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMember of the Association of Chief Police Officers Review Working Group
default;
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFuture Chair of 
defaultthe 
defaultIndependent Custody Visiting Association
default.
default&#xa0;
default7.3
default              
defaultIn relation to partners, my Chief Executive and I have achieved 
defaulta great deal
default in
default 
defaultbridging gaps and working with partners. 
defaultWe now 
defaultsit on the Chief Executive 
defaultand Leaders 
defaultG
defaultroup, and the pan
default-
defaultDorset 
defaultJoint Asset Management Group to 
defaultsecure collaboration by sharing buildings.
default&#xa0;
default7.4
default              
defaultI have also 
defaultcarried out
default a lot of work on 
defaultBluelight
default Collaboration in Dorset, and I have attended several national meetings with national stakeholders like Sir Ken
default 
defaultKnight, Tobias E
defaultl
defaultlwood MP and 
defaultthe Rt Hon 
defaultFrances Maude MP to drive through collaboration in an innovative and cost saving way.
default&#xa0;
default7.5
default              
defaultDorset has several initiatives underway to share buildings and services.
default  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTransparency of and repdefaultorting by commissioners to datedefault&#xa0;
default8.1
default              
defaultI inherited only half a team, mainly ex Police Authority staff, who did not appreciate how to be transparent in the way that elected officials should be. 
default  
default&#xa0;
default8.2
default              
defaultIn addition, 
defaultthe electronic processes were
default 
defaultn
defaulto
defaultt there either
default but this is now addressed
default.
default&#xa0;
default8.3
default              
defaultBut we have got there, and I am confident that 
defaultI 
defaultand the Force are now as transparent a
defaults we could be.  Indeed it was re
defaultassuring that Bernard Rix (COPACC) stated that my office is one of the best at being transparent nationally. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusiondefault&#xa0;
default9.1
default              
defaultI feel I have highlighted many positives in this submission, and I have highlighted blockages too.
default 
default I am surprised that your questioning has not focussed at all on public engagement, arguably the biggest part of a PCC
defaults role.  For democracy to be effective, it has to be visibly effective.  I attend a public forum every two weeks, hold PCC surgeries and I have recruited 
defaultsix voluntary advocates, who are my “eyes and ears” in various communities, including the older community and the Polish
default communities
default.
default&#xa0;
default9.2
default              
defaultThere is so much more that the role of the PCC can achieve, given the time, the right resources and the opportunity.  I believe I make a difference and I will continue to work hard to keep the people of Dorset safe.
default&#xa0;
default9.3
default              
defaultTo detail all of the work undertaken in the year is difficult within 3000 words and I am happy to expand on the areas above and other areas I am influencing by appearing before your Committee.
