Written evidence submitted by defaultDr Judith Freedman, Convener, defaultThe Consortium of Expert Witnesses to the Family Courtsdefault (LAI 0081)default&#xa0;
defaultI write on behalf of the nearly 600 members of the Consortium of Expert Witnesses to the Family Courts. 
defaultOur members comprise expert clinicians from a variety of disciplines that report to the Family Courts, including paediatrics, adult and child psychiatry, psychology, and independent social work. We provide professional input
default 
defaultregarding non-accidental injuri
defaultes, mental health issues within families, and child development. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough you have raised particular issues about the Governmentâ€™s proposals to restrict legal aid, 
defaultplease
default consider 
defaultthe
default 
defaulthuman rights 
defaultissues that 
defaultcurrently 
defaultare affecting children and families
default who are before the Family Courts. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis input to the
default Courts has largely disappeared for 
defaultthe 
defaultfamilies who 
defaultneed public support and no longer have it. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat is being lost is the clinical expertise and experience of senior professionals who have contributed to the working of the Family Co
defaulturts for many years. Medical specialists 
defaulthelp
default the Courts to identify non-accidental injuries, sometimes when they 
defaulta
defaultre not suspected. They 
defaulthelp
default the Courts to identify cases where non-accidental injuries 
defaulta
defaultre wrongly suspected. 
defaultWhen mental health clinicians i
defaultdentify treatable problems, families 
defaultcan be helped to
default remain together, reducing the risk of poor outcomes for a child growing up in care and the 
defaultfinancial cost to 
defaultsociety
default. Conversely, prompt mental health assessments can identify poor prognosis and high le
defaultvels of risk, reducing delay for the child and reducing cost by assisting the Court in speedy resolution of these cases.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe real victims are the children and their families who are the subjects of Family Court proceedings. They will not have the benefit 
defaultof expert clinical input to the 
defaultC
defaultourts when decisions are made about their future.
default 
defaultDecisions made without relevant and accurate evidence risk justice being undermined for children and families who cannot afford to pay privately
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI am available to discuss these matters further with you or to give evidence in person, if you wish.
