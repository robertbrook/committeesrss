Written evidence submitted by [bold]Dr Judith Freedman, Convener, [bold]The Consortium of Expert Witnesses to the Family Courts[bold] (LAI 0081)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I write on behalf of the nearly 600 members of the Consortium of Expert Witnesses to the Family Courts. 
[normal]Our members comprise expert clinicians from a variety of disciplines that report to the Family Courts, including paediatrics, adult and child psychiatry, psychology, and independent social work. We provide professional input
[normal] 
[normal]regarding non-accidental injuri
[normal]es, mental health issues within families, and child development. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Although you have raised particular issues about the Governmentâ€™s proposals to restrict legal aid, 
[normal]please
[normal] consider 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]human rights 
[normal]issues that 
[normal]currently 
[normal]are affecting children and families
[normal] who are before the Family Courts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This input to the
[normal] Courts has largely disappeared for 
[normal]the 
[normal]families who 
[normal]need public support and no longer have it. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What is being lost is the clinical expertise and experience of senior professionals who have contributed to the working of the Family Co
[normal]urts for many years. Medical specialists 
[normal]help
[normal] the Courts to identify non-accidental injuries, sometimes when they 
[normal]a
[normal]re not suspected. They 
[normal]help
[normal] the Courts to identify cases where non-accidental injuries 
[normal]a
[normal]re wrongly suspected. 
[normal]When mental health clinicians i
[normal]dentify treatable problems, families 
[normal]can be helped to
[normal] remain together, reducing the risk of poor outcomes for a child growing up in care and the 
[normal]financial cost to 
[normal]society
[normal]. Conversely, prompt mental health assessments can identify poor prognosis and high le
[normal]vels of risk, reducing delay for the child and reducing cost by assisting the Court in speedy resolution of these cases.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The real victims are the children and their families who are the subjects of Family Court proceedings. They will not have the benefit 
[normal]of expert clinical input to the 
[normal]C
[normal]ourts when decisions are made about their future.
[normal] 
[normal]Decisions made without relevant and accurate evidence risk justice being undermined for children and families who cannot afford to pay privately
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am available to discuss these matters further with you or to give evidence in person, if you wish.
