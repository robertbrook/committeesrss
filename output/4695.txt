[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Oil &amp; Gas UK is the trade association that speaks for the whole sector and is the definitive source of information about the UK upstream. It serves as the gateway to industry networks and expertise.1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Offshore helicopter operations are routinely conducted in a hostile marine environment, hence the need to ensure that high levels of flight safety are pre-requisite.1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; No other country in which the oil and gas industry operates puts more effort into improving its aviation safety performance through leadership, communication and co-operation.1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK industry recognises the importance of joined-up working and engages the workforce and trade unions in offshore helicopter safety awareness through offshore safety committees and onshore networks.1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since 1992, six fatal accidents have claimed the lives of 47 offshore workers and flight crew and there have been 18 non-fatal accidents.1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, to determine how safe offshore helicopter flights are requires an understanding of all facets of offshore helicopter flight operations and rotorcraft engineering.1.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Comparisons between the safety performances of countries should be considered in relation to the measure of success in striving to meet the primary objective of ensuring that everything that can reasonably be done to minimise the risks is being done.1.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many safety initiatives have been funded and implemented by the oil and gas industry over the past 35 years.1.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This includes projects jointly funded by oil and gas companies with the regulators (CAA and Health &amp; Safety Executive), helicopter operators and other involved organisations (e.g. National Air Traffic Service (NATS), aircraft and equipment manufacturers).1.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Helicopter Task Group (HTG) and Helicopter Safety Steering Group (HSSG) are the other oil and gas industry groups dealing with helicopter operations but they serve different purposes. 1.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since the early days in the North Sea there has been almost constant regulatory evolution. The current legislative basis for UK aviation flight operations and airworthiness are well established, of a high level, and kept under constant scrutiny by CAA.1.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As the regulatory spread of EASA continues to grow and increase its influence over UK aviation operations and airworthiness, etc. the UK Government should ensure that CAA resources and regulatory focus is properly maintained in order to reinforce CAA’s ability to continue applying high standards in UK aviation safety.1.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; HSE regulate and has the oversight for helicopter activities on offshore installations. They do this in conjunction with CAA via a Memorandum of Understanding. HSE’s offshore inspectors effectively provide oversight of safety improvements to do with helideck operations.&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Oil &amp; Gas UK is the leading representative body for the UK offshore oil and gas industry. It is a not-for-profit organisation, established in April 2007 but with a pedigree stretching back over 40 years. Membership is open to all companies active in the UK continental shelf (UKCS), from super majors to large contractor businesses and from independent oil companies to SMEs working in the supply chain. Its predecessor was the UK Offshore Operators Association (UKOOA).&#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our aim is to strengthen the long-term health of the offshore oil and gas industry in the United Kingdom by working closely with companies across the sector, governments and all other stakeholders to address the issues that affect our business.&#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Health and safety is an important part of any industry, particularly in the offshore oil and gas sector, which is classed as a major hazards industry.&#xa0;Offshore helicopter operations are routinely conducted in a hostile marine environment, hence the need to ensure that high levels of flight safety are pre-requisite.&#xa0;2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK offshore oil and gas industry is committed to continually improving safety standards for all aspects of offshore helicopter operations.&#xa0;Few other countries in which the oil and gas industry operates puts more effort into improving its aviation safety performance through leadership, communication and co-operation than the UK.&#xa0;2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Transparent reporting of UK offshore aviation safety performance, and learning from accidents and incidents, is achieved through information sharing with International and European industry aviation safety forums. The UK industry recognises the importance of joined-up working and engages the workforce and trade unions in offshore helicopter safety awareness through offshore safety committees and onshore networks.&#xa0;2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The industry operates generally within a goal setting safety regulatory framework but also adheres to the prescriptive aviation requirements that apply to offshore helicopter operations. Through the publication of robust aviation management guidelines, information dissemination, workshops and seminars, developing and delivering industry-wide initiatives and programmes and engaging with governments and other external organisations, the UKCS is widely regarded as a global exemplar of good aviation safety practice.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Reference to Section 4 in the Oil &amp; Gas UK Health &amp; Safety Report 2013 will provide details about the UKCS Offshore Helicopter Transport Safety Record up to the end of 2012. The report can be accessed at:http://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/Health_Safety_Report_2013.cfm &#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, under Supporting Documents, this web page includes Appendix 2 which provides a complete listing of the 72 reportable accidents involving helicopters serving the UK offshore oil and gas sector from 1976 to 2012.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since 1976, commercial air transport helicopter flight statistics and reportable accident data for UKCS offshore operations have been collected by the industry along with relevant reports obtained from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Mandatory Occurrence Reporting (MOR) scheme. &#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; During this 37-year period up to year-end 2012, more than 63 million passengers have been transported to and from offshore installations on the UKCS, with over 7.5 million flights made (sectors flown), consuming over 3.5 million flying hours. &#xa0;3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Regrettably, during this period, 12 fatal accidents have claimed the lives of 115 offshore workers and flight crew. There have been 60 non-fatal accidents.&#xa0;3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Health &amp; Safety Report 2013 provides a report that is representative of today’s offshore flight operations using a fleet of modern helicopters. Data from 1992 to 2012 have been used for comparative purposes. As a measure of current UKCS activity, in 2012, just over 114,000 sectors were flown, consuming 86,000 flight hours and transporting just short of a million passengers offshore. &#xa0;3.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since 1992, six fatal accidents have claimed the lives of 47 offshore workers and flight crew and there have been 18 non-fatal accidents.&#xa0;3.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Use of this statistically small data set does not determine “how safe are offshore helicopter flights”. To reach a sensible conclusion this requires a much deeper understanding of all facets of offshore helicopter flight operations and rotorcraft engineering.&#xa0;3.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Most important when assessing aircraft technical failures is to recognise that for helicopter types used globally in the same role, a major component failure resulting in a crash or ditching (as identified by the AAIB in their reports into the Eurocopter AS332L2 [G-REDL] fatal accident in 2009 and two Eurocopter EC225 accidents [G-REDW and G-CHCN] in 2012), could have occurred anywhere in the world; regardless of where the helicopter was being flown, over land or sea.&#xa0;3.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Indeed, when offshore helicopter accident rates on the UKCS are compared with the International Oil &amp; Gas Producers Association (OGP) Aviation Safety Committee’s (ASC) worldwide fatal and non-fatal reportable accident rates for the period 1995 to 2010 the data indicates that, averaged over this time, offshore helicopter operations on the UKCS carry significantly less risk than operations elsewhere in the world.&#xa0;

[[[Comparison of Fatal and Non-Fatal Reportable Accident Rates, 1995 to 2010]]]&#xa0;3.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This important observation in the context of the UKCS helicopter safety record is independently supported by reference to Table 7.2 - Overview over helicopter accidents in the North Sea (and Canada) in the period 1999-2009 on page 88 in the Norwegian SINTEF Helicopter Safety Study 3, dated 22 March 2010; which explains why or why not the listed accidents could have occurred in the Norwegian sector at the same time. http://www.norskoljeoggass.no/en/Activities/HSE-and-operation/Helicopter-safety-/  &#xa0;3.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Paragraph 7.3.6 in the SINTEF Report compares the Norwegian and UK sectors and says, “It is striking that the UK sector had ten accidents while Norway only had one accident in the period 1999-2009, with comparable amounts of person flight hours. All fatalities in the North Sea during the period have also occurred in the UK sector. The statistics show a significantly different development between the UK and Norwegian sectors from the previous period. The analysis has shown, however, that all accidents, in principal also could have occurred in Norway. This indicates that our low accident rate in the period could be a random result; this is also supported by sensitivity analyses”.&#xa0;3.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Equally, when assessing outcomes from these accidents, it is very important to remember that the 100% survival rate for the two (2) helicopters that ditched in 2012 (33 people involved) was attributable to the outstanding skills of the two flight crews, relatively calm weather conditions, the quality and effectiveness of passengers’ survival training and the aircraft and personal safety equipment provided.&#xa0;3.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The AS332L2 non-fatal ditching accident whilst on the approach to BP ETAP in February 2009 [G-REDU] was attributed by AAIB largely to flight crew perceptual and procedural issues in the final approach. There was no loss of life and the 18 people involved were all rescued.&#xa0;3.15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the absence of completed investigations and a report by AAIB, it is inappropriate for Oil &amp; Gas UK to comment in detail or speculate about outcomes from the AS332L2 [G-WNSB] fatal accident off Sumburgh on 23 August 2013. &#xa0;3.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, AAIB published a Special Bulletin (S7-2013) on 18 October 2013 which states that “no evidence of a technical fault with G-WNSB has been found that could have been causal to the accident”. This finding resulted in the AS332L2 being allowed to return to offshore service; following the prompt and collective oil and gas industry decision (including Trades Union representatives) on 24 August to temporarily withdraw the Super Puma helicopter type (all variants) from service.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A key reason for the UK having a better safety record in relation to helicopter operations relative to other countries is that many parts of the world lack the regulatory, management and equipment sophistication when compared with the UK.&#xa0;4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Also, on the UKCS, helicopter operations are conducted in a hostile marine environment exclusively with two-engine, two-pilot operations. Whereas, for example, in the US Gulf Coast region there are a large number of small, single-engine helicopter and single-pilot operations conducted in relatively benign marine environments and a variety of onshore environments.&#xa0;4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; When attempting to make UKCS aviation safety comparisons with other North Sea states it should be noted that the UK has the largest helicopter fleet size and significantly higher rates of utilisation and passengers carried (e.g. twice the flight hours flown in Norway).&#xa0;4.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Further, the other North Sea helicopter operations are principally conducted by subsidiaries of the same helicopter companies that provide the bulk of helicopter services on the UKCS; generally working to the same aviation rules (e.g. JAR-Ops 3), operating, maintenance and flight safety requirements / guidelines, pilot and engineer training regimes, etc.&#xa0;4.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ultimately, comparisons between the safety performances of countries should be considered in relation to the measure of success in striving to meet the primary objective of ensuring that everything that can reasonably be done to minimise the risks is being done. As outlined elsewhere in this submission, we believe that the UK has been and remains a global leader in helicopter safety.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is not unreasonable to say that having invested very heavily in replacing an ageing fleet of helicopters on the UKCS with the very latest technology rotorcraft available in the global marketplace, UK helicopter operators and the oil and gas companies alike are shocked and dismayed by the severity and outcomes of the accidents, in the past four years.&#xa0;5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Appendix 3 of the Oil &amp; Gas UK Health &amp; Safety Report 2013 referred to in paragraph 3.1 provides a full and detailed list of industry-led safety initiatives and CAA research projects. The Appendix can be accessed at:http://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/Health_Safety_Report_2013.cfm&#xa0;5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Oil &amp; Gas UK Aviation Safety Technical Group (ASTG) and its predecessor, UKOOA Aircraft Committee, have a long history of taking the initiative and aggressively driving forward projects to improve offshore helicopter safety.&#xa0;5.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Having identified routine and sometimes unusual operational and technical issues and discovered problems that require resolution, along with learning from the hard lessons arising from fatal and non-fatal accidents and incidents, many safety initiatives have been funded and implemented by the oil and gas industry over the past 35 years. &#xa0;5.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This includes a long list of research projects which are often jointly funded by oil and gas companies with the regulators (CAA and Health &amp; Safety Executive), helicopter operators and other involved organisations (e.g. National Air Traffic Service (NATS), aircraft and equipment manufacturers).&#xa0;5.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; UKOOA Aircraft Committee was initially formed by a group comprised of aviation specialists from oil and gas companies and in the mid-1990s this group was opened up to include senior representatives from the regulators, agencies and helicopter operators. &#xa0;5.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This composition remains today in the Oil &amp; Gas UK ASTG. Hard won experience of working together to jointly solve problems and implement new ways of doing business in a challenging and hostile marine environment continues today and is the foundation for continuous improvement.&#xa0;5.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Helicopter Task Group (HTG) and Helicopter Safety Steering Group (HSSG) are the other oil and gas industry groups dealing with helicopter operations but they serve different purposes. &#xa0;5.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; HTG was initially formed as the body tasked to focus on oil and gas industry responses to the 2009 fatal helicopter accident. HTG was formed as a multi-agency working group comprising executive and senior representatives from Oil &amp; Gas UK, oil and gas companies, the offshore contractors, the helicopter operators, CAA, HSE, Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency, Grampian Police, Trades Unions (RMT, Unite and BALPA) and the offshore workforce.&#xa0;5.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; HTG had full executive authority to maintain collective overview by all the stakeholders of the accident investigation outcomes and respond promptly to Air Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) findings and recommendations; along with reviewing all the activities to do with providing accident victims family support, management of the emergency response, robustness of aviation management guidelines and workforce communications, etc.&#xa0;5.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To work quickly and effectively when problems had been identified and solutions were being sought, HTG had full authority to initiate research and other studies to improve offshore helicopter safety. It did this in several areas such as pressing the aircraft manufacturers to develop (from a research project) and implement Advanced Anomaly Detection (as production AAD systems) to enhance the performance of Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) for improved fault detection in the major dynamic components (e.g. main rotor gearboxes and transmission). Furthermore, since 2012, all workers flying offshore have been provided with personal locator beacons, tested to a CAA standard.&#xa0;5.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Subsequently, after the HTG’s role of oversight of the 2009 accident came to a logical end it was decided to continue the valuable work that had been done to improve workforce communication and engagement on helicopter passenger safety under a new group, the HSSG, within the industry lead safety body, Step Change in Safety.&#xa0;5.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Following the 2012 / 13 accidents HSSG immediately undertook a similar role to HTG to provide collective industry responses and provide the conduit for workforce communications and engagement. &#xa0;5.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, HSSG membership has become unwieldy in recent times so, HTG has been re-established as a small executive management oversight group and HSSG has reverted to its previous role.&#xa0;5.15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ASTG continues to focus on resolving a wide range of technical and operational issues, progressing solutions and further developing and refining Aviation Management Guidelines in conjunction with all the stakeholders. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is already an abundance of legislation and regulations relating to offshore helicopter operations.&#xa0;6.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since the early days in the North Sea there has been almost constant regulatory evolution. The current legislative basis for UK aviation flight operations and airworthiness are well established, of a high level, and kept under constant scrutiny by CAA.&#xa0;7.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As the regulatory spread of EASA continues to grow and increase its influence over UK aviation operations and airworthiness, etc. the UK Government should ensure that CAA resources and regulatory focus is properly maintained in order to reinforce CAA’s ability to continue applying high standards in UK aviation safety.&#xa0;7.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A key to future offshore helicopter safety improvements is for the UK to retain the well-established high level of flight operations requirements, airworthiness requirements and regulatory scrutiny by CAA; regardless of the Directives issued by European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).&#xa0;7.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; EASA is seeking a baseline regulatory standard to satisfy all European states and in so doing is in danger of diluting the ‘gold standard’ that has been an overriding objective in the UK, since the early days of aviation. &#xa0;7.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CAA is at the forefront of ensuring that UK aviation activities conducted by the offshore helicopter Air Operators Certificate (AOC) Holders working in the UK remains safe. Likewise, for oversight of airworthiness and air traffic services.&#xa0;7.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; HSE regulates and has the oversight for helicopter activities on offshore installations. They do this in conjunction with CAA via a Memorandum of Understanding. HSE’s offshore inspectors effectively provide oversight of safety improvements to do with helideck operations.&#xa0;7.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is not immediately apparent that EASA responds vigorously or in a timely manner to the many recommendations that have made in AAIB reports into recent offshore accidents. For instance, there is little evidence of EASA progress with the 13 (of 27) safety recommendations put forward in the report of the AS332L2 non-fatal ditching accident in 2009 [G-REDU].&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
