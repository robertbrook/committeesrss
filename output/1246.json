"&#xa0;\nJoint written evidence submitted by Professor Sue Black, Dr Jonathan Mendel, and Dr Hauke Riesch (WSC003)&#xa0;It is widely accepted that w\nomen are\n significantly\n under-represented throughout \nScience, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (\nSTEM\n)\n based subjects\n.\n \nFrom \nsecondary school level\n and onwards what \nBlickenstaff\n \n(2005) \ndescribes as “layers in a sex-based filter”\n,\n \nor what the Committee refer\ns\n to as a ‘leaky pipeline\n’,\n \nsystematically and disproportionately \nremove\ns women from \nSTEM\n subjects\n.\n \nIn\n direct and stark contrast with this\n,\n however, i\nt \nis well recognised and accepted\n that women \npredominate\n in forensic science\n \nin ways \nthat are \natypical \nof the pattern\ns\n seen in\n all\n other\n STEM subjects\n.\n \nHouck (2009\n) \nobserves\n a situation where “the percentage \nof females \n(\non US forensic science degrees\n)\n was\n \n78%\n when\n the average percentage of females for non-forensic science bachelor’s degrees range\nd\n from\n only\n 32% to 47%”.\n \nAlthough under-researched, the situation seems to be even more dramatic in\n the\n UK forensic anthropology \ncommunity\n.\n \nFor example, \nin the 10 years that the \nundergraduate forensic anthropology degree \nhas been offered \nat Dundee University\n,\n \nit \nhas alway\ns \nattracted\n over 75% female students \nand \nin some years\n \nthis has risen to \nover 90%\n femal\ne representation\n.\n&#xa0;\nTh\ne\n situation \nin forensic science \nhas led to the suggestion that \nthe subject\n might be “\na Gateway for Women in Science\n” (Houck 2009)\n and t\nhe unusual demographics \ndisplayed \nin forensic anthropology \nmay \noffer a\nn even\n more focussed opportuni\nty to interrogate\n and exploit the potential for\n this unusual pattern as we attempt to understand this \nwell\n-\nrecognised, but little understood, \nreverse gender bias phenomenon\n.\n \nThat this is an international situation is borne out by the fact that \nwomen \nform\n t\nhe majority of\n forensic\n laboratory staff \nin the US \n(Houck 2009\n)\n and in the UK\n, the \nBritish Association for Forensic Anthropology \nhas confirmed that it \ncurrently has 102 female members and only 44 males\n - a ratio of nearly 2.5:1\n.\n \nInterestingly, \ndespite an i\nncreasing focus on addressing gender inequalities in S\nTEM (\nfor example, as part of the Athena Swan Programme)\n, forensic science has been curiously\n overlooked\n as a possible template for a solution\n and\n,\n in this, we \nbelieve that we may \nhave missed a golden \nopportunity\n.\n&#xa0;\nW\ne do know that f\norensic anthropology offers \nclear \nevidence\n to falsify the common (though weakly-evidenced) claim that under-representation of women in STEM is down to\n lower ‘natural’ ability levels\n.\n \nForensic anthropology \nis an especially use\nful \nand powerful \nexample\n,\n as it \ndemands rigorous,\n robust and defensible science that is tested in the adversarial arena of the UK judicial courts on a daily basis.\n \nA recent audit undertaken by the British Association for Forensic Anthropology showed that\n,\n \nof those forens\nic anthropologists who\n \nregularly\n defend their science in court, \nover\n 80% are female\n – suggesting that the ‘leaky pipeline’ has been \nfirmly \nplugged in this STEM science\n.\n \nIf women are able to progress notably \nwell\n in one \nchallenging \nbranch of \nSTEM, it becomes harder to argue that there is any intrinsic reason why they cannot do so in others.\n&#xa0;\nF\norensic anthropology in the UK \nmay therefore offer\n \nstrong indicators\n for possible solution\ns to the \n‘leaky pipeline’\n in other STEM subjects\n. I\nt may have s\nome lessons that could be learned \nand best practice that could be adopted \nto \nperhaps \nreverse\n,\n or at least \nslow down,\n the \nway this ‘leaky pipeline’ affects \nwomen entering, remaining and progressing in STEM subjects\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nReferences:\nBlikenstaff\n, J.C.\n \n(2005).\n \nWomen and science careers: Leady pipeline or gender filter?\n \nGender and Education 17(4): 369-386.\n&#xa0;\nHouck, M.\n \n(2009).\n \nIs forensic science a gateway for women in science?\n \nForensic Science Policy and Management 1(1): 65-69.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
