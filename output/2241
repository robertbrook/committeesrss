defaultAvailability of facilities for training and playing sport, for both girls and women, at both elite and grassroots levels.default&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFacilities continue to be a problem on a number of fronts and in particular for women and girls. These start with the very nature of the design of facilities and in particular where changing room provision is concerned.  On a lot of occasions facilities are designed without due care and attention to what needs female sports participants have. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf you take the Sport England Guidance for example on Pavilions and Clubhouses and in particular changing room design it does not lend itself to attracting more women and girls in to playing sport. Greater attention should be given to the needs of female participants. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default Secondary school changing rooms are probably the last place on earth that a young female 11 – 16 years old would like to be seen in. Often open plan changing rooms at a time in their life when they probably would welcome more privacy. Lack of vanity provision is a problem when their role models are more likely to be from the pop or fashion world than the world of sport. These are just 2 examples of facility design that continue to be a common problem.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default Programming of sports facilities is a key concern in that the demand for sports facilities is far greater from males and male dominated sports than it is for females. The providers are not driven by equality of opportunity and a fair proportion of time dedicated to growing female sports participation. They are generally more concerned about generating the income and the bottom line. The current climate as also resulted in the public sector mentality shifting towards being a more commercially driven animal. In the past leisure centers would have happily provided a badminton court for 4 females. However that would now not happen at the expense of a potential 5 a-side booking that would bring in more income.
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultYou might think that when performing at an elite level that access to facilities is easier for our elite women athletes. We have examples in Leicester that due to financial pressures that one of our hockey facilities was converted into a more commercially orientated 5 aside cash 
defaultcow
default. This resulted in our elite women’s hockey team that consisted of 4 Olympians having to leave the City boundaries and try and establish their routes in the leafy suburbs of the County at the local Grammar School. Even here as a female stand alone sports club they are perceived as being down the order of importance when it comes to the operation and programming of the facilities.         
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile facilities are only the enabler to growing female sports participation we need to be doing more. Where we have facilities we should be working with providers to ensure inclusion is part of their business planning. 
default2.0 default              defaultFinance, including sponsorship and prize moneydefault2.1
default              
defaultThe lack of financial clout on a number of fronts is the fundamental problem as to why women’s sport will always take a back seat. Unfortunately the only element that gets anywhere near a debate is the financial purse at Wimbledon for the women’s winner in comparison to that of the men’s winner. The argument regarding the fact the men have to play more sets is ridiculous and this is something that we should be striving to lead the way with and offer the same financial incentives through both the men’s and the women’s draw.
default2.2  
default              
defaultPrize money is only part of the problem. If you unpick the distribution of public sports funding (Lottery and exchequer) and the equality of distribution amongst sports you will find that female dominated sports like hockey and netball are way down the list in terms of the finances their respective Governing Bodies receive. This is largely due to the fact that their market is harder to reach than the more male dominated sports and they are realistic about the number of participants they can attract. This unfortunately creates a knock on effect to the amount of funding they receive. Greater allowance should be given by Government and Sport England to realise that women like it or not are a harder audience to attract in to sport. Rather than diluting the funding these Governing Bodies receive they should be given more funding due to their market being more difficult.
default2.3
default              
defaultSport England’s £500 million worth of funding distributed to Governing Bodies of Sport should have come with some criteria round women’s participation. Instead they have suggested that 60% of this funding needs to be directed towards 16 – 24 year olds playing more sport. This needed to go a step further and suggest that a percentage of the funding should have been focussed on women and girls of this age.
default2.4
default              
defaultIt raises the question as to whether we need more females in high profile administrative roles when it comes to sport. An extremely low percentage of Board positions within National Governing Bodies of Sport are held by women. 
defaultSomething that must be addressed urgently.
default2.4
default              
defaultSponsorship for females participating in sport is extremely difficult to come by unless you are a Jess Ennis or a Serina Williams. Basically you not only have to be elite you have to be the best in the world to attract the interest of commercial sponsorship. This is largely due to the lack of media exposure that women’s sports receive. Sponsoring a female sports star is not going to raise the profile of your brand when TV cameras and newspaper photographers are very really seen anywhere near a hockey or netball fixture even at international level. 
default2.5
default              
defaultWhen sponsorship deals do materialise for females it tends to be for the individuals competing in sport and not for team sports. The Forbes magazine confirms this with their demonstration of the highest paid sports women. The top 10 paid sports women all play individual sports with 7 coming from the world of tennis. The disappointing factor though is that on closer inspection only 3 of those 10 women make the top 100 paid sports people list according to Forbes Magazine.   
default2.6
default              
defaultWe have a long way to go in terms of equality when it comes to our female sports people and there are a number of factors that need to be considered to create a level playing field with their male counter parts.
default&#xa0;
default3.0default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMedia coveragedefault&#xa0;default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat other subject demands as much media coverage as sport. Heavily dominated by male sport and in particular football, female sport struggles to get anywhere near the back page or the main TV channels unless it is a Kelly Holmes or a Becky Adlington winning double Olympic gold medals. 
default3.2
default              
defaultThe 4 year cycle of the Olympic Games is the only time a camera comes anywhere near female sport apart from the annual Wimbledon fortnight.
default3.3
default              
defaultHow are we expected to turn more and more young girls on to sport without the equivalent exposure to that of the male dominated sports?
default3.4
default              
defaultOur TVs and the endless broadcasting corporations are now creating opportunities to view sport 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Surely there must be available air time for one of the big 3 (Sky, Virgin or BT Sport) to dedicate a channel to women’s sport. While this may be optimistic thinking it would be advantageous for one of them to take this leap of faith.
default3.5
default              
defaultWe continue to produce excellent female role models that you would hope would attract the media attention they deserve for being good at their sport. However the unfortunate nature of the media coverage of female sport results in the fact that our most decorated gymnast Beth Tweddle’s major media coverage as come largely through reality TV and dancing on ice.
default4.0default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultReasons why participation in sport by women decreases default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important to recognise that the foundations of the problem when it comes to females participating in sport start way before girls become women. While participation may be generally the same between boys and girls in early years it does not take long until the problem kicks in. A growing gender gap emerges in the final years of primary education and is reinforced at secondary school. At year 4 of primary school, about two-thirds of girls and boys are doing the recommended amount of physical activity. However, by year 6, far fewer girls are doing so (39% meeting the target, against 73% of boys). 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese disappointing figures are not because girls are opposed to physical activity per se. 
default Girls generally want to do more physical activity
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe collapse in girl’s participation in sport is down 
defaultto a number reasons
default some of which have been discussed earlier including the lack of media exposure for our excellent female sports stars / role models.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default Peer group pressure where girls are concerned is even stronger and the need to conform to the latest fashion icon or pop star. While getting sweaty through sport in the male world is acknowledged in a positive way by peers unfortunately this is not the same for girls. This a longstanding cultural issue that until attitudes and behaviours are transformed and individuals recognise that you can still be feminine and good at sport the battle will continue
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA large percentage of girls will say that they participate in sport and physical activity due to the outcome it delivers of maintaining a certain weight and body image. Why this is a 
defaultpositive it can also be a negative in that you would like to hear girls say that they participate in sport because they enjoy it and they are good at it. 
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInevitably once girls do become adults the pressure on time becomes even more difficult. Juggling a career with family life and leisure time is not easy and generally the first thing to go will be their own participation in sport or physical activity often to accommodate others.
default&#xa0;
default4.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEven in adult life some of the barriers that exist in teenage years continue to exist like being too self conscious, lack of confidence and women still continue to be more concerned about body image than men.
default&#xa0;
default4.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe key to resolving this spiral of decline is to continue and inspire females, to then convert that inspiration into participation which in turn will result in perspiration. Inspiration to Participation to Perspiration is not only for men.  
default&#xa0;
default5.0default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe variety of sports on offer to girls at schooldefault&#xa0;default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSchool is the environment where we have a chance to start and change the mindset of young females. This is not a quick win situation and like with any school sport policy it needs long term cross party and cross departmental commitment to creating a cultural change to how PE and School Sport is delivered.
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default At present if asked a large percentage of girls would suggest that PE and School sport is reserved for the sporty and talented kids. On the basis of this it is extremely important that the variety of sports on offer in schools is appealing to both sexes. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt New College Leicester we are extremely conscious of this and not only do we deliver an enriched diverse PE curriculum that caters for all boys and girls we also provide extra-curricular activities of the same nature. We engage external partners who bring with them excellent role models the likes of Leicester Ladies Hockey Club and their Olympians who clearly demonstrate that you can still be feminine and 
defaultbe
default an elite sportswomen. We are extremely keen to engage more female clubs to provide school club links, but sourcing female clubs is not easy in a community sport world that continues to be dominated by male sports and clubs 
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGone should be the days of the PE knickers and girls should feel comfortable in their attire and not having to conform to the latest state of the art sports gear. Here at New College we have a uniform policy that includes a fit for purpose PE uniform for both boys and girls. 
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe generally provide single sex PE lessons to enable the girls to participate without the intrusion of overly competitive boys. We have a mixed PE team of both males and females all extremely passionate about providing a diverse sporting offer. 
default&#xa0;
default5.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe new Government School sport Policy of providing primary schools with a sport resource (Primary School Sports Premium) is a concern we have challenged. While we welcome the ring fencing of Government funding we are concerned about the lack of criteria associated with that. 
default&#xa0;
default5.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf Mr Gove would listen to me I would suggest 
default&#xa0;
defaultAny policy needs targets. Just saying “increase competition” will not wash. I think maybe a SMART goal-setting training course for Mr Gove would help our current system. We must 
defaulthave national expectations, not just for PE but also for school sport and participation in general which includes targets for girls.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultA support structure of highly competent people to manage the system needs to be in place. A regular comment from primary teachers for the past ten years has been “We don’t have the time” and I would add that many also do not possess the skills to implement their own PE and sport programmes without someone to support and drive towards national targets. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo ensure the health, wellbeing and future sport participation of children in this country we have to take politics away from school sport. Mr Gove aside, all political parties would appear in general to want to increase participation, improve competitive opportunities and ensure staff are trained and supported to deliver great PE and sport with suitable extra-curricular provision. A ten-year vision for PE and school sport is needed, a vision that is refreshed every three years as needed. We must continue to fund this area as it will never be sustainable within a school without direction and clarity regarding targets. Certainly cutting PE and school sport funding has had a devastating effect on participation rates in both the curriculum and extra-curriculum sport just in two years. 
default    
default&#xa0;
default5.8
default              
defaultCurrently let down by the lack of recognised Government school sport strategy, vision and organisation to drive school sport each and every school will be left to fend for itself. This is extremely worrying in the battle to continue and encourage more girls to participate within sport. The saving grace is organisations like the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation, The Youth Sports Trust and The Association for Physical Education all of which are hugely experienced in the Physical Education needs of children and young people and in particular girls.
