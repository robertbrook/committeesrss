defaultWritten evidence from Michelle Levy (TIC 077)
default&#xa0;
defaultMy name is Michelle Levy and I am writing with regard to the new committee set up to deal with the problem of public transport in rural communites, 'passengers transport in isolated communites'. My community/village is one of those.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default I live in a village in north Cornwall called St. Newlyn East it's located 4 miles from Newquay yet it might as well be in outerspace the way our local government views it.
default&#xa0;
default There is a major road, the 3075 which divides our village which
default&#xa0;
default when coming from 
defaultNewquay is on the
default&#xa0;
defaultleft while two villages Cubert and Crantock which is on the right side of this main road enjoy a better bus service then we do.
default&#xa0;
default There buses run every half hour and they also enjoy an evening service up to mid-night and also a Sunday serv
defaultice while our village has only an hourly service finishing at 1645 from Newquay and from Truro 1810.
default&#xa0;
default We do not have even a Sunday bus service and our village is the same size if not bigger then the two above mentioned villages.
default&#xa0;
default There is also a similar bu
defaults service which runs from Mitcheal a village only 2 miles from ours.
default&#xa0;
default They in fact have two different bus companies serving them and they too enjoy an evening and Sunday service.
default&#xa0;
default And they are much smaller then oursleves.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default There is even a bus service in Z
defaultela a little hamlet with less then a quarter of the popluation then Newlyn
default&#xa0;
defaultEast.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default They in fact have a bus service every half hour.
default&#xa0;
defaultI think it disgusting that we as concil tax payers should have to pay concil tax to subsidise these villages that enjoy a m
defaultuch better service then we do.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey say our route is not viabley commercial, well neither is
default&#xa0;
defaultthe other villages.
default&#xa0;
default The only time Cubert and Crantock are busy
default&#xa0;
defaultis in the summer months of
default&#xa0;
defaultJune, July and August.
default&#xa0;
default The rest of the year they get the same amount o
defaultf people getting on them as we do yet there service never alters.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany times the early buses do not turn up-they are supposed to start the service going to
default&#xa0;
defaultTruro
default&#xa0;
defaultfrom our village at 0710.
default&#xa0;
default Yet on several occasions the 0710, 0810 and the 0910 never turned 
defaultup and there
default&#xa0;
defaultwere people waiting to get to work, college, doctors and dentist appointment and even jury duty.
default&#xa0;
default Many young people have left our village because
default&#xa0;
defaultwhen they get
default&#xa0;
defaulta job they have to leave it or else they are sacked because they
default&#xa0;
defaultcan't get to work 
defaulton time.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat the use of having a bus service which cannot be relied on.
default&#xa0;
default A timetable
default&#xa0;
defaultis a legal contract between the passenger and the bus company.
default&#xa0;
default They can't just say they don't have a bus to put on because then they become in breach of contract.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultfares to get to Truro are £4.50 for an adult and around £2.90 for a child.
default&#xa0;
default If a young mothert had to go shopping in the city she would have to pay £7.40 just to pick up the essentials and she is not even sure that a bus will turn up to take her!!
default&#xa0;
defaultI am a 
defaultpensioner and
default&#xa0;
defaultI have to wait on
default&#xa0;
default1010 bus, but many times this bus doesn't turn up or if it does turn
default&#xa0;
defaultup it's full.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default They give priorty to the people in Newquay.
default&#xa0;
default The bus company wouldn't even think to save maybe five spaces for us.
default&#xa0;
default I once asked an offical
default&#xa0;
defaultwho works for Western Greyhound the bus company that servies our village, why don't they do this so atleast some of us would have a change to get on the bus
default&#xa0;
defaultand there answer was that the people at Newquay would then have to wait another 45 minutes for a b
defaultus well what about us, we would have to wait for an hour!
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default But he didn't seem to care.
default&#xa0;
default Why should he, he lives in Newquay.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI was waiting for the 1010 to show up
default&#xa0;
defaultand when it did it was full.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere were 9 people plus myself waiting to get on the bus.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultIt was a freezing morning in March
default&#xa0;
default most of the people waiting were between 70-85 years of age and one man had to make a hospital appointemt to be examined for an empending heart operation.
default&#xa0;
default This man was inferm
default&#xa0;
defaultand had trouble standing up for too long even
default with a can you can see he was shaking from the strain of standing up and waiting for this bus.
default&#xa0;
default You could tell he was in pain but he was old and sick and too tired to fight the bus company so he turned and walked away stooped, dejected. 
default&#xa0;
default Probably going h
defaultome to
default&#xa0;
defaultcall the hospital and tell them he can't
default&#xa0;
defaultmake his appointment again because he had to cancel the week
default&#xa0;
defaultbefore for the same reason.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is not an islocated insident it happens on a regular basis.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultPEOPLE DEPEND ON THE BUSES TO GET TO WORK, COLLE
defaultGE, ATTEND DOCTOR AND HOSPITAL APPOINTMENT AND EVEN JURY DUTY.
default&#xa0;
default THE PEOPLE HERE HAVE A LIFE AND THE BUS COMPANY IS DESTROYING IT FOR MANY.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default OUR YOUNG PEOPLE CANNOT TAKE JOBS AND ARE FORCED TO LEAVE TO VILLAGE.
default&#xa0;
default WHEN BUSES DON'T TURN UP PEOPLE ARE FORCED T
defaultO TAKE TAXIES AND FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GET REIMBURED BY THE BUS COMPANIES.
