[normal]Written evidence from Michelle Levy (TIC 077)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My name is Michelle Levy and I am writing with regard to the new committee set up to deal with the problem of public transport in rural communites, 'passengers transport in isolated communites'. My community/village is one of those.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I live in a village in north Cornwall called St. Newlyn East it's located 4 miles from Newquay yet it might as well be in outerspace the way our local government views it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There is a major road, the 3075 which divides our village which
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] when coming from 
[normal]Newquay is on the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]left while two villages Cubert and Crantock which is on the right side of this main road enjoy a better bus service then we do.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There buses run every half hour and they also enjoy an evening service up to mid-night and also a Sunday serv
[normal]ice while our village has only an hourly service finishing at 1645 from Newquay and from Truro 1810.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We do not have even a Sunday bus service and our village is the same size if not bigger then the two above mentioned villages.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There is also a similar bu
[normal]s service which runs from Mitcheal a village only 2 miles from ours.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] They in fact have two different bus companies serving them and they too enjoy an evening and Sunday service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] And they are much smaller then oursleves.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There is even a bus service in Z
[normal]ela a little hamlet with less then a quarter of the popluation then Newlyn
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]East.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] They in fact have a bus service every half hour.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I think it disgusting that we as concil tax payers should have to pay concil tax to subsidise these villages that enjoy a m
[normal]uch better service then we do.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They say our route is not viabley commercial, well neither is
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the other villages.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The only time Cubert and Crantock are busy
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]is in the summer months of
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]June, July and August.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The rest of the year they get the same amount o
[normal]f people getting on them as we do yet there service never alters.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many times the early buses do not turn up-they are supposed to start the service going to
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Truro
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]from our village at 0710.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Yet on several occasions the 0710, 0810 and the 0910 never turned 
[normal]up and there
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]were people waiting to get to work, college, doctors and dentist appointment and even jury duty.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Many young people have left our village because
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]when they get
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a job they have to leave it or else they are sacked because they
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]can't get to work 
[normal]on time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What the use of having a bus service which cannot be relied on.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] A timetable
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]is a legal contract between the passenger and the bus company.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] They can't just say they don't have a bus to put on because then they become in breach of contract.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]fares to get to Truro are £4.50 for an adult and around £2.90 for a child.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] If a young mothert had to go shopping in the city she would have to pay £7.40 just to pick up the essentials and she is not even sure that a bus will turn up to take her!!
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am a 
[normal]pensioner and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have to wait on
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1010 bus, but many times this bus doesn't turn up or if it does turn
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]up it's full.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] They give priorty to the people in Newquay.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The bus company wouldn't even think to save maybe five spaces for us.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I once asked an offical
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]who works for Western Greyhound the bus company that servies our village, why don't they do this so atleast some of us would have a change to get on the bus
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and there answer was that the people at Newquay would then have to wait another 45 minutes for a b
[normal]us well what about us, we would have to wait for an hour!
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] But he didn't seem to care.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Why should he, he lives in Newquay.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I was waiting for the 1010 to show up
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and when it did it was full.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There were 9 people plus myself waiting to get on the bus.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]It was a freezing morning in March
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] most of the people waiting were between 70-85 years of age and one man had to make a hospital appointemt to be examined for an empending heart operation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This man was inferm
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and had trouble standing up for too long even
[normal] with a can you can see he was shaking from the strain of standing up and waiting for this bus.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] You could tell he was in pain but he was old and sick and too tired to fight the bus company so he turned and walked away stooped, dejected. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Probably going h
[normal]ome to
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]call the hospital and tell them he can't
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]make his appointment again because he had to cancel the week
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]before for the same reason.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is not an islocated insident it happens on a regular basis.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]PEOPLE DEPEND ON THE BUSES TO GET TO WORK, COLLE
[normal]GE, ATTEND DOCTOR AND HOSPITAL APPOINTMENT AND EVEN JURY DUTY.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] THE PEOPLE HERE HAVE A LIFE AND THE BUS COMPANY IS DESTROYING IT FOR MANY.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] OUR YOUNG PEOPLE CANNOT TAKE JOBS AND ARE FORCED TO LEAVE TO VILLAGE.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] WHEN BUSES DON'T TURN UP PEOPLE ARE FORCED T
[normal]O TAKE TAXIES AND FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GET REIMBURED BY THE BUS COMPANIES.
