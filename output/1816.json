"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Science Council (WSC086)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Women in the wider STEM workforce&#xa0;\n“Good practice benefits al\nl, staff and students, men and women. However, bad practice adversely affects women’s careers more than men’s.”\n“The age profile of the department, and the diversity of its staff, makes a difference. Young men and women with families have different expectations \nand needs from their older colleagues. Those younger staff members’ careers (and their science) cannot thrive unless the working culture of the department reflects the reality of dual career partnerships.”\nPrinciple 1:\nA robust organisational framework to deliver equality of opportunity and reward.\nPrinciple 2: \n              \nAppointment, promotion and selection processes and procedures that encourage men and women to apply for academic posts at all levels.\nPrinciple 3\n:\nDepartmental structures and systems that enable men and women to progress and continue in their careers.\nPrinciple 4: \n              \nDepartmental organisation, structure, management arrangements and culture that are open, inclusive and transparent and encourage the \nparticipation of all staff.\nPrinciple 5: \n              \nFlexible approaches and provisions that encompass the working day, the working year and a working life and enable individuals, at all career and life stages, to maximise their contribution to mathematics, their d\nepartment and institution.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\nAppendix 1\n&#xa0;\nMember Bodies of the Science Council - August 2013 &#xa0;\nAssociation for Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine\nAssociation of Neurophysiological Scientists \nAssociation for Science Education \nBritish Academy of Audiology \nBritish Association of Sport and Exercise Science \nBritish Computer Society\nBritish Psychological Society \nBritish Society of Soil Scientists\nChartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management \nCollege of Podiatry \nEnergy Institute\nGeological Society of London \nInstitute of Biomedical Science \nInstitute of Brewing and Distilling\nInstitute of Corrosion \nInstitute of Food Science and Tech\nnology \nInstitute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology \nInstitute of Materials, Minerals and Mining \nInstitute of Mathematics and its Applications \nInstitute of Measurement and Control \nInstitute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine \nInstitute o\nf Physics \nInstitute of Science and Technology \nInstitute of Water\nInstitution of Chemical Engineers \nInstitution of Environmental Sciences \nLondon Mathematical Society \nMineralogical Society \nNuclear Institute \nOil and Colour Chemists’ Association\nOperati\nonal Research Society \nPhysiological Society \nRoyal Astronomical Society \nRoyal Meteorological Society \nRoyal Society of Chemistry \nRoyal Statistical Society \nSociety for Cardiological Science and Technology \nSociety for General Microbiology \nSociety of \nBiology\nSociety of Dyers &amp; Colourists \nThe\n&#xa0;\nOrganisation\n&#xa0;\nfor Professionals\n&#xa0;\nin Regulatory\n&#xa0;\nAffairs\n&#xa0;\nAppendix 2&#xa0;\nExtracts from The current and future UK science workforceReport prepared for the Science Council by TBR, 2011 &#xa0;\nThis research uses a new analysis\n considering the science workforce across the entire economy, rather than looking at total employees within science based industries. This innovative approach enables an understanding of the true size and scope of the science workforce across the economy, \nrather than limiting the research to considering scientists working in a narrow band of science sectors.\n&#xa0;\nThe definitions of the science workforce used for this report are:\n&#xa0;\nSectors are also classi\nfied as:\n&#xa0;\nChart 1\n              \nEmployment split by Sub-Sector, Region and Gender – Primary Workers\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nChart 2\n              \nEmployment split by Sub-Sector, Region and Gender – Secondary Workers\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.futuremorph.org/\n \n \nThe current and future UK science workforce\n TBR, Sept. 2011 \nhttp://www.sciencecouncil.org/content/science-workforce\n Prof \nAthene Donald, Unlocking potential – The Smith Institute June 2011  \n \nhttp://www.ref.ac.uk/media/ref/content/pub/panelcriteriaandworkingmethods/01_12.pdf\n \nhttp://www.sciencecouncil.org/content/role-models-and-case-studies-report\n \n \nhttp://www.sciencecouncil.org/content/celebrating-international-womens-day-2013\n \nhttp://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/further-education-skills/docs/s/11-771-stem-graduates-in-non-stem-jobs.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.sciencecouncil.org/content/10-types-scientist-%E2%80%93-science-jobs-are-not-all-same\n \n \nThe current and future UK science workforce, TBR repor\nt prepared for the Science Council, 2011 \n \nhttp://www.theukrc.org/files/useruploads/files/final_sept_15th_15.42_ukrc_statistics_guide_2010.pdf\n \nhttp://www.iop.org/policy/diversity/initiatives/juno/\n Planning for Success: Good Practice in University Science Departments, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2008\n Good Practice Sche\nme, Women in Mathematics, London Mathematical Society, 2013\n \nhttp://www.daphnejackson.org/\n \nhttp://www.bis.gov.\nuk/assets/biscore/business-law/docs/w/11-745-women-on-boards.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/research/16_flexibleworking.pdf\n"
