defaultExecutive Summary
defaultThe idea of 
defaultresettlement of refugees in Arab counties was firmly understood to be the only viable approach from 1949 through the early 1950s. This is in spite of countless public pronouncements regarding a balanced approach that would include repatriation, resettlemen
defaultt, and ‘rehabilitation’ or ‘reintegration.’
default&#xa0;
defaultThis testimony reviews how 
defaultthe term
default “reintegration” had been used only once by the United Nations, in September 1948, in connection to the refugees.
default In the coming years it would become one of the linchpins for 
defaultthe United Nations and other NGO’s who dealt with the Palestinian refugees.

defaultThe Quedefaultstion of ‘Reintegration’ and its implicationsdefault&#xa0;defaultwithout prejudice to the provisions of paragraph of General Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 11 December 
default1948, the reintegration of the refugees into the economic life of the Near East, either by repatriation or resettlement, is essential in preparation for the time when international assistance is no longer available, and for the realization of conditions of
default peace and stability in the area.
