[[[Key recommendations]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;2.1 The Sustainable Food Trust (SFT) was established in 2011 to help accelerate the transition to more durable and benign food production. We welcome this opportunity to comment on the issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and will concentrate on those aspects that relate to the development of AMR in food animals. &#xa0;2.2 The author of this submission declares an interest as he is an organic beef and sheep farmer and has been involved in the development of organic farming standards in the UK, which restrict the use of antibiotics on organic farms.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1 It might be more helpful to consider how AMR has developed over the last 15 years, since, although the issue was briefly revisited by the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee in its third report in 2001 [1], this more closely equates to the period since a Parliamentary committee last gave serious consideration to AMR in 1998 [2] and the ACMSF produced a report on this in 1999 [3].&#xa0;3.2 Although AMR is an inevitable consequence of antimicrobial use there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of farming-related AMR developments. We have seen:&#xa0;3.2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter in poultry and pigs [4], which is contributing to the rise of fluoroquinolone resistance in campylobacter infections in humans [5].&#xa0;3.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; fluoroquinolone resistance in salmonella [6][7] and the emergence of plasmids carrying fluoroquinolone resistance in salmonella. Plasmids are mobile genes that readily pass resistance from one bacterium to another.&#xa0;3.2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; a significant rise in AMR in E. coli urinary-tract infections (UTIs) in humans [8][9]. Food is recognized as an important source of AMR genes in the human gut, and the E. coli causing UTIs are faecal in origin. It has been estimated there are more than 750,000 E. coli infections every year in the UK, most of which will be UTIs [10]. Treatment failures in the UK due to the rise in AMR in UTIs have contributed to a 4-fold increase in E. coli blood poisoning over the last 20 years, to approximately 40,000 cases annually and an increase in mortality to approximately 8,000 deaths each year.&#xa0;3.2.4              the emergence of ESBL (extended spectrum beta lactamase) resistant E. coli In UK farm animals and imported chicken [10], and its spread to salmonella and klebsiella.&#xa0;3.2.6              the emergence of livestock-associated (LA) strains of MRSA which have the ability to colonize, pass between and cause infection in farm animals and humans [11]. In the UK, MRSA ST398 has been found in milk on dairy farms and in horses [12][13]. It has also been found in a small number of human cases [14]. &#xa0;3.2.7              the discovery of an entirely new type of MRSA in dairy cows and humans, with a mecC resistance gene, as opposed to a mecA gene [15][16]. It has been estimated this could be responsible for 1-4% of Danish human MRSA cases. It also causes human infections in England and Scotland [15][17].&#xa0;3.2.8              the emergence of carbapenem-resistant infections in humans, and isolated reports of carbapenem-resistant bacteria in farm animals [18][19][20]. This has possibly spread from humans to farm animals, but the use of farm antibiotics can ‘co-select’ for carbapenem-resistant bacteria once present [21].&#xa0;3.2.9              the emergence of the new epidemic multi-drug resistant (monophasic)  salmonella typhimurium in pigs and other farm animals, which is causing infections in humans [22].&#xa0;3.2.10              the emergence of linezolid resistance in staphylococci and enterococci in both humans and animals and the emergence of plasmid-mediated linezolid resistance [23]. Linezolid is an antibiotic of last resort for treating infections such as MRSA and VRE. It is not used in agriculture, but the veterinary antibiotic florfencol is cross-resistant with linezolid [24].&#xa0;3.2.11              AMR is also steadily becoming a problem for the effective treatment of farm animals. Resistance to tetracyclines, sulphonomides and ampicillin has been increasing for many years in E. coli, and the rise and spread of ESBL E. coli on British farms could make infections difficult to treat in future. AMR has also been increasing in swine dysentery, with some cases resistant to all veterinary antimicrobials including the pleuromutilins [25] a class of antibiotics being developed for human medicine with the potential for treating MRSA and tuberculosis [26]. The pleuromutalin, tiamulin, can be added to the feed of egg-laying hens and has a zero withdrawal period. It is not clear what part AMR played in a major outbreak in East Anglia which affected 24 farms between 2006 and 2009, but 3,000 sows had to be slaughtered, because they could not be treated effectively [27]. Veterinary antimicrobials that are used to treat swine dysentery are also permitted for its control (or in some cases prevention) at sub-therapeutic levels over prolonged periods. This is likely to have contributed to the rise of resistance.&#xa0;3.2.12              The House of Lords drew attention to the high use of fluoroquinolones on farms and recommended action in 1998. This fell shortly afterwards as a result, but has increased annually since and now stands at its highest ever level, 2,434 kg of active ingredient. The use of modern (3rd and 4th generation) cephalosporins and macrolides on farms also continues to increase. These are defined as critically important antimicrobials (CIAs) in human medicine [28]. Additional restrictions on their use are needed.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;4.1 Only one published study has ever looked at the direct effect of food on the levels of resistance in bacteria in the human intestine [29]. It found that resistance levels fell very sharply when food was sterilised, providing strong evidence that food contributes significantly to resistance in some human infections. Because this was only a small study, a larger study should be undertaken to see if the results are replicated. &#xa0;4.4 Research is needed to establish for the full range of antimicrobials, how long after treatment AMR falls back to background levels. This could be used to amend statutory withdrawal periods to help protect consumers against antimicrobial resistance as well as residues. A Defra-funded project from 2001-2004 concluded, ‘The finding of this study indicate that the risk posed by the antibiotics evaluated could be greatly reduced by increasing the withdrawal period by 7 days for chlortetracycline and enrofloxacin, and introducing a withdrawal period of 3 weeks for tylosin and 2 weeks for avilamycin.’ [30] Follow up research at a cost of £410,000 was carried out which identified additional strategies for reducing AMR in animals at slaughter [31], but this all appears to have been shelved and Tylosin, for example, still has a zero withdrawal period in pigs. &#xa0;4.5 There is an urgent need to establish:&#xa0;

[[[5.]]] 

[[[Is there sufficient res]]]

[[[earch and investment into new antibiotics?]]]&#xa0;5.1 Research should be encouraged, with public funds if necessary, into the development of new antimicrobial classes, especially those with Gram-negative action. &#xa0;

[[[6]]]. 

[[[What measures (including behavioural change]]]

[[[)]]]

[[[ have been most effective in controlling the spr]]]

[[[ead of resistant pathogens and ]]]

[[[what measures could be used to control other pathogens?]]]&#xa0;6.1 As explained above, longer withdrawal periods between treatment and slaughter can dramatically reduce levels of AMR. This may be more practical for cattle, pigs and free-range poultry than broilers. Reducing stocking density, allowing young animals to develop good immune systems (for example by later weaning) and reducing stress are all very helpful in reducing the use of antimicrobials and the levels of resistance in pathogens and commensal bacteria. Defra-funded studies have shown that there are very much lower levels of AMR in organically reared animals [32]. Caution is needed with the use of some disinfectants as these also select for AMR.&#xa0;7. 

[[[What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 Strategy?]]]&#xa0;7.1 The SFT welcomes the three strategic aims, the overall spirit and, with some qualifications, the seven key areas for future action in the strategy. However, we also see a number of serious weaknesses. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.2 The strategy should have recognised the need for vets to be required to adopt antibiotic-prescribing policies, just as the Health Act 2006 introduced such a requirement for hospital prescribing. Vets have the right to ‘prescribe according to their clinical judgment’ but all veterinary and medical prescribing should be subject to intelligent overview by colleagues and regulators and those prescribing poorly should receive additional training.7.3 We welcome the commitment to encourage the training of farmers. However, it is important this is balanced and independent. Since the ban on advertising antimicrobials in farming journals came into force in October 2013, some pharmaceutical companies have been holding seminars for farmers to improve their understanding of responsible antimicrobial use. That is not a substitute for training, as they will inevitably use these as commercial opportunities to promote their products. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.4 We welcome the commitments on surveillance for AMR, but it is also essential that data be collected on how much of each antimicrobial class is used in each species.

[[[&#xa0;]]]Broader concerns about the strategy

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.5 We welcome the commitment to advocate minimizing routine preventative antimicrobial use but this does not go far enough. This practice still is still widespread and the underlying cause of most resistance problem on farms. It is primarily undertaken for commercial not clinical reasons. There would be less need for CIAs if other antimicrobials were not abused in this way. In addition, although growth promotion has been banned, some antibiotics can still be used at growth-promoting levels as a low cost insurance against the risk of possible disease. In addition, almost all dairy cows are routinely treated with antibiotics in attempts to prevent mastitis.

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.6 The inclusion of antibiotics in the feed or water of herds or flocks of animals accounts for over 85% of farm antibiotic use in the UK [33], in contrast to Sweden where it accounts for 12% [34]. Many of these antibiotic products are licensed for preventative treatment, and in some cases there is no requirement that any disease be diagnosed. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.7 In the past year, both the Government and the VMD have stated that they do not approve of the routine use of antibiotics for disease prevention [35][36], and in 2011 the European Medicines Agency issued a statement which discourages routine use [37]. Very recently, a new scientific commission launched by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases recommended that routine preventative use in farming of medically important antibiotics be phased out [21].

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.8 Despite these concerns, numerous veterinary antibiotic products may still be used routinely. A timetable to phase out this practice in the UK should be included in the strategy. This would not prevent the metaphylactic (preventative) use of antimicrobials when disease has been identified in some animals in a herd or flock.

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.9 The implementation of the strategy is to be led by a new ‘Interdepartmental High-level Steering Group’. We see no difference between this and the interdepartmental steering group that has presided over a period of spectacular increases in AMR developments in farm animals. As such independent oversight with teeth is needed.&#xa0;7.10 The need for an over-arching independent scientific committee to embrace both human and veterinary medicine were key recommendations of the Swann Committee report in 1969 and the House of Lords’ report in 1998. In both cases the Governments of the day took several years to set up the committees, overloaded them with relatively minor tasks, failed to provide them with adequate resources to consider the bigger picture, then when there was little media interest in AMR, quietly wound them up. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.11 The need for such a committee is even greater today and we recommend that one should be set up. To avoid history repeating itself there also needs to be a new permanent Parliamentary committee to monitor AMR issue and the Government’s progress in addressing it. The process initiated by the House of Lords committee in 1998 came to an end in 2001, just at the point when continuing scrutiny could have prevented some of the most serious AMR developments.&#xa0;7.12 A major concern about the strategy is the role given to the VMD in jointly providing the lead on implementation with PHE. Although the strategy states ‘The Department of Health, with support from PHE 

[[[and Defra ]]][our emphasis], will lead on implementation of the Strategy’, this is misleading since responsibility for AMR was taken from Defra in April 2011 and handed to the VMD. It is therefore the VMD, not Defra, that will be leading on the veterinary side. It was the VMD, not Defra, that was involved in drawing up the Strategy (see p3 of Strategy). Motives for this obfuscation should be considered.&#xa0;7.13 Although the VMD is efficient and very professional, and has addressed a number of longstanding abuses of veterinary medicines over the past year, it is not suited to this primary leadership role on the veterinary side due to its lack of democratic accountability and inherent conflict of interests in the way in which it was established, in 1989, as a self-funding agency, as part of moves to ‘roll back the state’ and remove regulatory burdens on industry. As explained below, this makes it excessively vulnerable to influence and lobbying, particularly by the pharmaceutical industry. Similar concerns have been expressed in relation to the regulation of human medicines [38], however neither the Department of Health nor PHE, which lead the implementation of the AMR strategy on the medical side, have no financial conflict of interests, since their funding comes from central Government.&#xa0;7.14 In 2011-12, 79% of the VMD’s £14.3 million income came from the industries it regulates, with two thirds of this coming from pharmaceutical companies, mostly for licensing work [39]. However, under the EU’s Mutual Recognition and Decentralised procedures, the VMD must compete with other EU national licensing bodies to attract applications, because the pharmaceutical companies can choose which EU licensing body to work with [40].&#xa0;7.15 This competitive licensing situation ensures that the VMD must appear attractive to pharmaceutical companies and creates a conflict of interest. The VMD clearly recognises that its finances depend on companies viewing it favourably and says in its latest Business Plan that one of its priorities is to 

[[[‘]]]Ensure that the veterinary pharmaceutical industry consider the level of service&#xa0;provided by the VMD to be good or excellent’. And it explains why this is important by saying ‘To enable an increased percentage of EU work to&#xa0;come via the VMD we need to measure and understand the views of our&#xa0;customers so we can understand any barriers to being the agency of choice’ [41].&#xa0;7.16 A further area of concern is that the VMD states, 

[[[‘]]]In 2013/14 we will be&#xa0;working with other suitable organisations and assurance schemes that we have&#xa0;identified, to consider delegating the responsibility for inspections to them’ [41]. This raises the question of whether it is appropriate for a largely industry-funded regulator to delegate regulation to a wholly-industry body, over the use of products where profit is such a strong motivating factor? &#xa0;7.17 The VMD also states it, ‘We will continue to consult our customers and interest groups at the&#xa0;earliest stage during development of policy and strategy and invite them to put&#xa0;forward proposals for the development of effective regulatory mechanisms

[[[.’ ]]]We question whether it is appropriate for the VMD to be the arbiter on policy and strategy in relation to AMR, given its vulnerability to industry influence?&#xa0;7.18 The VMD states it ‘will be actively involved in the&#xa0;discussion required to promote the use of veterinary medicines in preventing&#xa0;disease in order to maximise productivity’ [41][p6]. And, ‘In all&#xa0;cases the VMD will work to influence the legislation to ensure that&#xa0;safe and effective veterinary medicines remain available for use in&#xa0;animals and regulatory burdens are kept to the minimum

[[[' ]]][41]

[[[ ]]][p4]. This suggests the VMD has one message for the industry which wants to retain preventative use and markets antimicrobials to maximise farm productivity, and another for a more general audience [36]. &#xa0;7.19 The VMD had a large number of meetings last year with industry representatives. Fifty of these related to licensing issues, an unspecified number related to policy issues. One of the VMD’s roles, for which Defra pays it £3 million pa, is ‘the provision and implementation of policy advice to Ministers’. Since Defra no longer has any responsibility for AMR and even its own advisory committee on AMR is chaired and administered by the VMD, Ministers have little alternative but to agree to the advice the VMD gives them. This means that industry lobbying of the VMD is essentially equivalent to lobbying a Minister. This is inappropriate, especially at the present time when the industry is fighting to oppose moves to end routine prophylactic use of antimicrobials [42].&#xa0;7.20 The VMD is also responsible for the Government’s assessment of the significance of veterinary antimicrobial use to AMR in infections affecting humans. In the 5-year Strategy, this begins with the statement, ‘Increasing scientific evidence suggests that the clinical issues with antimicrobial resistance that we face in human medicine are primarily the result of antibiotic use in people, rather than the use of antibiotics in animals.’ The VMD has produced several similar statements before. The statement may be correct overall but it is highly misleading and creates the impression there is no significant farm dimension to the AMR problem, when closer examination of following text and the science shows there clearly is. In response Farmers Guardian told its readers, ‘Antimicrobial resistance seen in human medicine is primarily the result of antibiotic use in people, rather than animals, a major Government report has stated’ [43]

[[[.]]]

[[[ ]]]There are many similar examples. The VMD’s approach is at odds with concerns expressed in many countries and designed to please its main sources of funding. More seriously, the phrasing of such statements re-enforces entrenched views and seriously undermines efforts to reduce AMR in farm animals through more judicious use of antimicrobials.
