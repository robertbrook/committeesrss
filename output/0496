[normal]The question that the subject of your enquiry boils down to is this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"Why is it that 'ordinary' people are increasingly doubting the carefully constructed and[bold] [bold]well orchestrated panoply of lies we have been telling them?"[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Answer:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In many cases we just might know more science than you do, and secondly not be quite as
[normal] 
[normal]gullible as many of you seem to be.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 'science', as you people are so keen on assuring us, is 'settled'. Indeed it is settled 
[normal]â€“
[normal] in
[normal] 
[normal]favour of the null hypothesis. There is no dangerous 'climate change' caused by human
[normal] 
[normal]activity, increasing C02 does not present a threat, rather a benefit - more crops and therefore
[normal] 
[normal]more food to feed a growing population.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The economics of 'green' energy are the economics of the madhouse.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The old adage 'the truth is an oft repeated lie' for once has proved as untrue as the
[normal] 
[normal]government paid climate scientists' predictions. They would be wise to heed these words in
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]Torah:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]You may say to yourselves, "How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the
[normal] 
[normal]LORD?" If what a prophet proclaims in the name of
[normal] 
[normal]the LORD does not take place or come
[normal] 
[normal]true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously.
[normal] 
[normal]Do not be afraid of
[normal] 
[normal]him.
