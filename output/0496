defaultThe question that the subject of your enquiry boils down to is this.
default&#xa0;
default"Why is it that 'ordinary' people are increasingly doubting the carefully constructed anddefault defaultwell orchestrated panoply of lies we have been telling them?"default&#xa0;
defaultThe Answer:
default&#xa0;
defaultIn many cases we just might know more science than you do, and secondly not be quite as
default 
defaultgullible as many of you seem to be.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 'science', as you people are so keen on assuring us, is 'settled'. Indeed it is settled 
defaultâ€“
default in
default 
defaultfavour of the null hypothesis. There is no dangerous 'climate change' caused by human
default 
defaultactivity, increasing C02 does not present a threat, rather a benefit - more crops and therefore
default 
defaultmore food to feed a growing population.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe economics of 'green' energy are the economics of the madhouse.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe old adage 'the truth is an oft repeated lie' for once has proved as untrue as the
default 
defaultgovernment paid climate scientists' predictions. They would be wise to heed these words in
default 
defaultthe 
defaultTorah:
default&#xa0;
defaultYou may say to yourselves, "How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the
default 
defaultLORD?" If what a prophet proclaims in the name of
default 
defaultthe LORD does not take place or come
default 
defaulttrue, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously.
default 
defaultDo not be afraid of
default 
defaulthim.
