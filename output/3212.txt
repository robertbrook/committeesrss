CUKT works to improve the lives of people throughout the UK and Ireland, by influencing policy, and by changing lives through innovative practice and partnership work. The Trust was established by Scots-American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie in 1913. &#xa0;We have chosen to respond by way of six key recommendations which reflect our experience.&#xa0;Further information on our work is available on our website www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk. &#xa0;

[[[Community Ownership of Land]]]

[[[ in Scotland]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Carnegie UK Trust’s experience and interest in Land Reform is specifically community ownership of land. We would like to see more opportunities for communities to take on ownership of land and to derive the greatest benefits from doing so. &#xa0;We welcome this inquiry into Land Reform in Scotland and many of the suggestions in the inquiry discussion paper relating to community ownership. &#xa0;We are also actively engaging with the Scottish Government on the proposed Community Empowerment and Renewal Bill and we have submitted evidence to the Scottish Government Land Reform Review Group.

[[[&#xa0;]]]We have seen how community ownership of land or other local assets can have a transformative effect in communities. Half a million acres of land are now in community ownership in Scotland resulting in repopulation; new homes; new businesses; and a new sense of confidence, energy and opportunity. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]Our own research has shown that it can be a powerful catalyst for a wide range of social, environmental and economic improvements in local communities with a positive impact on individual and community wellbeing. &#xa0;Our experience has shown that the benefits of community ownership and/ or management can be: &#xa0;&#xa0;There is great potential for more rural and urban communities across Scotland to access the many benefits that owning and controlling local assets, including land, can offer. &#xa0;We would therefore welcome the introduction of measures that would make ‘it easier for communities to take ownership of land and other assets’ and ‘measures intended to facilitate and make easier the transfer of land and other assets in public ownership to communities and others’.

[[[ecommendations]]]&#xa0;We have identified a package of six recommendations that we believe need to be in place in order to deliver improved community and individual wellbeing for Scottish communities through ownership and/or management of land and local assets. While each component below is important in its own right the full benefits of each measure can only be derived if all are in place.&#xa0;&#xa0;
