[normal]L
[normal]ife Cycle UK believes that cycling is a safe activity in Britain’s towns and cities.  However, we recognise that many people do not feel safe, particularly when they don’t have the skills to cycle in traffic.  
[normal]Life Cycle does not believe that the answer t
[normal]o improving safety lies in segregating cyclists from cars, although we recognise that on some routes this is appropriate. 
[normal]Life Cycle 15- year experience of delivering cycle training shows that  the provision of high quality  training to people of all ages,
[normal] can ensure they have the appropriate skil
[normal]ls to negotiate traffic safely, understand how to choose routes that have less traffic giving them the confidence to be safe on the roads.

[normal]Bikeability
[normal] should be available to 
[normal]child
[normal]ren 
[normal]fro
[normal]m year 5 onwards, and also available to all secondary school age children.  We believe that 
[normal]children and young people are ready to start cycling at different stages in their development and 
[normal]training should be 
[normal]available to support them at the point when the
[normal]y are ready, not only in Primary School.

[normal]Life Cycle trained 650 adults to the National Standard in 2013 to cycle safely on the 
[normal]roads
[normal] of Bristol enabling them to feel safe and confident to cycle.  However, cycle training is not widely
[normal] available and is dependent on the priorities of local government. We believe the provision of low-cost high quality adult cycle training should be universally available to adults, wherever they live in England.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Employers should be incentivised to encou
[normal]rage staff who cycle to take up opportunities for training. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As part of the 
[normal]standard driving test, and the HGV licence test, 
[normal]we believe that all drivers should be given cyclist aw
[normal]a
[normal]reness training. This needs to increase their und
[normal]erstanding of how and why cyclists behave the way the
[normal]y
[normal] do on the 
[normal]roa
[normal]d, and 
[normal]how 
[normal]driver’s
[normal] 
[normal]should behave correspondingly.
