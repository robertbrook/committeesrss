[normal]2.1 
[normal]The Sustainabl
[normal]e Food Trust (SFT) 
[normal]was
[normal] established in 2011 to help accelerate the transition to more durable
[normal] and
[normal] benign
[normal] food production
[normal]. We welcome
[normal] 
[normal]this opportunity to comment on
[normal] the issue of antimi
[normal]crobial resistance
[normal] (AMR)
[normal] and
[normal] will concentrate on
[normal] those aspects that 
[normal]relate to
[normal] the 
[normal]development of AMR
[normal] 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]food animals
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 
[normal]The author of this 
[normal]submission
[normal] declares an interest as he 
[normal]is an organic 
[normal]beef and sheep 
[normal]farmer
[normal] and 
[normal]has
[normal] been involved in the development of organic 
[normal]farming 
[normal]standards
[normal] in the UK
[normal], which restrict the use of antibiotics on organic farms
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1 It might be more helpful to consider how 
[normal]AMR
[normal] has developed over the last 15 years, since
[normal], although the issue was briefly revisited by the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee in its third report in 2001
[normal] 
[normal][1]
[normal],
[normal] this more closely equates to the period since 
[normal]a 
[normal]Parliament
[normal]ary committee
[normal] last gave 
[normal]serious 
[normal]consideration to 
[normal]AMR
[normal] in 1998
[normal] 
[normal][2]
[normal] 
[normal]and the ACMSF produced a repo
[normal]rt 
[normal]on this 
[normal]in 1999 
[normal][3]
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 
[normal]Although AMR is an inevitable co
[normal]nsequence of antimicrobial use 
[normal]there has
[normal] been an unprecedent
[normal]ed 
[normal]increase in the 
[normal]number of
[normal] 
[normal]farming-related 
[normal]AMR developments.
[normal] 
[normal]We have seen
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the emerg
[normal]ence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter
[normal] in poultry and pigs
[normal] 
[normal][4]
[normal],
[normal] which is contributing to the rise of fl
[normal]u
[normal]oroquinolone resistance in campylobacter infec
[normal]tions in humans
[normal]

[normal] and the E.
[normal] 
[normal]coli causing UTIs are faecal in origin
[normal]. 
[normal]It has been estimated there are 
[normal]more than
[normal] 750,000 E. coli infections every year in the UK, most of which will be UTIs
[normal] 
[normal][10]
[normal]. Treatment failures 
[normal]in the UK 
[normal]due to the rise in AMR in UTIs have
[normal] contributed to 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]4-fold increase in E. coli
[normal] 
[normal]blood poisoning
[normal] 
[normal]over the last 20 years
[normal],
[normal] to approx
[normal]im
[normal]ately 40,000 cases annually
[normal] 
[normal]and an increase i
[normal]n mortality to approximately 8,0
[normal]00 deaths 
[normal]each year
[normal].

[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]its spread to salmonella and klebsiella.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.6
[normal]              
[normal]the emergence of 
[normal]livestock-associated 
[normal](LA) 
[normal]strains of MRSA 
[normal]which 
[normal]have the 
[normal]ability to colonize, pass between 
[normal]and cause infection in farm anim
[normal]als and humans
[normal] 
[normal][11]
[normal]. In the UK
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]MRSA 
[normal]ST398 has been 
[normal]found 
[normal]in milk
[normal] 
[normal]on 
[normal]dairy farms
[normal] and in horses 
[normal][12]
[normal][13]
[normal]. It has also been found in a small number of human cases 
[normal][14]
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.7
[normal]              
[normal]the discovery of
[normal] an entirely new type of MRSA in dairy cows and humans
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]with a 
[normal]m
[normal]ecC

[normal]gene
[normal],
[normal] as opposed to a 
[normal]m
[normal]ecA gene
[normal] 
[normal][15]
[normal][16]
[normal]. It 
[normal]has been 
[normal]estimated 
[normal]this
[normal] could
[normal] be responsible for 1
[normal]-4
[normal]% of 
[normal]Danish human MRSA cases. I
[normal]t also causes human infections in England and Scotland
[normal] 
[normal][15]
[normal][17]
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.8
[normal]              
[normal]the

[normal]of 
[normal]carbapenem-resistan
[normal]t 
[normal]bacteria in farm animals 
[normal][18]
[normal][19]
[normal][20]
[normal]. This has 
[normal]possibly spread from humans to farm animals
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]but the use of farm antibiotics 
[normal]can 
[normal]‘co-select’ for carbapenem
[normal]-
[normal]res
[normal]istant bacteria once present
[normal] 
[normal][21]
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.9
[normal]              
[normal]the emergence of 
[normal]the
[normal] new epidemic multi-drug resistant 
[normal](monophasic)  
[normal]salmonella typhimurium 
[normal]in pigs and other farm animals
[normal], 
[normal]which is 
[normal]causing
[normal] infections in humans 
[normal][22]
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.10
[normal]              
[normal]the emergence of linezolid resistance in staphylococci and enterococci in 
[normal]both humans and animals and the emergence of plasmid-
[normal]mediated
[normal] linezolid resistance
[normal] 
[normal][23]
[normal]. Linezolid is an antibiotic of last resort for treating infections such as MRSA and VRE. 
[normal]It 
[normal]is not used in agriculture, but the veterinary antibiotic florfencol is cross-resistant
[normal] with linezolid
[normal] 
[normal][24]
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.11
[normal]              
[normal]AMR is also steadily becoming a problem for the effective treatment of farm 
[normal]animals. 
[normal]R
[normal]esistance to tetracyclines, sulphonomides
[normal] and ampicillin 
[normal]has
[normal] been 
[normal]increasing for many years 
[normal]in E. coli
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and the 
[normal]rise
[normal] 
[normal]and spread 
[normal]of ESBL E.
[normal] 
[normal]coli 
[normal]on
[normal] 
[normal]British 
[normal]farms 
[normal]could make 
[normal]infections
[normal] difficult 
[normal]to treat 
[normal]in future. 
[normal]AMR
[normal] has also been increasing in swine dysentery
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]with some cases resistant to all ve
[normal]terinary antimicrobials including
[normal] 
[normal]the pleuromuti
[normal]lin
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal][25]
[normal] a class of antibiotics being developed for human medicine with the potential for treating MRSA and tuberc
[normal]ulosis
[normal] 
[normal][26]
[normal]. 
[normal]The pleuromutalin
[normal],
[normal] tiamulin
[normal],
[normal] can 
[normal]be added to the feed of egg-
[normal]laying hens and has a zero withdrawal period. 
[normal]It is not clear what part 
[normal]AMR
[normal] played in a m
[normal]ajor outbreak in East Anglia which affected 24 farms 
[normal]between 2006 and 2009
[normal],
[normal] but 3,000 sows had to be slaughtered
[normal],
[normal] because they could not be treated effectively
[normal] 
[normal][27]
[normal].
[normal] V
[normal]eterinary antimicrobials that are used to treat swine dysentery are also permitted for its control
[normal] (or in some cases prevention)
[normal] at sub-therapeutic levels over prolonged periods. This is li
[normal]kely to have contributed to the rise of resistance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.12
[normal]              
[normal]The House of Lords drew attention to the high use of fluoroquinolones on 
[normal]farms and recommended action
[normal] in 1998
[normal]. This fell
[normal] shortly afterwards
[normal] as a result
[normal],
[normal] but has increased annually since and now st
[normal]ands at its highest ever level
[normal], 2,434 kg of active ingredient
[normal]. The use of modern (3
[normal]rd
[normal] and 4
[normal]th
[normal] generation) cephalosporins and macrolides on farms also continues to increase. These are defined as critically important antimicrobials 
[normal](CIAs) 
[normal]in human medicine
[normal] 
[normal][28]
[normal]. Additional restrictions 
[normal]on their use are needed.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal] 
[normal]Only one published study has ever 
[normal]looked at the direct effect of food on the levels of 
[normal]resistance in bacteria in the human intestine
[normal] 
[normal][29]
[normal]. It found that resistance levels fell very sharply 
[normal]when
[normal] food was sterilised, providing strong evidence that food contributes 
[normal]significantly 
[normal]to resistance
[normal] in some human infections
[normal]. Because this
[normal] was only a small study, a larger study should be undertaken to see if the results are replicated. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4 
[normal]R
[normal]esearch 
[normal]is needed 
[normal]to establish 
[normal]for the full range of antimicrobials,
[normal] 
[normal]how long after 
[normal]treatment AMR falls back to background levels
[normal]. This 
[normal]could be used 
[normal]to 
[normal]amend statutory 
[normal]withdrawal 
[normal]periods
[normal] 
[normal]to help protect consumers against antimicrobial resistance as well as residu
[normal]e
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal] Defra-funded project 
[normal]from 2001-2004 concluded, ‘
[normal]The finding of this study indicate that the risk posed by the antibiotics 
[normal]eva
[normal]luated coul
[normal]d be greatly reduced
[normal] by increasing the withdrawal period by 7 days for chlortetracycline and enrofloxacin, and introducing a withdrawal period of 3 weeks for tylosin and 2 weeks for avilamycin.
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal][30]
[normal] 
[normal]Follow up research at a cost of £410,000 was carried out which identified additional strategies for reducing AMR in animals at slaughter
[normal] 
[normal][31]
[normal], but this 
[normal]all 
[normal]appears to have been shelved and 
[normal]Tylosin, for example
[normal],
[normal] still has a
[normal] zero withdrawal period in pigs
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5 
[normal]T
[normal]here is an
[normal] 
[normal]urgent 
[normal]need to establish
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.[bold] 
[normal]Is there sufficient res[bold]earch and investment into new antibiotics?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1 
[normal]R
[normal]esearch should be encouraged, with public funds if necessary
[normal],
[normal] into the development of new antimicrobial classes, especially t
[normal]h
[normal]ose with Gram-negative action. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6[bold].
[normal] 
[normal]What measures (including behavioural change[bold])[bold] have been most effective in controlling the spr[bold]ead of resistant pathogens and [bold]what measures could be used to control other pathogens?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1 
[normal]As explained above
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]longer
[normal] withdrawal periods between treatment and slaughter can dramatically reduce levels of AMR.
[normal] This may be more practical for 
[normal]cattle, 
[normal]pigs and free-range poultry than broilers. 
[normal]Reducing stocking density, allowing young animals to develop good immune systems (for example by 
[normal]later 
[normal]weaning
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]and reducing stress are all very helpful
[normal] in reducing the use 
[normal]of antimicrobials and the levels of resistance in pathogens and commensal bacteria
[normal]. Defra-funded 
[normal]studies have shown that there are ver
[normal]y much lower levels of AMR in organically
[normal] 
[normal]reared animals
[normal] 
[normal][32]
[normal].
[normal] Caution is needed 
[normal]with
[normal] the use of some disinfectants as these also select for AMR.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal] 
[normal]What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 Strategy?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1 
[normal]The SFT welcomes the three
[normal] strategic aims, the overall spirit and,
[normal] with some qualifications, the seven
[normal] key areas for future action in the strategy. However, we 
[normal]also 
[normal]see
[normal] a number of serious weaknesses
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7
[normal].2
[normal] 
[normal]The strategy should have recognised the need for vets to be 
[normal]required
[normal] to adopt antibiotic-prescribing policies, just as the Health Act 2006 introduced such a require
[normal]ment for hospital prescribing. 
[normal]Vets have the right to ‘prescribe a
[normal]ccording to their clinical judg
[normal]ment’ but all
[normal] v
[normal]eterinary and medical prescribing should be subj
[normal]ect to intelligent overview by colleagues and regulators and those prescribing poorly should receive additional training.
[normal]7
[normal].3
[normal] 
[normal]We welcome the commitment to encourage the training of farmers. However, it is important 
[normal]this
[normal] is balanced and independent. Since t
[normal]he ban on advertising antimicrobials 
[normal]in farming journals
[normal] came into force in October 2013, some phar
[normal]maceutical companies have been holding 
[normal]seminars for farmers to improve their understanding 
[normal]of 
[normal]respons
[normal]ible antimicrobial use. That is not a substitute for 
[normal]training
[normal],
[normal] as they will inevitably use 
[normal]these as commercial opportunities
[normal] to promote their products
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7
[normal].4
[normal] 
[normal]We welcome the commitments on surveillance for AMR
[normal],
[normal] but it is 
[normal]also 
[normal]essential that data be 
[normal]collected on
[normal] how much of 
[normal]each 
[normal]antimicrobial class is used 
[normal]in 
[normal]each
[normal] species
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Broader concerns about the strategy
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.5
[normal] 
[normal]We welcome the commitment to advocate minimizing routine preventative antimicrobial use but this does not go far enough. 
[normal]This
[normal] practice 
[normal]still 
[normal]is still widespread
[normal] and the 
[normal]underlying
[normal] cause of 
[normal]most
[normal] resist
[normal]ance problem on farms
[normal]. It is
[normal] primarily undertaken for commercial not clinical reasons. 
[normal]There would be less need for CIAs if other antimicrobials were not abused in this way. 
[normal]In addition, a
[normal]lthough growth promotion has been banned, 
[normal]some
[normal] 
[normal]antibiotics can still
[normal] be
[normal] used at growth-promoting levels as a low cost insurance against the risk of possible disease.
[normal] 
[normal]In addition, almost all dairy cows are routinely treated with antibiotics in attempts to prevent mastitis.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.6
[normal] 
[normal]The inclusion of antibiotics in the feed or wa
[normal]ter of herds or flocks of animals accounts for over 85% of farm antibiotic use in the UK 
[normal][33]
[normal], in contrast to Sweden where 
[normal]it
[normal] account
[normal]s
[normal] for 12
[normal]%
[normal] 
[normal][34]
[normal]. Many of these antibiotic products are licensed for preventative treatment, and in some cases there is no requirement that any disease be diagnosed. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.7
[normal] 
[normal]In t
[normal]he past year, both the Government and the VMD have stated that they do not approve of the routine use of antibiotics for disease prevention
[normal] 
[normal][35]
[normal][36]
[normal], and in 
[normal]2011 the European Medicines Agency issued a statement which discourages routine use 
[normal][37]
[normal]. Very recently, a new scientific commission launched by 
[normal]the journal 
[normal]Lancet Infectious Diseases recommended that routine preventative use in farming of medically important antibiotics be phased out
[normal] 
[normal][21]
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.8
[normal] 
[normal]Despite these concerns
[normal],
[normal] numerous veterinary antibiotic products may still be used routine
[normal]ly.
[normal] A timetable to phase out this practice in the UK
[normal] should be included in the strategy
[normal].
[normal] This would not 
[normal]prevent 
[normal]the metaphylactic (
[normal]preventative
[normal])
[normal] use of antimicrobials when disease has been identified in 
[normal]some animals in 
[normal]a herd or flock.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.9
[normal] 
[normal]The implementation of the strategy is to be led by
[normal] a new ‘
[normal]Interdepartmental High-level Steering Group’. We see no 
[normal]difference 
[normal]between this and the interdepartmental steering group that has presided over a period of spectacular increases in AMR
[normal] developments in farm animals.
[normal] As such 
[normal]independent
[normal] oversight with teeth is 
[normal]needed
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.10 The need for an over-arching independent scientifi
[normal]c committee to embrace both human and veterinary medicine were key recommendations of the Swann Committee report in 1969 and the House of Lords’ report in 1998. In both cases the Governments of the day took several years to set up the committees, overloade
[normal]d them with 
[normal]relatively minor
[normal] tasks, failed to provide them with adequate resources
[normal] to consider the bigger picture
[normal], then when there was little media interest in AMR, quietly wound 
[normal]them 
[normal]up. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.11
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he need for such a committee is even greater today
[normal] and we re
[normal]co
[normal]mmend that one should be set up. To
[normal] avoid history repeating itself 
[normal]there also needs to be a 
[normal]new 
[normal]permanent
[normal] Parliamentary committee 
[normal]to monitor
[normal] 
[normal]AMR issue and 
[normal]the Government’s progress in addressing it
[normal]. 
[normal]The process initiated by the House of Lords committee 
[normal]i
[normal]n 1998 
[normal]came to an end in 2001, just at the point when continuing scrutiny 
[normal]could have prevented some of the most serious AMR developments
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.12
[normal] 
[normal]A major concern about the strategy is the role given to the VMD in jointly providing 
[normal]the 
[normal]lead on implementation 
[normal]with PHE. Although the strategy states ‘The Department of Health, with support from PHE 
[normal]and Defra [bold][our emphasis],
[normal] will lead on implementation of the Strategy’, this is misleading since responsibility for AMR was taken from Defra in April 2011 and handed to
[normal] the VMD.
[normal] It is therefore the VMD, 
[normal]not
[normal] Defra, that will be 
[normal]lead
[normal]ing
[normal] on the veterinary side
[normal]. It 
[normal]was the VMD, not Defra, that was involved in drawing up the Strategy (see p3 of Strategy).
[normal] Motives for this obfuscation should be considered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.13 
[normal]Although the 
[normal]VMD is efficient
[normal] and very professional,
[normal] and has addressed a number of longstanding abuses of veterinary medicines over the past year, it
[normal] is not suited to this 
[normal]primary
[normal] 
[normal]leadership role 
[normal]on the veterinary side 
[normal]due to its 
[normal]lack of democratic accountability and i
[normal]nherent conflict
[normal] of interest
[normal]s
[normal] in 
[normal]the way in which it was established
[normal],
[normal] in 1989
[normal],
[normal] as a self-funding agency, as part of moves to ‘roll back the state’ and remove regulatory burdens on industry.
[normal] 
[normal]As 
[normal]explained below, 
[normal]this 
[normal]make
[normal]s
[normal] it excessively vulnerable to influe
[normal]nce and lobbying, particularly 
[normal]by
[normal] the pharmaceutical industry.
[normal] Similar concerns have been expressed in relation to the regulation of human medicines
[normal] 
[normal][38]
[normal], however 
[normal]neither the Department of Health nor 
[normal]PHE
[normal], which lead the implementation of the AMR strategy on the medical side
[normal],
[normal] have no
[normal] financial conflict of interests
[normal],
[normal] since
[normal] their funding comes from central Government
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.14 In 2011-12, 79% of the VMD’s 
[normal]£14.3 million 
[normal]in
[normal]come came from the industries it regulates, with two thirds of this coming from pharmaceutical companies
[normal],
[normal] mostly for 
[normal]licensing work
[normal] 
[normal][39]
[normal]. 
[normal]However, under the EU’s Mutual Recognition and Decentralised procedures, the VMD must compete with other EU national licensing bodies to attract applications, 
[normal]because
[normal] the pharmaceutical comp
[normal]anies 
[normal]can choose which
[normal] 
[normal]EU 
[normal]licensing body to work with
[normal] 
[normal][40]
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.15
[normal] This competitive licensing situation ensures that the VMD must appear attractive to pharmaceutical
[normal] companies and creates a conflict of interest. The VMD clearly recognises that its finances depend on companies viewing it favourably and says in its latest Business Plan that one of its priorities is to 
[normal]‘[bold]Ensure that the veterinary pharmaceutical industry 
[normal]consider the level of service
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]provided by the VMD to be good or e
[normal]xcellent’. And it explains why this is important by saying 
[normal]‘To enable an increased percentage of EU work to
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]come via the VMD we need to measure and understand the views of our
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]customers so we
[normal] can understand any barriers to being the agency of choice’
[normal] 
[normal][41]
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.16
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal] further area of concern is that
[normal] the VMD states, 
[normal]‘[bold]In 2013/14 we will be
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]working with other suitable organisations and assurance schemes that we have
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]identified, to consider delegating the responsibility for inspections to them
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal][41]
[normal].
[normal] This raises the question
[normal] of whether it is appropriate 
[normal]for a largely
[normal] industry-funded regulator
[normal] to
[normal] delegate regulation 
[normal]to a wholly-
[normal]industry
[normal] body
[normal],
[normal] over the use of products 
[normal]where
[normal] profit is such 
[normal]a strong motivating factor? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.17
[normal] 
[normal]The VMD 
[normal]also 
[normal]states it, ‘We will continue to consult our customers and interest groups at the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]earliest stage during development of policy and strategy and invite them to put
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]forward proposals for the development of effect
[normal]ive regulatory mechanisms
[normal].’ [bold]We question whether it is appropriate for the VMD to be 
[normal]the arbiter
[normal] on policy 
[normal]and strategy
[normal] in relation to AMR
[normal],
[normal] given it
[normal]s
[normal] vulnerability to industry influence?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.18
[normal] 
[normal]The VMD states it ‘
[normal]will be actively involved in the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]discussion required to promote the use of veterinary medicines in preventing
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]disease in order to maximise productivity’ 
[normal][41]
[normal][p6]
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]And, ‘In 
[normal]all
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]cases the VMD will work to influence the legislation to ensure that
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]safe and effective veterinary medicines remain available for use in
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]animals and regulatory burdens are kept to the minimum
[normal]' [bold][41]
[normal] [bold][p4]
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This suggests the VMD has one message for the indu
[normal]stry which wants to 
[normal]retain preventative use and market
[normal]s
[normal] antimicrobials
[normal] to maximise farm productivity
[normal],
[normal] and another for a more general audi
[normal]ence 
[normal][36]
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.19
[normal] 
[normal]The VMD had a large number of meetings last year with industry representatives. Fifty of these related to licensing issues, an unspecified number related to policy issues. One of the VMD’s roles, for which Defra pays it £3 million pa, is ‘the provision and
[normal] implementation of policy advice to Ministers’. Since Defra no longer has any responsibility for AMR and even its own advisory committee on AMR is chaired and administered by the VMD, Ministers have 
[normal]little
[normal] alternative but to 
[normal]agree to
[normal] the advice the VMD giv
[normal]es them. 
[normal]This
[normal] means that 
[normal]industry 
[normal]lobbying 
[normal]of the 
[normal]VMD is 
[normal]essentially equivalent to
[normal] lobbying a Minister. This is inappropriate
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]especially at the present time when the industry 
[normal]is fighting to oppose
[normal] moves to end routine prophylactic use of antimicrobials
[normal] 
[normal][42]
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.20
[normal] 
[normal]The VMD is also responsible for the Government’s assessment of the significance of veterinary antimicrobial use 
[normal]to AMR
[normal] in infections affecting humans. 
[normal]In 
[normal]the 5-year Strategy
[normal],
[normal] this
[normal] begins with the statement, ‘
[normal]Increasing scientific evidence suggests that the clinical issues with antimicrobial resistance that we face in human medicine are primarily the result of antibiotic use in people, rather than the use of
[normal] antibiotics in animals.
[normal]’ The VMD has produced several similar statements before. The statement may be correct overall but it is 
[normal]highly 
[normal]misleading and creates the impression there is no significant farm dimension
[normal] to the AMR problem
[normal], when closer examination
[normal] 
[normal]of following text and the science 
[normal]shows there 
[normal]clearly 
[normal]is. In response 
[normal]Farmers Guardian told its readers, 
[normal]‘
[normal]Antimicrobial resistance seen in human medicine is primarily the result of antibiotic use in people, rather than animals, a major Government report h
[normal]as stated’
[normal] 
[normal][43]
[normal].[bold] [bold]There are many similar examples
[normal].
[normal] The VMD’s approach 
[normal]is at odds with concerns expressed in many countries and 
[normal]designed to please 
[normal]its main sources of funding. More seriously
[normal],
[normal] the phrasing of such statements 
[normal]re-enforces entrenched views and 
[normal]seriously
[normal] undermine
[normal]s
[normal] efforts to 
[normal]reduce AMR in farm animals through more judicious use of antimicrobials
[normal].
