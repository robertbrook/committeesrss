"Written evidence submitted by Sarah Teather MP (LAI 0071)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nI am the Member of Parliament for Brent Central, representing one of the most ethnically diverse \nconstituencies in the UK. I am Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Refugees and in June this year was fortunate enough to secure a Backbench Business debate in the House of Commons on the subject of legal aid.\n&#xa0;\n2.              The proposed introduction of a residence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to those with a “strong connection” with the UK&#xa0;2.1 \n              \nThe proposed residence test will leave many vulnerable individuals without the means to access the legal system. Individuals who hav\ne a legal right to challenge decisions made about them will be unable to do so. In effect, these individuals will be unequal before the law.\n \nWhile I recognise and welcome the number of exceptions to the residence test that the Government announced in their\n response to the Ministry of Justice’s consultation \nTransforming Legal Aid: delivering a more credible and efficient system\n, \neven in its amended form it will result in many vulnerable \nindividuals \nbeing unable to access the justice system. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nSchedule 1\n of the The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO) sets out the civil cases for which legal aid is currently available. During the course of LASPO, the Government argued that the types of cases included in Schedule 1 are those t\nhat most need legal aid. During a House of Commons debate on 6 September 2011, the then Minister for HM Courts Service and Legal Aid stated that “schedule 1 [of the bill] makes legal aid available for the most serious damages claims against public authorit\nies” and that \n“the Bill ensures that funding may be made available for claims regarding a breach of statutory duty or a breach of convention ri\nghts against public authorities”\n. The introduction of the residence test would mean that many individuals would not be eligible for legal aid even in those cases which the Government has previously accepted \nare the most serious. \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nAmong those groups that would be negatively affected \nby the residence test are migrant children. Those children who do not meet the resident test criteria would be unable to receive civil legal aid for cases relating to special educational needs, community care for children in need and in care, children at r\nisk from gang-related violence, child victims of sexual offences, and judicial review. The Ministry of Justice should produce a full Child Impact Assessment of the residence test.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nWomen are also likely to be disproportionately affected by the residenc\ne test. As a group, they are high \nusers of civil legal aid: over 55% of clients for civil representation are female\n. Additionally, women whose\n status is dependent on a spouse or partner would, in most cas\nes, not qualify as they would not have\n been legally\n resident in the country for 12 months.\n \nThose women who fail to meet the proposed residence test would not be eligible for support in cases that involve sexual offences, protection from harassment, equality and discrimination claims, judicial review, welfa\nre benefit appeals and cases involving the special education needs of any dependent children.\n Implementing the residence test would discriminate against women who have not been legally resident for 12 months and would also cause problems for women who do n\not have access to the documentation they need to prove their status. I believe that women who have been legally resident for less than 12 months have the same right to civil legal recourses when they are fighting discrimination, seeking protection from har\nassment or \nseeking recompense following a sexual assault as any other woman.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nAlso impacted by the residence test will be those individuals seeking asylum in the UK.\n The test as originally proposed would have meant that i\nndividuals whose claim for asyl\num is refuse\nd but who cannot be removed would have\n be\nen\n unable to access legal aid to make a new claim. \n \nThe \nnext steps\n document, at paragraph 118, welcomely \nstates that under the updated proposals legal aid will continue to be available for individuals su\nbmitting a fresh claim or making a judicial review in respect to a previous decision. \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nAlso welcome is the concession that for those individuals granted refugee status, the starting date for the 12 months continuous residence will be the time at which\n the application for asylum was made, rather than the time it was granted, which was the case under the original proposals\n.\n However, this approach still seems counterintuitive as it means that the individuals who have the strongest cases for refugee status\n will not be eligible for \ncivil legal aid for almost a year, whereas those individuals who are granted refugee status after successive appeals might never cease to be eligible for support\n.\n \nThe denial of legal aid following a successful asylum claim is part\nicularly worrying as it is frequently at this stage that individuals experience a gap in the support they are entitled to from the state and resorting to legal proceedings is often necessary. A further area for concern is that the \nnext steps\n document is un\nclear about whether the 12 month period starts from the time the initial claim is made or when the successful claim is made. \nIf it is the latter, this would disadvantage those individuals who are granted asylum but w\nhose initial claim was refused.\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n              \nThere are also practical difficulties with the proposed residence test. The proposal put forward would require legal aid providers to check the immigration status of prospective \nclien\nts, a system that closely resembles that currently used by employers. Whi\nle the Ministry of Justice documentation makes this appears to be a fairly straightforward and efficient system, my experience as a constituency MP suggests otherwise.\n&#xa0;\n2.8\n              \nThe British immigration system is extremely complex and there are many different ty\npes of immigration status and, as a result, a vast array of status documents. Whereas n\now people are issued with Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs), previously they were issued with \npaper Immigration Status Documents (ISDs) and some have either stamps or v\nignettes in their passports. As an MP who has dealt with thousands of immigration cases since being elected, I still come across unfamiliar documents. I do not believe that legal aid providers can or should be expected to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of\n immigration documents.\n&#xa0;\n2.9\n              \nOther possible issues relating to the ability of legal aid providers to check documents include cases where\n a person is granted indefinite leave to enter, \nin which cases \nthe \npassport \nstamp will have an expiry date.\n&#xa0;\n The expiry date is the date by which the person must enter the UK, however a lay person may interpret it as expiration of their leave.\n Furthermore, when an individual \nsubmits an application to the Home Office, they are requ\nired to submit their original status documents and will only have an acknowledgment sent to them.\n This would prevent that individual from being able to prove their eligibility.\n&#xa0;\n3.              The proposed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisoners&#xa0;3.1\n              \nUnder the proposals, f\nirms carrying out prison law work will have to have criminal legal aid contracts. This will almost certainly spell the end of specialist niche prison law practices. \n&#xa0;\nPrisoners already have to exhaust internal complaints remedies b\nefore they can apply for a court to review the legality of a Prison Service decision, and the courts regularly find such decisions to have been unlawful despite them having been maintained by the complaints procedures. The courts have ruled, for example, t\nhat it is unlawful for the Prison Service not to provide indeterminate prisoners with rehabilitative courses so that they can reduce their risk and progress to release, and that decisions on recategorisation and transfer have a direct impact on liberty bec\nause they can impede the prisoner's progress to release, as well as confining them to more severe conditions and difficulties maintaining family relations than may be justifiable. Such rulings are in the wider interests of society as well as to the individ\nual prisoners, and ironically are likely to have saved considerable financial and other costs in the longer term.\n Also, most of prison law will be removed from scope, including:\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nResettlement Work:\n This includes w\nork done \nto secure timely access to off\nending behaviour courses and to education and employment opportunities; ensuring that local authorities have services in place for young, elderly and disabled prisoners who are approaching release; ensuring the probation service has conducted its assessmen\nt, and checked release addresses.\n This could result in extra costs as prisoners fail to be released on time.\n For example,\n A, 15 years old, contacted the Howard League through a children’s advocate. He had behaved well in custody and was told he could be re\nleased early from his secure children’s home in two days time provided he has somewhere suitable to live. He could not go home to his dad as the local authority had obtained an ASBO restricting his movements on the estate where his dad lived. In fact, he w\nas in prison in part for breaching the ASBO after his foster care placement had broken down and the local authority had advised him to return to his dad’s. The Howard League for Penal Reform were able to write \nan urgent letter to the local authority remind\ning them of their duties. As a result he was released to a children’s home.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nDisciplinary hearings:\n These can impose hefty penalties on prisoners, or alter conditions of detention including solitary confinement or added days. Legal aid would remain whe\nn the Tarrant criteria are met – i.e. adjudications dealt with by a Prison Governor, but these are very rare. Proceedings are highly formal and legalistic. \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nAdditionally, the removal of most prison law from the scope of legal aid will place extra burd\nens on the Prison Ombudsman. However, the judgements of the Ombudsman are not binding, nor does it have the same powers as the court to award damages or to require remedial action. The Government should continue to provide legal aid for prison law cases.\n&#xa0;\n4.              The proposal that providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceed&#xa0;4.1\n              \nThe process of judicial review is a \nkey check and balance on the actions \nand decisions \nof \npublic bodies\n. The ability to instruct legal representation is necessary for \nthe vast majority of\n individuals to \naffectively \naccess the judicial review process.\n \nThe approach outlined in the \nTransforming Legal Aid \nconsultation\n will make it more difficult for people to find representation because of the increased risks to providers. As judicial review processes are “front-loaded” (i.e. most of the work for the case is done prior to the applicat\nion for permission), the proposals mean that providers will be risking not getting paid for substantial amounts of work. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nThis includes instances where claims would have previously been settled before reaching court as the local authority o\nr\n governmen\nt department in question agrees to settle. The effect will be to make providers more litigious to ensure that they are paid, rather than relying on seeking cost orders. This will mean that cases that would not have reached court previously will now have to\n be heard by the court, putting extra strain on court time.  \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nProviders will also not be able to take on as many judicial review cases as they do currently as the increased risks will not make it financially viable. The outcomes of permission applicat\nions are hard to predict and events can overtake proceedings. This means that even cases which appear clear cut carry a degree of risk. Providers will have to reduce their judicial review caseload in order to reduce their exposure to risk. \nFollowing the co\nnsultation, t\nhe\n \nGovernment i\nntends to modify this proposal by introducing\n discretion to permit the Legal Aid Agency to pay providers in certain cases\n \nconcluding prior to a permission decision without a costs order or agreement.\n However, this is unlikely to\n provide the certainty that providers require in order to take on cases.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nThe financial savings of this proposal are, according to the impact assessment, just £1 million from a legal aid budget of nearly £2 billion. The human cost, however, is far grea\nter \nand t\nhe overall impact of this proposal will be to prevent individuals being able to challenge the decisions taken by local authorities and government departments. The i\nmportance of this change should not\n be overlooked. \n              \n \n&#xa0;\n5.              The proposal that legal aid should be removed for all cases assessed as having “borderline” prospects of success.&#xa0;5.1\n              \nIn the \nnext steps\n documents, the Government argue that public funding should not be expended on cases that do not have at least a 50% chance of success. \nBorderli\nne cases (those cases of which it is not possible to tell the likely success of the case) are\n, under the Government’s proposals,\n removed from scope. Borderline cases are those which are not unclear but, by reason of disputed law, fact or expert evidence, i\nt is not possible to decide that the chances of success are greater than 50% or that the prospects for success are poor. Due to this uncertainty, these cases are sometimes very important as they are test cases\n,\n \ncreate precedents and in doing so clarify the\n law. \nPreventing these cases from being brought will prevent legal assessment of the most important issues of the day, and will unfairly let the \nG\novernment clarify the law when individuals cannot.\n The Government should continue to fund borderline cases in \nthe same way that it currently does.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n \nSee paragraph 125 of \nTransforming legal aid: next steps\n \nhttps://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/transforming-legal-aid-next-steps/supporti\nng_documents/transforminglegalaidnextstepsweb1.pdf\n \nLegal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders bill Deb, 6 September 2011, c328\n \nLegal Aid statistics 2012-13\n"
