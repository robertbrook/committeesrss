defaultWritten evidence from the Police for Crime Commissioner for Northamptonshire [CST0075]default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThank you for your letter of 6
defaultth
default December regarding the Public Administration Select
default 
defaultCommittee's ongoing inquiry into Crime Statistics.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have been following the progress of your inquiry closely over the past few months
default 
defaultand look forward to reading the Select Committee's final report and recommendations
default 
defaultin due course.
default&#xa0;
defaultFirstly, I recognise that the accurate recording of crime statistics plays a vital role in
default 
defaultensuring public confidence in policing and is vital to informing operational decision
default 
defaultmaking, a view which I know is shared by my Chief Constable.
default&#xa0;
defaultSecondly, turning to the questions that you have raised in your letter, I am aware that
default 
defaultin the past policing has been heavily target focussed something which I am not
default 
defaultparticularly keen to reintroduce at a local level, especially following the Home
default 
defaultSecretary's decision to remove centrally appointed targets.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat targets if any do you set for your Police Force?default&#xa0;
defaultI think it is important that you define what you mean by 'target'. The abolished targets
default 
defaultHMG refers to set up a perverse performance culture where by it was all about the
default 
defaulttarget and not the outcome - process over people.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have set one specific numerical target in my Police and Crime Plan. I want to see at
default 
defaultleast a 40% reduction in violent crime offences across our county.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen I was first elected as Police and Crime Commissioner, Northamptonshire had
default 
defaultthe same level of violence offences as Merseyside, Greater Manchester and the West
default 
defaultMidlands.
default&#xa0;
defaultI am sure you will agree that Northamptonshire has little in common with such places.
default 
defaultFor example, they face significant additional pressure on their resources in part due to
default 
defaulttheir more urban environments.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 40% reduction is merely a way of describing the kind of transformational change
default 
defaultI want to see. Also it is a challenge to the whole system - not just the Police. For
default 
defaultinstance what will the CPS contribution be to meet that reduction? Prisons? Etc.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat impact do you think this has on police recording of crime practices?default&#xa0;defaultMy hope in setting such an ambitious target is to focus minds on the enormity of the
default 
defaultchallenge we face in making Northamptonshire the Safest Place in England and
default 
defaultNorthamptonshire Police the best performing force in the Country.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are a number of checks and balances Police Forces have to contend with
default 
defaultincluding the Home Office, IPCC, HMIC, the General Public and the Police and
default 
defaultCrime Commissioner.
default&#xa0;
defaultI do not feel that the one specific numerical target I have set for the Force creates any
default 
defaultadditional pressure on the Police. It is however a fact that my Police and Crime Plan,
default 
defaultmy strategic direction and support of the Chief Constable has resulted in the fastest
default 
defaultfall in crime than anywhere in the UK over the last twelve months.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo me that is the best indication of what I'm doing works.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow do you assure yourself that recorded crime figures in your area aredefault defaultcorrect?default&#xa0;defaultThe recording of crime statistics is first and foremost a matter that sits under the
default 
defaultdirection and control of the Chief Constable.
default&#xa0;
defaultPolice recorded crime is an important indicator of Force performance and is used in
default 
defaultthe performance and accountability meetings that are held between my Office and the
default 
defaultPolice Force.
default&#xa0;
defaultA protocol has been established between myself and the Chief Constable which
default 
defaultdescribes how I will hold him accountable for performance. This is built on a trusting
default 
defaultrelationship that the data and information provided to the Office of the Police and
default 
defaultCrime Commissioner by the Force is accurate. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo what extent can you trust the statistics for your area?default&#xa0;defaultDespite National Crime Recording Standards, there is not a level playing field when
default 
defaultcomparing forces. This is due to the fact that the same crime in one force area can be
default 
defaultsubject to different recording practices in another. As a result, those making
default 
defaultjudgements on statistics alone might assess Northamptonshire Police as a Force that is
default 
defaultperforming poorly.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe force has set up a National Crime Recording Standards (NCRS) group led by an
default 
defaultAssistant Chief Constable to "ensure a professional, ethical and pragmatic approach to
default 
defaultthe recording of crime to provide a policing service with integrity". This group is
default 
defaultformed by core parts of the organisation responsible for data quality, crime
default 
defaultmanagement and investigation. This group meets quarterly to review performance,
default 
defaultaddresses areas of concern and commissions data quality audits. Audits conducted
default 
defaultduring 2013 include: robbery, threats to kill, domestic burglary, vehicle crime,
default 
defaultharassment and Section 5 Public Order Act and criminal damage to dwellings. This
default 
defaulthelps the Force to understand current recording practices and make any necessary
default 
defaultchanges, it is worth noting that few crimes have been reclassified or cancelled
default 
defaultsuggesting the Force's recording for these crimes is accurate.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt-the beginning of2013, the force adopted an 'investigate to record' practice, which
default 
defaultis applied by other forces, which has coincided with an impact on recorded crime
default 
defaultfigures. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabularies have identified this issue and
default 
defaultare investigating to determine the extent of these changes and to what extent the
default 
defaultreductions reported are 'real'. The Force has reassured me that crime recording retains
default 
defaultthe highest of standards and integrity.
default&#xa0;
defaultI trust that this provides the clarity that you were looking for. If I can be of any further
default 
defaultassistance in the future, please do not hesitate to contact me.
