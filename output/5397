&#xa0;
[normal]Written evidence from the Police for Crime Commissioner for Northamptonshire [CST0075][bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for your letter of 6
[normal]th
[normal] December regarding the Public Administration Select
[normal] 
[normal]Committee's ongoing inquiry into Crime Statistics.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have been following the progress of your inquiry closely over the past few months
[normal] 
[normal]and look forward to reading the Select Committee's final report and recommendations
[normal] 
[normal]in due course.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Firstly, I recognise that the accurate recording of crime statistics plays a vital role in
[normal] 
[normal]ensuring public confidence in policing and is vital to informing operational decision
[normal] 
[normal]making, a view which I know is shared by my Chief Constable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Secondly, turning to the questions that you have raised in your letter, I am aware that
[normal] 
[normal]in the past policing has been heavily target focussed something which I am not
[normal] 
[normal]particularly keen to reintroduce at a local level, especially following the Home
[normal] 
[normal]Secretary's decision to remove centrally appointed targets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What targets if any do you set for your Police Force?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I think it is important that you define what you mean by 'target'. The abolished targets
[normal] 
[normal]HMG refers to set up a perverse performance culture where by it was all about the
[normal] 
[normal]target and not the outcome - process over people.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have set one specific numerical target in my Police and Crime Plan. I want to see at
[normal] 
[normal]least a 40% reduction in violent crime offences across our county.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When I was first elected as Police and Crime Commissioner, Northamptonshire had
[normal] 
[normal]the same level of violence offences as Merseyside, Greater Manchester and the West
[normal] 
[normal]Midlands.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am sure you will agree that Northamptonshire has little in common with such places.
[normal] 
[normal]For example, they face significant additional pressure on their resources in part due to
[normal] 
[normal]their more urban environments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 40% reduction is merely a way of describing the kind of transformational change
[normal] 
[normal]I want to see. Also it is a challenge to the whole system - not just the Police. For
[normal] 
[normal]instance what will the CPS contribution be to meet that reduction? Prisons? Etc.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What impact do you think this has on police recording of crime practices?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]My hope in setting such an ambitious target is to focus minds on the enormity of the
[normal] 
[normal]challenge we face in making Northamptonshire the Safest Place in England and
[normal] 
[normal]Northamptonshire Police the best performing force in the Country.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are a number of checks and balances Police Forces have to contend with
[normal] 
[normal]including the Home Office, IPCC, HMIC, the General Public and the Police and
[normal] 
[normal]Crime Commissioner.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I do not feel that the one specific numerical target I have set for the Force creates any
[normal] 
[normal]additional pressure on the Police. It is however a fact that my Police and Crime Plan,
[normal] 
[normal]my strategic direction and support of the Chief Constable has resulted in the fastest
[normal] 
[normal]fall in crime than anywhere in the UK over the last twelve months.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To me that is the best indication of what I'm doing works.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How do you assure yourself that recorded crime figures in your area are[bold] [bold]correct?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The recording of crime statistics is first and foremost a matter that sits under the
[normal] 
[normal]direction and control of the Chief Constable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Police recorded crime is an important indicator of Force performance and is used in
[normal] 
[normal]the performance and accountability meetings that are held between my Office and the
[normal] 
[normal]Police Force.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A protocol has been established between myself and the Chief Constable which
[normal] 
[normal]describes how I will hold him accountable for performance. This is built on a trusting
[normal] 
[normal]relationship that the data and information provided to the Office of the Police and
[normal] 
[normal]Crime Commissioner by the Force is accurate. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To what extent can you trust the statistics for your area?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Despite National Crime Recording Standards, there is not a level playing field when
[normal] 
[normal]comparing forces. This is due to the fact that the same crime in one force area can be
[normal] 
[normal]subject to different recording practices in another. As a result, those making
[normal] 
[normal]judgements on statistics alone might assess Northamptonshire Police as a Force that is
[normal] 
[normal]performing poorly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The force has set up a National Crime Recording Standards (NCRS) group led by an
[normal] 
[normal]Assistant Chief Constable to "ensure a professional, ethical and pragmatic approach to
[normal] 
[normal]the recording of crime to provide a policing service with integrity". This group is
[normal] 
[normal]formed by core parts of the organisation responsible for data quality, crime
[normal] 
[normal]management and investigation. This group meets quarterly to review performance,
[normal] 
[normal]addresses areas of concern and commissions data quality audits. Audits conducted
[normal] 
[normal]during 2013 include: robbery, threats to kill, domestic burglary, vehicle crime,
[normal] 
[normal]harassment and Section 5 Public Order Act and criminal damage to dwellings. This
[normal] 
[normal]helps the Force to understand current recording practices and make any necessary
[normal] 
[normal]changes, it is worth noting that few crimes have been reclassified or cancelled
[normal] 
[normal]suggesting the Force's recording for these crimes is accurate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At-the beginning of2013, the force adopted an 'investigate to record' practice, which
[normal] 
[normal]is applied by other forces, which has coincided with an impact on recorded crime
[normal] 
[normal]figures. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabularies have identified this issue and
[normal] 
[normal]are investigating to determine the extent of these changes and to what extent the
[normal] 
[normal]reductions reported are 'real'. The Force has reassured me that crime recording retains
[normal] 
[normal]the highest of standards and integrity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I trust that this provides the clarity that you were looking for. If I can be of any further
[normal] 
[normal]assistance in the future, please do not hesitate to contact me.
