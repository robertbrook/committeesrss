default 
defaultThis is a submission to the Commons Select Committee enquiry on passenger transport in isolated communities on behalf of Norfolk Community Transport Association (NCTA).  NCTA is a membership organisation of individual community transport operators in 
defaultNorfo

defaultFifteen operators are running one or more minibuses.  The largest operator has a fleet of over 60 buses and the smallest have one 
defaultor two buses, which primarily offer transport to the activities run by the member organisation.  Seven operators run transport provision only.
default  These organisations operate on Section 19 or Section 22 licences and include paid and volunteer drivers.
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default 
defaultFifty-
defaulteight operators run community car schemes only  These are delivered by volunteer drivers using their own cars and are supported by voluntary co-ordinators (in about three organisations there is a paid, part time co-ordinator) and voluntary management commi
defaultttees/trustees.

default 
defaultNorfolk County Council currently provides £283,350 in grants to 
defaultsome of 
defaultthese operators and has additionally 
defaultbeen 
defaultawarded contracts to provide specific services such as operating
default demand responsive transport, school transport 
defaultetc
default.  Some district councils provide funding to 
defaultoperators to subsidise the cost of the journey for the individual passenger
default, for health purposes
default.  Some parish councils also offer a subsidy in their areas.
default&#xa0;
default2.6.
default 
defaultCommunity Transport Operators are independent community based organisations that have been set up by groups of local people responding to community needs.  Some in 
defaultNorfolk
default have been running for over 20 years.  Some are thriving with pools of up to 50 volun
defaultteer drivers while some are struggling, unable to recruit new drivers and not seeking to offer a service to people other than existing, long-term users.  As a result, coverage within the county is inconsistent, in terms of where 
defaulto
defaultperators ar
defaulte based and wha
defaultt their offer is 
default(some CTO
defaults support volunteers with the offer of free transport in return for their volunteering role.  This assists those who 
defaulthave been long term unemployed
default to evidence their commitment to developing skills and experience and 
defaultcan 
defaultresult in
default them being offered paid employment).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default 
defaultBus operators provide a range of services including traditional door-to-door, dial-a-ride services in accessible minibuses.  Passengers book a journey and are co
defaultllected from their home, taken to their destination
default,
default collected 
defaultand taken home again at a pre-arranged time.  They pay a fare and drivers (or passenger assistants) help them on and off the 
defaultbus, 
defaultcarry shopping and ensure they are secured in their seats befor
defaulte departing.
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default 
defaultBus operators also deliver services to Norfolk County Council and others, including a demand responsive transport service called ‘
defaultFlexibus
default’ in 
default5
default parts of Norfolk; school transport, particularly for those needing accessible vehicles, adult soc
defaultial care journeys, such as to day centres, etc.  These are contracts awarded in a competitive environment.
default  Some CTs provide feeder services to other transport hubs, particularly from isolated rural communities  
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default 
defaultCar Schemes are focused particularly on he
defaultalth based journeys, including to doctors’ surgeries, hospital appointments, dentists, opticians, chiropodists, etc.  So
defaultme also take people shopping or 
defaultto community based 
defaultand well-being 
defaultactivities.  They are based in a specific geographic area
defaults
default and offer s
defaultervices only to people living in a particular parish, village or market town.  
default&#xa0;
default3.4.
default 
defaultMost of the passengers 
defaultusing community transport 
defaultare older people, people with a disability or a health problem.  Many are 
defaultmuch older people aged 80+ and a significant proport

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default 
defaultThe key factors influencing the environment in which community transport is operating in 
defaultNorfolk
default are:
default&#xa0;
default4.1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn aging population – as well as national demographics, 
defaultNorfolk
default is a popular retirement area.  Most rural districts have 
defaultp
defaultopulations of people aged over 75 that are significantly higher than the national average (fig 1)
default. The figure for

defaultFig 2
default&#xa0;
default4.1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDecreasing access to funded hospital transport – although it is claimed that the eligibility criteria have not changed, there is extensive reported evidence that criteria are being applied
default more narrowly,
default to limit access to this service.  The result is a si
defaultgnificant increase in demand for community transport.  One of our members, North Norfolk Community Transport, reports 
defaultjust under 
defaulta 
default200
default% increase in demand for its 
defaultMedi
defaultride
default service in the 
defaultpast two
default year
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDecreasing public funding for investment in voluntar
defaulty organisations at a time of recession, means that they are having to do more with less.  Norfolk County Council is maintaining its grant 
defaultfund for co
defaultmmunity transport in the next
default financial year but is able to make no guarantees for the position 
defaultbeyond Marc
defaulth 2015
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.1.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIncreasing requirements by funders for operators to meet requirements such as all drivers having Disclosure and Barring Service checks.  Although NCTA offers our members free checks for volunteer drivers, this is still an additional effort for vol
defaultunteers to go through the checks and to co-ordinate the process.  Whilst these checks are undoubtedly necessary, they are time consuming and some volunteers are reluctant to go through the process.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default 
defaultNCTA undertook a piece of research in autumn 2012 
defaultin 17 i
defaultdentified parishes
default in the centre of the county to support a funding bid we were making for a new demand responsive transport service in that area
default. 
default 
defaultWe circulated links to an on line survey and additionally distributed 464 hard copies and others were circul
defaultated by Parish Clerks.  We received 109 returns.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default 
defaultThe headline findings 
defaultwe
defaultre:
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
default 
defaultThe most important aspects 
defaultof the service were the hours of
default operation (82%), availability at weekends (64%) and booking at short notice (45%).  40% of respondents said that home 
defaultpick ups
default were important to them.
default&#xa0;
default4.5.
default 
defaultPeople made comments about how ba
defaultdly a bus service was needed in the area, how they felt isolated and that journeys were long and difficult and also expensive.  Respondents with disabilities and those with caring responsibilities for others were particularly supportive of the prospective 
defaultservice.
default&#xa0;
default4.6.
default 
defaultThe biggest demand for transport expressed in NCC’s survey was in the areas of accessing essential services and socialising and meeting family and friends.  These were seen 
defaulta
defaults important indicators in people’s well being.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default 
defaultThere are a number of factors that limit community transport from playing a wider role in delivering transport services.  The limitations do not include enthusiasm and a willingness to deliver.  
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default 
defaultThere is a limit to what volunteers ca
defaultn be expected to do.  Most volunteers do not want to work early in the morning, late in the evening or at weekends.  This limits the services that can be offered by volunteer dependent operators.
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
default 
defaultCTOs
default tend to work in very specific areas and if there is no
default scheme in a particular community, it cannot be imposed from a top down position.  This can result in areas of need not having access to a CT scheme while more affluent communities, with more access to volunteers with nice cars, have thriving schemes.
default&#xa0;
default5.4.
default 
defaultMan
defaulty potential passengers cannot afford longer journeys in a CT vehicle, even though they are cheaper than commercial alternatives.  Many people in 
defaultNorfolk
default live 20 miles or more from a major hospital, which would result in a round trip costing around £18.  Ou
defaultt of county trips to specialist hospitals such as 
defaultPapworth
default could cost around £90 (this might be reduced if a subsidy is available but the passenger would still have to pay £45).
default&#xa0;
default5.5.
default 
defaultOnly CTOs running buses with Section 22 licences are eligible to accept 
defaultconcessionary travel passes.  This limits their ability to offer affordable transport to some of the most disadvantaged groups of people in the community and means that some operators have extra
default administration from running two
default different types of licence.
default&#xa0;
default5.6.
default 
defaultCTOs experienced a significant drop in demand for services purchased by adult social services department as a result in cuts to local government funding affecting day centres.  Many of these have closed with the result that some 
defaultisolated individuals have n
defaultowhere to go and no opportunity to use the transport that is available to them.  CTOs had a sudden drop in income that has affected their ability to run sustainable services.
default  
defaultThe introduction of personalised budgets has also had an impact on CTOs as previ
defaultous contracts to provide transport for groups of people from Social Services departments have ended and there is no automatic inclusion of transport costs when individuals plan and agree their budgets.  Some people are making the decision to buy their tran
defaultsport from a range of sources.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1.
default 
defaultThere are a number of barriers faced by Community Transport Operators in 
defaultNorfolk
default.  The main ones are:
default&#xa0;
default6.1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe commissioning agenda – CTOs are seeking full cost recovery from 
defaultcontracts so that other areas of income are not cross-subsidising local authority contracts.  They are competing against commercial providers who are putting in very low bids that are acting as a loss leader.  Sometimes this results in these organisations 
defaulthaving to withdraw from contracts before completion.  Norfolk County Council is seeking to cut their costs and
default many standard contracts are awarded
default only on the basis of price rather than value for money.  The Public Services (Social Value) Act is having lim
defaultited impact in changing this culture although a recent transport contract did include social criteria.  CTOs will not bid for contracts if they don’t make 
defaultan operating surplus
default from them
default.  
defaultThe majority of c
defaultontracts issued by NCC tend to be short term (1 yea
defaultr) that do not enable contract holders to develop long term plans
default&#xa0;
default6.1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack of engagement by health providers in CT.  GP surgeries and hospitals 
defaulta
defaultr
defaulte the main organisational beneficiaries of community transport but make no financial contribution to the services
default.  CTOs could help to reduce costs of non emergency medical transport to the ambulance service, freeing resources to concentrate on emergency services.
default  This would also achieve other cost savings for health providers.
default&#xa0;
default6.1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecruiting volunteers – this is a con
defaultstant concern for all types of CTO.  As described above, the volunteer profile is aging and 
defaultsome schemes are not able to recruit younger volunteers.
default  
defaultThere is a lack of trustee volunteers coming forward to take over from aging ones 
defaulton
default CT
defaultO
default 
defaultboards
default.
default  
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaulttravel expenses
default rate for volunteers is set at 45p for 
defaultup to
default10,000 miles
default.
default 
default B
defaulteyond this, the volunteer is deemed to be in profit and is not insured. This limits the amount a volunteer car driver can
default&#xa0;
defaultdo
default,
default particularly with the increase in the longer runs for h
defaultospital car journeys.
default&#xa0;
default6.1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn aging fleet of vehicles – a recent audit undertaken by NCTA identified that 70% of the bus fleet is between 5 – 10 years old and 27% is over 10 years old
default&#xa0;
default6.1.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChanges to D1 status of driving licences – this is a problem that is beginn
defaulting to occur as drivers who passed their tests after 
default1996
default n
defaulteed to take an additional test to be eligible to drive a minibus.  This costs over £1000 per driver and poses a significant extra cost for CTOs.  It also reinforces the dependency on older drivers 
defaultwho have D1 status on their licences
default.  
defaultCTO
defaults could attract younger drivers, pay for them to take the additional test to drive minibuses, only to lose them to commercial operators.  The CTO would then have to begin the recruitment process from scratch
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.1.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultReq
defaultuired training for each driver includes:
default&#xa0;
default6.1.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdditional costs of providing accessible services, such as t
defaulthe 
defaultprice
default of fully accessible vehicles compared to standard minibuses – a new
default,
default standard vehicle can cost in the region of £18 – 20,000 
defaultcompared to £
default38 – 40,000 for a fully accessible minibus.
default&#xa0;
default6.1.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommercial operators tend to carry a maximum of one designated 
defaultwheelchair on any journey.  This is reflecte
defaultd in their fare structure.  
defaultS
defaultome CTOs carry multiple large customised wheelchairs, scooters and mobility aids.  This restricts the amount of fare paying passengers.  A 16 
defaultseater
default fully accessible minibus can only 
defaultaccommodate seven passengers due to the 
defaultnumber
default of wheelchair mobility aids.
default&#xa0;
default6.1.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe time it takes the majority of passengers to get from their door onto the bus, to find their seat and put their seat belt on.  For individuals who travel in their wheelchair
defaults,
default 
defaultadditional time is required to apply all the safety restraints (6) for each wheelchair.  Those passengers who need a wheelchair or scooter to get from their house to the bus and 
defaultfrom the bus, 
defaultonce they have arrived 
defaultat their destination
default,
default take considerably l
defaultonger and therefore each journey is less time efficient than a similar journey undertaken by a commercial operator
default&#xa0;
default6.1.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn additional cost for CTOs is for safety equipment suc
defaulth as wheelchair restraints (front and back), wheel chair occupant safety seat belt re
defaultstraints, seat belt extensions.  The cost is on average £600 per wheelchair.  Some CTOs have up to £3,000 of additional safety equipment on each bus.
default&#xa0;
default6.2.
default 
defaultIn general, CTOs face the same issues as many other third sector organisations including an increasingly 
defaultcompetitive bidding process to win grant funding and the processes taking an increasing amount of time with more and more complexity in completing each application.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.1.
default 
defaultIn order to overcome these barriers, the following actions could be taken:
default&#xa0;
default7.1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIncrease skills within CTOs to bid for and win contracts
default&#xa0;
default7.1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPublic authorities take social value into account when issuing contracts, publish full details about when current 
defaultcontracts are due for renewal and bidding processes are advertised in good time.  Contracts are awarded on the basis of value for money over the lifetime of the contract rather than the lowest price
default&#xa0;
default7.1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultContracts should be offered for 
defaultlonger periods, ideally 
defaulta 
defaultminimum 
defaultfive year term
default (with an option to extend a further 3 years)
default,
default which will 
defaultenable CTOs to plan over longer periods and become more sustainable businesses.
default&#xa0;
default7.1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal support 
defaultshould
default 
defaultbe 
defaultavailable to assist in the recruitment of volunteers
default specifically for
default driving
default&#xa0;
default7.1.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInvestment funds are available to enable CTOs to buy new vehicles (Norfolk County Council is currently offering a Small Vehicles Fund of £250
default,000 but this is a one off oppo
defaultrtunity
default).  This should be conditional upon CTOs operating a depreciation p
defaultolicy with a vehicle replacement fund in their budgets.
default&#xa0;
default7.1.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment sh
defaultould review the D1 status on driving licenses or set up a ring fenced fund for CTOs to access funds for training drivers to drive minibuses.
default&#xa0;
default7.1.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment should review the LTA Section
default19 s
defaultervice so that all CTOs are eligible to accept concessionary bus passes  without having to apply for and run a section 22 route.
default7.1.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe growing movement towards setting up local community transport forums should be recognised as highly beneficial to the secto
defaultr and supported to develop and grow.  The benefits of this kind of support are identified below.
