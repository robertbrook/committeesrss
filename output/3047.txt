&#xa0;Written evidence from the Royal Academy on Engineering (SRN 034)&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]This submission is in response to a call for evidence on an inquiry into the strategic road network. The Royal Academy has chosen to respond only to one area of the multiple questions raised by the committee: “How should the Highways Agency be reformed to make it ‘the world’s leading highway operator’? What roles should Government and the private sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network?”&#xa0;The points below reflect discussions among members of the Royal Academy of Engineering’s Transport Community of Practice, concerning the importance of independent technical advice and in-house technical knowledge and skills within both the Highways Agency and Department for Transport.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;October 20131&#xa0;
