[[[Andrew Kidd (BRC 65)]]]&#xa0;I have viewed all of the DCLG Select Committee meeting available regarding Building Regulations appertaining to electrical work in dwellings and am astounded.&#xa0;I am a duly elected Regional Representative of the NAPIT Trade Association bound by the limitations of a non-disclosure agreement, I am therefore presenting my views in a personal capacity as a qualified electrician with over 30 years experience in the trade. I am currently registered with the NAPIT Competent Persons Scheme.&#xa0;Firstly I have to say that the reality of the Part P “industry” appears to be contained within the evidence that the industry has NOT presented to you.&#xa0;

[[[SUMMARY]]]&#xa0;It has been stated that the electrical industry is complicated – the reality is that it is as complicated as the vested interests have made it for their own commercial advantage.&#xa0;1. The Basic principle of a trained, qualified and experienced individual working, often unsupervised, in the homes of the public is simple and straightforward. The complications arise due to the way various bodies have set out to systematically mislead both the public and Parliament with regards fulfilling public expectation. The public are fully aware of what training, qualifications, experience and abilities an “electrician” should possess – so the “industry” has been more than willing to present their members as “electricians” without actually fulfilling said public expectation. This is a far, far more profitable approach ....&#xa0;2. In my considerable experience, the probability of domestic electrical work complying with the Wiring Regulations (BS7671 – the British Standard against which electrical installation work is certified as compliant) is primarily determined by whether or not the INSTALLER that actually carried out the work is a trained, qualified and experienced electrician. The issue of Competent Person Scheme membership appears to be a near irrelevance. &#xa0;3. How can an individual be competent if they are unable to actually carry out the work the British Standard that they are certifying against?  The corner stone of competence MUST be the ability to actually DO the work – currently it is not.4. The Part P Schemes will not admit that their membership includes “five day wonders” – so where HAVE they all gone - as by my estimate over 80% of new Registrants to electrical Competent Persons Schemes since 2005 have been the same “five day wonders”.&#xa0;5. What training, qualifications and experience DO the “assessed individuals” actually possess?&#xa0;6. It is unfeasible that an inexperienced individual can be competent after only having undertaken a few days training. &#xa0;7. Quite how work carried out by an untrained, inexperienced operative under the “supervision” of a totally absent “Qualified Supervisor” is absurd. The Electrical Installation Certificates (EIC`s)  accompanying much of this work are totally inaccurate (bordering on fraudulent) or not even appropriate, quite often including details of safety devices that do not exist yet with “test results” obtained for them!&#xa0;8. In reality it takes an electrician to know if electrical work is compliant with BS7671 (not merely an “inspector”) – yet it is the non-competent householder who is held responsible for meeting the Building Regulations and raising any complaint.&#xa0;9. The issue of complaints deteriorates into farce. The Part P “industry” assesses it`s own members (but does not actually certify them as “competent”) AND runs it`s own complaints procedures. There is NO independence or impartiality at all. The concept that UKAS Accreditation will address such issues has already proven to be nonsense.&#xa0;10. UKAS merely accredits an entity against the policies and procedures that they are presented with – yet these same policies and procedures can be, and are, written by the Part P industry themselves.&#xa0;11. It must be noted that with regards monitoring of the Scheme Operators there appears only to be a requirement for the Schemes to document their CAPACITY to both meet their Terms of Authorisation and manage any conflicts of interest. No mention is made of monitoring whether (or not) the said Terms of Authorisation are ACTUALLY met or if conflicts of interest are ACTUALLY avoided or dealt with effectively.&#xa0;12. Surely UKAS cannot both accredit AND monitor the same organisation?&#xa0;13. The current, abysmal, state of the industry is due in no small part to the belief by the Schemes that the truth will never come out as any wide-scale misconduct or malpractice can be dismissed as a series of “one-offs”.&#xa0;Fortunately, there ARE informed individuals, such as myself, who will NOT be intimidated by the arrogance and greed shown by the Scheme Operators and ARE prepared to appear before your committee to present a fuller and fair picture of the current state of the industry – devoid of such vacuus marketing phrases as “customer proposition” (whatever it means!).&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
