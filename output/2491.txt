[[[Scottish Women’s Aid]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[1.0 Introduction]]]1.1 Scottish Women’s Aid is the lead organisation in Scotland working towards the prevention of domestic abuse. We represent the collective voice of our 36 member groups who provide refuge accommodation and a range of support services to women, children and young people escaping domestic abuse. Scottish Women’s Aid campaigns to stop domestic abuse; improve the protection and provision of services for women and children experiencing domestic abuse and provides evidence and ‘expert view’ input to the government and policy makers at a national and local level.We welcome the opportunity to provide evidence to the Work and Pensions Select Committee Inquiry into the provision of support to meet housing costs in the reformed welfare system. 

[[[2. Summary]]]Women’s Aid in Scotland supports thousands of women and children every year, with over 500 women a week making contact with Women’s Aid for the first time for support, refuge accommodation, information or advice. Vulnerable women and children across Scotland face growing difficulties accessing and sustaining the support and hosing they need due to the cumulative impact of welfare reform. Our members are reporting concerns about the following aspects of welfare reform which particularly impact upon women and children trying to escape domestic abuse:&#xa0;

[[[are dealt with under welfare reform]]]3.1 Scottish Women’s Aid welcomed the announcement by Ministers to the Committee in September 2012 that ‘exempt accommodation’ would be dealt with outside of Universal Credit and would be part of a localised system in the longer term. 3.2 However, not all supported accommodation qualifies as ‘supported exempt accommodation’ (SEA). The definition of SEA, excludes supported accommodation owned by a local authority. It also only applies if support is provided on behalf of the landlord, current commissioning practice is for local authorities (as funders) to procure support services directly from the support provider, the landlord (an RSL) is not normally involved in this process.&#xa0;3.3 In April 2013, Lord Freud, Minister for Welfare Reform, wrote to Scottish Women’s Aid stating that the Government intends to protect supported housing such as refuge accommodation from Universal Credit changes and will be developing solutions to this. While we welcome this decision we are still awaiting details of the interim solution, which is likely to include a revision of the SEA definition, but remain apprehensive that a revised definition will continue to exclude local authority owned supported accommodation.&#xa0;3.4 In the longer term the likelihood is that a new system will devolve funding to the Scottish Government. We are concerned about the impact of this on the future financial stability of refuge accommodation:current costs of supported housing.&#xa0;3.5 In Scotland almost a third of refuge accommodation is owned by local authorities and does not qualify as exempt. The majority of local authorities have continued to exempt this accommodation from the under occupation charge for this financial year, while they await the outcome of the DWP’s consultation on housing benefit and supported accommodation. In some areas, however, there has already been an impact on refuge services, for example;3.6 The ‘bedroom tax’ is severely limiting the options for women moving on from refuge due to the lack of availability of one bedroom accommodation. In one area women in refuge have been told that the waiting list for one bedroom properties is 3 years. The delay in women moving on from refuge means services struggle to accommodate women and children at the point of crisis.  Many Women’s Aid services report having to operate waiting lists and this inability to offer safe accommodation when it is needed greatly increases the risk to women and children.3.7 Refuge services in Scotland are already unable to meet demand; our annual census day survey found that 2 out of 3 women were unable to get a refuge space for themselves and their children because of the lack of safe or suitable space. Where women are not able to access refuge accommodation for themselves of their children when they need to they may be at risk of returning to abusive partners or forced to accept unsuitable bed and breakfast accommodation through a local authority which no longer has access to appropriate temporary self-contained accommodation.3.8 We are very concerned that women may be prevented from leaving an abusive partner because they fear they will be unable to pay for alternative accommodation. In one area a Women’s Aid service has reported a woman returning to her abusive partner after being offered a two bedroom flat by the local authority, as she feared not being able to pay the ‘bedroom tax’ and getting into debt.

[[[Pressure on Women’s Aid services as a result of ]]]

[[[welfare reforms ]]]4.1 Women’s Aid services in Scotland are reporting women presenting for support with increasingly complex problems, requiring support to deal with online benefit claims, appeals, sanctions, debt and housing issues arising from the ‘bedroom tax’. Our members reported a 70% increase in demand for their services in the last year; that they are struggling to meet. We are concerned that the essential support services Women’s Aid provides to help women and children recover and rebuild their lives is being diverted into responding to urgent welfare benefit issues resulting from recent reforms.It is essential that alongside the introduction of sweeping changes to the welfare benefits system the Government provides sufficient and accessible advice services to respond to the needs of vulnerable people affected by these reforms. At present it is the severely overstretched voluntary sector that is being relied on to meet that need.

[[[5.0 Increased poverty ]]]5.1 Women’s Aid workers are working with an increasing number of women coming to them who have no money; this is due to the length of time claims are taking to process, ESA appeals and benefit sanctions. These sanctions are at times the result of DWP staff being unaware of the JSA Domestic Violence Easement, which exempts victims of domestic abuse from job seeking conditions and requirements for up to 13 weeks.  Recent research by the DWP found low levels of awareness or promotion of the exemption in Job Centre offices. Where possible Women’s Aid services will provide small emergency loans but have very limited resources to do this with and are aware that these are unlikely to be recovered. We are also aware that women in these situations are being increasingly advised to go to food banks, in rural areas of Scotland many women lack the means to travel to food banks.Women experiencing domestic abuse face considerable barriers in trying to leave an abusive partner, access to refuge at the point they make that decision is crucial, as is the possibility of finding and affording a home at a future date. The current reforms to the benefits system are impacting adversely on women’s ability to access refuge and move onto to rebuild their lives.Scottish Women’s Aid is continuing to call on the Government to ensure that all refuge services are treated as exempt supported accommodation.27 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; http://www.scottishwomensaid.org.uk/sites/default/files/SWA%20Census%20Leaflet%202012%20v2.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/208123/rrep843.pdf
