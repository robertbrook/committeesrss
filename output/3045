[normal]WD 01[bold]Written Evidence [bold]from [bold][***] [bold]a staff member, Department for Communities and Local Government (WD 01)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]In Autumn 2012, during the previous session that the select committee had with staff representatives, a number of points were raised about lack of analysis and evaluation of DCLG policies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some of these points were picked up upon when you took evidence from the DCLG executive team on 
[normal]12
[normal]th
[normal] November 2012
[normal], including those regarding the amount of spend (a figure of £2m of research in the pipeline was mentioned), the treatment of research proposals on a case by case basis, and the work undertaken on impact assessments (see particularly q70 by Mr Heyes).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would like to make several points in response to the comments from the executive team, specifically that: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. There is no doubt that the research programme has been cut back. £2m of research spend sounds like a lot of money in isolation, but if that includes a major project such as the ongoing English Housing Survey, there isn’t going to be much left for other external analytical work. As such, without a detailed breakdown, the £2m figure for research spend isn’t at all useful. What you would need to look at is what are the departmental priorities, the largest financial commitments in terms of policy, and then look at what efforts are being made on each one in terms of appraisal and evaluation to see whether these efforts are proportional or not.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. You may want to refer to the NAO report and PAC session on new homes bonus on 3
[normal]rd
[normal] June 2013 to see the critique of the minimalist approach that the department employed for the evaluation of this policy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. On the point about research proposals being handled on a one by one basis, the problem appears to be that most of them are being turned down, so whether they are treated on a one by one basis or collectively as a research programme seems to make little difference to the outcome. The problem remains the patchy and inconsistent nature of analysis and evaluation activity across the department’s policy areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Impact assessments (IAs) are done in-house and require political sign off, so always going to be a degree of compromise, and in any event, IA overview suggests that step 7 of the process should be planning for the evaluation of the policy (so the fact that IAs are being done shouldn't be regarded as a substitute for evaluation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would also like to return to a point I made at the previous session, which is that it isn’t a lack of resource that affects our activities in analysing and evaluating policies as much as a lack of will and a lack of challenge.
