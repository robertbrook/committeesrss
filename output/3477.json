"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Denplan (PHE0018)Summary:Supporting information:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDental problems are more common in people with diabetes.  It is estimated that people with Type 2 diabetes are three times more likely to develop dental problems than people without diabetes, and the risk is also increased for people with Type 1.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMedical research has found a correlation between atherosclerotic (cardiovascular and \ncerebrovascular\n disease: notably heart attack and stroke) and periodontal disease (gum disease).  43% of the UK population suffer from periodontal disease, costing £2.73bn last year.  A BMJ study (May 2010) found a 70% increased risk of cardiovascular disease event among those who did not brush their teeth twice a day. \nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNow studies have shown that kidneys, like other major organs, are at a similar risk to be affected by periodontal disease through bacteria in the blood stream.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince up to one million patients visit a dentist each week, dentists are well-placed to detect and advise upon tobacco consumption, alcohol usage and diet and where appropriate signpost to relevant services.\n&#xa0;\nThe dental profession can therefore help Public Health England improve the nation’s health and encourage positive behaviours that jointly benefit good oral health and good general health.  This in turn relates to the prevention of, and earlier intervention in long term conditions.   Helping people think about and manage their own health on a daily basis will be an important part of the Public Health England’s success and rising to the long term conditions challenge.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAbout Denplan&#xa0;\nNovember 2013&#xa0;\n"
