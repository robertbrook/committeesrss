"Written evidence submitted by Justice (LAI 0061)&#xa0;\"I find it hard to believe that a government which truly respected the rule of law - which had taken the trouble to understand what that phrase really means, \nand to study the consequences of what it has in mind - would have contemplated introducing the [civil legal aid proposals]\".\n&#xa0;Lord Hope, Former President, Supreme CourtHL Deb, 11 July 2013, \nCol\n 469\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;JUSTICE considers that the proposals for reform in Transforming legal aid are ill-considered, rushed and unsupported by evidence.  &#xa0;We consider that each of the proposals under consideration by the JCHR will undermine the rule of law and significantly restrict access to justice for individuals without independent means.  We are specifically concerned that the proposals to restrict eligibility for prisoners and persons with less than 12 months lawful residence are incompatible with the right to the equal protection of the law and the right to equal treatment protected by Article 14 ECHR and the HRA 1998.  Further proposals to restrict access to judicial review are based upon scant evidence of the need for reform and could undermine the long-term constitutional function of judicial review.&#xa0;The Government has failed to answer serious concerns raised, including by representatives in both Houses, members of the senior judiciary, members of the legal professions and groups representing individuals affected by the proposed changes (from civil society and public bodies alike), about the constitutional function of legal aid, the impact of these measures on the effectiveness of our justice system and the credibility of our judiciary or the ability of individuals to hold public bodies to account.  &#xa0;We regret that this process has become less about a rational approach to making justifiable savings and more about a new “ideological” approach to the distribution of legal aid, based not upon the complexity or seriousness of individuals’ complaints, but about categories of persons deemed deserving or undeserving of public support by virtue of their status.  This process appears to have become overtly politicised by Ministers suggestions in the press that cases funded by legal aid as time-wasting and unworthy and legal aid lawyers caricatured as “fat-cats” unduly drawing on public funds.   Unsupported allegations that public law is used as a “promotional tool” for “left-leaning” organizations and lawyers undermine any confidence that the Government is approaching this exercise objectively. \n  &#xa0;Yet, the Government proposes to introduce each of these significant changes by secondary legislation, over a short timetable of around 6-8 months, with little to no opportunity for effective parliamentary scrutiny.      &#xa0;Background&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTiming, effectiveness and evidence-based policy making&#xa0;We deal with each of these concerns in greater detail in our response to the \nFirst Consultation Paper\n.  However, we are concerned that the inadequacy of the evi\ndence for reform is compounded by the short treatment of the consultation in \nNext Steps, \nspecifically, in Annex B\n.  \nThe analysis of the concerns expressed by many of the consultation responses, including members of the senior judiciary and public authoriti\nes who will be affected by these changes\n,\n is cursory.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe constitutional significance of legal aid and human rights law&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n[D]\nenial\n of legal protection to the poor litigant who cannot afford to pay is one enemy \nof the rule of law\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLegal aid is both\n a right in itself and an essential precondition for the exercise and enjoyment of a number of human rights, including the rights to a fair tr\nial and to an effective remedy. \n \nIt represents an important safeguard that \ncontributes to ensuring the fairness and public trust in \nthe administration of justice.\nLegal aid s\nhould be as broad as possible...\nto contribute to the elimination of obstacles and barriers that impair or restrict\n access to justice by providing assistance to people otherwise unable to afford legal representation a\nnd access to the court system.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEligibility and the residence

example, Daily Mail, \nThe judicial review system is not a promotional tool for countless Left-wing campaigners, The \nRt\n Hon \nChris\n Grayling MP, Lord Chancellor, 6 September 2013\n See JUSTICE, \nA \n \nPublic Defender, \n(1987) and \nPublic Defenders: Learning from the \nUS\n experience, \n(2001). \n For examples of our work on LASPO, see, our response to the Green Paper consultation –(\nhttp://www.justice.org.uk/resources.php/159/legal-aid-green-paper-justice-response\n), Press Summary (\nhttp://www.justice.org.uk/data/files/resources/282/press210611.pdf\n) and our letter to the Lord Chancellor on the principles of legal aid reform (\nhttp://www.justice.org.uk/resources.php/48/legal-aid-cuts-must-be-guided-by-principle\n).  \n \n    \nCP 14/2013\n JUSTICE’s \nresponse to the First Consultation Paper is available here: \nhttp://www.justice.org.uk/resources.php/349/transforming-legal-aid\n \nNext steps, \nhere: \nhttps://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/transforming-legal-aid-next-steps\n \n  \nhttps\n://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/judicial-review\n \n \nFor example,\n the \nremoval of the right to choose may have been\n unlawful pursuant to section 27(4) LASPO\n. \nThe Government maintains its view that the residency test may be introduced \nthrough secondary legislation following LASPO.\n \nWhile LASPO clearly permits the Secretary of State to make arrangements for the provision of legal aid, it is difficult to argue that this power includes the ability to exclude whole classes of person\ns\n from el\nigibility without further scrutiny by Parliament.\n See for example,  \nex parte \nKhawaja\n \n[1984] AC 74\n Tom Bingham, \nThe Rule of Law\n, \nAllen Lane\n, \nLondon\n, 2010, pp. 85 and 88.  That the rule of law included a requirement on the State to furnish civil legal ai\nd, in addition to protection for those accused of crimes was clear.  The rule of law includes that \n“means must be provided for resolving, without prohibitive cost or inordinate delay, bona fide civil disputes which the parties themselves are unable to reso\nlve”.\n   That the principles of the common law protect the right of access to justice, including through the testing of rules which might inhibit access to the court is clear.  See \nR v Lord Chancellor ex p Witham \n[1998] QB 575 (this case dealt with the impl\nications of court fees for access to the courts).  \n \nAirey\n v \nIreland\n (1979) \n2 EHRR 305\n \nat 26\n \nSteel &amp; Morris v \nUnited Kingdom\n \n(2005) 41 EHRR 22 at 59\n The Government ought to recall its obligations to c\nomply with A\nrticle 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamen\ntal Rights when \nimplementing\n EU law, which provides that ‘legal aid shall be made available to those who lack sufficient resources in so far as such aid is necessary to ensur\ne effective access to justice.’.  Importantly, Article 47 TEU does not include the\n additional requirement of Article 6 ECHR that a fair hearing be provided in the determination of “civil rights and obligations”.  See \nDEB v \nGermany\n, \n[2010] ECR I- 13849\n, 28.  \n Several international and regional human rights treaties recognise access to \nfree legal assistance as an essential component of the right to a fair trial.\n  Although many of these focus on criminal justice, international law appears to mirror the requirements of the common law and the ECHR that legal assistance may be essential wher\ne otherwise a hearing would be rendered unfair\n.  For example, In its \nGeneral C\nomment No. 32 (2007), the Human Rights Committee acknowledged that “the availability or absence of legal assistance often determines whether or not a person can access the releva\nnt proceedings or participate in them in a meaningful way”, and encouraged States to provide free legal aid not only in criminal proceedings, but also in other cases where individuals do not have sufficient means to pay for it.    \n A/HRC/23/43, Report of the Special \nRapporteur\n on Judges and Judicial \nIndependence\n, \nGeneva\n, 15 March 2013,.

2005, sections \n1 and 17 set ou\nt the Lord Chancellor’s statutor\ny duty to uphold the rule of law.\n Section 17 makes reference to the Promissory O\nath undertaken by the Lord Chancellor that: \n”I do swear that in the office of Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain I will respect the rule of law, defend the independence of the judiciary and discharge my duty to ensure the provision of resources for the \nefficient and effective support of the cou\nrts for which I am responsible\n.”\n \nLegal Services Act 2007, section 1\n further defines the regulatory objectives of the Legal Services Board and other relevant authorit\ni\nes as including (a) protecting and promoting the\n public interest; (b) supporting the constitutional principle of the rule of law; and (c) improving access to justice.\n F\nor example\n,\n all \nUK\n born infants under 1 year old would be excluded from support to represent their interests in care proceedings\n.

I do not believe that it is appropriate for us then, on top of that, to be paying for legal aid for those cases to go to court\n (Q205)\n.\n \n \n \nThat prisoners are in a vulnerable position and subject to the absolute coercive\n power of the State is recognised in most international human rights instruments and within the domestic law.  As Lord Woolf recognises in his report, \nPrison Disturbances: \n‘a prisoner, as a result of bein\ng in prison, is particularly vu\nlnerable to arbitrary\n and unlawful action’ (1991), \npara\n 14.293.   See also \nR v Board of Visitors of \nHull\n Prison \n[1979] 1 QB 425 and \nRaymond v Honey \n[1983] 1 AC 1.\n For example, many of the serious issues identified in the Joint Committee on Human Rights report on deaths in cu\nstody about the treatment of prisoners – segregation, access to healthcare and restraint to take a few – would now be treatment issues for which prisoners would no longer be able to access criminal legal aid to lodge a complaint, even if it had been shown \nthat a remedy was not possible using the alternative mechanisms identified in the First Consultation Paper.  See Third Report of Session 2004-05, \nDeaths in Custody, \nHL\n&#xa0;\n15-I/HC\n&#xa0;\n137-I\n \nR (P and Q) v Secretary of State for the Home Department\n [2001] 1 WLR 20\n02.\n \nR (Graham) v Secretary of State for the Home Department\n [2007] EWHC 2950 (\nAdmin\n).\n \nR (Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home Department \n[2001] 2 AC 532 \n: \nR v Secretary of State for the Home \nDepartment\n, Ex parte \nSimms\n \n[1999] Q.B. 349\n.\n \nR v Deputy Governor of HMP \nParkhurst\n ex p Hague \n[1992]\n AC 148\n:\n  \nR (SP) v Secretary of State for the Home Department\n \n[2004] EWCA \nCiv\n 1750\n.\n \nR (Vary and others) v Secretary of State for the Home Department\n \n[2004] EWHC 2251 (\nAdmin\n)\n:\n \nR (\nBlagden\n) v Secretary o\nf State for the Home Department \n[2001] EWHC 393 (\nAdmin\n)\n.\n The case of \nTarrant \nconsidered the circumstances in which an individual might be entitled to representation at an oral hearing.  The criteria include the seriousness of the implications of the hear\ning for the individual prisoner.\n For example, in relation to Brixton Prison \nhttp://www.justi\nce.gov.uk/downloads/publications/inspectorate-reports/hmipris/prison-and-yoi-inspections/brixton/brixton-2010.pdf\n at paras 3.34-3.45\n.
