[[[Susan Morgan â€“ Written evidence]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;As an enthusiastic and experienced country walker in England and Wales I am writing to support two proposals to put into the Bill.&#xa0;One is that all unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic, and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.&#xa0;Secondly, when a Local Authority declines to impose a Traffic Regulation Order that has wide public support, there should be a right of appeal. &#xa0;Having come across green lanes which have been considerably damaged, it is essential for their preservation that these two proposals are included in the Bill to prevent continual further damage.&#xa0;Thanking you for your attention in this matter.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
