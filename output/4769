[normal]Issues and concerns raised in the Annual Report relating to the performance of local authorities in child protection and services for looked-after children
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are many positive commitments to ensuring that local 
[normal]authorities provide the best services for looked after children in the Annual Report.  However, there are still some issues that need addressing including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition, over 
[normal]10% of children are still being moved more than three times a year
[normal] 
[normal]with m
[normal]ore than half only given a week's notice or les
[normal]s of being moved to another foster home and 
[normal]a quarter given no notice at all. This
[normal] does 
[normal]not provide a stable context for learning
[normal], and f
[normal]requent relocation ranks as poor practice by an authority that neither understands a child’s needs, nor changes their 
[normal]educational prognosis.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This need not be the case. Ofsted’s report also states that better authorities “had robust data systems that enabled virtual schools to monitor and track the progress of children, individually as well as collectively” as well as add
[normal]ress specific educational issues through the use of technology.  This means there is support for its wider use in the education of looked after children - a sensible position as technology: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One example of an online education provider is The Nisai Virtual Academy (NVA).  It is 
[normal]an award winning online learning community
[normal], on a secure e
[normal]ncrypted platform that provides a 
[normal]real-time teaching environment
[normal] with CRB checked specialist teachers
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]that specialise
[normal] in 
[normal]SEN and 
[normal]personalised learning
[normal]. 
[normal]In addition, it provides a secure reporting system that keeps the virtual head informed of attendance, contribution and behaviour meaning that 
[normal]those who are excluded from traditional education
[normal] can 
[normal]access full and proper education online.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Each learner has 
[normal]their own personal profile based on their ability and the subjects that they want to study.  It 
[normal]allows
[normal] students to engage in live lessons with teachers and other students as well as
[normal] providing a 
[normal]well being centre
[normal] to help reduce barriers to learning
[normal].  Indeed
[normal], 
[normal]the results speak for themselves. T
[normal]he students who use the NVA are often those who, in the eyes of the majority, are unlikely to gain any qualifications and/or achieve anything with their lives.  Considering that a quarter
[normal] of looked-after 
[normal]children still 
[normal]obtain no qualifications with a further quarter obtaining fewer than five GCSEs or equivalent, 
[normal]they can be easily placed in this category. 
[normal]However, last year 91% of the students of Nisai Learning achieved GCSE and A-level qualifications, and 30.6% achieved
[normal] A* to C grades – a figure below the national average but again, considering many of these students would have had no GCSE or A-levels under their belts without the use of the online education, 
[normal]this is 
[normal]an impressive achievement. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With this in mind, action
[normal] needs to be taken to:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Issues and concerns raised in the Annual Report relating to the performance of secure accommodation
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The report states that “28% of young people in secure children’s homes were neg
[normal]ative about the support they receive with their work or education”.  A terrifying statistic backed up by previous reports that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Education is one of the key elements to a young person being able to leave a life of crime behind. However, many offenders in custody are unable to access traditional education; and for that reason online education provision can help these young pe
[normal]ople.   Indeed, many young offenders have experienced ‘disrupted education’ in the mainstream system and this often continues once they are in a secure location.   Providing them with access to online learning tools like the Nisai Virtual Academy, would ov
[normal]ercome this problem, as they would be able to study from any location, provided they have access to a PC or laptop with a broadband Internet connection. Not only will this provide continuity in their learning whilst they are in custody, but would enable th
[normal]em to continue their studies without interruption once they complete their custodial sentence. Latest figures show there were “just 119 GCSE passes in public sector young offender institutions in 2010/11, the latest year for which figures are available. Th
[normal]is represents a 49 per cent drop on the number of passes for 2009/10, when the figure stood at 232…”
[normal] The opportunity to study in a consistent manner will not only give young offenders the best chance to succeed, but will also support their resettlement an
[normal]d enhance their ability to re-engage with education, training and employment.  It will also mean that young people can engage with the education system without feeling that they are dealing with the “authorities” with whom they may have trust issues becaus
[normal]e of previous treatment or experiences.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With this in mind action needs to be taken to:
