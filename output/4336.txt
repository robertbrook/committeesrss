[[[Supplementary written evidence submitted by the Department for Work and Pensions]]]&#xa0;The following information was requested by the Committee after the evidence session:&#xa0;

[[[Question 1]]]There are no plans to publish anything else on destinations but we continue to monitor the progress of Incapacity Benefit Reassessments. The link to the 2011 report is below:https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/214578/rrep791.pdf&#xa0;

[[[Question 2]]]1.&#xa0; Can people be required to sign on if they are not receiving benefit because of a sanction?"signing on" is shorthand for continue to be entitled to Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA). Claimants who are sanctioned continue to be entitled to JSA throughout a sanction period as long as they continue to meet the conditions of entitlement.&#xa0; We monitor these conditions by requiring claimants to "sign on" - in other words, attend reviews where their compliance with the actively seeking and available for work conditions is checked.&#xa0; A claimant who fails to meet these requirements would - as normal - be disentitled.&#xa0; Where a claimant is disentitled they will not appear on the claimant count.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.&#xa0; Are there any statistics on the number and proportion of sanctioned claimants who do NOT continue to sign on during the period of their sanction or for a longer period?We cannot quantify the number of claimants who choose to end their JSA claim as a result of a sanction referral or decision to apply a sanction as the claimant could have ended their JSA claim for other reasons.&#xa0; There are incentives on claimants to continue to "sign on" during a sanction - to continue to receive JCP support and to receive hardship payments (to receive hardship claimants must remain on JSA).&#xa0; More generally, as sanction volumes have increased we have not seen a corresponding increase in off-flows.&#xa0; The recent decline in the claimant count is primarily driven by falling on-flows.&#xa0;

[[[Question 3]]]In addition the Minister said there would be a second independent review – separate to the Matthew Oakley review – of the sanction process and the WPSC asked for information on this.Since taking over her new portfolio, the Minister for Employment has taken a close interest in the sanctions regime and has asked for a review of the application of the regime.&#xa0;&#xa0;We will share more details of the review, including the Terms of Reference, with the Committee shortly.&#xa0;2 December 2013&#xa0;
