[normal]Written evidence from Slater and Gordon (CMI0017)[bold]E[bold]xecutive Summary[bold]We do not accepted that Britain has a so-called ‘compensation culture’. We believe this is a myth propagated by the insurance industry to protect their reputation and ultimately their profits.

[normal]ompany profits from motor vehicle insurance remain 
[normal]healthy (market leader Direct Line, saw profits from car insurance rise 
[normal]in 2012 by £262m from £255m in 2011 or 2.7%
[normal], Admiral had a 19% profit in the corresponding period
[normal]). Even though 
[normal]in 2013 
[normal]companies are repor
[normal]ting tougher conditions 
[normal]– believed to be due 
[normal]to a more competitive market – only last month Direct Line reported operating profits of £418m in the first three quarters. That is a spike of more than 20%. 
[normal]It is important that through 
[normal]this
[normal] process of reform the initial goal of lowering insurance premiu
[normal]ms is not forgotten. There must be clear, independent oversight of any measures seeking to reduce the financial burden to the motorist. The historically huge rise in premiums is now as much a cost of living issue as energy prices.

[normal]Government must
[normal] focus on the way the industry calculates premiums. There must also be assurances 
[normal]that
[normal] savings 
[normal]are pass
[normal]ed
[normal] on to motorists and not simply
[normal] achieved to

[normal] shareholder return. This should be addressed through legislation. 
[normal]The industry cites insurance fraud as a key driver of premium cost and the Government has responded by recommending that medical experts be accredited to improve the quality of reporting a
[normal]nd reduce the incidence of fraud. Done correctly, Slater &amp; Gordon support the accreditation of medical experts.  To succeed, a scheme must be completely independent and impartial from influence from interested parties. 
[normal]If fraud does exist at a level which
[normal] is 
[normal]causing premium pressure, all stakeholders 
[normal]must do everything
[normal] within
[normal] thei
[normal]r power to limit 
[normal]these 
[normal]opportunities.
