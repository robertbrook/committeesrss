[normal]Written evidence from the British Beer and Pub Association (CYS 051)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The British Beer &amp; Pub Association (BBPA) is the leading organisation representing the brewing and pub sector. Our members account for 96% of beer 
[normal]brewed in the United Kingdom and own around half of Britain's 49,500 public houses
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We 
[normal] write in response to
[normal] your follow-up inquiry on cycling safety,
[normal] in particular, your question; 
[normal]‘
[normal]Whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from 
[normal]other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.
[normal]’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]City centre businesses, particular
[normal]ly
[normal] those offering food, are dependent on daily deliveries to ensure 
[normal]they 
[normal]can operate without
[normal] disruption
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Pubs situa
[normal]ted in city locations are no different and are heavily reliant on daily deliveries
[normal],
[normal] of both food and beer, collection of empty kegs and 
[normal]require 
[normal]access 
[normal]for 
[normal]company technical support staff. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Segregated cycle lanes already cause particular issues for pub del
[normal]iveries. Manual handling 
[normal]of 
[normal]bulk beer containers such as kegs and casks (as specified in current 
[normal]H
[normal]ealth 
[normal]&amp;
[normal] Safety Regulations)
[normal] ideally
[normal] requires the delivery vehicle to be sited at the kerb-side outside the premises. 
[normal]Physically segregated 
[normal]lanes prevent this 
[normal]access
[normal] and in some circumstances, 
[normal]bulk containers must be wheeled across the cycle lane which poses a 
[normal]further 
[normal]risk 
[normal]to 
[normal]both cyclists and delivery drivers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are already significant restrictions imposed on delivery vehicles
[normal], including 
[normal]the enforcement of
[normal] permitted delivery times (night time deliveries are not
[normal] allowed
[normal]), access routes and parking restrictions. Whereas it may be desirable to separate road users to protect those considered more vulnerable, further restrictions could seriously hinder the abili
[normal]ty to deliver to pubs, particularly if this were to 
[normal]prevent deliveries
[normal] during busy trading periods, i.e. lunchtimes. 
[normal] 
[normal]Imposing such restrictions 
[normal]c
[normal]ould also lead to increased, inefficient journey times as all deliveries would be squeezed into a shorter time
[normal] window. 
[normal] 
[normal]This 
[normal]in itself 
[normal]would lead to wider congestion issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Re
[normal]laxing some of the existing restrictions 
[normal]c
[normal]ould potentially ease traffic load at key periods such as peak commuting time, and would, in practice, offer a degree of segregation. In particular
[normal], easing the existing night-time restrictions on delivery times, as permitted during the 2012 Olympic Games, 
[normal]c
[normal]o
[normal]uld optimise the efficiency of deliveries and could result in 
[normal]reduce
[normal]d
[normal] concentration of delivery vehicles on the road at peak times.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]brewing industry supports safe
[normal]r
[normal] measures for 
[normal]all road users to reduce 
[normal]the potential for incidents
[normal].  However, w
[normal]here further, physical segregation of road use
[normal] is proposed
[normal],
[normal] we would 
[normal]emphasise 
[normal]that the road system is critical for the functioning of businesses 
[normal]in towns and cities, particularly London. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]BBPA would be pleased to be involved in any ongoing 
[normal]discussions 
[normal]with TfL, DfT and others on this issue.
