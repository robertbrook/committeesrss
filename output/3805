defaultWritten evidence from the British Beer and Pub Association (CYS 051)default&#xa0;
defaultThe British Beer &amp; Pub Association (BBPA) is the leading organisation representing the brewing and pub sector. Our members account for 96% of beer 
defaultbrewed in the United Kingdom and own around half of Britain's 49,500 public houses
default&#xa0;
defaultWe 
default write in response to
default your follow-up inquiry on cycling safety,
default in particular, your question; 
default‘
defaultWhether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from 
defaultother road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.

defaultCity centre businesses, particular

default those offering food, are dependent on daily deliveries to ensure 
defaultthey 
defaultcan operate without
default disruption

default 
defaultPubs situa
defaultted in city locations are no different and are heavily reliant on daily deliveries

defaultSegregated cycle lanes already cause particular issues for pub del
defaultiveries. Manual handling

defaultbulk beer containers such as kegs and casks (as specified in current 
defaultH
defaultealth 
default&amp;
default Safety Regulations)
default ideally
default requires the delivery vehicle to be sited at the kerb-side outside the premises. 
defaultPhysically segregated 
defaultlanes prevent this 
defaultaccess
default and in some circumstances, 
defaultbulk containers must be wheeled across the cycle lane which poses a 
defaultfurther 
defaultrisk 
defaultto 
defaultboth cyclists and delivery drivers.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are already significant restrictions imposed on delivery vehicles
default, including 
defaultthe enforcement of
default permitted delivery times (night time deliveries are not
default allowed
default), access routes and parking restrictions. Whereas it may be desirable to separate road users to protect those considered more vulnerable, further restrictions could seriously hinder the abili
defaultty to deliver to pubs, particularly if this were to 
defaultprevent deliveries
default during busy trading periods, i.e. lunchtimes. 
default 
defaultImposing such restrictions 
defaultc
defaultould also lead to increased, inefficient journey times as all deliveries would be squeezed into a shorter time
default window. 
default 
defaultThis 
defaultin itself 
defaultwould lead to wider congestion issues.
default&#xa0;
defaultRe
defaultlaxing some of the existing restrictions 
defaultc
defaultould potentially ease traffic load at key periods such as peak commuting time, and would, in practice, offer a degree of segregation. In particular
default, easing the existing night-time restrictions on delivery times, as permitted during the 2012 Olympic Games, 
defaultc
defaulto
defaultuld optimise the efficiency of deliveries and could result in 
defaultreduce
defaultd
default concentration of delivery vehicles on the road at peak times.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultbrewing industry supports safe
defaultr
default measures for 
defaultall road users to reduce 
defaultthe potential for incidents
default.  However, w
defaulthere further, physical segregation of road use
default is proposed
default,
default we would 
defaultemphasise 
defaultthat the road system is critical for the functioning of businesses 
defaultin towns and cities, particularly London. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultBBPA would be pleased to be involved in any ongoing 
defaultdiscussions 
defaultwith TfL, DfT and others on this issue.
