"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by The Motivation Charitable Trust &#xa0;Executive Summary: Disabled peopleâ€™s access to assistive devices is a human right recognized by the United Nations. However, for disabled individuals in the developing world, \nassistive devices are often difficult to obtain, and\n,\n when they are available, inappropriate for both the user and the environment. \nAn appropriate assistive device can dramatically improve the health and quality of life of the user, but an inappropriate on\ne can cause serious and potentially deadly medical complications. Despite this, assistive devices receive little attention from institutional development agencies. Furthermore, development projects\n are frequently designed without consideration of the needs\n of disabled people and as a result, disabled people are excluded and marginalized\n from much-needed programmes\n. The Department for International Development is called upon to adhere to international guidelines on disability, include both disabled people an\nd attention to assistive devices in development projects and to ensure that all assistive devices used in their programmes are appropriate for the needs of the beneficiaries. Without this, development efforts will fail\n by neglecting \na \nvulnerable portion of\n the world. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n UNCRPD, \n3 May 2008 \n World Health Organisation, 2011\n"
