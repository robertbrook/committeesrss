"&#xa0;\nWe are pleased to submit the following evidence in the name of the Parents Circle – Families Forum\n.\n&#xa0;The Parents Circle\n-\nF\namilies \nF\norum is an organization of more than 600 bereaved \nPalestinian and Israeli families who have lost an immediate family member in the conflict. The PCFF\n w\norks to solve the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis through dialogue and mutual\n \nunderstanding.\n&#xa0;\nGiven that the lack of trust and empathy between th\ne sides allows for the cycle of violence to continue, \nt\nhe Forum presents a different and much-needed perspective on the reasons for the violence. \n&#xa0;\nTo achieve this goal we work to imbue both sides with a sense of tolerance and reconciliation rather than hat\nred and revenge, sharing with others our personal and painful stories. \n&#xa0;\nEach day, through our activities and outreach\n,\n the Families Forum reaffirms the sanctity of life and the need to safeguard human dignity and freedom.\nThe long term vision of the organi\nzation is to create a framework for a reconciliation process to be an integral part of any future political peace negotiations. Without reconciliation, we believe there can only be a ceasefire, and not a lasting peace.\nTo lay the groundwork for a lasting p\neace, PCFF provides, first and foremost, the opportunity for Israelis and Palestinians to meet.\n&#xa0;\nIn the context of conflict, the two peoples remain alienated from one another, a separation which is fortified by feelings of fear, hatred, mistrust and dehuman\nization of the other.\n&#xa0;\nRather than allow bereavement to serve as yet another reason to hate, PCFF’s activities aim to use the personal stories of bereaved Israelis and Palestinians to prevent further bereavement on both sides, to demand a peaceful resolutio\nn to the conflict from \np\nolicymakers and to educate the public towards reconciliation.\nThe PCFF’s work has been recognized by highly respected international figures\n,\n including President Obama,\n former Prime Minister and Quartet Envoy\n \nTony Blair, \nArchbishop D\nesmond Tutu, US President Bill Clinton, US President Jimmy Carter, Daniel Barenboim and many others.\n \nT\nhere is a British F\nriends of the \nPCFF \nwhich is a registered charity\n in the UK. I\nts patrons include Lord Rowan Williams, \nLord Jonathan Sacks\n, Juliet Steve\nnson, Dr Usama Hasan, \nRabbi Jonathan Wittenberg\n, Dr Amineh Hoti, \nKaren Armstrong\n, \nHuw Irranca-Davies MP\n, \nLord Janner of Braunstone QC\n and \nRabbi Lionel Blue\n.\n&#xa0;\nIt is our deep conviction, borne out of our personal experiences, and confirmed by the impact of our activities, that promoting mutual understanding of the other within Israeli and Palestinian societies at the grass roots level is central to resolving the \nconflict. The most powerful way to do this, and the most challenging, is to bring Israelis and Palestinians face to face in a spirit of open dialogue, and not confrontation. Prior to the Second Intifada contact between the two societies was far greater. Th\nat \ndesperate period of conflict greatly deepened the\n emotional and physical wedge between the two populations. \nToday we are struggling against the challenging political situation and the physical barriers\n that separate us\n which\n shut down the space for dia\nlogue, reduce understanding, and reinforce hardline positions on both sides.  \nIn the context of the considerable sums spent by international donors with the aim of promoting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, we believe that grass roots reconciliati\non projects like ours are a critically important investment. \nWe urge the UK government to give priority accordingly to grassroots reconciliation efforts\n that\n educate each side about the other and bring Israelis and Palestinians \nto the understanding that no\nn-violence is the only solution to this never ending conflict\n.\nOur \norganization\n is\n constantly searching for new and innovative ways to bridge the divides. Following are examples of our activities. We are proud of what we have achieved, but we are acutely a\nware that there is so much more to be done, and many more people we need to reach. \n&#xa0;4a. \nYouth Education\nThe personal stories of our members hold special significance for\n&#xa0;\nthe younger generation.\n&#xa0;\nOur\n high school dialogue meetings address young Israeli and Palestinian students.\n&#xa0;\nSince the \nS\necond Intifada there is a whole generation who have never met the “other side” and the dialogue meetings may be their first encounter.\n&#xa0;\n After hearing\n&#xa0;\nthe personal nar\nratives and the joint message of an Israeli and a Palestinian representative from the PCFF in their classroom, there is a\n&#xa0;\ndefinite change in attitude and a willingness to explore the possibility of a dialogue as an alternative to violence and an understand\ning of the needs of the other. \n&#xa0;\nWe know that these encounters work by the interesting and often very poignant feedback forms students fill in at the end of the meeting.\n&#xa0;\nWe manage to reach an average of 15,000 students each year.\n&#xa0;\nWe have a follow up meeting\n with the students which includes the screening of “Two Sided Story”\n&#xa0;\na documentary produced by the Parents Circle – Families Forum, which illustrates the narrative of both sides.\n&#xa0;\nThis documentary is based on an adult workshop run by the PCFF.\n4b.\n \nSummer Ca\nmp – Youth Programme\nIt is the children caught in the midst of the Israeli\n-\nPalestinian conflict who have paid the highest price of all:\n&#xa0;\nthey have suffered the trauma of losing an immediate family member.\n&#xa0;\nEach year the\n&#xa0;\n PCFF\n r\nuns a \ns\nummer \nc\namp for bereaved children and their friends. The children are aged 14 to 18.\n&#xa0;\nSome of the facilitators today have been to the \ns\nummer \nc\namp themselves and so there is an ongoing commitment to peace after they participate.\n&#xa0;\nToday with Face\nb\nook the participants \nare able to keep in touch during the year and\n,\n dependent on budget\n,\n we arrange meetings. The programme includes social games, dialogue, workshops, physical activities, Arabic and Hebrew language lessons and joint creative projects and expressions of their \nlearning.\n&#xa0;\nThese activities aim at building trust among the youth.\n&#xa0;\nSome activities are competitive, where mixed bi-national groups experience work\ning\n together as teams\n. \nPalestinian and Israeli youth alike come away from their experience in the \ny\nouth program\n with increased knowledge of the other, with a sense of connection to one another that was built regardless of religious, cultural, national or ethnic ties.\n&#xa0;\nThe sense of shared humanity that existed for many before\n,\n was cemented by this experience.\n4c. \nAdu\nlt Education\nProgrammatic and People\n t\no People Approach\n:\nThe past several years of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been characterized by an absence and stalling of any political or diplomatic dialogue, therefor the current peace talks make the work on\n the ground\n and\n the \np\neople to \np\neople approach more important than ever. The ongoing conflict continues to create barriers – both emotional and \nphysical\n – between both societies.\n&#xa0;\nThe PCFF’s work is based on the premise that reconciliation is a multi – level\n process necessary to complement and drive any future peace agreement.\nThe underlying basis of the \npeople to people \np\nrogram\nme\n \nis\n that change results from the interaction of belligerent groups when there is opportunity for increased mutual understanding and\n appreciation. It also \nworks on the premise \nthat following the initial \ninteraction\n, partnerships and \ncollaboration\ns\n addressing common concerns create a real long-term commitment, on the way to \nbuilding \ntrue peace between people and communities.\n“History \nThrough the Human Eye”\n project:\nModules for social change agents, made up of unilateral and bilateral workshops and dialogue activities over time, between Israelis and Palestinians to recognize, learn about and acknowledge the personal and national narrati\nve of the other.\nThe Parents Circle \nh\nas run 1\n6\n workshops which included Palestinian and Israeli doctors, \na\nrtists,\n&#xa0;\n \ne\nducationalists, NGOs, \ns\nocial \nactivists\n, just to mention a few.\n&#xa0;\nThese workshops have created a rippl\ne\n effect and with each workshop we run we\n \nare \nhav\ning\n more and more applicants.\n&#xa0;\nIn the present climate this is some\nthing\n of a miracle and demonstrates that the Palestinians and Israelis in our group each have standing in their communities.\n&#xa0;\nThe documentary “Two\n S\nided Story\n”\n&#xa0;\n is based on \none of the \nworkshops under this project \nwith participants form every walk of life and \nshade of \nopinion in Israel and Palestine. We are screening this documentary \nthroughout the\n \nW\nest Bank\n and \nIsrael \nas well as\n \ni\nnternationally.\n&#xa0;\nIt is an exceptional tool for understandi\nng the narrative of the other and for breaking down entrenched barriers.\n4d.\n \nSocial\n&#xa0;\nMedia\nThe past several years of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been characterized by an absence and stalling of any political or diplomatic dialogue.\n&#xa0;\n Both sides vie\nw the other with distrust and skepticism and not as partners for making peace.\nToday,\n on the\n front line in the public opinion battle are social media platforms like Facebook\n, which is\n very influential among Israelis and Palestinians\n. A \nthird of \nall \nPalesti\nnians and around \n45\n percent of Israelis are active on Facebook\n,\n but even on Facebook Israelis and Palestinians are mostly exposed to their own communities and to voices of criticism and hatred \non\n \nboth sides.\n&#xa0;\nThey do\n \nn\no\nt hear enough \nalternative\n voices and especially the unique voice of the PCFF\n.\nThe PCFF launched the Crack in the Wall (CITW)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(\nhttp://www.facebook.com/crackinthewall\n)\n&#xa0;\n in order to foster interaction between Palestinians and Is\nraelis and to facilitate more opportunities for changing attitudes, breaking down stereotypes and humanizing the conflicted societies in order to break the cycle of violence.\n&#xa0;\n The uniqueness of this network is that all its entries are published in Hebrew a\nnd Arabic\n,\n allowing users to express themselves in their own language.\n&#xa0;\nResearch has shown that technologies of communication like social media platforms have an enabling effect.\n&#xa0;\nThey have acted as a catalyst to facilitate and accelerate social change alrea\ndy happening on the ground. Since the Crack in the Wall was launched in April 2012 it has provided a platform for more than 20,000 people, the majority of them Israelis and Palestinians.\n&#xa0;\nIt has brought to the forefront the fact that there are Israelis and \nPalestinians who want to be engaged and who are determined to work together to \nchange the\n status quo. In 2013 the Crack in the Wall project won the prestigious \nUnited Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC)\n/BMW\n&#xa0;\naward.\nWe are \nalso \nproud of our website \nwww.theparentscircle.com\n which publicises our activities \nin English, Hebrew and Arabic.\n&#xa0;\n4e. \nWomen’s Group\nWomen on both sides of the conflict need to be empowered to realize their own strengths and unique abili\nty to conduct a dialogue and to acknowledge the role of women in the path to reconciliation.\n&#xa0;\nUN resolution 1325 affirms the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, peace-building, peacekeeping\n&#xa0;\nand \nhumanita\nrian response.\n&#xa0;\n With all of this in mind\n,\n the PCFF\n h\nas created a powerful group of bereaved women who are fast becoming important players in the maintenance and promotion of peace and security.\nOver 2012/2013\n&#xa0;\n \nsome 60 Palestinian and Israeli women from the\n group worked on trust building, and capacity building. They learned how to give power to the\nir\n personal narratives and to be stronger agents for change.\n&#xa0;\nThey\n \nwere exposed to the \nn\national narrative from both sides and participated in experiential tours to significant venues \nwhich\n \nillustrate\nd\n the narrative of \neach side\n.\n&#xa0;\nThey were exposed to the role of women in conflict resolution all over the world in a lecture series and \nplanned\n&#xa0;\na \nsuccessful public event\n&#xa0;\nheld in Tel-Aviv\n, \nattended by over 1,500 Israelis and 200 Palestinians from the\n&#xa0;\nWest Bank\n, an extraordinary achievement in the current circumstances\n. The women created a Photography Exhibition\n,\n “The Presence of the Void\n”,\n along with\n “Texture of Life”\n,\n&#xa0;\nan exhibition of Palestinian and Israeli books which each wom\na\nn created of her life.\n&#xa0;\n There was also “Jam Session”\n, in which\n&#xa0;\nPalestinian and Israeli women made more than 750\n&#xa0;\nbottles of jams and pickles to be sold at the event. A recipe \nbook in English with the story of each wom\na\nn will soon be ready to \nsell in order to raise\n funds to further the activities.\nThe women’s group is planning a co-op of embroidery from \nsix\n \nWest bank \nvillages \nas a means of\n empower\nment\n and for the\n women\n to \ncreate\n income.\n4f. \nExhibitions\nThe Parents Circle-Families Forum has created a number of  exhibitions. “Offering Reconciliation” was an \nexhibition of 135\n&#xa0;\nceramic plates created by Palestinian and Israeli artists.\n&#xa0;\nThis exhibition was shown in Israel and then at \nthe United Nations,\n&#xa0;\n \nt\nhe world Bank, and several other major venues and cities.\n&#xa0;\nIn the \n“Cartoons in Conflict” \nproject\n,\n \nmore than 50\n&#xa0;\n famous international cartoonists donated cartoons \nfor an \nexhibition which ha\ns been displayed all over Europe\n and\n the \nUnited\n \nStates.\n&#xa0;\nAn exhibition create by the women's group - \n“\nFabric of War\n”\n,\n-\n  was \nshown\n at the\n&#xa0;\nRoyal Festival Hall and will soon be displayed in Chicago.\n&#xa0;\n \nT\nhese projects \ngenerate\n media coverage and expose our message to people who would not normally know about the possibility of reconciliation.\n4g. \nInternational activities\nThe Parents Circle\n-\nFamilies Forum send delegates all over the world\n to promote a message of reconciliation\n, i\nncluding regular visits to the UK\n hosted by the UK Friends of \nPCFF\n.\n&#xa0;\nOn recent trips to Britain we have spoken in\n parliament\n, been interviewed\n on three BBC programs and have had articles in the Guardian, Times and other \nUK news\npapers.\n&#xa0;\nWe \nhave spoken on nume\nrous university campuses and \nrecently also spoke at the Regents Park Mosque and in several synagogues.\n&#xa0;\nWe feel it is highly significant that u\nniversities, \nm\nosques, \ns\nynagogues and \nc\nhurches are willing to host us as Palestinians and Israelis speaking \nin the \nsa\nme voice. Our message \nto international audiences is clear: \n\"D\no\n no\nt be pro \none side or the other but \npro\n-\nsolution\n,\n otherwise you import our conflict into your \ncountry\n\"\n. This message is particularly important in countries like Britain which have significan\nt Muslim and Jewish communities, with considerable risk of tension\n.\n4h. \nDocumentaries\nWe have three documentaries which have been shown internationally and have won prestigious prizes from Amnesty International and other Human Rights groups\n. \n“\nTwo Sided \nStory\n”\n looks at a \npeople to people reconciliation project and the impact on its participants. “\nWithin the Eye of the Storm\n”\n \nfollows two men, one Israeli and one Palestinian, both of whom fought for their national cause, and both of whom lost a daughter in \nthe conflict, in their search to understand one another.  “One Day After Peace” follows Robi Damelin, an Israeli born in South Africa whose son was shot and killed whilst on military service in the West Bank, in her quest to learn lessons from South Africa\n’s \nTruth and Reconciliation Committee\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
