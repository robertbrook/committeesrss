defaultWritten evidence submitted by Sir Alan Beith MP,defaultChair of the Liaison Committee (FTF 08)default&#xa0;
defaultThank you for your letter of 16 December inviting evidence to your Committee’s inquiry into the impact of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act on governmental and parliamentary planning in the last year of a Parliament.  I am responding in a personal capacity, based on my experience of chairing the Justice and Liaison Committees. 
defaultYou ask how certainty about the date of the next general election is likely to affect the work of Parliament, and in particular of Select Committees, in the final year before that election.  The main effect on select committees, in my opinion, is that knowledge of the date of the Election should allow for better planning, and encourage Member engagement, in the latter part of the Parliament.  A fixed date will not remove the risk that the focus of select committee members shifts away from committee work towards constituency and party matters as the Election nears, but it should mean that there is a longer period before this occurs.  In this respect, it should have a positive impact on select committee effectiveness.
