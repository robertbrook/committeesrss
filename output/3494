[normal]Written evidence submitted by the [bold]Royal Society of Chemistry [bold](AMR0050)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Royal Society of Chemistry is the world’s leading chemistry community, advancing excellence in the chemical sciences. With 48,000 members and a knowledge business that spans the globe, we are the UK’s professional body for chemical scientists; a not-for-profit organisation with over 170 years of history and an international vision of the future.  We promote, support and celebrate chemistry. We work to shape the future of the chemical sciences – for the benefit of science and humanity.

[normal]The Royal Society of Chemistry welcomes the opportunity to respond to the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee ‘Call for Evidence: Antimicrobial Resistance’.  We have chosen to comment on those areas that we feel are of particular relevance to the chemical sciences, and have therefore chosen not to comment on aspects relating to public health trends, behaviour and antimicrobial administration practices.
