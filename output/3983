[normal] The balance of 18 pence
[normal] was used to raise funds for the future through fundraising activities

[normal]. 
[normal]Its
[normal] 
[normal]annual report lists the number of employe
[normal]es (approximately 5%) whose gross pay exceeds £60,000 per year, presented in bands of £10,000. The salary bands published within

[normal]Some of 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]highest paid 
[normal]employees
[normal] are world leading scientists who have contributed to 
[normal]major
[normal] advances in cancer research and continue to do so.  
[normal]Others
[normal] are senior leaders with the necessary skill and experience to manage 
[normal]a
[normal] comparatively complex 
[normal]organisation
[normal] 
[normal]which,
[normal] 
[normal]l
[normal]ike other international
[normal] biomedical organisations
[normal],
[normal] demand
[normal]s
[normal] high quality professional management.  Of the 189 staff members who earn £60,000 per year or more, 105 are involved with scientific work (56%)
[normal].
[normal]  84 are ‘non-scientific’ staff (44%) 
[normal]whose work is essential in 
[normal]running the organisation and in 
[normal]sustaining the
[normal] fundraising that enables 
[normal]the Charity

[normal]Cancer Research U

[normal] is a company limited by guarantee and is a registered charity.  It is governed by a Council of Trustees.  This Council is ultimately responsible for the Charity’s strategic direction, supported by a number of committees to which the Council delegates cert
[normal]ain authorities. 
[normal]These include 
[normal]a 
[normal]Nomination, Governance and Remuneration Committee
[normal], whose role is explained further below.
[normal] 
[normal]The Charity’s governance fully complies with the Code for the Voluntary and Community Sector, endorsed by the Charity Commission.

[normal]The governance of 
[normal]Cancer Research UK 
[normal]is designed to match the
[normal] standards expected of a FTSE 250 company.

[normal]Cancer Research UK’s Nomination, Governance and Remuneration Committee 
[normal] has responsibility for oversight of the governance policies and procedures of the Charity and also determines and agrees the overall policy for remuneration and pension arrangements for employees
[normal].  
[normal]The Committee, whose terms of reference are regularly rev
[normal]iewed, consists entirely of 
[normal]T
[normal]rustees.
[normal] The Committee oversees any major changes in employee benefits includ
[normal]ing
[normal] review and approval of the remuneration of members of the Executive Board
[normal] and the Chief Executive
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It also

[normal]5. The Charity has
[normal] a series of 
[normal]broad salary bands 
[normal]appropriate to
[normal] each grade
[normal] which do
[normal] not 
[normal]distinguish 
[normal]between 
[normal]function and
[normal] specific role types, but allow 
[normal]the 
[normal]group
[normal]ing of
[normal] roles of similar skill, professionalism and responsibility
[normal].
[normal]  When 
[normal]the Charity
[normal] 
[normal]consider
[normal]s
[normal] each role
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]it
[normal] 
[normal]set
[normal]s
[normal] a benchmark salary range 
[normal]between the median salary of the charity sector and the median of the appropriate
[normal] private or other
[normal] sector for that particular role.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Apart from me
[normal]mbership of one of our pension schemes
[normal],
[normal] all of which are contributory, remuneration
[normal] does not
[normal] include any additional ben
[normal]efits such as bonuses
[normal],

[normal] typically

[normal]The Charity
[normal] 
[normal]aim
[normal]s
[normal] to be competitive in the market
[normal] 
[normal]so as
[normal] to attract and retain the best people,
[normal] 
[normal]whilst always being mindful of the efficient use of donors’ support. 
[normal]To achieve this 
[normal]it
[normal] use

[normal] external agencies and salary 
[normal]survey 
[normal]databases to ensure that 
[normal]it
[normal] 
[normal]benchmark

[normal] accurately
[normal];
[normal] th
[normal]is approach is
[normal] reviewed on a regular basis. 
[normal]Positions on
[normal] the Executive Boa
[normal]rd are individually benchmarked. While 
[normal]the Charity
[normal] 
[normal]recognise
[normal]s
[normal] that 
[normal]it
[normal] should not and do
[normal]es
[normal] not compete directly with the private sector in terms of remuneration, 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]success in recruiting from th
[normal]e private 
[normal]sector is strongly correlated to the breadth, intere
[normal]st and diversity attached to 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]roles.

[normal] 
[normal]Recruitment for senior roles

[normal]of assessments

[normal]by
[normal] senior managers and 
[normal]T
[normal]rustees
[normal],
[normal] incorporating a
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]technical assessment, as required, to assess specialist capabilities.
[normal] 
[normal]Where appropriate
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]external
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]agencies
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]are engaged 
[normal]in
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the search and selection of candidates.
[normal] 
[normal]These agencies
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]support 
[normal]the Charity
[normal] 
[normal]in creating robust selection processes that are
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]comparable to those used in the

[normal] 
[normal]The Cha
[normal]r
[normal]ity’s
[normal] 
[normal]current policy is not to disclose the remuneration details of individual

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Appendix[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Improving treatments and developing new ones[bold]19. Survival
[normal] rates from cancer have doubled over the last 40 years. The science support
[normal]ed
[normal] and fund
[normal]ed by Cancer Research UK
[normal] is at the hea
[normal]rt of these improvements. In 2012/13, 
[normal]the Charity
[normal] 
[normal]spent £351 million on research in institutes, hospitals and universities across the UK. 
[normal]It is
[normal] the only charity that funds research into all types of cancer, across the development pathway from basic biology to large clinical trials. 
[normal]The Charity has
[normal] helped develop life-saving and life-extending cancer treatments, including tamoxifen
[normal] and Herceptin
[normal] f
[normal]or breast cancer and abiraterone for prostate cancer.
[normal]20.
[normal] 
[normal]A substantial proportion of Cancer Research UK's scientific funding is provided to 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]five core research institutes in Glasgow, Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester and London. Cancer Research UK is one o
[normal]f the founding partners of the Francis Crick Institute - a world-class centre for interdisciplinary medical sciences, research and innovation, scheduled to open in 2015.  
[normal]21.
[normal] The Charity
[normal] 
[normal]also fund
[normal]s
[normal] work through fifteen Cancer Research UK Centres.  These C
[normal]entres provide a national framework to deliver world-leading research, improved patient care and greater local engagement. They drive local partnerships and high-calibre collaborations between universities, NHS Trusts
[normal], industry
[normal] and other cancer charities u
[normal]nder a united strategy to accelerate the translation of research into the clinic for patient benefit. 
[normal]22.
[normal] 
[normal]Providing an environment in which world-class research can thrive is crucial to 
[normal]a
[normal]chieving 
[normal]the Charity’s
[normal] 
[normal]research goals. 
[normal]I
[normal]nvestment in infrastructure 
[normal]such as 
[normal]in the
[normal] 
[normal]Centres helps to shape the research environment in the UK so that researchers can make the most of funding from 
[normal]Cancer Research UK
[normal] 
[normal]and others
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It also enables 
[normal]the Charity 
[normal]to

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Arming everyone with vital information[bold]23.
[normal] 
[normal]In 2012/13 
[normal]the Charity 
[normal]also spent £17 mill
[normal]ion on providing information to people affected by cancer, raising awareness of cancer risks and symptoms, and influencing health, science and charity policies.  
[normal]It

[normal] with patients and the public about cancer prevention
