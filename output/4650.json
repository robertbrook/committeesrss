"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Christian Aid [CEP0018]&#xa0;\nFollowing my appearance before the Public Administration Select Committee on Tuesday 17 December, please see the below supplementary information relating to issues and specific questions that arose during the hearing. \n&#xa0;\n1. Payment of CEO salary &#xa0;\nThe highly complex and demanding nature of our Chief Executive’s role involves her working across a range of areas of activity in the organisation. Her salary is therefore not allocated to a single source but apportioned across a number of different income streams, compliant with donor restrictions, to reflect the diverse activities of her role. This is common practice across charities. \n&#xa0;\nChristian Aid receives donations for its work from a number of different sources including individual donors, Trusts, Foundations, Governments (including UK AID, Ireland AID, EU and USAID) and \ncorporates\n. This funding comes with varying levels of restrictions on its use according to the wishes of the donor. Our 2012/13 Financial accounts report that 85.6% of our funds are spent directly on our charitable purpose, 13% on fundraising and 1.4% on governance. The CEO undertakes work across all three of these areas and as such different funding sources may make contributions to the overall funding for the CEO. \n&#xa0;\n2. Publication of salary information &#xa0;\nIn its Annual Trustees Report, Christian Aid publishes the salary of its Chief Executive and the pay bands of its other higher paid staff that earn over £60k pa. The report also includes the publication of its Remuneration policy which states our adoption of the Hutton Fair Pay Review recommendation on executive pay. We have in place a ratio of 1:4 that limits the highest paid member of staff based on the median salary paid to our staff in the UK. \n&#xa0;\nThis report is available on our website, but the Select Committee raised the question as to whether we should do more to make sure this information is readily accessible to our supporters and donors. We are considering this suggestion seriously in the light of best practice and recommendations from places such as the Charity Commission. \n&#xa0;3. Christian Aid’s Blog on International Holocaust Day 2010. &#xa0;\nWhile it was outside the scope of this inquiry, we also seek to respond the questions raised by Mr \nHalfon\n regarding the perception of Christian Aid’s position on Israel-Palestine.\n&#xa0;\nChristian Aid has always been unequivocal in its support for the security of Israel and the rights of all Israeli people to live safely and securely. We believe that the security of both Israelis and Palestinians are indivisible. All sides to the conflict bear responsibility for atrocities that have taken place and share responsibility for finding solutions. Singling out one to the exclusion of others will not advance the cause of peace. \n&#xa0;\nWith regard to the specific issue raised, Mr \nHalfon\n is correct that on 27 January 2010, International Holocaust Remembrance Day, a blog appeared on the \nCtrlALtShift\n \nwebsite, that described the Israeli President Shimon Peres as a war criminal. The \nCtrlALtShift\n \nwebsite was a forum for Christian Aid’s youth supporters and moderated by Christian Aid staff. \n&#xa0;\nAs soon as senior Christian Aid staff became aware of the blog it was taken down and Christian Aid made an unreserved apology for publishing it. The organisation also apologised for what it acknowledged was the deep offence caused by the timing of the article. It was clear that there had been shortcomings in the moderation procedure and so Christian Aid then launched an urgent review of the procedures the organisation was using to prevent such serious mistakes from occurring. \n&#xa0;\nPlease find attached to this letter a copy of the statement issues by Christian Aid at the time of this incident, which was published on The Guardian website on February 5 2010. \n&#xa0;\nI trust that this response is of use to the Committee.\n&#xa0;\nChristian Aid Statement published on The Guardian website, February 5 2010 &#xa0;\nChristian Aid apologises unreservedly for the article that appeared. It was written by an outside contributor and was taken down immediately it was brought to the attention of senior staff. Christian Aid also apologises for the deep offence caused by the timing of the article ? Holocaust Memorial Day ? and the use of Holocaust images alongside the article. \n&#xa0;\nThe incident exposed shortcomings in the moderation procedures for the Ctrl Alt Shift website and an urgent review of these procedures is underway. \n&#xa0;\nChristian Aid repudiates the suggestions made in the article about the Israeli President Shimon Peres. All sides to the conflict bear responsibility for atrocities that have taken place. Singling out one to the exclusion of others will not advance the cause of peace. \n&#xa0;\nChristian Aid believes that only dialogue between all parties can achieve lasting peace and a viable solution for Israelis and Palestinians alike. \n&#xa0;\nChristian Aid has always been unequivocal in its support for the security of Israel and the rights of all Israeli people to live safely and securely. While deeply regretting this particular incident, Christian Aid will continue to press for Palestinians to be afforded the same rights as Israelis. \n&#xa0;\nCtrl Alt Shift is an innovative youth project launched by Christian Aid last year to give a voice to the many British young people who, according to research we commissioned, are keen to understand and get involved in global development issues. It is a forum for debate, and that debate is often impassioned. In this case, however, the material was clearly inappropriate.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
