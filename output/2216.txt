[[[Bill]]]&#xa0;Can I stress at the beginning of this letter that I am writing in my personal capacity and not on behalf of North East Derbyshire District Council.&#xa0;Can I ask, that when noble members are considering the Bill that they consider the following points, in reference to your consultation document at the below link http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/draft-deregulation­ bill/news/have-your-say-on-the-draft-deregulation-bill/&#xa0;•              reclassify all unsealed unclassified county roads as restricted byways (highly deregulatory);&#xa0;•              reclassify Byways open to All Traffic (BOATs) as restricted byways, ideally everywhere but especially in national parks, areas of outstanding national beauty and on national trails (neutral impact as regards deregulation)&#xa0;•              give to local communities (eg  parish and district/borough councils and community and user groups) the right to appeal over the head of a highway authority which persistently refuses to use a Traffic Regulation Order (TRO) to exclude motor vehicles where thereis clear evidence that such an Order is needed (alas, not deregulatory but fits in with the government's localism agenda)&#xa0;•              change the regulations governing the introduction of Traffic Regulation Orders so as to make it less costly and burdensome for highway authorities and national parks to use such orders (highly deregulatory in effect)&#xa0;All of these changes would also save the large amount of public money needing to be spent by highway authorities on repairing lanes damaged by 4x4s and motor bikes- once repaired they get damaged all over again unless motor vehicles are excluded.&#xa0;Yours sincerely&#xa0;Councillor Graham Baxter, MBE&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
