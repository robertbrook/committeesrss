Written evidence submitted by Derek W defaultLoudendefault&#xa0;defaultI refer to your call for evidence on Land Reform in Scotland and to the questions posed. Please find below my response to the questions raised:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe pattern of land ownership in Scotland remains very highly concentrated with 60% of the land owned by 0.025% of the population.

defaultBenefits under the present system accrue to the lucky few who find themselves by an accident of birth the inheritors of a truly iniquitous system. I would like to make clear however that a distinction must be made between family farms, small farms, crofts and the huge estates. We benefit greatly as a society from farmers culture of hard work and long hours on which much of their success and our supply of food depends. How little things have changed over time with regard to the big estates can be deduced from the study of the great Tom Johnston’s 1909 book “Our Scots Noble Families” and the later works of John McEwen (1977) “Who Owns Scotland?” and Andy Wightman (1996 et seq.) “Who Owns Scotland).
default&#xa0;
defaultDisadvantages of the present system are myriad with huge subsidies going to the landward equivalent of the “slipper skippers” so derided by fishing communities. The “brown brogue bandits” appear to have been able to persuade the courts that their human rights would be compromised by the public finding out how much they received from us in grants. If you take the grant, we have a right to know how much you get. In recent years there has been a switch away from production subsidies in the direction of energy production. What should have happened was that communities owned or shared the ownership of windfarms. That isn’t what has happened. Huge subsidies are being paid by the public through their energy bills to major estate owners with minimal benefits accruing to rural communities. The 5% contribution of windfarm income which communities can share in some parts of the Highlands is voluntary on the part of developers and is not replicated everywhere. It should be. The Scottish Government in developing windfarm projects on the Forestry Commission Estate north of the border has insisted on a community right to partner the developer. This should ensure that ten times as much income accrues to the communities which 
defaultbecome involved. I was shocked to find that Parish Councils in England and Wales would be able to borrow from the Public Works Loan Board to finance their involvement in such a scheme but Community Councils in Scotland would not be.
default&#xa0;
defaultEngland has no such Forestry Commission scheme so their ability to borrow is of no use to a Parish Council in tackling Fuel Poverty but where this could be done in Scotland the funding isn’t available. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhere large estates have been acquired by the public more needs to be done in the way of support to allow them to develop and grow the local economy. Timber planting does the same job as improving the fuel efficiency of vehicles in reducing carbon emissions. Our effort tends to focus on the sources of pollution with little being done to enhance carbon sinks through re-forestation. Part of this effort should include Short Rotation Coppice which community land could provide with local supply chains giving permanent jobs. Youth unemployment might also be greatly reduced during the establishment phase when trees are planted. An increased emphasis on tackling climate change in this way would have huge benefits to society. A look at Hill Holt Wood in Lincolnshire would show that positive externalities abound with such schemes.

defaultIn this area I defer to Robin Callander who’s 1998 tome “How Scotland is Owned” is a better source of information than anything I could contribute. Where I might comment is on the general position of small farms. Dairy farmers have been driven out of business in a relentless race to the bottom by supermarkets. I’d like my milk to be fresh and local. Increasingly it isn’t as small producers are squeezed out. Just as with banking, de-regulation has a down side. Milk is the worst of the markets where abolition of the state-run marketing board led to a rapidly increased concentration ratio at the wholesale and retail levels and to the rapid collapse of the number of farmers in the industry. This is most efficient for production in the short-run but bad for food security in the long-run as farms exit the industry. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI was struck on a visit to Norway that their access to house sites was clearly a bit better than ours. The conversation went something as follows:
default&#xa0;
defaultHow would a prospective home-builder acquire a site? “Oh well the municipality might point out that so-and-so was looking for a site &amp; suggest that one be made available to them”. And what if the landowner chose not to supply one or wanted too much for it. “Oh that doesn’t happen, if they don’t supply one (for approx 50,000 NOK or £5,000 from memory) then we just take it from him by compulsory purchase.” This is better for younger people but probably wouldn’t please the landowner much!
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCommunity Land Scotland are calling for a stronger community right to buy across Scotland, even when
default 
defaultthere is not a willing seller, provided this is in the public interest. I’d support this. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is again a clear crossover with the position regarding fishing. The right to receive subsidies for crop production and animal husbandry or for investment in productive machinery (with associated Capital Allowances) are clearly now assets of the farm. In a similar way the right to fish is determined by a permit granted by the state to (originally) the skipper of a vessel. The market system has allowed brown brogue bandits and slipper skippers to detach these assets from their original purpose and exploit them not as farm or fishing vessel assets but as personal pensions. I wanted the fishing permits tied to communities so they could not land other than in the local harbour. Neither the Royal Society of Edinburgh nor the Prime Minister’s Strategy Unit would go that far. Rights to collect subsidies when you’ve long since sold the farm are clearly wrong.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe need to plant trees, when we plant trees there is an Opportunity Cost arising from what the landowner could have earned from some other activity. Over time the incentive of a tax-free end product has evolved to reflect that. For the landed estates and for high earners seeking to avoid tax going down to the woods means they are in for a “big surprise”. Woodland Grants could be prioritised in a way which favours communities with the leftovers going to tax avoiders.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt could be made easier with the change requested by Community Land Scotland regarding the present need for a willing seller. I’ve also reflected in an accompanying submission on what could be done to make existing community buy-outs more successful.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultNot so sure here. There was a considerable disincentive for community buy-outs to create new crofts if they stood the chance of having the land swiftly disappear off back into the private sector by the method stated. Would this apply to community land or just to private landed estates? Would compensation be at full market value or at a crofting “right to buy” like discount? If it involves a transfer of land to a tenant at a discount what safeguards would be put in place regarding the on-sale by the new owner at a massive profit? Improved rights of tenure and the ability to nominate your successor from your wider family or friends might be a compromise solution.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultYes, maybe you could give it a creative name like “Crofters Commission” or else hand it over to the legal establishment to set up and run for a small fee. Which would you prefer?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMy first thought on hearing of the proposal to close half the libraries in Moray was “Don’t they have a hill”? If they do have a hill, borrow from the PWLB, stick up a turbine and earn the money to keep the things open. Councillors are often businessmen. If their business was in trouble they wouldn’t say “all I can do is cut costs” they would also try to sell more! Again I find the “Conventional Wisdom” completely baffling. My home town the Royal Burgh of Tain still has some assets left in the Common Good including some land and the extensive mussel fishery. It is held and managed by the Highland Council who pay next to no interest on the balance. Communities should all have Common Good Funds locally controlled. Much of the land transferred to the Highland Council has been sold off or developed. There is not much evidence of where the money went. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI guess this could be looked at in a number of ways. Perhaps the tax could be levied on the change in value on a Capital Gain on sale which can otherwise be (a) rolled-over or (b) avoided on retirement? Perhaps it could be introduced as a revenue tax? It could be added to Council Tax or Business Rates but any increase in taxation in the present circumstances people find themselves in must, by necessity be marginal.
