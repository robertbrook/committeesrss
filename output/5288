Letter from defaultRt Hon Theresa May MP, Home Secretarydefault, defaultto the Chair of the Committee, default14default defaultJanuarydefault 201default4default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default16 December 2013default oral evidence sessiondefault follow-updefault&#xa0;
defaultThank you for your letter of 6 January asking the following further questions following
default 
defaultmy appearance before the Home Affairs Select Committee on 16 December.
default&#xa0;
defaultForeign Fighters
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the concerns about foreign fighters, what sort of work is the Government doing to identify and monitor UK nationals who travel in order to engage in jihad?default&#xa0;defaultAre social media such as twitter and Facebook being monitored for people who are claiming to engage or have engaged in fighting abroad?default&#xa0;defaultThere have been claims that there is significant "coming and going" from the battlefield with people going to fight for a month or two in Syria and then returning to Britain to rest and recuperate. What legislative means does the Government have at its disposal to stop people returning to Syria? And is the legislation sufficient?default&#xa0;
defaultThe police and the security and intelligence agencies undertake a number of
default 
defaultactivities to identify, monitor and disrupt UK-Iinked individuals of concern who travel
default 
defaultabroad to engage in conflict. You will understand why I am unable to provide
default 
defaultspecific details of all of the actions that are being taken for these purposes.
default&#xa0;
defaultYou ask about the legislative means we have at our disposal to stop people from
default 
defaultreturning to Syria. A wide range of offences already exists on the statute books that
default 
defaultcan be used to disrupt travel by such individuals and to manage the risk they may
default 
defaultpose on return, including in the Terrorism Acts 2000 and 2006 which provide 
defaultextraterritorial 
defaultjurisdiction in relation to certain activities. In particular, where there is
default 
defaultevidence that individuals are planning, promoting, funding, facilitating or participating
default 
defaultin terrorist activities overseas - including terrorist fighting - the police and Crown
default 
defaultProsecution Service will seek to prosecute them, before they go or on their return.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhere appropriate, consideration will also be given to the use of disruptive powers
default 
defaultsuch as asset freezes and Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures
default 
default(TPIMS) to disrupt travel and manage the risk posed by returnees who cannot be
default 
defaultsuccessfully prosecuted , or in the case of foreign nationals, deported. If the
default 
defaultindividual is a dual national, I will consider whether deprivation of their British
default 
defaultcitizenship is appropriate. Similarly, I may seek to exclude non-nationals from the
default 
defaultUK on public interest grounds.
default&#xa0;
defaultI also have the power to refuse or withdraw passports (under the Royal Prerogative)
default 
defaultwhere I believe that a person's activities - past, present or proposed - are so
default 
defaultundesirable that the grant or continued enjoyment of passport facilities is contrary to
default 
defaultthe public interest. New powers to search for, and seize, cancelled passports, as
default 
defaultwell as other invalid travel documents, have been introduced into the Anti-Social
default 
defaultBehaviour, Crime and Policing Bill.
default&#xa0;
defaultOverseas Capacity Building
default&#xa0;
defaultIs the Government confident that overseas capacity building programmes have a positive effect on both the host country and in the UK and how is the effectiveness of the individual programmes measured?default&#xa0;defaultPlease could you provide a breakdown of the Â£30 million budget for overseas capacity building detailing what sort of programmes are being run where.default&#xa0;defaultWhere are the Government's priority countries in terms of overseas capacity building for the next year?default&#xa0;
defaultAs Charles Farr's letter to the Committee of 6 January 201
default4
default sets out, we do not
default 
defaultpublicly disclose the location, number or purpose of all our capacity building projects
default 
defaultoverseas because they very often have a counter terrorist operational purpose.
default 
defaultHowever, as might be expected, and as described in the Foreign Secretary's speech
default 
defaulton Countering Terrorism Overseas (14 February 2013), our work focuses in those
default 
defaultareas where there is a serious and potentially long-running threat to the UK and our
default 
defaultinterests abroad.
default&#xa0;
defaultProjects primarily focus on working with police, prosecutors, judges and prison
default 
defaultauthorities to build their capacity to detain, prosecute and convict terrorists based on
default 
defaultrespect for human rights and the rule of law. Every aspect of this work is closely
default 
defaultmonitored and requires Ministerial oversight and approval.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor operational and security reasons that you will understand I cannot provide more
default 
defaultin-depth detail of the projects or detailed costing breakdown in this letter.
default&#xa0;
defaultI
default understand that the Committee has written separately to the Foreign Secretary
default 
defaultabout the cross-Government effort to build capacity overseas in his role as lead
default 
defaultMinister for that work. In light of that, these additional questions from the Committee
default 
defaultmay be better dealt with in more detail in the response to that letter.
default&#xa0;
defaultTPIMs
default&#xa0;
defaultAre individuals on TPIMs also provided with the necessary support to deradicalise them? Are any of the individuals part of the Channel Programme?default&#xa0;
defaultPrevent interventions play a part in operational planning to manage the risk from
default 
defaultTPIM subjects after the expiry of TPIM measures. It would be inappropriate for me to
default 
defaultcomment on the detail of these plans. None of the TPIM subjects are currently
default 
defaultsuitable for Channel, which is specifically designed for individuals at risk of being
default 
defaultdrawn into terrorism.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe note that in response to our request that Mr Farr provide us with the deportation request from the Somaliland Government in relation to Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, Mr Farr wrote to us saying:default&#xa0;default"As this matter is currently the subject of ongoing civil litigation I cannotdefault defaultprovide any details further to what I told the Committee. However, I candefault defaultconfirm that documents relating to Mohamed's deportation from Somalilanddefault defaultwere disclosed during open session in the TPIMs proceedings by both thedefault defaultGovernment and Mohamed's lawyers. These documents are not in the publicdefault defaultdomain."defaultCan we ask you to confirm that a) a deportation request was made by thedefault defaultSomaliland Government and that b) the Somalian Government refused todefault defaultaccept the return of Mr Mohamed to their territory?default&#xa0;
defaultYou have asked for sight of official correspondence from the Somaliland government
default 
defaultin respect of the deportation of Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed. I can confirm that
default 
defaultdocuments relating to Mohamed's deportation from Somaliland were disclosed
default 
defaultduring open session in the TPIMs proceedings by both HMG and Mohamed's
default 
defaultlawyers. However, as has previously been set out, these documents are not in the
default 
defaultpublic domain, given the ongoing litigation and as such it would be inappropriate for
default 
defaultme to comment further on the details.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs I also indicated at committee, the Government would not normally disclose
default 
defaultgovernment to government communications. By routinely doing so we may harm
default 
defaultfuture relations with a third state on the basis that all future correspondence will be
default 
defaultmade publically available.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn respect of Mohamed's return to the UK and as has been set out previously, the
default 
defaultlaw is
default quite clear on this. Section 1
default(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 exempts from
default 
defaultimmigration control persons who have the right of abode. This means that there is
default 
defaultno legal basis for preventing British citizens, like Mohamed, from returning to the UK,
default 
defaultwhatever the circumstances of their return and whatever their activities abroad. It is
default 
defaultalso important to note that where someone is a British citizen, it is not necessary for
default 
defaulta foreign government to seek permission for their return.
default&#xa0;
defaultCommunications data
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat is the difference between the current data monitoring capabilities ofdefault defaultGCHQ and those that would have been introduced under the Communicationsdefault defaultData Bill?default&#xa0;
defaultThe Draft Communications Data Bill proposed the retention of additional
default 
defaultcommunications data by Communications Service Providers so that with appropriate
default 
defaultapprovals and where necessary and proportionate it could be acquired by law
default 
defaultenforcement agencies as part of a specific investigation. GCHQ's core mission
default 
defaultrelates to the gathering of foreign intelligence and they may collect data in relation to
default 
defaultthis function. They are not able to provide the communications data required by
default 
defaultdomestic law enforcement agencies. Further detail on GCHQ's capabilities has been
default 
defaultshared with the Intelligence and Security Committee, as this is expressly within
default 
defaulttheir remit.
