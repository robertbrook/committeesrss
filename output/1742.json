"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Michelle Levy (TIC 077)\n&#xa0;\nMy name is Michelle Levy and I am writing with regard to the new committee set up to deal with the problem of public transport in rural communites, 'passengers transport in isolated communites'. My community/village is one of those.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n I live in a village in north Cornwall called St. Newlyn East it's located 4 miles from Newquay yet it might as well be in outerspace the way our local government views it.\n&#xa0;\n There is a major road, the 3075 which divides our village which\n&#xa0;\n when coming from \nNewquay is on the\n&#xa0;\nleft while two villages Cubert and Crantock which is on the right side of this main road enjoy a better bus service then we do.\n&#xa0;\n There buses run every half hour and they also enjoy an evening service up to mid-night and also a Sunday serv\nice while our village has only an hourly service finishing at 1645 from Newquay and from Truro 1810.\n&#xa0;\n We do not have even a Sunday bus service and our village is the same size if not bigger then the two above mentioned villages.\n&#xa0;\n There is also a similar bu\ns service which runs from Mitcheal a village only 2 miles from ours.\n&#xa0;\n They in fact have two different bus companies serving them and they too enjoy an evening and Sunday service.\n&#xa0;\n And they are much smaller then oursleves.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n There is even a bus service in Z\nela a little hamlet with less then a quarter of the popluation then Newlyn\n&#xa0;\nEast.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n They in fact have a bus service every half hour.\n&#xa0;\nI think it disgusting that we as concil tax payers should have to pay concil tax to subsidise these villages that enjoy a m\nuch better service then we do.\n&#xa0;\nThey say our route is not viabley commercial, well neither is\n&#xa0;\nthe other villages.\n&#xa0;\n The only time Cubert and Crantock are busy\n&#xa0;\nis in the summer months of\n&#xa0;\nJune, July and August.\n&#xa0;\n The rest of the year they get the same amount o\nf people getting on them as we do yet there service never alters.\n&#xa0;\nMany times the early buses do not turn up-they are supposed to start the service going to\n&#xa0;\nTruro\n&#xa0;\nfrom our village at 0710.\n&#xa0;\n Yet on several occasions the 0710, 0810 and the 0910 never turned \nup and there\n&#xa0;\nwere people waiting to get to work, college, doctors and dentist appointment and even jury duty.\n&#xa0;\n Many young people have left our village because\n&#xa0;\nwhen they get\n&#xa0;\na job they have to leave it or else they are sacked because they\n&#xa0;\ncan't get to work \non time.\n&#xa0;\nWhat the use of having a bus service which cannot be relied on.\n&#xa0;\n A timetable\n&#xa0;\nis a legal contract between the passenger and the bus company.\n&#xa0;\n They can't just say they don't have a bus to put on because then they become in breach of contract.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nfares to get to Truro are £4.50 for an adult and around £2.90 for a child.\n&#xa0;\n If a young mothert had to go shopping in the city she would have to pay £7.40 just to pick up the essentials and she is not even sure that a bus will turn up to take her!!\n&#xa0;\nI am a \npensioner and\n&#xa0;\nI have to wait on\n&#xa0;\n1010 bus, but many times this bus doesn't turn up or if it does turn\n&#xa0;\nup it's full.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n They give priorty to the people in Newquay.\n&#xa0;\n The bus company wouldn't even think to save maybe five spaces for us.\n&#xa0;\n I once asked an offical\n&#xa0;\nwho works for Western Greyhound the bus company that servies our village, why don't they do this so atleast some of us would have a change to get on the bus\n&#xa0;\nand there answer was that the people at Newquay would then have to wait another 45 minutes for a b\nus well what about us, we would have to wait for an hour!\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n But he didn't seem to care.\n&#xa0;\n Why should he, he lives in Newquay.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI was waiting for the 1010 to show up\n&#xa0;\nand when it did it was full.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nThere were 9 people plus myself waiting to get on the bus.\n&#xa0;\n \nIt was a freezing morning in March\n&#xa0;\n most of the people waiting were between 70-85 years of age and one man had to make a hospital appointemt to be examined for an empending heart operation.\n&#xa0;\n This man was inferm\n&#xa0;\nand had trouble standing up for too long even\n with a can you can see he was shaking from the strain of standing up and waiting for this bus.\n&#xa0;\n You could tell he was in pain but he was old and sick and too tired to fight the bus company so he turned and walked away stooped, dejected. \n&#xa0;\n Probably going h\nome to\n&#xa0;\ncall the hospital and tell them he can't\n&#xa0;\nmake his appointment again because he had to cancel the week\n&#xa0;\nbefore for the same reason.\n&#xa0;\nThis is not an islocated insident it happens on a regular basis.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nPEOPLE DEPEND ON THE BUSES TO GET TO WORK, COLLE\nGE, ATTEND DOCTOR AND HOSPITAL APPOINTMENT AND EVEN JURY DUTY.\n&#xa0;\n THE PEOPLE HERE HAVE A LIFE AND THE BUS COMPANY IS DESTROYING IT FOR MANY.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n OUR YOUNG PEOPLE CANNOT TAKE JOBS AND ARE FORCED TO LEAVE TO VILLAGE.\n&#xa0;\n WHEN BUSES DON'T TURN UP PEOPLE ARE FORCED T\nO TAKE TAXIES AND FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GET REIMBURED BY THE BUS COMPANIES.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
