[[[Executive Summary]]]It is the National Outsourcing Association’s (NOA) contention that an entirely new approach to outsourcing needs to be established within the public sector to bring about significant improvements in procured services over the long term, as well as to aid the UK economy.Although outsourcing is not directly mentioned in the Committee’s call for evidence, £82bn of outsourced services are provided to the public sector each year, which we believe makes outsourcing highly relevant. Further to that, Oxford Economics in April 2011 estimated that turnover across all ‘outsourced’ markets amounts to some £207 billion per annum, equivalent to some 8.0% of economy-wide output. The private/public sector split is approximately 60%/40%. The UK outsourcing industry supports 3.3 million jobs and contributes £28.5 billion to the Treasury each year. It is a significant and growing industry in the UK, yet it gets castigated more than praised, oft because it becomes the scapegoat for some other failure.&#xa0;The truth is ‘outsourcing works’, when done right. Evidence suggests that outsourcing can lead to savings of between 15% and 30%.  If we conservatively assume effective outsourcing delivers savings of 10% that amounts to a saving on £82bn of services, of £8.2bn per annum.But it only works, when it’s the right solution for the given scenario and when it’s done well. It seems clear to many that the skills and culture that are required for outsourcing to work consistently well in the public sector simply do not exist. The NOA’s recommendations are:The NOA can help through qualification and accreditation and we propose all public bodies review their sourcing practices against the NOA best practice Life Cycle and over time achieve and maintain accreditation for their practices. We also promote the development of shared best practice and call on Government to start voicing support for this essential and burgeoning industry.
