It draws on a number of current and recent UKERC research projects including research on \nc\narbon \nc\napture and \ns\ntorage (CCS), the assessment of electricity\n generation costs, scenarios for smart electricity grids, and energy efficiency and demand reduction. It also builds on the wider expertise of the authors in low carbon innovation, including the role of policies and incentives to support such innovation.\n T\no discuss our response further, please contact Professor Jim Watson, UKERC Research Director: Email \njim.watson@ukerc.ac.uk\n; Tel. 0207 594 1571\n).\nBefore turning to the Committee’s specific questions, it is usefu\nl to set out some important features of low carbon innovation that have informed our responses. \nThe definition of innovation\n we use in this submission is\n a broad one\n. Innovation includes several distinctive but related stages – from research and developme\nnt (R&amp;D) to prototyping, demonstration, commercialisation and deployment. \nE\narly conceptions of innovation characterised \na linear\n process of moving through these stages from R&amp;D to deployment\n. \nHowever, t\nhis \n‘linear model’ was soon abandoned as too simplisti\nc by many of those engaged in innovation as well as some of those trying to understand and support it.\nMore complex conceptions of innovation were developed for several reasons\n, each of which is important for current and future UK policies to bear in mind\n. First, there are frequent feedback loops between the stages of innovation. Innovation does not only happen through the development of new technologies, it also occurs as a result of ‘learning by doing’ as technologies are deployed in \nmarkets. \nOnshore win\nd and solar PV provide clear examples where innovation and learning through deployment has delivered substantial cost reductions. However, recent work by UKERC also suggests that cost reduction through innovation and learning is an inherently uncertain pro\ncess that may not be characterised by smooth downward trajectories, and that exogenous factors such as currency \nmovements and raw material price rises can overwhelm such cost reductions\n.\nSecond, innovation involves multiple interactions between public and\n private\n sector actors in \n‘innovation \nsystems’\n. These systems have traditionally been understood at a national or regional level, but there is an increasing emphasis in innovation research on systems that focus on particular groups of technologies (e.g. lo\nw carbon technologies). Furthermore, these systems are \nincreasingly global which poses particular challenges for \nnational \ninnovation policies.\n Third, innovation is not only a technological process – it is also associated with institut\nional and social chang\nes\n. \nFor example, smarter electricity networks could open up opportunities for electricity markets to operate in different ways, and for a different relationship between consumers and energy suppliers. \nFourth, innovation can be incremental (e.g. to steadily\n improve the thermal efficiency of a gas turbine or solar panel) or radical (e.g.\n \nto fundamentally change the relationship between electricity supply and demand through the application of information, communication and control technologies).\n&#xa0;\nResponses to the Committee’s questionsThe \nUK’s \nlow carbon transition \nwill\n \nrequire \nchange\ns\n in \nour energy system\n at a speed\n that is unprecedented in our lifetimes. \nAnalysis by\n \nthe government, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) and \nUKERC\n \nshows\n that \nthese changes will require concerted action across the energy system to develop and deploy low carbon and energy efficient \ntechnologies\n.\n A recent review of low carbon scenarios generated by \none of \nUKERC’s energy systems model\ns\n reinforces the importance of energy efficiency across the economy if medium and long-term targets for emissions reduction are to be met in a cost effec\ntive way. It also shows that early decarbonisation of the electricity sector – and some subsequent electrification of \nother sectors (heat and transport) is common across th\ne\ns\ne\n scenarios. \nThis transition will also require broad societal acceptance of the l\narge-\nscale \nlow carbon generation \ntechnologies that may be needed to achieve these goals (e.g. \nwind, CCS, nuclear).  In some cases (e.g. home refurbishment, travel mode and community energy projects) more active engagement \nby citizens with the energy system\n, and in the changes that are required, is implied.\n These social and behavioural changes form par\nt of the innovation\n that is necessary\n. \nUKERC funded research on public attitudes to energy system change\n indicates that it is possible for the public to make sensible judgements about energy system innovation when they understand the dilemmas and challenges\n involved\n.  \nAgainst this background, our view is that the government’s overall approach to low carbon \ninnovation \nhas moved in a positive direction over the last 10 years\n. As the\n N\national Audit Office (NAO) report commissioned for this inquiry shows\n, the UK government has significantly increased funding for energy research, development and demonstration (R\n,D&amp;D) since the early 2000s. The vast majority of this funding has been directed to low carbon technologies (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1: UK Public Spending on Energy R\n,\nD&amp;D (1974 to 2012) \nSource: IEA \nEnergy Technology Research and Development Database\n.\nIt \nis also welcome that government funding is not only focused on fundamental research, but is also concerned with the development, demonstration and early deployment (see our response to question 4 below). Furthermore, the NAO highlights positive improvement\ns since 2010 in the co-ordination of publicly funded R,D&amp;D and in the development of an improved evidence base through Technology Innovation Needs Assessments (TINAs).\nHowever, the NAO report also draws attention to some shortcomings of the government’s ap\nproach. There is now a substantial international \nevidence\n \nbase on\n ‘what works’ in\n energy innovation\n policy\n. \nInsights from this evidence base include: \nthe need to establish\n a coherent, system-level perspective, providing sustained funding over time, avoidi\nng ‘capture’ by incumbent private sector interests, and supporting a combination of incremental and \npotentially radical\n \ninnovations.\nJudged against \nthis evidence base\n, \nthe UK approach could still improve. As shown by Figure 1, government funding for R,D&amp;\nD has been erratic. \nThere has been a dramatic decline since the 2010 high point – with a one-third reduction in total public spend between 2010-11 and 2011-12 alone. This was due to a ‘spike’ in funding in 2010 due to the stimulus package the UK government\n implemented following the 2008 financial crisis. \n Furthermore, there have been calls for the level of funding to be increased further to reflect the extent of the UK’s low carbon ambitions\n.\nThere has also been a lack of systematic evaluation of past R,D&amp;\nD programmes, and the inclusion of explicit learning within the design or new or revised programmes. In some cases, such learning has been undertaken.\n For example, both DECC and the NAO have reflected on some of the problems encountered in attempts to fund\n full-scale CCS demonstrations\n. Whist progress with the \ndemonstration of CCS technologies has been slow and frustrating – and this is in part due to the poor design of innovation policies\n - lessons learned have then been incorporated into the design of the current phase of the CCS commercialisation programme.\nThe \nNAO \nalso \nnotes\n that \nco-ordination across public sector bodies and agencies with respect to low carbon innovation may not be effe\nctive enough. \nIn our vi\new, the Low Carbon Innovation Co-ordination Group\n (LCICG)\n has been successful to some extent in improving co-ordination and taking a ‘high level’ strategic view of priorities for low carbon innovation. However, \nco-ordination could be\n more effective at the level of individual initiatives or technology areas. For example, a number of initiatives are seeking to support smarter electricity and heat networks including the Energy Technologies Institute smart systems and heat programme, the \nLow Carbon Networks Fund (overseen by energy regulator, Ofgem) and a proposed new \nE\nnergy \nS\nystems Catapult\n (funded by the government’s Technology Strategy Board)\n. There is significant scope for a greater level of information sharing, \nand \njoint learning acro\nss these initiatives.\n \n&#xa0;Historically, many commentators argue that there has been a bias towards the support of low carbon \ninnovation on the supply side of the energy system,\n both in the UK and more widely\n.\n This is reflected in a greater level of government support for innovation in energy supply technologies, despite well documented and well understood barriers to the develo\npment and widespread up\ntake of demand side innovations\n. It is therefore welcome that energy demand technologies have recently received a greater share of UK government R,D&amp;D funding than in the past (see Figure 1).\nGiven the barriers to deployment of ener\ngy efficiency technologies, and their potential to deliver emissions and cost reductions relatively quickly, it is \nreasonable to place a major focus on the deployment phase of the innovation process for demand side options. Historically, that is what the U\nK and ot\nher Governments have done\n. However, the current policy approach to deployment needs to be strengthened. Our analysis indicates that the current policy mix is unlikely to deliver sufficient cost-effective energy efficiency. Contracts for difference \nwill provide a clear signal for investment in low carbon supply; but there is no equivalent support for el\nectricity efficiency deployment\n. Support for household electricity efficiency under CERT has not been continued in the Energy Company Obligation (ECO\n).  Support for business sector energy efficiency, outside the Climate Change Agreement (CCA) sectors, is effectively restricted to energy taxes (CCL and CRC), which will have a limited impact given the price inelast\nicity of electricity demand\n. The propose\nd £20M Energy Demand Reduction pilot provided for in the Energy Bill is welcome, but itself very small and its operation through the capacity market is \na priori\n unlikely to be effective for energy efficiency technologies given their high capital cost and n\negative operational costs. \nIt would be a mistake to focus \nonly \non \nthe \ndeployment of demand side technologie\ns\n, or to assume that \nthe rate of \ntechnical\n change on the demand side\n of the energy system\n is slower\n than on the supply side.\n \nT\nhe opposite \ncan\n be true\n: mass-\nmarket technologies change more rapidly than those dependent on large scale construction projects.  For example, lighting technology \ncould\n go through two complete transitions (\nfrom \nincandescent to fluorescent\n; and then from fluorescent\n to \nLE\nDs\n) in \nthe\n time\n-\nscales \nit will have \ntake\nn\n to deliver a single power plant fitted with CCS.\n \nOf course, there are difficulties supporting innovation in energy efficiency: it cuts across three major sectors – buildings, process industry and transport – with a\n huge diversity of actors a\nnd technologies.  However, well-\ndesigned Government funded R&amp;D programmes \nto \nsupp\nort energy \nefficiency technologies\n have been found to be highly cost effective in both the UK\n and the USA\n.  \nAlthough network technologies are not necessarily low carbon per se, they can been important enablers of low carbon energy systems. \nNetwork innovation\ns\n \nfor heat, gas and electricity \nha\nve\n \nalso \nreceived more government support \nin recent years\n because of this\n enabling role. R,D&amp;D activities have been funded by g\novernment, the Research \nCouncils, electricity distribution companies (via initiatives such as the Low Carbon Network Fund\n, LCNF\n) and the Energy Technologies Institute\n (ETI)\n.\nThe LCNF program \nis\n facilitat\ning\n netw\nork innovation by enabling tria\nling of new technologies, operating and commercial arrangements. A recent review of smart grid projects across Europe reveals \nthat the UK is now one of the largest investors in smart grid\n demonstration\n proje\ncts\n. However, \nin per capita terms\n,\n \nUK investment is well behind some other countries \nsuch as Denmark.\nE\nffective mechanisms \nhave not yet been \nput in place to share learning\n \nbetween different funded programmes, \nand \nto \nimprove the effectiveness of the innova\ntion system in this area\n. Recently the \nEnergy Networks Association\n \nlaunched a ‘smarter networks \nportal’, an inventory of projects \noverseen by Ofgem\n. This does not include projects funded by other public funding bodies. \nS\nuccessful \ndeployment of network \ninnovation\ns\n will depend on the systematic \napplication of the \nlearning from these individual \nR,D&amp;D \nprojects \nby network companies and other actors (e.g. Local Authorities) \nto their mainstream activities. In addition to good mechanisms for learning, this will\n also require sufficient skills and\n access to capital. \nThe \nunder supply \nof skills \nin science, engineering and technology occupations\n \nin the UK\n could negatively impact \nthe pace and scope of \nnetwork \ninnovation in the coming decades. \nSimilarly, there will ne\ned to be strong, long-term incentives for investors and network operators via regulatory formulae and other policies for if such wider deployment is to take place.\n&#xa0;There are two main rationales for the role the LCICG plays. First, there is a need to \nimprove the co-ordination of low carbon innovation funding across different\n public funding bodies\n. This should help\n to promote learning, \nto strengthen \nnetwork\ns between firms and other innovating organisations, \nand \nto identify areas where there are synergies or overlaps. Second, strategic thinking is required to identify priority \ntechnology areas for these funding bodies.\nWhilst the establishment of the LCICG has improved co-ordination\n significantly\n, there is still \nscope for this to improve. \nBoth the NAO report commissioned for this inquiry and the recent report from the Research C\nouncils’ Energy Strategy \nFellow\nship make this point\n. The Fellowship \nreport \nalso \nargues that there is \nscope for more co-ordination \nbetween funding agencies at a ‘working level’, for example \nthrough specific joint initiatives\n such as funding calls\n. \n \nThe \nLCICG also\n has a key role to play in identifying priority technologies and funding mechanisms for the UK’s publicly funded energy R,D&amp;D programmes. Given that the UK is a medium sized economy, and public finances are tight, it is not possible for public fu\nnding to support all low carbon technologies at a significant level. Despite this rationale for prioritising a number of specific technology areas for support, the UK government has not \nprovided explicit rationales for the choices that have been made. A pa\nrtial exception was the report produced by a group convened by former Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir David King, in 2002\n. \n&#xa0;\nT\nhe \nTINAs that have been produced so far\n, together with an assessment carried out by the Research Councils’ Energy Strategy \nFellowship\n, represent a welcome step forward. \nThese assessments focus on important criteria such as the relevance of specific technologies for UK policy goals, the potential value of successful development and deployment for the UK, and the current status\n of UK scientific and industrial capabilities\n. \nOf course, the TINAs have some limitations. \nT\nhe government has not yet \npublished an overall strategy that draws on these individual TINAs\n – and provides a rationale for technological priorities\n. Such an overv\niew is due to be published in early 2014. \nIn addition, innovation may also entail changes in \nthe \nbehavior of energy users\n, business models and institutions. These non-technical \ndimensions of innovation\n \nneed to be factored into innovation polic\nies\n more strongly.\nThe measurement of the relative success of the LCICG’s strategy – and of the government’s overall support for low carbon innovation – will not be straightforward. As the NAO notes, the LCICG has proposed seven metrics for outputs and outcom\nes. \nIt remains to be seen how easy it will be to gather the necessary data – and to attribute such outputs and outcomes to R,D&amp;D programmes. Given that innovation often occurs over relatively long timescales, there are likely to be significant time lags be\ntween spending within these programmes and the full impacts of this spending on deployment. Furthermore, such metrics will only be useful if they are part of a wider effort to monitor and evaluate the impacts of R,D&amp;D programmes – and to apply the lessons \nto future programmes.\n&#xa0;\nIt is important for government to strike a balance between support for nearer-to-market low ca\nrbon technologies that can be deployed over the next 1-2 decades and support for more basic R&amp;D for the long term. Technologies in the former category are much more likely to have an immediate impact in helping to meet energy policy goals, particularly the\n UK’s carbon budgets to the late 2020s. \nS\nome commentators have called for a refocusing of efforts on more fundamental R&amp;D\n on the grounds that ‘breakthroughs’ may make meeting these targets cheaper\n. Whilst such R&amp;D is important, \nour view is\n \nthat \nthis is \nvery \nunlikely to be sufficient\n. A\n significant amount of innovation (and cost reductions) occurs through \nlearning-by-deployment\n. \nFor th\nis\n reason, there needs to be a continuing\n policy support for\n the deployment of a range of low carbon innovations including energy efficiency and demand \nreduction (see answer to question 2 above) and low carbon supply.\n Furthermore, this policy support needs to be tailored to take account of the large differences bet\nween low carbon \ntechnologies \nin terms of their development stage, \nmarkets, level of complexity and so on\n. \nTaking offsho\nre wind as an example\n, it is important to focus on \noperations and maintenance regimes to enhance reliability and improve load factors, a\nnd reductions in \ncapital costs\n through increases in turbine size\n.\n \nI\nt is \ntherefore \nwelcome that the government’s approach emphasis\nes\n stages of the innovation process that are nearer to market – \nincluding\n \nthe demonstration and scaling up of low carbon \ntechnologies.\n \nDemonstration is a particularly risky stage of the innovation process because it requires an increasing amount of investment to be made by a technology developer, but at a time when the risks of failure remain high. Government policy has an i\nmportant role to play in supporting technologies across this ‘valley of death’ between R&amp;D and commercial deployment.\nThe UK’s CCS commercialisation programme and the Low Carbon Networks Fund\n (LCNF)\n are two good examples of \ngovernment funding for this stage of the innovation process. It is not clear in either case whether government funding will help deliver \nall of \nthe desired outcomes. \nBut they show that government and other public sector bodies (Ofgem in the case of the LCN\nF) have become more comfortable with \ndemonstration \nfunding. As we have noted in our answer to question 1, \nmechanisms for \nlearning \nwithin\n these programmes will be essential\n. These will help to ensure effective knowledge sharing \nby the companies and other or\nganisations involved, and \nlesson learning by\n funding \nbodies seeking to maximise the ch\nances \nof successful outcomes\n. \n&#xa0;\nAs we have noted in our answer to question 4, innovation processes take time. \nTherefore funding programmes that support these processes need to have \na certain amount of predictability and durability. \nThe UK’s recent experience of funding for energy R,D&amp;D h\nas been a distinctive and rather extreme one\n, as\n shown by\n Figure 1\n. \nAs the Energy Strategy Fellowship report argues, more sustained funding is required, with longer-term programmes in some cases\n.\nIf the recent\n decline continues, and there is\n no improvemen\nt in certainty, there is likely to be a commensurate decline in investment in innovation by the private sector. \nThe recent changes to the Energy Comp\nany Obligation (ECO) illustrate\n this. \nThese changes \nhave already had a substantial effect on delivery plans\n for solid wall investment.  This results from the scaling back from the original ECO plans, which our analysis at the time indicated was very ambitious (arguably over-ambitious)\n.  However, the change is a serious setback for longer term building fabric e\nfficiency goals in the UK, given the importance of the solid walled building stock, as it substantially weakens the policy drivers for improvement of this technology. O\nne change in ECO from earlier supplier obligations is removal of support for improvement\ns in efficie\nncy in lighting and appliances.\n Again, this results in limited pressure for commerci\nal investment in innovation.\n  \nAnother contrasting area where short time horizons are potentially an issue is the CCS commercialization programme. As noted earl\nier, progress with the demonstration of CCS technologies in the UK has been frustratingly slow. Whilst it is very welcome that £1bn is still available in principle to \npartly \nsupport one or more demonstrations, repeated delays mean that there is a risk that\n this funding will not be available when required – especially if implementation \nis delayed beyond the current \nSpending Review period. \n&#xa0;Given that many low carbon technologies are developed by multinational firms, international collaboration can complement national government R,D&amp;D \nprogrammes – and help to reduce the costs of achieving domestic policy goals. The \nIEA \nnoted that for \nthe UK, ‘international collaboration… may be essential to accelerate technology development’\n. The European Union is the UK’s most important international arena for public energy innovation. As in the UK there have been recent\n efforts to improve the cohere\nnce of European research.\n Spending in the Framework Programme (and the successor ‘Horizon 2020’ programme) is embedded in the European Commission’s Strategic Energy \nTechnology Plan, which elaborates a long-term vision of energy system development. This inc\nludes Industrial Initiatives and a European Energy Research Alliance (EERA), comprising 15 leading energy research institutes (UKERC is the lead partner in EERA for the UK). The International Energy Agency has also built up a significant range of publicly \nfunded activities in energy innovation in recent years, including a set of Implementing Agreements (IAs) for collaboration in specific areas. \nEvidence on the effectiveness of UK engagement in international initiatives is mixed. The UK participates in 25 o\nf the IEA’s Implementing Agreements\n. This is \nwell above the average\n. Within the \n7\nth\n European Framework Programme\n (FP7)\n, UK universities and research organisations have out-performed the European average in attracting support\n. However, \nthe reverse is true \nfor private companies\n. \nThe UK’s performance in attracting this funding for \nlow carbon research within \nFP7 has also been mixed. According to a Committee on Climate Change report in 2010, UK funding share was\n just 11%\n at the time\n, far behind Germ\nany which at\ntracted 21%\n. T\nhe UK \nwas\n also perceived \nat the time as being\n less effective as other states at influencing the design of the Framework Programme for\n low-carbon technologies\n. \nAs more consolidated international programmes have emerged, the UK’s system of \ndistributed centres and networks has created some barriers to participation. UK participation in international programmes has been mostly on a bottom-up basis\n,\n \nled by individual institutions with little overall co-ordination (see our response to Q3). \nThe \nEnergy Research Partnership identified a need for stronger linkages between the UK’s domestic energy innovation strategy and international engagement\n. The international review of the Research Councils’ Energy Programme also detected missed opportunities f\nor international collaboration, due to lack of guidelines or incentives (particularly for collaboration outside of the European Union), lack of funding and low awareness or time availability on the part of researchers\n.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nW\natson\n,\n J (\n2008\n)\n. \nSetting Priorities in Energy Innovation Policy: Lessons for the UK\n.
