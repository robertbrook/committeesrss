"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Celgene Corporation (RAD005)&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCelgene \nis \ndelighted to respond to the Science and Technology Committee’s consultation on the funding available for R&amp;\nD in science and technology in the UK. Although we are unable to respond to all aspects of the report produced by the National Audit Office into this issue, there are some specific comments in relation to R&amp;D in the life sciences sector that we would like \nto be taken into consideration as the Committee progresses its investigation. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy way of background, Celgene is a global biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients worldwide. As a company, we seek to deliver truly innovative an\nd life-changing medicines for our patients. In the UK we have developed a number of products for the treatment of cancer and other severe, immune, inflammatory conditions. \n&#xa0;\n1.3. There are four key issues discussed in this consultation response. These are:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe competitiveness of R&amp;D in the UK\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe uptake of new medicines on the NHS\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe role of Academic Health Science Networks (AHSNs)\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe potential of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency’s (MHRA) Early Access Scheme\n&#xa0;\n2. The competitiveness of R&amp;D in the UK&#xa0;Celgene believes that the UK should aim to be a market leader in R&amp;D across the full life-cycle required for developing a new medicine. This means increasing focus on post approval safety studies, as well as on the initial recruitment of patients to a new study and translational research. It may be that some incentivisation is needed in this area. Celgene would welcome greater consistency around the approval process and costs of conducting R&amp;D in the UK. The current discrepancy in the funding and data acquired to start a trial is creating too much uncertainty for companies in the UK. We would also support moves to enable organisations to recoup the non-refundable set up costs where clinical sites are unable to recruit sufficient patient numbers. 2.1 Pharmaceutical R&amp;D is an expensive business. A recent report by the UK \nOffice of Health Economics (OHE) suggests that the mean or average cost of researching and developing a successful new medicine has significantly increased over the last decade and is now estimated at US$1,506million, at 2011 prices.\n According to the OHE, however, R&amp;D costs vary substantially by therapeutic area. The most recent analyses suggest that the most expensive therapeutic areas in terms of drug R&amp;D costs are neurology, respiratory and oncology.\n This is because drugs in these categories experience lower success rates and longer development times.\n              \nThey also represent some of the areas of greatest unmet need in medicine. This issue is exacerbated in the case of oncology by the UK’s ageing population, the associated increase in cancer incidence rates and by the poor outcomes in the UK relative to other EU countries. Research in these fields \nis therefore of critical importance for the health and wellbeing of patients across the UK.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nThe pharmaceutical industry in the UK currently employs around 67,000 people directly – 25,000 of those in research and development. As the NAO outlined in their report, the majority of\n current research programmes in the UK are funded and carried out by the industry.\n&#xa0;\n2.3  Celgene is wholly supportive of the significant\n contribution the National Institute of Health Research’s (NIHR) biomedical research centres and units have made to the current environment for R&amp;D.  The new Coordinated System for gaining NHS Permission (CSP) has been effective in supporting high quality \nclinical research studies in England. Celgene recognises the challenges of meeting the 30 day target for gaining permission for a new research project in partnership with the NIHR, \nparticularly given the length of contract discussions which must be conclud\ned before the trial can start, \nbut believes \na timely \nreview\n process\n \nis an important factor in maintaining a competitive environment for R&amp;D.\n In many EU countries the process is more streamlined and efficient, as those conducting research do not need to secure R&amp;D approval, as well as approval from the European Commission and the MHRA\n&#xa0;\n2.4  Celgene has a number of UK clinical trials which have \nbenefited from the support of the NIHR to recruit patients. In the majority of cases, their proactive approach to ensuring recruitment targets are met has been highly effective. \nAt\n one of \nthe\n sites\n Celgene works with\n, \nthe \nChief Investigator has worked clos\nely with NIHR nurses to ensure a sufficient number of patients are involved in the trial. The\nir contribution to \nsecuring \npatient consent \nhas been \nvital in ensuring\n sufficient\n recruitment in\nto the trial \nwhich\n may not have otherwise \nbeen achieved. The \nlearni\nngs from\n examples like\n this \nare critical to feed\nback into the system\n and a more consistent mechanism needs to be put in place to allow all those involved in clinical research to share their experiences – both positive and negative.\n&#xa0;\n2.5  Despite the vital \nwork of the NIHR, the system for approval for new clinical trials in the UK remains highly complex. Currently, approval must be gained from \neach \nsite where the research is to be undertaken and each local R&amp;D office needs to be informed. There is no standar\nd form between sites and the requirements vary for each. \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nFor a multi-site research project, this can be challenging and burdensome\n, often slowing down the trial set up as a result. Other countries including \nFrance, Germany, Italy, Canada, Spain, \nRussia, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Romania all have less burdensome processes for gaining approval for new clinical studies\n and a standardi\ns\ned process is therefore needed in the UK to make it more competitive on the global stage. \n \n&#xa0;\n2.7\n  Celgene has real concer\nns that the cost of conducting clinical trials in the UK is prohibitive for many organisations\n.\n The fees charged by R&amp;D departments are not currently standardised and vary considerably\n. In one of the studies Celgene has been involved in the per patient cos\nt varied from £5,500.00 per patient to £9,900.00 per patient\n. Despite the national costing template created by NIHR, this can make it difficult to plan for the costs of a major clinical trial programme and \nsome centres are so costly it is impossible for a \ncompany like Celgene, which is a relatively new entrant to the UK market, to justify the expense\n when other countries across Europe and beyond \ncan be significantly cheaper than sites \nin\n the UK.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n8\n Additionally\n, set up costs - \nwhich are non-refundable \n- \ncan run into thousands of pounds. Whilst this is not an issue if the site delivers its quota of patients, this does \nrepresent\n an increasing cost burden when they don’t. Celgene believes that R&amp;D fees should be standardised between sites in the UK and must \nbe made more transparent. The fees should be proportionate to the size and complexity of research projects and there should be a mechanism in place to recoup charges paid if a site fails to deliver the required quota of patients.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.9\n  The UK is currently focused on becoming a world leader in translational research and stratified medicines. Various partnerships and programmes have been set up to incentivise this work. \nT\nhis is clearly an important and exciting area of research, which ha\ns the potential to c\nonfer huge benefits to patients. However,\n \nit\n should not be pursued to the detriment of post-approval safety studies\n which are carried out at the \nreq\nuest of approving authorities and are often a\n condition of approval\n. It is vital that th\ne research community continues to understand how new treatments work in real world settings and are able to understand the impact a treatment has on patients once it has gained approval. \nWe therefore welcome the development of the Systemic \nAnti-Cancer Ther\napy \n(SACT) data\nbase \nwhich will provide important information about the\n clinical management in cancer chemotherapy\n \nand \nwould encourage Government \nto speed up other da\nta sets becoming mandatory so they\n can really add value quicker to the countries knowledge and insights\n. \nIn line with the Government’s intention to measure the overall ‘value’ of a medicine, this kind of \ninformation\n \ncan support us to understand the patient benefits of a new medicine and th\ne impact it has on their quality of life. \nIt can also \nhelp industry to make its case for funding for a new medicine, provide collateral to clinicians wishing to prescribe a new treatment and allow patients to understand the full benefits of the medicine th\ney are taking.\n&#xa0;3. Uptake of new medicines on the NHS needs to be incentivised&#xa0;Celgene would welcome greater clarity from the Department of Health on the speed and extent of take-up of new medicines once they have received approval. In particular, it is vital that, once a new medicine is included in a local formulary or nationally commissioned, clinicians are encouraged to prescribe this treatment to patients where appropriate.&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOnce a medicine has been approved for use in the UK, companies continue to \nstruggle to have these placed on local formularies\n or built into national guidelines and pathways. As a result of this,\n patients report delays in their ability to access the new medicines they need.\n This is often caused by long delays in the NICE appraisal\n process \nand \nit is important that \nbarriers to prescribing \nare not\n put in the way whilst decisions \nby NICE \nare \nbeing \nmade\n. To improve patients access it is vital that the NHS embrace\n new technology whilst it awaits a \nformal appraisal \ndecision or \nthat NICE s\npeed up their appraisal process \nso patients don’t face \nthese \ndelays\n. The introduction of value-based pricing (V\nBP\n)\n \nshould also not be allowed to cause\n greater delays\n in the appraisal process\n.\n&#xa0;3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough positive steps have been made to overcome this challen\nge, including the introduction of the NICE Compliance Regime, progress remains slow. The Government must do more to ensure that the new structures across the NHS incentivise speedier access to medicines. The current status quo is both bad for patients – wh\no are forced to wait to receive new treatments – and bad for the life sciences industry, which invests heavily in the development of new medicines that do not get the take-up anticipated, despite support from clinicians and patients.\n It is also important t\no minimise the current \nvariation in uptake and \nNHS E\nngland \nmust \nlook at best practice \nacross the country in order to\n ensure variation is minimized to best standards to ensure equality across UK.\n&#xa0;4. The role of Academic Health Science Networks (AHSNs)&#xa0;Celgene believes the Government should do more to incentivise industry involvement in AHSNs and would welcome AHSNs playing a more active role in creating simpler, more consistent approval processes for new clinical trials.4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a huge amount of \noverlap between the work of industry and the academic research community\n. U\nltimately\n,\n both are looking to achieve the same outcomes – access to the best, new treatments for patients in the UK at the appropriate point in the patient journey.\n&#xa0;4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGood science a\nnd good investment is equally important to both parties. It is easier to harness funding and access the best data when organisations from industry and academia work together. More needs to be done to promote and incentivise partnership working where this w\nill lead to improvements for patients. AHSNs are a welcome step in the right direction. However, their interaction with industry has been mixed – whilst some see collaboration with industry as core to what they do, others have failed to engage at all. It w\nould be useful for the Department of Health and the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills to indicate that collaboration through these networks is important to their success and share examples of best practice in cross-sector partnerships.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn impo\nrtant change that could be achieved fairly easily would be to create super-networks in which three or four AHSNs come together to create a single \nR&amp;D/ i\nnstitutional \napproval process for new clinical trials. This would simplify and streamline the process in\nvolved in setting up new R&amp;D projects and provide a greater pool of patients to recruit to the trials. This cross-AHSN collaboration is already taking place in some parts of the country and more should be done to make the individual networks accountable fo\nr ensuring the competitiveness of the UK as an environment for R&amp;D.\n&#xa0;5. The potential of the MHRA’s Early Access Scheme&#xa0;Celgene urges the Government to provide greater clarity on the direction of travel of the MHRA’s Early Access Scheme. \nWe also advocate that the MHRA looks closely at areas where initiatives similar to the Early Access Scheme have been implemented. In particular, learnings should be taken from the ATU de cohort and the Centre for Accelerating Medical Innovations to inform and shape the Early Access Scheme in the UK.5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCelgene \nin principle \nsupports the MHRA’s proposed early access scheme, which will help ensure that patients can have access to medicines earlier in the product lifecycle, including – assuming that adequate safety data is availa\nble – during the late development and regulatory phases, prior to marketing authorisation. This is particularly important for products that have the potential to deliver particular benefits to patients – either because they are to be licensed for particula\nrly rare conditions, such as rarer forms of cancer, or for conditions where there is high unmet medical need or few alternative treatment options for patients. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis scheme can, in particular, support the \nall those involved in clinical research\n \n(and those\n that are potential beneficiaries of the clinical research) \nto collect high quality real life data which can provide significant insight into the effectiveness of a new medicine. It will support more widespread use of innovative new treatments that can del\niver positive outcomes for patients for whom there are currently very few treatment opportunities available. \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, greater clarity is urgently needed as to how this scheme will work in practice – in particular, what will the process be for selecting s\nuitable products and reviewing the available data; how will the MHRA engage other stakeholders (including industry and patients) in the process; and what monitoring and evaluation mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that the scheme meets its desired \nobjective of improving early access to new medicines? \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe MHRA should look at other schemes that are in place or in development abroad to improve the early access scheme proposed in the UK. As you may be aware, a\n number of EU Member States have put in place national arrangements similar to the early access scheme with the intention to increase availability to promising new products for a cohort of patients where there is unmet need. The most well-known of these is \nthe \nAutorisations Temporaires d’Utilisation de cohorte \n(ATU de cohorte), which was introduced in France in 1994 and where more than 130 medicines were granted an ATU de cohorte in therapeutic areas, including oncology-haematology, CNS, infectious diseases and metabolism (including rare diseases). Feedback sugg\nests that the positive impact of this national scheme has been attributable to the fact that these products are subject to reimbursement. Although this has not been an unbridled success, it does provide an opportunity for the MHRA to learn the lessons from\n elsewhere as they design their own scheme. \n&#xa0;\n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe development of innovative medicines is a highly regulated, lengthy and expensive undertaking and the continued research and development of novel products to treat areas of unmet medical need should be incen\ntivised by appropriate reimbursement policies. If a similar scheme \nto the ATU de cohort \nwere to be introduced in the UK, an appropriate level of reimbursement should be considered to incentivise innovation by the research community and companies.\n&#xa0;\n5.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is\n also much to be supported in the proposals for adaptive licensing, being developed by the Centre for Accelerating Medical Innovations at Oxford University. Over the past five years a number of schemes have been put forward that take a more adaptive approa\nch to market access\n, such as\n ‘staggered approval’, ‘conditional licensing’ and ‘progressive approval’. The central elements of all these new systems and the important factor that should be incorporated into the early access scheme is not the design but the\n collaboration between academia, manufacturers, \nhealthcare professionals, the regulators, patient groups and – increasingly – reimbursement agencies\n. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Mestre-Ferrandiz, J., Sussex, J. and Towse, A.
