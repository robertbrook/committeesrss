[[[xecutive Summary]]]We do not accepted that Britain has a so-called ‘compensation culture’. We believe this is a myth propagated by the insurance industry to protect their reputation and ultimately their profits. Insurance company profits from motor vehicle insurance remain healthy (market leader Direct Line, saw profits from car insurance rise in 2012 by £262m from £255m in 2011 or 2.7%, Admiral had a 19% profit in the corresponding period). Even though in 2013 companies are reporting tougher conditions – believed to be due to a more competitive market – only last month Direct Line reported operating profits of £418m in the first three quarters. That is a spike of more than 20%. It is important that through this process of reform the initial goal of lowering insurance premiums is not forgotten. There must be clear, independent oversight of any measures seeking to reduce the financial burden to the motorist. The historically huge rise in premiums is now as much a cost of living issue as energy prices. Motorists are required by law to have insurance and therefore Government must focus on the way the industry calculates premiums. There must also be assurances that savings are passed on to motorists and not simply achieved to improve shareholder return. This should be addressed through legislation. The industry cites insurance fraud as a key driver of premium cost and the Government has responded by recommending that medical experts be accredited to improve the quality of reporting and reduce the incidence of fraud. Done correctly, Slater &amp; Gordon support the accreditation of medical experts.  To succeed, a scheme must be completely independent and impartial from influence from interested parties. If fraud does exist at a level which is causing premium pressure, all stakeholders must do everything within their power to limit these opportunities.Key initiatives would include:
