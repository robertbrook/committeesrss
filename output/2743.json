"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Select Committee on the European UnionSub-Committee B - Internal Market, Infrastructure and EmploymentCall for Evidence - EU Action to Tackle Youth Unemployment&#xa0;Response from Institute For Employment Studies (IES) byKari P Hadjivassiliou and Stefan Speckesser&#xa0;1. \nDo you think that the EU should be providing funding to Member States to tackle youth unemployment? Does EU action respect Member States’ powers in the area of social and employment affairs? \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. Is there sufficient disaggregation in EU measures to tackle youth unemployment between, for example, support for young people classified as being not in education, employment or training (‘NEETs’), support for newly qualified graduates looking for work, and general career guidance? \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4. \nAre the EU’s accounting, monitoring and evaluation procedures sufficient to be able to determine whether EU funded projects to tackle youth unemployment have been successful or not? Are there ways in which they could be improved? \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5. \nHow do you think the funds allocated through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and the European Social Fund (ESF) could best be spent? \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6. \nDo you feel that young people (aged 15-24), youth groups and their representatives are involved and consulted to a satisfactory degree in the decisions being made around EU funding for youth unemployment projects, and how they are administered? &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8. \nHow can the EU and Member States embrace new technologies and new methods of working to combat youth unemployment? \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7 October 2013\n7\n&#xa0;\n              \nhttp://www.youthforum.org/\n              \nhttp://qualityinternships.eu/\n&#xa0;\n              \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=993\n              \nhttp://we-mean-business.europa.eu/\n              \nhttp://europa.eu/youth/en\n&#xa0;\n"
