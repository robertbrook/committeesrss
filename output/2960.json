"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from the Department for Transport (SRN 008)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;Questions&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nInvestment1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe commitments \nwe \nmade in the Spending Review constitute the biggest ever upgrade of our \nexisting \nstrategic national roads network, tripling annual investment on major roads enhancements from today’s level to over £3bn by 2020/21.\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis \nwill allow us to address the backlog o\nf repairs and deliver a world-class road network that can meet our future needs, transforming performance by \nimproving connectivity, capacity and journey reliability\n.\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInvestment can also enhance the standard of safety for road users. Our safest roads are t\nhose where we’ve already invested – where junctions are safe, where dual carriageways \nand motorways \ntake much of the risk out of overtaking and where surfaces and alignments \nreflect\n modern\n standards\n. For example improving \nbusy \nat-grade junctions to \ngrade-separated standard would not only mean better flowing traffic but potential safety improvements of 25%-50%.\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn \nAction for Roads \nwe made clear that a\nny improvements to the network will need to be made in a way that supports our\n quality of life and sustainability\n outcomes. This means that our vision for roads must \nb\ne designed to minimise environmental impacts and also address existing problems. The scale of investment which we intend to deliver means that we can afford to invest \nin environmental safeguards. Greater use of measures such as tunnels, green bridges, noise mitigation\n and measures to control air quality impacts\n, means that there \ndoes not need to be \na stark choice between a well-functioning road network and a well-protec\nted environment\n.\n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe will build on and expand existing cooperation with environmental and other \nbodies\n,\n and \nroads \ninvestment \nwill \nbe accompanied by an aggressive policy of decarbonisation, to address the carbon consequences of motoring and move us to a lowe\nr-impact future.  \n1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government has made an unprecedented long-term commitment to speeding the transition to low emission motoring in the \nUK\n, including the goal of seeing every car on the \nUK\n’s roads effectively zero emission by 2050.  \nAction for Roads \ncommitted an additional £500m to support the switch to the latest ultra-low emission vehicles\n, \nwhich builds upon existing funding and the\n £1 billion\n \nof joint industry and g\novernment funding for an Advanced Propulsion Centre.\n&#xa0;\n \nThis will \nsupport\n \nimprovements\n in air quality \nas well as\n \nreductions in\n carbon \nand greenhouse gas emissions\n.\n1.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe also want to ensure that improvements to \nthe \nSRN\n \ntake account of the needs of non-motorised users, such as cyclists and walkers. This includes addressing key areas where major\n roads create a barrier to cyclists and walkers, improving safe access for cyclists, especially around junctions, and taking account of their needs in the design of road improvements. \nThe Highways Agency has \nalready \nbeen working with Sustrans to \nidentify s\npecific\n improvements \nacross the\n network. \n&#xa0;\nReform1.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur strategic road network needs to be well-funded, with the right investment in the right places. However, it also needs to be well run in order to ensure that investment delivers value for money for\n \nroad users and taxpayers. \n1.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAction for Roads\n set out a range of significant reforms, building on the recommendations of Alan Cook’s 2011 \nindependent report ‘\nA Fresh Start for the Strategic Road Network\n,\nto improve performance and efficiency. These included:\n \n&#xa0;\n1.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe expect these reforms to generate major efficiency savings across the roads programme. We will be launching a consultation on our more detailed proposals for reforming the Highways Agency in the near future.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is important that transport planning is integrated with land use planning so that transport facilities can be developed to meet future needs at the outset. \nIn May 2012 we set out \nplans for \nroute based strategies (RBS\ns\n)\n \nto \nidentify \nthe management and enhancement \nneeds \nof our road network\n,\n tak\ning\n account of local needs and interests\n, including\n local authorities, Local Enterprise Partnerships, motorists’ organis\nations, environmental groups and others\n.\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecent H\nA schemes already include successful links with local transport –\nfor example \nnew improvements to the A453 will connect directly to park and ride facilities on the Nottingham Express Transit extension. \nOver t\nhe next two years RBS\ns\n will cover all of the network and \nhelp identify where these synergies exist\n, and will form a key part of the evidence that will inform the first Roads Investment Strategy\n. \nThis may include identifying\n cases where the best way to addr\ness capacity issues on the \nSRN\n will be to do something\n on other networks.\n \nMore broadly, w\ne will also seek to \nalign road \nand\n \nrail investment strategies \nfrom 2017. \n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe should not be looking to choose between investing in roads and investing in rail if we want to remain internationally competitive. \nThat is why they Government has committed to significant, complementary investments in both our road and rail networks.\n T\nr\nansformative projects such as HS2 and Crossrail are investments in our national economic success. It is important that these networks serve to complement one another to enhance the \nUK\n’s connectivity. Subject to consultation, the proposed HS2 stations at Bi\nrmingham International, \nManchester\n \nAirport\n, East Midlands and\n \nSheffield\n will all be located close to existing motorways.\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nD\nepartment \nhas committed\n to publish\ning\n a \nNational Networks \nNational Policy Statement (NN NPS) by the end of the year which will set\n out the policy and planning framework within which applications for planning consent for nationally significant road, rail and rail freight interchange developments are considered. \nThe \nNN \nNPS\n will make an important contribution to removing planning barrie\nrs to growth by providing clarity and certainty to scheme promoters and decision-makers on the government’s priorities for development.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe N\national \nT\nransport \nM\nodel (NTM)\n is designed to forecast long-term trends (currently 2010 to 2040 in five year intervals) based on:\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe three key drivers for road traffic are population, income and the costs\n of road transport\n. Between 2010-2040 the population in \nEngland\n is expected to rise by 20%, GDP \nper capita is projected to \nrise by 57% and the fuel cost of driving is projected to fall by 28%. By 2040 \nSRN\n traffic is forecast \n(in the central case) \nto be 46% higher than in 2010, implying an increase in congestion (measured\n \nas lost time) of about 114%.\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nB\nackcasting exercise\ns, which \ninput past economic and demographic drivers into the NTM accurately \nsupport projections of\n actual traffic growth on all roads in \nEngland\n, \nand \ngive us confidence in our forecast\ns\n, \nthough we acknowledge that our model tends to \nov\nerestimate traffic in urban areas (e.g. \nLondon\n) and underestimate traffic in rural areas\n.\n \nWe continually work to update and improve our modelling and understanding on what and why something is happening and the impact on the future.\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, u\nncertainty is inherently part of forecasting and predicting future behaviour and trends. \nT\nraffic trends and outcomes depend on a large number of variables, economic (\nGDP\n, oil prices) and behavioural (people preferences, trends and social habits). \nForecasts\n must be interpreted as best estimates given \nthe \ncurrent state of\n \ninformation and assumptions. We seek\n to \nreflect\n this uncertainty by using \nscenario analysis and \nsensitivity analysis to understand \nthe \nimpact\n of different assumptions\n and \na range of potentia\nl alternative outcome\ns\n. \n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are exploring any changing patterns in the demand to travel, \nusing the latest National Travel Survey (NTS) data\n,\n \nthrough the re-estimation of the \n‘\ntrip rates\n’\n, and the resultant number of trips to and from an area\n. These are\n us\ned in \nour\n National Transport Model (NTM) and \nalso\n feed into local roads schemes modelling and appraisal. \nThe first stage of \nthe\n \nproject\n \nis \naddressing three key topics:\n&#xa0;\n3.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe second stage of the trip rates project will further investigate the drivers behind any travel demand changes in trip rates observed from the first stage.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government has committed \na substantial increase in investment \non the \nSRN\n, which \nwill \nhelp address long-term issues of capacity.\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMuch of the additional capacity \non the motorway network \nwill be provided through application of \nsmart\n&#xa0;\nmotorways\n (also known as ‘managed motorways’)\n. This is to help get the best out of some of the most con\n&#xad;\ngested sec\n&#xad;\ntions of our motor\n&#xad;\nway net\n&#xad;\nwork. \n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government will also \ninclude\n upgrade\ns to\n the national non\n-motorway network managed by the H\nighways \nA\ngency\n, with a \nsignificant \nproportion moved to dual-lane and grade-separated road ‘expressway’ standard to ensure free-flowing traffic nationwide. As part of this, the Government will tackle some of the most notori\nous and long-standing road hot spots in the country. Roads which are widely recognised as being in need of a solution to alleviate congestion and tackle enduring problems.\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government will identify and fund solutions, initially through feasibility studi\nes, to look at problems and identify potential schemes on the A303 to the south west, the A27 on the south coast, the A1 north of \nNewcastle\n, A1 Newcastle-Gateshead Western by-pass, \nthe A47 \nand trans-Pennine routes between Sheffield and \nManchester\n.\n&#xa0;Innovative technology4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nGovern\nment recognises the important role of technology \nand information \nin improving how people travel. Academia and industry are typically at the forefront of identifying the opportunities and challenges presented by new technologies, an\nd in pushing the boundaries of what is possible. The role for Government is to provide the right environment and support to allow new technologies to flourish\n, including, for example,\n \nthrough sett\ning \na clear\n strategic vision and policy framework\n, \nremoving \nbarriers to commercialisation\n, developing standards and bringing stakeholders together to address common issues\n.\n4.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department for Transport and the Highways Agency are already making effective use of innovative technologies to improve reliability, effici\nency and safety\n on the strategic roads for which they are responsible.\n4.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFollowing the success of the M42\n \nsmart motorway pilot scheme\n -\n \nwhich \ndramatically improved safety\n and\n \nreliability of \njourneys, as well as reduced emissions and\n noise -\n the \nG\novernment is\n \nmaking a large scale commitment\n to this technology. Of the 26 new Highways Agency national roads schemes due to start work by 2015, 13 are \nsmart \nmotorway schemes (see fig 2.4 in \nAction for Roads\n). \n4.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have also provided funding to police forces in England\n for 3D laser scanners to enable faster evidence capture by the police \nfollowing incidents, ensuring that lanes can be re-opened as soon as possible, minimising\n disruption to \nroad users\n and surrounding areas\n.\n4.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department for Transport and the Highways A\ngency are also exploring the potential benefits and implications of\n \nemerging technologies that will influence our roads in the future\n, as well as being closely involved in discussions at European level.\n A particular area of interest is ‘cooperative systems\n’ where \nvehicles cooperate with one another\n and/or the road infrastructure. \n4.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDfT has been working with researchers at \nOxford\n \nUniversity\n and Nissan to develop a ground-breaking trial for semi-autonomous cars, ensuring that government legislation does\n no\nt bl\nock innovation. \nDfT is \nalso \ncurrently in the process of commissioning a feasibility study\n \nto examine\n the \npotential benefits and impacts of \n‘platooning’ for heavy vehicles on strategic roads,\n and the possibility of UK trials\n.\n4.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment’s plans for \nreforming the \nHighways \nA\ngency will \nalso \nprovide \ngreater freedom, flexibility and in\ncentives\n for the SRN road operator \nto develop innovative techniques to improve network management\n and deliver more efficiently\n.\n&#xa0;5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nG\novernment is committed to investing in our national road infrastructure to improve capacity, reduce conges\ntion and enhance connectivity across the country. \nIn \nInvesting in Britain’s Future\n, the Government outlined a dramatic increase in the level of public investment in infrastructure of all kinds, including roads. \nThis will fund the biggest-ever upgrade of our existing network. \n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn delivering this investment, we will consider the ways in which the private sector can best help speed delivery and drive efficiency.\n  \n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe continue to rule out tolls as a mechanism to fund\n existing roads. However\n,\n t\nhere will be cases where the combination of the significant expense of the scheme and the distribution of the benefits means that it is fair that users meet some of the costs of the scheme, rather than general taxpayers. This wou\nld be in very limited circumstances where schemes deliver new roads or transform an existing road into an entirely new route beyond all recognition and there is a strong economic and commercial case for a contribution from tolling.\n&#xa0;\n \n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n‘\nAction for Roads\n’\n has\n set out the Government’s plans for reforming the Highways Agency, making it more efficient, more secure, and giving it the freedoms needed to match the best performance in the private sector. \n \n5.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInternational experience, as well as lessons from the way oth\ner types of infrastructure are run in the \nUK\n, suggests that this could lead to more efficiency, quicker delivery and better forward planning.\n As discussed in ‘\nAction for Roads\n’ \nmost European countries, such as \nFrance\n, \nAustria\n and \nSweden\n, run their \nstrategic roads at much greater distance from central government.\n5.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are confident that our programme of reforms will allow \nEngland\n’s roads to catch up wit\nh its international competitors\n. We will continue to keep \nthe potential contribution of private finan\nce\n under review, but further institution\nal change would only come after full \ndiscussion \nwith the public and stakeholder groups. \n&#xa0;\n6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe management of the \nSRN\n will always be a partnership between the network operator on the one hand and a range of private sector contractors on the other. Successful cooperation is vital to a well-run and cost-effective road network.\n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n transformation\n to set up the Highways Agen\ncy as a\n \npublicly-owned company\n, as laid out in \n‘\nAction for Roads\n’\n is aligned with the recommendations made in \nAlan Cook\n’s independent \n2011 \nreport \nand \nwill\n \nsubstantially improve the network operator’s performance\n. \nWe will provide more details of the Governm\nent’s proposals for reform of the Agency in our forthcoming consultation.\n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese changes\n \nrepresent\n a clear break from \nthe \nshort-term thinking and stop-start culture\n that has affected the management of the network to date\n. It will put in place the structures\n, commitments and relationships to support a more ambitious infrastructure programme, and allow the \nSRN\n to operate more like the best-performing infrastructure providers in other sectors. \n6.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt will mean a clearer, more strategic role for government – provid\ning a strong, certain framework against which the managers of the \nSRN\n could be held to account, and a network operator who can prioritise network management over government processes. \n6.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis will have knock on benefits for suppliers. Credible independence \nwill allow confidence in road investment plans, enabling suppliers to procure materials at lower costs through longer contracts and invest more in recruitment and staff training.\n6.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt will also challenge the supply sector. T\nhe \nnew body \nwill be seeking an exp\nansion in supply, cost savings and doing things faster\n, which will bring new challenges to m\nanufacturers and suppliers\n.\n We will need industry to step up to help us deliver our objective to have a road network fit for the 21\nst\n century.\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nAlan Cook\n, \nA Fresh Start for the Strategic Road Network\n, \nNovember \n2011\n ‘\ntrip rates\n’\n are the number of trips made by person segmented by area, household a\nnd purpose of the journey\n"
