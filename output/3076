defaultThe social implications of youth unemployment represent a pan-EU challenge that does not respect borders, as evidenced by the recruiting of young people from Spain and the UK to work in Germany as apprentices.  The political implications are demonstrated by the rise of neo-Nazi organisations in Greece, for example, where young people are recruited into militias.  It is therefore incumbent on the EU to provide focused funding which targets specific challenges, with local focuses on where the social/political risks are demonstrably highest.  This should be channelled through local delivery agencies which mean that the existence of such funding must be far better advertised than currently.  A recent project targeting East Kent youth unemployment was spectacularly under-promoted with many agencies precluded from bidding because they were unaware of the funding opportunity thanks to the inefficiency of the Cabinet Office which was responsible for disseminating the information.

defaultThe very existence of EU support needs to be far better promoted.  In Wales, the existence and value of ESF Funding is widely known, and has supported a far better response to youth unemployment through apprenticeships and traineeships than in England, as Mr.Vaughn’s submission shows.  Additionally, EU Funding can be a useful lever to disseminate good practice, especially where states are reluctant to admit that others do it better.  There is much good practice in states as different as Wales and Germany that others, especially England, are reluctant to learn from.

defaultThere are both commonalities and differences that are to be found in all unemployment situations.  
defaultCommon links are particularly found around issues of employability/fitness for the workplace. The employability deficit is found in both NEETs, graduates and long term unemployed. The differences are to found in access to opportunities, recruitment barriers, skills acquisition etc, Further complications in England result from the differences (ideological, structural and administrative)  that flow from three departments of state with varying degrees of responsibility for the 16-24 agenda.  For example, the apparent denial of Job Seekers 
defaultAllowance by the DWP to young people undertaking work experience as part of their traineeship programme – a BIS initiative.  Multiple initiatives to deal with unemployment overlap, conflict and confuse delivery agencies.

defaultThis presents a huge challenge to EU Funding, hence the recommendation above that EU Funding should target local issues through local agencies,

defaultAs with all evaluative procedures, the tendency is to measure that which is easily measured rather than which matters.  The EU needs robust criteria that can evaluate both hard and soft outcomes, and these have to clearly agreed. For example, simply taking someone out of work into employment whilst invaluable needs to be monitored for longer-term persistence in work as well. Was this outcome a result of simple job matching with no input in terms of additional skills or employability training, or was it a result of such training being provided? Clearly the latter approach is better in the long term. Do cash incentives make a real differences?

defaultThe best value for money would be in transforming the skills and employability basis within secondary education, thus attacking the root problem of much youth unemployment. Schools do not prepare young people for the world of work.  Schools fail in this regard, and lack of funding is only part of this.  Numerous surveys in the UK confirm this reluctance of employers to hire young people.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen such an intervention has taken place, the results are remarkable.  Barclays Bank PLC took on 1000 young people last year into their apprenticeship progamme without regard to their qualifications or prior experience.  With an employability support programme delivered by their training partner, Elmfield Training, Barclays achieved an 85% success record with a cohort that previously would not have made it to the first stage of the recruitment process. I would strongly advise inviting Mike Thompson, who runs this programme for Barclays to give evidence. (email:

defaultI would strongly advocate the direction of funding at this challenge.

defaultThey know nothing about such funding, as I discovered in Kent recently.  As I stated earlier, if many agencies are unaware of such funding, how can young people be expected to be aware?  A major challenge here!

defaultMy comments above touch on the risk/challenge of youth migration. I believe this has been neglected, certainly in the UK, when we focus far more on migration from Eastern Europe for example.

defaultDeploy the technologies that young people use, and ensure that all young people have access to such technologies.
