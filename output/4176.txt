[[[Written evidence submitted by Prof. Phil Redmond [FBB0076]]]]&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]This submission is made in a personal capacity, but informed by having worked in television for over thirty years and engaged professionally with the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 at many levels.I created Grange Hill for the BBC and Brookside and Hollyoaks for Channel 4, and through that Mersey Television, based in Liverpool, which grew to become the UK’s largest independent drama production company and a global centre of technical excellence.In latter years, in my public roles as Creative Director of European Capital of Culture 2008 and then Chair of the Independent Advisory Panel to the UK City of Culture, I have witnessed the collaborative and supportive power of the BBC as the UK’s primary public service broadcaster. It’s scale and reach is something that should not be diluted but strengthened, cherished but, also be encouraged to better promote cultural and creative activity across the UK.It will not take much. Just a small shift from competitive media company to a refocused public service facilitator. In other words, the BBC does not have any UK competitors for its public service remit, it does not need to do everything itself, but it can facilitate so many others to do so much more.This paper cannot fully expand that argument within the constraints set, but does try to answer the questions as set by the terms of reference, and in the same point order. &#xa0; Sykes Committee 1923&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
