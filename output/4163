[normal]The Need 
[normal]For
[normal] The Television Licence Fee In The 21
[normal]st
[normal] Century
[normal]Written evidence submitted by Miriam Hall, 
[normal]British 
[normal]citizen
[normal], student
[normal] and Public Service Media consumer
[normal]Executive summary:
[normal]This submission addresses the following terms of reference of the committee: 
[normal]I have 
[normal]3 policy recommendations:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The licence fee: best funding method
[normal]Similarly 
[normal]advertising funded 
[normal]producers
[normal] 
[normal]neglect
[normal] smaller 
[normal]audiences
[normal], leaving minorities 
[normal]under represented
[normal].  
[normal]Dr Helen Weeds notes that the reason that PSM was developed in the 1930s 
[normal]was because advertising would not fund
[normal] high quality or diversity in television, as advertisers value audience size or attracting specific demographics “rather than the value of the co
[normal]ntent to consumers.”
[normal] 
[normal]In PSM the value of content for the public must be paramount
[normal], so advertising should not fund it
[normal].
[normal]In 2013 Finnish PSB Yleisradio replaced its licence fee with a ring-fenced means tested tax collected by the government, calculated per head not pe
[normal]r household. The 2013 annual report shows the broadcaster has transformed well
[normal], but it will likely take several years (and a few governments) to see if the fears of budget cutting and loss of independence due to state control of funding are realised.
