[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1. StepChange Debt Charity is the UK’s largest specialist provider of free, independent debt advice. The Charity offers support and solutions to over 400,000 heavily indebted consumers every year. In 2012 we helped clients repay £327 million in unsecured d
[normal]ebt. 
[normal]Introduction[bold]2. A lack of adequate support for housing costs in a reformed welfare system leaves many households with an invidious choice:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. However, for households with persistent low income all three of these outcomes are often unavoidable.
[normal]4. In the long term, if the welfare system does not offer claimants enough help with housing 
[normal]costs it will result in:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Analysis[bold]6. Analysis of our clients, representative of all consumers seeking debt advice in the UK, taking onto account the DWP’s predict drop in welfare income of £12 a week, shows:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Driving unsecured over-i[bold]ndebtedness[bold]7. An adequate level of support for housing costs is crucial to keeping people financially solvent.
[normal]8. Structurally unsustainable finances are a key driver of over-indebtedness. In the first quarter of 2013, 26 percent of people living in rente
[normal]d accommodation advised by StepChange had a negative surplus – having to spend more than household income each month on essential bills such as council tax and fuel. This circumstance leaves individuals, a) in a position where they are likely to take out u
[normal]nsecured credit to pay essential household bills, b) very vulnerable to financial shocks
[normal]. 
[normal]9. We are concerned that welfare reforms leave more people in this difficult position and will therefore result in increased personal indebtedness. Taking into acco
[normal]unt the predicted decline in income resulting from the housing elements of the reformed welfare system the proportion of clients with a negative budget increases by a further 16 percent
[normal]. This is an estimated 40,139 people representing over £500 million 
[normal]worth of unsecured problem debt.
[normal]Table 1[bold]10. Because of the urgent and regular nature of rental payments we are particularly concerned about people facing payment difficulties turning to payday loans. Analysis of our clients shows that those with rent 
[normal]arrears are far more likely to have at least one payday loan.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]Prioritising rent over other essential bills[bold]11. Over-indebted consumers in rented accommodation with a negative budget are far more likely to have arrears on other priority bills t
[normal]han those with a surplus. We are concerned they are often left with a choice of meeting rent payments or other household essentials, such as council tax or fuel bills.
[normal]12. Figure 1 (below) shows that tenants with a negative budget are far more likely to be
[normal] in arrears on essential household bills. We have estimated the cost to Councils from these StepChange clients alone is £13 million. 
[normal] 13. A high proportion of those falling into a negative budget following welfare reform are also in arrears: 22 percent ha
[normal]ve arrears on council tax, 13 percent arrears on electricity bills, nine percent arrears on gas bills and seven percent arrears on water bills.
[normal]Figure 1[bold]14. As we can see from table 3 those households struggling to meet rent payments are most likely to b
[normal]e in arrears on other essential household bills. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Table 3[bold]  
[normal]Rent arrears[bold]15. Inadequate support for housing costs leaves households with a structurally low income very vulnerable to rent arrears. Figure 2 shows that client with a negative budget are f
[normal]ar more likely to have rent arrears than those with a budget surplus.
[normal]Figure 2[bold]16. We are concerned the direct payment of housing costs in Universal Credit will exacerbate this problem, further contributing to increased arrears. We note a survey conducte
[normal]d by Crisis with 180 councils and voluntary organisations in 2009 about the impact of the LHA reforms. This survey found 82 percent said claimants were falling into arrears or having their tenancies ended as a result of direct payments.    
[normal]17. In this con
[normal]text we are also worried by the use of Continuous Payment Authority (CPA). On average, StepChange clients owe money to six separate creditors. Many of these creditors (particularly payday lenders) will use CPA to recover debt, without concern for individua
[normal]ls’ overall financial health. CPA is a payment mechanism where a creditor using an individual’s credit or debit card details can take money direct from an account at any point without specific approval.
[normal] 
[normal]We see numerous occasions where CPA takes money from 
[normal]accounts, leaving clients unable to meet rental payments. We are concerned that with direct payment of housing costs will leave people vulnerable to missing rental payments because the money passing through their account will be taken by CPA.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reduction [bold]in rent[bold]18. It seems unlikely that rents will reduce in real terms at any point in the foreseeable future, reducing the negative effects of welfare reform changes. Survey evidence from the Residential Landlords Association (RLA) reported a majority of land
[normal]lords receiving housing benefit would not be prepared to reduce their rent levels following welfare reform.
[normal]Failure of plans to repay debt[bold]19. An additional concern is that for households already experiencing debt problems reduced income can imperil any mo
[normal]ve they have made to take control of their finances. A debt management plan (DMP) is a non-statutory tool for repaying unsecured debt over an extended period. Analysis of our client database indicates 11 percent of tenants recommended this solution in Q1 2
[normal]013 will able to continue on it following welfare reform because their income will be too low to repay any unsecured credit debts. This may result in them either having to go bankrupt or fall further and further behind. Both options would result in concurr
[normal]ent loss to individuals and creditors.
