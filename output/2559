defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;default1. StepChange Debt Charity is the UK’s largest specialist provider of free, independent debt advice. The Charity offers support and solutions to over 400,000 heavily indebted consumers every year. In 2012 we helped clients repay £327 million in unsecured d
defaultebt. 
defaultIntroductiondefault2. A lack of adequate support for housing costs in a reformed welfare system leaves many households with an invidious choice:
default&#xa0;

defaultcosts it will result in:

defaultAnalysisdefault6. Analysis of our clients, representative of all consumers seeking debt advice in the UK, taking onto account the DWP’s predict drop in welfare income of £12 a week, shows:
default&#xa0;defaultDriving unsecured over-idefaultndebtednessdefault7. An adequate level of support for housing costs is crucial to keeping people financially solvent.
default8. Structurally unsustainable finances are a key driver of over-indebtedness. In the first quarter of 2013, 26 percent of people living in rente
defaultd accommodation advised by StepChange had a negative surplus – having to spend more than household income each month on essential bills such as council tax and fuel. This circumstance leaves individuals, a) in a position where they are likely to take out u
defaultnsecured credit to pay essential household bills, b) very vulnerable to financial shocks
default. 
default9. We are concerned that welfare reforms leave more people in this difficult position and will therefore result in increased personal indebtedness. Taking into acco
defaultunt the predicted decline in income resulting from the housing elements of the reformed welfare system the proportion of clients with a negative budget increases by a further 16 percent
default. This is an estimated 40,139 people representing over £500 million 
defaultworth of unsecured problem debt.
defaultTable 1default10. Because of the urgent and regular nature of rental payments we are particularly concerned about people facing payment difficulties turning to payday loans. Analysis of our clients shows that those with rent 
defaultarrears are far more likely to have at least one payday loan.

defaultPrioritising rent over other essential billsdefault11. Over-indebted consumers in rented accommodation with a negative budget are far more likely to have arrears on other priority bills t
defaulthan those with a surplus. We are concerned they are often left with a choice of meeting rent payments or other household essentials, such as council tax or fuel bills.
default12. Figure 1 (below) shows that tenants with a negative budget are far more likely to be
default in arrears on essential household bills. We have estimated the cost to Councils from these StepChange clients alone is £13 million. 
default 13. A high proportion of those falling into a negative budget following welfare reform are also in arrears: 22 percent ha
defaultve arrears on council tax, 13 percent arrears on electricity bills, nine percent arrears on gas bills and seven percent arrears on water bills.

defaulte in arrears on other essential household bills.

defaultRent arrearsdefault15. Inadequate support for housing costs leaves households with a structurally low income very vulnerable to rent arrears. Figure 2 shows that client with a negative budget are f
defaultar more likely to have rent arrears than those with a budget surplus.
defaultFigure 2default16. We are concerned the direct payment of housing costs in Universal Credit will exacerbate this problem, further contributing to increased arrears. We note a survey conducte
defaultd by Crisis with 180 councils and voluntary organisations in 2009 about the impact of the LHA reforms. This survey found 82 percent said claimants were falling into arrears or having their tenancies ended as a result of direct payments.    
default17. In this con
defaulttext we are also worried by the use of Continuous Payment Authority (CPA). On average, StepChange clients owe money to six separate creditors. Many of these creditors (particularly payday lenders) will use CPA to recover debt, without concern for individua
defaultls’ overall financial health. CPA is a payment mechanism where a creditor using an individual’s credit or debit card details can take money direct from an account at any point without specific approval.
default 
defaultWe see numerous occasions where CPA takes money from 
defaultaccounts, leaving clients unable to meet rental payments. We are concerned that with direct payment of housing costs will leave people vulnerable to missing rental payments because the money passing through their account will be taken by CPA.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultReduction defaultin rentdefault18. It seems unlikely that rents will reduce in real terms at any point in the foreseeable future, reducing the negative effects of welfare reform changes. Survey evidence from the Residential Landlords Association (RLA) reported a majority of land
defaultlords receiving housing benefit would not be prepared to reduce their rent levels following welfare reform.
defaultFailure of plans to repay debtdefault19. An additional concern is that for households already experiencing debt problems reduced income can imperil any mo
defaultve they have made to take control of their finances. A debt management plan (DMP) is a non-statutory tool for repaying unsecured debt over an extended period. Analysis of our client database indicates 11 percent of tenants recommended this solution in Q1 2
default013 will able to continue on it following welfare reform because their income will be too low to repay any unsecured credit debts. This may result in them either having to go bankrupt or fall further and further behind. Both options would result in concurr
defaultent loss to individuals and creditors.
