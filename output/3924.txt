[[[ [OD 27]]]]The UK government’s recent National Action plan reasserts the aim of making the UK government the ‘most open and transparent government in the world’. It is ‘leading the world on Open Data’ to bring about ‘economic, social and political progress’. However, the broad aims of the transparency agenda raise a number of uncertainties that could undermine the goals of the reforms.

[[[The Uncertainties of Open Data]]]The first uncertainty concerns which of the ‘economic, social and political’ aims the government supports. Observers have noted a shift in emphasis from the democratic aims of government transparency and accountability to the economic aims of encouraging growth. Although originally inspired by the MPs’ expenses scandal, there is an increasing emphasis on these ‘economic’ objectives, demonstrated by David Cameron’s commitments at the 2013 G8 meeting on tax transparency. Jonathan Gray made the point after the OGP that ‘The Prime Minister's speech typified a broader trend in open government discourse, away from political accountability and social justice and towards economic growth, digital innovation and supporting startups’.This shift could lead to an obscuring of the other benefits of Open Data. Among the many possible effects of the reforms, Open Data or Big Data could revolutionise how policy is delivered. This aim is likely to attract support from public bodies that could quickly see the benefits of having detailed street-level data on resources, problems and policy impact. Its neglect in the government’s new narrative would weaken a powerful lever for encouraging public bodies to co-operate. The second uncertainty concerns exactly what results the government expects to see. Measuring a general ‘cultural change’ towards openness or ‘community empowerment’ is difficult. The data is unlikely to produce many high profile examples of citizens using the data, so called Armchair Auditors given the lack of comparable data or mechanisms of accountability. This leads to the third uncertainty: how are the benefits supposed to happen? The emphasis on Open Data as an ‘enabler’ of involvement or participation is slightly misleading. There remains confusion about how exactly Open Data can be used-who, for example, should an unhappy citizen send their unearthed misspending to? How could it then be used to rectify a situation or hold a body to account? For Open Data to work it needs to fit alongside new accountability mechanisms, feedback systems or means of participating. The promised new ‘localism’ mechanisms that could help the data to work at local level, such as community budgeting, are yet to appear.

[[[Consequences]]]These uncertainties bring possible knock on effects for all the key groups involved, from politicians to public bodies and the public. For politicians the danger is that, like occurred with FOI, ambitious but vague aims may lead to disappointment and lack of interest. Although the Action Plan speaks of the government becoming more enthusiastic about Open Data, politicians generally lose their zeal towards openness and only support it on their own terms. Some interviewees were concerned that the ‘economic’ emphasis involved strengthening the hand of private bidders and led to media portrayals of public bodies as ‘wasters’ of public money. Increased accountability could be a mixed blessing for a Minister, especially if directed at them or their government and may encourage distortion or ‘spin’. Despite its presentation as a ‘neutral’ outcome of technology, Open Data is very political. For public bodies the lack of clarity on aims or outcomes is likely to lead to a range of implementation difficulties. Some local authorities are ‘experimenters’, willing to adapt and innovate with data. However, without clear aims or goals many bodies are likely, at a time of cuts, to pursue a policy of minimal compliance and simply put out raw data on their websites. In extreme cases, as seen with some US departments, bodies may simply release ‘old’ or non-valuable information. This also means that the experiments and innovations that could attract the public won’t take place. Given such mixed signals and lack of enthusiasm, the public themselves may lose interest. In the US a similar story of lack of clarity and low compliance lead to low public uptake or interest. The scenario is not inevitable. A greater clarity about the aims and expectations of Open Data would assist those whose co-operation and enthusiasm is needed. The lesson from other transparency reforms is that leadership, clarity and innovation makes for more successful systems.   &#xa0;November 2013&#xa0; See The National Action Plan https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/255901/ogp_uknationalactionplan.pdf Ben Worthy (2013) ‘David Cameron’s Transparency Revolution?’ http://campus.hec.fr/global-transparency/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Worthy-David-Camerons-Transparency-revolution-FINAL.pdfJonathan Gray ‘Open Government Partnership should foster accountability and social justice’, 4th Nov 2013 http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/nov/04/open-government-social-justice-david-cameron See Giles Moss and Stephen Coleman (2013) ‘Deliberative Manoeuvres in the Digital Darkness: e‐Democracy Policy in the UK’.&#xa0;The British Journal of Politics &amp; International Relations.
