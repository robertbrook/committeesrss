[normal]Written evidence from 
[normal]Borrowdale
[normal] Parish Council (TIC 018)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Call for Evidence- Passenger Transport in Isolated Communities was considered by the 
[normal]Borrowdale
[normal] Parish Council at their last meeting, and they have asked that I contact you with the following observation:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]- Over the past season there has been an increase in the number of public bus services, which are serving the 
[normal]Borrowdale
[normal] Valley (a series of isolated rural communities) and whilst the increase in bus services can be viewed as a good thing the Parish Council are concerned that with the increase in the services during the summer may 
[normal]effect
[normal] the commerciality of the services during the Winter. As such the parish council are concerned that profits made during the summer are being ploughed into the extra services, leaving the area at risk of having a reduced or even no bus service during this winter, which would have a significantly detrimental effect on the residents of the parish.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]Borrowdale
[normal] Parish Council requested that I send you a copy of a letter recently sent to Cumbria County Council transport department about the above matter.
