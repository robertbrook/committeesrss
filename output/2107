[normal]Town and Country Planning Association – Written evidence[bold]1. [bold]              [bold]About[bold] the TCPA[bold]              [bold] [bold]1.1 The Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA) is an independent charity working to improve the art and science of town and country planning. The TCPA puts social justice and the environment at the heart of policy debate and inspires government, industry and campaigners to take a fresh perspective on major issues, including planning policy, housing, regeneration and climate change. Our objectives are to:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 Through the debates and processes of recent reforms to the town and country planning system, the TCPA had provided constructive and evidence-based responses to the Government on the implication of the changes. The TCPA engages with a wide range of practitioners and stakeholders from across the public, private and third sectors, and will continue to do so in responding to proposals for change. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. [bold]              [bold]TCPA response[bold]2.1 The TCPA welcome the opportunity to comment on the Draft Deregulation Bill. 
[normal]The draft Deregulation Bill contains a broad range of measures which are intended to reduce the burden of regulation on business, civil society, other organisations (including public sector bodies) and individuals. Of particular interest and concern to the TCPA are proposed measures to:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 The TCPA is concerned that aspects of these changes will have significant and detrimental impact the effectiveness of spatial planning and systematic preparation of policy on housing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 The TCPA responds to the following questions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Are the changes proposed in the draft Bill evidence-based and have any risks associated with the changes been taken adequately into account? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 We are not aware of any detailed evidence that, for example, the duty to prepare a Sustainable Community 
[normal]Strategy,
[normal] has had any quantifiable impacts on economic growth.   The general proposition that duties placed on local authorities create an undue burden is also a political assumption rather than an evidence based conclusion. The issue of whether 
[normal]duties are effective is a real issue but the Bill clearly recognises their utility by making such an obligation the centre piece of the draft legislation.   In our view the more specific and evidenced based the duty the more likely it is to be effective.  The proposed new duty is highly generalised and in relation to planning must be read against a series of other existing statutory duties contained in Section 19 of the 2004 Planning Act.  The proposed duty is, in our view, likely to lead to more rather than less confusion about which duty has precedence in any particular case.    
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5 We are specifically concerned at the suggested abolition of the Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS) and the related obligation for development plans to have 
[normal]regard
[normal] to such strategies their preparation.  The link between SCS and development plans was one of the centre pieces of the 2004 planning regime and was designed to ensure that planning was founded on the wider community aspirations for the sustainable development of an area.  Because the SCS was designed to provide a corporate overview of the local authorities’ objectives it ensured planning was strongly linked to wider set of community aspirations.     Breaking this link runs the very real risk of further isolating planning practice from community views and 
[normal]redsidualising
[normal] it as solely a regulatory rather than positive tool for local communities. We also believe the abolition for the requirements or housing strategy will result in a fragmentation of approaches to one of the most critical policy areas of local government reducing transparency and accountability in relation to range of housing issues.    
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Where is the introduction of such a duty likely to have beneficial effect? Where might there be adverse consequences?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.6 Because the duty is vaguely drawn and not based on clear evidence as to the problem is it trying to address its likely to have a marginal impact at best on local government behaviour particularly in relation to 
[normal]planning.
[normal] The NPPF already makes clear the overwhelming importance of economic considerations in decision making.  Most local authorities are already keenly aware of the need to consider growth in this policy context and it’s hard to see how the provisions of Bill will make a significant difference to their priorities.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.7 The TCPA recommends the Joint Committee considers our brief response to proposals set out in the Deregulation Bill with impacts on the planning system,
[normal] and would be happy to detail our concerns to the Joint Committee if called upon.
