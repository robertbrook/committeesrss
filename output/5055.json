"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nthe \nGwent Police and Crime Panel\n [PCC Progress \n44\n]\n              &#xa0;\nI am responding to the Committee’s inquiry into Police and Crime Commissioners\n.\n&#xa0;\nAs you are aware, the circumstances surrounding the retirement of the former Chief Constable for Gwent earlier this year \nwas widely reported in the news and \ncaused considerable public concern.  The matter was \nalso the \nsubject \nof \ninquiries by the Gwent Police and Crime Panel and your committee.\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe Panel acknowledge that the actions taken by the \nGwent Police and Crime \nCommissioner \nwere \nin compliance with the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act\n.  However, the Panel \nwere not \nconvinced that the current legislative framework provides the correct balance between a Commissioners right to remove a Chief Constable (or ask them to retire voluntarily) and a Chief Constable’s ability to demonstrate their suitability to continue (in relation to performance related issues).  \nThe Panel believe that \nthe first stage of any process to remove or retire a Chief Constable should be undertaken after a prescribed and documented performance assessment has been completed.  This process should be undertaken on a confidential basis and would provide an opportunity for a Commissioner to record performance concerns and give a Chief Constable time to address them or consider their future.  This should be a precursor to any formal or informal process before a Commissioner can remove or retire a Chief Constable.   \n&#xa0;\nTurning to the wider role and powers of Police and Crime Panels, the light touch support and challenge expected by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act \nis not realistic or satisfactory given the wide ranging powers exercised by PCCs. \n \nAs these new arrangements settle down PCPs are meeting more frequently to ensure they have sufficient capacity to support and hold their PCC to account (Gwent PCP ha\ns \nmet 8 times since January \n2013 \nand has another meeting planned before the end of the year). \n \n&#xa0;\nIf real challenge and accountability is to be achieved the role of Panels must be stren\ngthened to ensure that PCPs are consulted before major decisions are taken.  \nAlternatively, \nif the go\nvernment\n \nis\n content with ‘light touch’ accountability for PCCs then \nit\n should acknowledge that the role and effectiveness of PCPs will be limited to a broad overview which will have limited influence.  \n&#xa0;\nI hope the above comments assist the Committee’s inquiry.\n&#xa0;\nDemocratic Service Manager Gwent Police and Crime PanelDecember 2013&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
