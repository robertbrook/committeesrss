[[[Q219 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] Welcome to you all, and thank you very much for taking time away from your busy jobs to come in and see us. The session will last between 50 and 60 minutes, and I should make the point that members of the Committee with relevant interests will declare these now. Are there any interests on careers advice? No. The session is on the record and is being webcast live. Subsequently it will be accessible via the parliamentary website. Witnesses will receive a transcript to check and correct, and this will be put on the public record in printed form. I would ask each of you to begin by stating for the record your names and official titles, and if you would like to make a brief opening statement, that is fine. 

[[[Jane Artess]]]: I am Jane Artess. I work for the Higher Education Careers Services Unit, which is an educational charity. We are responsible for providing careers information and guidance materials for universities. We work predominantly with university careers advisory services and supply information for use by students and graduates. My particular role is to direct our research work. 

[[[Clive Richardson]]]: I am Clive Richardson, the Director of Public Affairs and Research at Go ON UK, which is a national charity that aims to promote digital skills. 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: I am one of Her Majesty’s Inspectors in Ofsted, and I am a special adviser on further education and skills. I am Ofsted’s National Lead for Careers Guidance, which covers pre-16 as well as post-16 careers guidance. I am also the author of a recent Ofsted report on careers guidance, which was published in September. 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: My name is Joe Billington and I am the Director of the National Careers Service, a part of the Skills Funding Agency, which in turn is an agency of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. We deliver the National Careers Service through contracts with careers service providers. There are 12 face-to-face contracts around the country. We have a national helpline for adults and for young people, and a comprehensive website. These are the main channels through which we deliver careers advice. 

[[[Baroness Valentine:]]] I am sorry, but I should declare an interest. The National Careers Service puts money into Skills London; I sit on the board. 

[[[Clive Richardson]]]: Go ON UK is a national charity. We work with the Government but we are not part of government. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Am I right that the HECSU is not part of government either?

[[[Jane Artess]]]: We are not government. HECSU is a wholly independent educational charity.  

[[[Q220 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you very much. We have heard from other witnesses about the vital importance of high quality advice and guidance for young people at key transition points in their lives to equip them for the sort of work that is available. Is it your view that this support is available? 

[[[Jane Artess]]]: Actually, no. The early indications are that access to advice and guidance is by no means uniform across what we might describe as young people: that is, those aged under 25. There seem to be very different systems of career support in schools, colleges and universities. Added to that are different kinds of advice and guidance systems available to those in employment, whether that employment is full or part time. We would also contend that there are currently some serious deficiencies in access to professionally qualified careers guidance practitioners. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] You are not expected to provide an answer to every question. Some questions may be more relevant to one witness than to another.

[[[Clive Richardson]]]: I think I will pass on this one and let my colleagues answer it.

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: As I indicated earlier, Ofsted has carried out a review of careers guidance and we published our report last September. For that review we visited 60 schools and were concerned that very few of them provided good careers guidance for all their pupils. Some schools were carrying out lots of different activities, but they were not well managed. We also found that among the young people we interviewed, around 1,000 had a very narrow view of the career pathways that were available to them. In the few schools that we found were doing this well, the careers guidance service was being led strongly by the leaders of those schools. It was a top priority for them and they were prepared to invest in the service to make sure that their young people get the information they need. Overall, however, we are concerned that the advice is not broad enough and that young people do not understand the full options available to them, and we are particularly concerned about the lack of promotion of vocational training and apprenticeships. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is a worry that we share. Are there any outstanding examples that could be featured as beacons of hope? 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: There were certainly a few schools where we felt that careers advice was a priority. One of the things we will be doing is going back to a couple of those schools to identify good practice and publish the examples in the hope that other schools will be able to follow them. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] May I ask if the academies, which seem to be burgeoning at the moment, have careers advice on the list of things that they should home in on? 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: It depends on when the academies were established. Those that were set up some time ago may not have added it, but I understand the more recent academies do so, if they also have a statutory duty to provide careers guidance. However, it was interesting to note that the few schools that we could see were doing this well were a complete cross-section. They were academies and schools both with and without a sixth form. Likewise, we did see a few schools with very poor careers guidance, and again there was no pattern in their being academies or schools with or without a sixth form, or in their being in urban or rural areas. But that does show that the ones we saw doing it well prove that it is possible to provide good guidance. 

[[[Baroness Hooper:]]] I think it was the Education Reform Act 1988 that brought in the idea of school governors being drawn from the local community, with a certain proportion to come from local businesses and industry. Have you found that there has been much benefit from that, and are the governors working together with the careers advice people? 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: It is interesting to note that one of our recommendations was that that should happen more often. Again, in the few schools that were doing this well, there was an employer or business that provided a member of the governing body. We would not expect them to be hands-on as governors in careers guidance, but we would expect them to give an overview and ensure that they could provide accountability in this area. 

[[[Baroness Hooper:]]] Perhaps they should also arrange school visits to local industry. 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: Yes, they should. 

[[[Q221 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Cotter:]]] I could go on for ever about the Ofsted report because it was quite crushing about many aspects, several of which I am sure we will look at again in the future. There are many examples. Indeed, the National Careers Service does not seem to come out of it terribly well at all—and it is the lead organisation. Perhaps I may make a comment about careers advice and guidance. All of us would wish to see more one-to-one work, but that does not come out particularly well. Nor, indeed, does the website. The answer to those who said, “We want one-to-one contact”, seemed to be, “Oh, you can click on to the website”. Those are discouraging and worrying aspects. The website seemed to be the catch-all, but perhaps it is not as good as it should be. 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: One of the problems with the website is that many teachers and staff working with young people seemed to take it for granted that they know how to use it. I think that many young people have struggled to get the full benefit of it. However, that was not so in every case. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Mr Billington, you are on the spot now. 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: I thoroughly relish the prospect. I should like to make clear just what the National Careers Service is here to do. The National Careers Service is a big part of the Government’s approach to the delivery of careers advice. It was established as the result of a document published in April 2012 entitled The Right Advice at the Right Time. The service had a specific remit, working face to face with people aged 19 and over and those who are unemployed at 18 years old, offering telephone support and website support. The duty for sourcing independent careers advice for young people under the age of 18 lies with schools when they are in school, with local authorities when they are out of school, and with FE colleges and sixth form colleges when they are at college. The National Careers Service does not have a remit to operate specifically within schools. We offer the complementary services of the website and the helpline to assist schools in their delivery. Lots of reports over the past nine months, Ofsted being one of them, have examined how that policy is playing out. The Government are developing a number of strategies to try to encourage schools to adopt some of the ways, which Karen has alluded to, in which schools can work with employers to offer more inspiring opportunities for young people to understand what the world of work is like. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] We have some evidence that arrived only today that talks about the website. It notes interestingly that youngsters do not use it very much. They focus on it for social networks, but only one-third looks to the internet for information about education and training or course offers. If we do not enthuse them to look for the information, surely they are not going to benefit. 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: There are some challenges around how to use IT to support careers options. One of the things that the Government are interested in doing is encouraging a vibrant marketplace so that there are lots of different ways to engage young people in careers. You will be aware that a number of websites have been specifically designed to encourage people’s interest in careers. We do a lot of work on trying to improve our website in order to respond to the feedback we get from young people.One of the biggest obstacles we encounter is how much people know about us, but when we work with young people on the website we achieve very high approval ratings for it. They appreciate what it is doing, but the fundamental point is as you say: that it is the first point of reference when people come to a website to seek this type of information and advice. 

[[[Q222 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Perhaps I may ask a general question that arises from one of the other responsibilities of this Committee, which is the internal market. The internal market has what is called a one-stop shop possibility for people who are looking to trade in the chemical industry, the textile industry, the motor industry and so on. Do you think there is any merit in suggesting that perhaps there ought to be a one-stop shop for careers advice for UK students and young people? 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: There is certainly value in having a single place to go to that can direct you to the best place for advice. It is harder to suggest one place that will necessarily provide all the advice to all the people. The National Careers Service offers that. Anyone can telephone our helpline, and there will be resources at the end of the telephone to help someone find out who is available in their locality to offer support and advice. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Do any of the rest of you have a problem with that one, or at least a suggestion about it? 

[[[Jane Artess]]]: My organisation runs a careers website. Admittedly it is not for young people in school but is aimed primarily at students and graduates in higher education. We have something like 2 million unique users, so we are quite a major provider of information on websites. We have discovered that, increasingly of late, more young people in school are now using our website to see what the job opportunities might be beyond graduation. That is quite an interesting new development. We are also finding that one of the problems with a lack of face-to-face support for younger people, particularly those in schools and colleges, is that it is very difficult for them to know what kind of questions they want answers to by going on to websites. Some websites, including our own, are very dense in the information they provide. While they are not particularly difficult to navigate, it is easy to miss something if you are not sure exactly how to articulate your questions. This is one of our concerns around the lack of guidance available to young people in schools and colleges on how to use online resources. There is therefore a tendency for some young people to approach websites in a slightly superficial way. They may not necessarily utilise effectively the resources that are available on the websites because they are not being prompted to do so by professionally qualified practitioners. This is really quite a major issue. Some of the best websites are excellent, and we need to try to find a way of helping young people to discern between a good website and one that has information on it that is inaccurate, not up to date or even factually incorrect. There is grave concern among some of us that a lot of material is available online that is actually wrong and inappropriate. There is an issue around how to steer people towards websites that are what might be called bona fide. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] If you have any more ideas on this one, would you please write to us with more detail? This has been put in front of me only in the past few days. 

[[[Q223 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Cotter:]]] The field we are talking about is very interesting, although I have not looked at it myself. In order to tempt young people to embark on looking at websites, have you considered involving young people themselves in their design, perhaps introducing something a bit punchy so that they can say, “I have looked at this and it is terrific”? I am not being critical, but I think it is important to try to ensure that young people themselves can offer advice and help.

[[[Jane Artess]]]: Indeed we are doing that. I can only speak on behalf of my own organisation, but we undertake a great deal of user testing. We test out with students every change that we make to the website, and we certainly try to make it as user-friendly as possible. However, as I say, our website is primarily aimed at students and graduates in higher education, so it is very information rich. I suspect—this is perhaps what my colleague has been referring to—that we may need different sorts of websites for the different sorts of individuals who use them. However, user testing is crucial and user-centred design is very much to the fore. 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: We have had a similar experience, having worked very closely with young people to develop our website. The Committee will be interested to take a look a website called Plotr—it is a website so it could not be spelled normally—which is receiving some government support. It is aimed much more at the dynamic end of the spectrum. We find, however, when we have conversations with young people, that there is a vast range of experience. Some young people find that dynamism quite patronising and they want more content, while others ask why it is so dry. It can be difficult. The model we are working towards, which we intend to implement over the next couple of years, is the very notion of a website that is a bit of out of date. What you really need is applications that work through other sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and so on, because that is where young people are all day long. Those sites are open to all and friends will recommend things on them. We are operating much more in that environment going forward. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] You will be glad to hear that we are going to be using Twitter for the inquiry this weekend. 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: Excellent.

[[[Q224 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Fearn:]]] This probably follows on from the previous questions. What is your view of the current ICT literacy of young people, and how do you think this compares with the situation in other member states? 

[[[Clive Richardson]]]: The BBC has carried out some research into media literacy across the UK which shows that 6% of 15 to 24 year-olds lack basic online skills as defined by their ability to send an e-mail or share information. At only 6%, that is quite a low bar. As I say, 6% cannot perform those simple tasks. Research by the Prince’s Trust shows that 17% of those not in education or training would not apply for jobs that require computer skills, so while it is only 6% overall, within that percentage there may well be groups with a greater or lesser predilection to use IT and apply for things online. Across the EU, the OECD Survey of Adult Skills, which was published last year, tested people’s proficiency at problem solving in technology-rich environments. The UK came seventh out of the EU countries on that scale. We are behind the Scandinavian countries, Germany and the Netherlands. We are in the middle of the table. 

[[[Lord Fearn:]]] Sixty per cent is a very high figure. 

[[[Clive Richardson]]]: Six per cent.

[[[Lord Fearn:]]] Where does the fault lie? Does it lie with the education system? 

[[[Clive Richardson]]]: Whenever we talk about the use of the internet, there is always a bunch of different reasons. One of them could be access, in that young people may not have access to the internet in the home, or they may just not have the skills. However, if there is no access either at school or in the home, those skills cannot be built up. The research does not give any of the details, but access and confidence in one’s ability to understand the internet must play a substantial role. 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: We published a recent Ofsted report that looked at the quality of ICT in 74 secondary schools over a period of three years. We could see that only 29 of those schools, therefore fewer than half, actually had good or outstanding ICT provision. The real problem was that some of the young people, particularly those who were more able, were not being supported well enough to develop their skills and perhaps therefore lost interest. The concern was that far too many students reach the age of 16 without the sound foundation in ICT that is required for further study in related subjects. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] How many did you say? What is the percentage? 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: I cannot give the percentages, but I will research the report. We certainly found that far too many young people did not have the basic skills and interest they needed to enable further study. 

[[[Lord Clinton-Davis:]]] What is the input, if any, of the European Union as far as this is concerned? 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: There are structural funds to support the National Careers Service. We spend in the region of £7 million to £8 million a year enhancing the services we offer, which is primarily the face-to-face service for adults or people over the age of 18. That £8 million is a proportion of the £60 million that we put out as our contracting in total. 

[[[Lord Clinton-Davis:]]] Is there any communication between the member states? 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: There is some communication in the academic field on best practice in careers advice. There is a research community that looks at the best models to pursue. I am aware that some of our leading practitioners in this country are in frequent contact with other academics and so on, particularly the Netherlands, but that is an international community, not specifically a European one. 

[[[Q225 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Baroness Hooper:]]] This question has also been touched on already. One development in careers advice has been the increasing use of online tools for young people in place of face-to-face contact. Do you regard this as a helpful development? 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: Everyone is looking at me. I think that it is a useful development. As I said earlier, we find that a lot of young people highly value the fact that they can access very detailed information online whenever they want to without having to wait for an appointment. They can research their own stuff and they know how to do it. They can find things out for themselves. In that sense it is a useful development. I think there is also another group of young people who might be able to do all that, but do not do so. They need to be given some encouragement in order to make that first click. That is the point made by the Chairman earlier: young people do not necessarily use IT for this purpose. It is not the first thing they do. The two things still need to go hand in hand. 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: One of the problems we found is that even among those who could use the website confidently, they did not have a mechanism for recording their ideas. There was no way they could understand where their thinking was going and then record it to discuss with someone. There was no tool for that. Certainly in our inspections we looked at records of interviews that career professionals had had with young people, and they were not always as clear as they could be. That is probably missing, whether it is an online tool or not. Something is needed to really support young people, as they go through the different stages of their education and training, in making their career decisions through understanding the different opportunities that are available. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is blatantly obvious to any of us, but the problem is that in many cases, particularly among the young unemployed we saw in Birmingham and Liverpool, they do not have people to discuss these issues with. They come from backgrounds that do not understand digital and may not have been in work. The conclusion I am coming to is that those who come from higher social levels have less need of websites because they have contacts. Their friends and parents will help them in looking for a job and so on. The ones who really need the websites have neither the digital equipment at home nor the face-to-face contact. They are therefore blighted. How can we break the cycle because this is the one area where we can see real impoverishment both in the home situation and in where they live—and indeed even in the schools they have attended. 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: I shall pick that up. In September last year the Government issued a strategy from Matthew Hancock called the Careers: Inspiration Vision Statement. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] He will be a witness before the Committee next week. 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: The strategy talks about some of the things that the National Careers Service will do and about what other parts of government, and indeed society, needs to do. The vision is very much about getting employers to engage with schools—something we talked about earlier when considering the role of governors. It looks for employers to offer inspiring opportunities to young people so that they can explore what the world of work is like and what a job is really like. I have with me a list of many of the jobs that people search for on our website, but the understanding of what those jobs actually are is often a long way from what they are really like. The vision wants to see direct contact between young people and employers not only in school but by taking kids out of school and bringing them into workplaces, and by offering them have-a-go opportunities to explore what job skills actually are. That kind of engagement opens young people’s eyes and may encourage them to explore the opportunity of having that important conversation about what they are going to do next.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Just as an observation, I would say that we do not help ourselves particularly when we consider the titles of some jobs. They give no indication of what they are. What is on that list of the jobs being searched for? 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: We have 750 job profiles on the register. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] We do not need them all today. Can you let us have a copy?

[[[Joe Billington]]]: I can give you the full list. The top four job searches never change, attracting more than 100,000 views over a six-month period. Those are: teaching assistant, primary school teacher, police officer and social worker. They are always the top four most searched for in the list. We are interested in the IT industry today as well, so I have had those highlighted. Becoming a computer games tester is the 11th most popular search, while computer games developer ranks at number 38. They seem to have gone down the list quite rapidly, but they are up there. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] What about construction and engineering? 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: I am not going to search all the way through the list, but they are there somewhere. 

[[[Earl of Liverpool:]]] You also mentioned that we are midway on the league table of other countries in Europe. It would be interesting to have that league table if we do not already have it. We want to see if there is any correlation between those who are higher up the table seeming to have more success in feeding young people into jobs. I do not know whether you can extrapolate that information from your research. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] The table shows that we rank seventh, with the Scandinavian countries and Germany ahead of us. It is obvious. 

[[[Earl of ]]]

[[[Liverpool]]]

[[[:]]] As I say, it would be interesting to have the league table. 

[[[Clive Richardson]]]: The OECD Skills Outlook was published towards the end of last year. It asks about numeracy, literacy and proficiency in IT. That is one of the categories in the survey, but I will happily share it with you. 

[[[Q226 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Baroness Hooper:]]] Lord Chairman, I believe that another of the witnesses wishes to speak, but perhaps I can put my question as well. I know that the Governments of some countries have pledged that each school child should have a personal computer to use; it is even happening in some countries in South America, and I think it is the case in some Scandinavian countries. Do you see this as being feasible in the foreseeable future? Obviously, if there is a lack of opportunity at home in some cases, the school has to be the alternative.

[[[The Chairman:]]] This cuts back to the digital divide, and our responsibility for the digital economy. We have been pushing on this to ensure that every home in the 500 million population of the European Union has a computer or access to a computer. However, it is going very slowly. 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: We have certainly seen a great increase in the use of computers in schools, particularly primary schools. What we are looking for now is something we have not seen so much of, which is not just the use of computers but actually their programming. That is going to be one of the big skills shortages in the near future. We know that the curriculum is changing, but we will be seeking to make sure that computer programming is taught effectively.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That it is because it is only with a knowledge of programming that young people will understand what a computer can actually do rather than just social networking and finding jobs.

[[[Clive Richardson]]]: Perhaps I can add to that. The provision of kit is obviously crucial, but the ability to understand how to use that kit is equally important. If a computer is supplied for the home, we must make sure that parents also understand what it is for and how to use it. There is also the need to provide an internet connection and there are questions around how that will be funded. The hardware is crucial, but there are other elements: skills and confidence are just as important as the provision of access. It is not just about providing kids with tablets. That is not the end of the story, it is the beginning. 

[[[Jane Artess]]]: This point relates to several other comments, so I hope it is sensible to make it at this juncture. We were talking earlier about the way people make career decisions. Something I might suggest is that there is quite a large body of research and literature about how people make career decisions. Relying on putting information before people is nowadays thought of as a slightly weak approach to such decision-making. There is a view now that people’s career decision-making is much more complex than simply looking rationally at the situation. People’s aspirations have to be considered, along with the kind of fulfilment they might get from a job. The whole area of career decision-making is being seen to be much more embedded within other socioeconomic factors. For example, mention has been made of whether people are looking for information on websites about engineering jobs. Current research literature suggests that young people in particular have a very limited range of ideas from which they choose. They do not choose from all the possible opportunities available to them, but from those things that seem to be appropriate to “people like me”. Those whose parents and backgrounds include experience of higher education, for example, will be more likely to see higher education and entering the professions as a route forward than people whose parents do not have such experiences. What I suppose I am really suggesting is that we need to broaden our thinking beyond simply considering what must be done to help people find information. It is much more complex and rich than that. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Surely it is an exercise in self development. 

[[[Jane Artess]]]: There is quite a lot of material available. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] As you are all experts, can you come up with your ideal plans for what you would like to see being done differently than is the case at the moment? I ask the question because we are spending quite a lot of money on careers advice, and a great deal of brainpower goes into it. It seems to me that the advice is not focused enough, although perhaps that is wrong. Also, the people who really need it are not benefiting from it. If you have any ideas along these lines, again we would be very grateful for them, and we will acknowledge the sources in our report. I hope that that will encourage you. 

[[[Q227 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Cotter:]]] I think it will be interesting to see in due course the list of particular subjects that people are engaging in in terms of jobs. The UK has been criticised for an emphasis on academic qualifications at the expense of vocational training and apprenticeships. Do you agree that this overemphasis exists, and in your view what effect does this have on the ability of young people, especially those who choose not to go to university, to access the labour market? 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: It was clear from the evidence for our report that a low status is given to vocational training and apprenticeships. As part of our survey of 60 schools, we also produced an online survey for parents, to which we had 1,700 responses. Of those, 70% wanted their children to go to university on the A-level route. It might be that they were the parents who could access a computer, but even so, it is a very high proportion. Certainly when talking to young people, their parents and teachers, it is clear that vocational training and apprenticeships are not fully understood. They are seen as a second option. For Ofsted it has become a very high priority to promote the vocational route as an equal route to the academic one. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] You mentioned 70% of parents, but how many of the children wanted the same thing? Was the percentage as high? 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: Talking to children separately, although it would be difficult to match the figures precisely the indication was certainly that that is what they would like to do. Those who felt that they were not able to take the university route felt that they were failing. The most important gap is the promotion of vocational training and employment at level 2, which is the equivalent of a GCSE, and thus not going up to the A-level route. People can then go into jobs and into training as a positive progression and as an achievement. 

[[[Lord Cotter:]]] That information is of great concern. I am a little surprised because I had hoped that the situation was changing. 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: Perhaps I can offer the Committee some encouragement on that front. What Karen has said is right, but it is worth being aware of the change that is going on and perhaps putting our shoulder to that wheel. We have seen a doubling in the number of apprentices in the country over the past four years. There were 240,000 in 2008-09, while 500,000 apprenticeships started last year, which reflects a big growth. There has also been a big growth in the number of employers who want apprentices. Indeed, we have seen a 27% increase just in the last year. Employer demand for apprentices is the key element. That is what will drive up the status of apprenticeships and the status of vocational routes to learning. That will deal with the problem. It is all about demand. If the demand is constantly for graduates, university will continue to be the main route. 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: I agree absolutely that there are now more apprentices, and last year we noted that a 63% increase of applicants who were under the age of 19: that is, applications made by 16 to 18 year-olds. More young people applied last year because they wanted to do apprenticeships, but only 23% were successful. There is a better chance of becoming an apprentice if you are aged 19 or 24-plus. Our concern is for the younger age groups because they do not have the opportunity to join apprenticeships—often because they do not have employability skills. Employers themselves will deem that at that age they are not employable, so that it is why it is really important that schools develop such skills. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Do you think that through these young people, who are now obviously rallying to the call for more apprentices, apprenticeships are commanding more respect? That is missing for this group. They might pretend behind a mask of bravado, but deep down they do not have much self-confidence or self-respect. Do you feel that this could be a win-win situation, where if people take up apprenticeships those around them will think that they are on the right road? 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: The Skills Funding Agency includes the National Apprenticeship Service, which has gathered a lot of evidence and case studies of highly admirable individuals who have been through apprenticeships and are now acting as advocates for apprenticeships. That happens a lot. We are promoting young people going into schools to talk about apprenticeships and that route to success. So it is happening, but Karen’s point is valid in that it is still only happening in a fairly small way. My feeling is that this is a burgeoning development and that it is growing all the time. People such as you can help with that by continuing to push the apprenticeships route. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] We have enough to do without going into schools, I am afraid. 

[[[Baroness Valentine:]]] I am not sure that I have understood exactly what Karen has just said. I recognise that employers might say that 16 to 18 year-olds do not have employability skills if they come in as apprentices. Are you saying that they should therefore stay on at school or go to sixth-form college until they are sufficiently confident to move into the workplace, or are you saying that employers should deal with them more while they are in that phase? 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: I think ideally we would expect schools to promote employability skills in young people so that when they reach the age of 16 they are more employment ready. We know that the FE sector is providing better training in employability skills, so that young people going into FE can develop these skills more quickly. That enables them to become more employable and secure an apprenticeship. That is also what the traineeship programme is doing. However, it is certainly also the case that employers have a large role to play as well in being able to identify what it is that they are looking for in young people, and in making sure that schools and the FE sector understand what those requirements are. 

[[[Baroness Valentine:]]] On the point about employability skills, at the age of 16, even if you have been very well trained, a lot of people are still quite immature, whatever is done. Certainly when listening to FE colleges and businesses talking about this issue, the conclusion I take from them is that trying to put young people into full-time apprenticeships where they are expected to contribute is not a productive way of working with 16 year-olds, however well they have been trained up to that point. They still need a bit more time to grow up in the same sense as people going to university are given time to grow up. That is particularly the case if they are the third generation to be out of work or whatever. I am not clear whether you are advocating employers taking on such people at the age of 16.

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: If young people have basic employability skills, it is a very good idea. They can be provided with training and they will progress. If they do not have those skills, it is up to schools and the FE sector to work with employers to find out what they need so that young people can progress into employment more quickly. That is better than completing a long-term course that might not lead to any employment. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] There are some enlightened employers who give young people a day off each week so that they can improve their literacy and communication skills. 

[[[Lord Clinton-Davis:]]] Can you give us some idea of the issues raised in the debate about this matter? We have raised the question about the UK being criticised, but there must be another point of view, not simply one point of view. Also, what view has been expressed by the TUC about this, if any? 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Perhaps you would like to think about those questions and write to us if you have something to contribute. 

[[[Q228 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Baroness Valentine:]]] European Union funds have been used in the past to support careers advice, for example the National Careers Service. Could you comment on the value of EU funding in this area? Has it been well used and has it added value? We are particularly interested in the European interventions. 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: Shall I start off on this one by talking about the National Careers Service? I alluded earlier to the fact that we spend around £8 million worth of European funding every year on our face-to-face service. The service was launched in 2012, but it had a predecessor called Next Step, which was the adult side of careers advice and guidance prior to the National Careers Service coming in. European funds were first introduced to careers advice and guidance in 2008 as part of the response to the economic downturn at the time. What was then the Learning and Skills Council was running a programme called Response to Redundancy, and that was where lots of European Social Fund money was used. It extended the Next Step offer to people who were not at that time in the priority group. It was formed of people who were in work and doing quite well, but because of the economic downturn many of them were facing redundancy. At the time we added to our list of priority groups a new section comprised of those who were at risk of or facing redundancy. For the past six years the section has remained part of our priority group. Lots of our European funding is focused on ensuring that people who face particular barriers to entering employment are given additional support by the National Careers Service. The European Social Fund has focused on that area and now around 70% of our delivery is made to people in the priority group. Taken together it is broader than the redundancy group. It extends to young people between the ages of 18 and 24 who are not in education, employment or training, people with learning difficulties and disabilities, and ex offenders. There is a list of the priority groups, and that is where the European Social Fund has had its impact. 

[[[Q229 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Earl of ]]]

[[[Liverpool]]]

[[[:]]] In previous sessions we have heard evidence that suggests that one of the biggest areas where there are skills gaps and therefore potentially jobs for young people is that of ICT. What do you think prevents young people coming forward into this area, and what could be done to encourage more to do so?

[[[Clive Richardson]]]: I will start off on this one. I want to make two points by way of context. The first is the size of the digital economy and its importance to the UK. The digital economy accounts for over 8% of UK GDP. It is larger than the construction sector and the education sector. Some 2 million jobs in the UK are due to business activity delivered through digital technology. The mobile operator 02 has forecast that in the period up to 2017 there could be up to 750,000 more jobs in the UK that require digital skills. It is quite a big deal at the moment and it is growing.The other point of context is the diversity of what we mean when we refer to ICT. A career as a video game designer is very different from a career working in data security in the financial services industry, which in turn is very different from working in digital advertising. Those three careers all need high-end ICT skills, but in very different contexts. ICT is a limiting description for what embraces a very rich environment of information, but one thing that we can be confident of is the fact that in the future all jobs will require some form of basic digital skill. I shall go back to the question. I am not sure that it is just about encouraging people to take up these opportunities because skills gaps exist. In Ireland there are currently some 4,500 vacancies in the IT sector, which cannot be filled. Half of all the IT jobs in Dublin have been taken by foreign-born workers because employers cannot get sufficient numbers of people with the skills to fill those vacancies. In the UK, the proportion of 16 to 29 year-olds working in the IT sector over the past decade has declined from 32% to 19%. Why is that? Employers report skills gaps, which goes back to the point about employability skills. While you need to have technical skills, you also need the softer communication, creativity and entrepreneurship skills. It is more about a bundle of skills. Young people leaving school or university often do not have the full complement of skills that employers tend to look for. Another statistic to underline this is the fact that the unemployment rate for IT graduates in 2010 was the highest for all degree courses. There is an issue about making sure that employers are given the opportunity to help feed into course design to make sure that the skills which young people are being taught are actually what employers want, especially in the digital area where the scene changes extremely rapidly. 

[[[Earl of ]]]

[[[Liverpool]]]

[[[:]]] Thank you for such a comprehensive answer. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Do you see a role for EU funds in this area? 

[[[Clive Richardson]]]: There could well be. One of the short-term solutions is to retrain people who have latent digital skills to give them the full package with business input. Some form of matching young people who are unemployed with employers, including SMEs that require digital skills, would be a useful way of trying to address the shortfall. Some funding could be provided. There is a range of companies which deliver digital skills, some of which I am aware of. They are called Free:Formers, Fluency and Codeacademy. They provide kids with digital skills and then put them into positions that are not just in high-end IT; they could go into digital marketing or advertising. The digital advertising market in the UK is now a lot larger than that for TV, so it is a big deal and it is growing. Some funding could be used for this kind of short-term training of young unemployed people with the input of employers who need certain skills. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Mr Billington, you get funds from the EU, do you not? Are they guaranteed for the next 10 or 20 years? If not, when will they next be up for grabs? 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: The next issue is to do with the careers guidance elements of the European Social Fund being forwarded into the skills area. It will be for local enterprise partnerships to determine whether they wish the money that is allocated for their area to be spent as part of the National Careers Service or they want to run their own services locally. We are currently in conversation with all 39 LEPs to determine whether it will be part of the National Careers Service or whether there will be local provision. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Do you find that you get a good reception from the LEPs? Do you find it constructive to work with them?  

[[[Joe Billington]]]: There is a wide variety of LEPs. 

[[[Jane Artess]]]: I cannot comment on all the engagement with IT, but we have some interesting information from the HE sector. It might be of interest to the Committee to know that of those who have studied software engineering or computer science at university, around two-thirds take up positions as what might loosely be called IT professionals, although that certainly covers a wide range of jobs. What is also interesting to note is that when we look at these destination figures, we realise that people who have studied other subjects are in the same position. For example, around 15% of those who have studied physics also progress into ICT-related jobs. It suggests that the sector is amenable to lots of different subject disciplines, certainly at the higher level, but I would guess at other levels as well. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is a real inspiration for young people who do not have jobs at the moment. It should be strongly publicised. 

[[[Jane Artess]]]: It is one of the features of the UK labour market, particularly at the higher levels, that the subject one has studied does not determine the kind of job one will actually go into. In many countries that is not the case, but it is over here. A lot of our graduates go into all sorts of different jobs. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] The Civil Service at the top level is full of anthropologists, architects and goodness knows what else. I believe that the classics are particularly well represented, which is great because that demands a mind-training education. This is no laughing matter, actually. The EU encourages young people to consider studying and working in other member states. 

[[[Q230 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Baroness Hooper:]]] Before I put my question, it occurred to me in the course of the evidence we heard in the discussion about ICT that I ought perhaps to have declared a non-pecuniary interest as honorary president of the British Educational Suppliers Association, whose members include the manufacturers of both hardware and software in this area. The association is also involved in the organisation of the BETT exhibition, which has recently taken place. The European Union’s Youth Employment Package promotes more and better apprenticeships and traineeships, and a Youth Guarantee of work experience or training. How important do you see these as being, and do you think there are other areas where European Union intervention in, I suppose, the form of funding, could help? 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: I have already indicated that apprenticeships and traineeships are absolutely critical for young people. It is interesting to note that what is missing is young people’s understanding that these schemes can lead to higher education courses and professional qualifications as well. Again, as I said earlier, many of the young people we interviewed had a very narrow view of what apprenticeships are and did not realise their potential. I have already talked about our concerns around the recruitment of young people into apprenticeships, but we are also concerned that in many areas the quality is still not good enough. They really are not meeting their full potential in providing the kind of training that will form a good basis for future employment. Having said that, there are of course examples of outstanding provision. Recently we inspected an enormous number of apprenticeships up and down the country, and those offered by the Construction Industry Training Board were judged to be outstanding. BT is another example of a company providing outstanding apprenticeships. Any intervention in supporting people to develop employability skills and understanding what apprenticeships can do, as well as ensuring that their parents and teachers see the value of them, is to be welcomed. 

[[[Q231 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, it is very important to keep them all in the loop. I shall ask my question now. The EU encourages young people to consider studying and working in other member states. Do you think that young people are aware of the EU-operated EURES online system to promote this sort of mobility? How effective is it, and are there better ways in which ICT could be used? 

[[[Jane Artess]]]: I suspect that young people are not that aware of EURES. My sense of this, in a purely professional sense because I have no hard and fast evidence, would suggest that encouraging young people in the UK to think about being geographically mobile is difficult. In some areas it is difficult to encourage young people to think about applying for opportunities in the neighbouring town, let alone in a neighbouring country. There are some very complex social and cultural norms around how people see their travel-to-work opportunities. We often hear that it is also about a lack of competence in the learning of other languages. I do not know whether that is the case, but intuitively I feel that it sounds plausible. That leads me to think that older and more experienced young people, those who already have experience of holding down a job, might be more amenable to thinking about their mobility. When thinking about this question, I was mindful of whether we do enough with employers and businesses that are transnational companies. Does the structuring of work placements and induction programmes include engagement in other countries, both European countries and maybe wider than that? That might be very useful. However, I suspect that one would have to start up such initiatives very much lower down in school so that it then becomes a possibility rather than something that is remote and detached. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] It is a real shame because there are opportunities for young people to go abroad for work, particularly when they do not have too much baggage. Doing so opens up good opportunities for them. Other nations are much more mobile, but the point is that we feel great because we speak English. 

[[[Clive Richardson]]]: I am not sure that EURES does a hugely successful job of promoting the idea of mobility on its website. It looks to be a function where you match CVs with employers who have vacancies, but it does not promote the idea that someone might want to go abroad to work. I know that it is being redesigned, because I was looking at it just yesterday, but I think that someone might learn more about what it is like to work in a different country by watching a two-minute video rather than reading through reams of text on the EURES website. I would suggest that the EU should itself do some user testing to make sure that what it is delivering is actually what young people find useful and interesting. 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: We have a link to EURES from the National Careers Service website. There may be some very limited statistics on how many people have visited that page which I might be able to find. I do not imagine that the number will be very high. The NCS website is quite large and there is a lot of stuff to look at. You have to go in a long way to find the EURES bit. However, I agree with what Mr Richardson has just said: this reflects our conversation earlier about how the NCS and other websites need to learn about how people interact with IT. It seems that EURES needs to look a little more closely at its website. Going to a website in order to find out about working overseas is not actually the way in which people engage. We need to look more into social media engagement. 

[[[Q232 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Clinton-Davis:]]] Perhaps I can ask the last question, which flows directly from what you have been saying. People, and young people in particular, are loath to go abroad. Could something be done to encourage such pathways to be followed? 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: As has already been mentioned, language learning in this country is seen as a subject in itself rather than as a marketable asset for those who want to do vocational training and move abroad. It is certainly something that needs to be better promoted in schools because it is a means of progressing to other vocational training. When we think of the range of jobs and career pathways that are available to linguists per se, they are not many, but actually those who can speak two or more languages really do have a strong asset that will support them. That is not promoted in schools very well.

[[[Lord Clinton-Davis:]]] Do schools, when they take pupils abroad on school trips, encourage that experience to be followed up?

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: There are lots of projects around exchanges, but many of them are not well enough linked to businesses and other vocational opportunities. Again, they are seen as something to help young people learn a language, but there is not enough to help them develop their own career ideas. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] The point was made earlier about companies that are really big over here and are probably based in the UK but which have huge international reach. There might be some merit in schools and universities approaching them—not from the Committee’s point of view—saying that they have young people with talents that can enhance their businesses if they are employed. They will go abroad and come back, particularly when they are young. I know there is always a danger that when employers send someone abroad, they think that they will never get them back because they will be poached by someone else, but that is a risk you have to take. It certainly seems a bit sanguine on the part of the British not to do it. I come from a country where we are always looking at the emigrant ship. Thank you all very much indeed for what has been an extremely worthwhile session. I am going to ask each of you to come up with a question that we should have asked but did not ask, and what the answer to that question is. 

[[[Jane Artess]]]: That is a good one. My major concern is to do with the kind of support structures that we are putting into place. We talk a lot about the lack of career guidance available to young people and I do not want to rehearse the arguments we have already heard. However, there are many different ways in which young people can be supported in their career progression. Let us just take the example of encouraging young people to be more mobile. We need to put in place the support structures that will allow people to feed confident that those are the kinds of moves they can make. Sometimes, with the emphasis on skills, employability and qualifications, we can miss some of the softer things around providing young people with mentors or buddies working in friendlier environments in which the art of the possible can become apparent to them. That is something that we need to think about. 

[[[Joe Billington]]]: I am very interested in the role and function of cultural role models in this arena. We are conscious of the research that has been done recently showing that the careers young people expect to go into are very different from the careers that the economy expects there to be. There is a big mismatch here. Although it is mostly speculation, a certain amount of research has been done into the cause of that, and I have with me some anecdotes which I think are fairly instructive. A conference was held last week called Inspiring Women. It was all about women and the economy, and no doubt the Committee heard about it because the Deputy Prime Minister’s wife was there. One of the questions being put by young women to the National Careers Service people at the conference was about midwifery. I am not sure that 10 years ago you would have found many young women asking about midwifery, but now there is a programme on the telly. Thirty years ago, when I was thinking about a career and some of my colleagues were careers advisers, lots of young women were asking about becoming motor mechanics. Again, you would not expect young women to ask about this career path, but at the time Kylie Minogue was a motor mechanic on “Neighbours”. It is worth spending a little time thinking about cultural role models and what they can do. The number of people who expect to work in the media and expect to make it by winning a talent contest is quite high, while planning for what the economy wants is quite low. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] What about the dancers?

[[[Joe Billington]]]: I really do not think that I am going to make it as a dancer; I am past that point. 

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: Very much building on what has just been said, what is missing is good information about skills shortages, where developments are taking place, and then promoting them. It follows on exactly from what Mr Billington has been saying. It is all very well for people to be inspired to do something, but there is no point if there are no jobs in that area. That is why there is a call to the LEPs to work so as to make sure that more information directly from businesses is made available in schools and to training providers to ensure that the training provision really is producing the skills that are required in the economy. 

[[[Q233 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Earl of ]]]

[[[Liverpool]]]

[[[:]]] Do you think there is a role for Facebook and Twitter in all this? I do not use either of them so I do not know. This question comes slightly out of the left field, but it occurs to me that if we want to reach young people, they are all on these social network sites. I am not sure I would go as far as wanting to see mentors on the Facebook site, but do you think there is a role for Facebook and Twitter in helping the young to find employment?

[[[Karen Adriaanse]]]: I think that this is already happening, but only on a very small scale. When we find it working well on our inspection visits, it is certainly something that we will be able to promote as good practice. It is an area that we are looking at. 

[[[Jane Artess]]]: It is already happening quite a lot in higher education. Lots of higher education careers services use Facebook and Twitter to communicate with students. Social networking is definitely replacing e-mail. 

[[[Clive Richardson]]]: I shall pick up on the gender divide in digital and look at what more can be done to encourage women to take up science, education and tech degrees. Women’s participation in technology has been declining over the past few years, so what can we do to champion the role models? They would be Baroness Lane-Fox or Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook. We are working with networks that seek to promote women in technology because at the moment it looks like things are going in the wrong direction. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you all very much indeed. We have had a fascinating evidence session about a fascinating subject. It is also very important, because as a country youth unemployment is one of the most serious areas of concern we have. &#xa0;
