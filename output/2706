default Summary
default&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultThe CIEH welcomes the Select Committee’s Inquiry into the Government’s review of housing standards and its proposals on the Code for Sustainable Homes.  The principal role for Environmental Health Practitioners is in the maintenance of housing standards and conditions in the private rented sector, but there is strong interest in the standards 
defaultet
default for new build housing
default, not least
default as these are of course the private rented dwellings of the future. The consultation also raises important issues about accessibility and space standards
default, which are of 
defaultparticular
default interest
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultThe key points of our submission are:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2default              defaultOverall approach default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultThe consultation is concerned with the standards that are applied to new housing construction and seeks to both to simplify standards and remove unnecessary ones, concentrating on those that should be 
defaultmandatory
default,
default 
defaultwhile other issues are left to be the subject of 
defaultvoluntary 
defaultcodes adopted by the industry. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCIEH position
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultThe distinction between mandatory and voluntary is sensible, but the 
defaultbalance between the two has 
defaultto be set carefully. 
defaultT
defaulthe housing market 
defaultcurrently favours the 
default“seller” and voluntary codes cannot be relied on 
defaultalone 
defaultto achieve the housing stock required in the longer term. 
default 
defaultFurthermore, government policies, especially its carbon-reduction targets, depend heavily on the performance of the current and future housing stock. The government should also be planning to ensure that the housing stock is better suited to the demographic shifts that are taking place. 
default&#xa0;default3default              defaultImplementation default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultThe 
defaultconsultation 
defaultpaper considers different methods for implementing the standards, e.g. embodying them in the Building Regulations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCIEH Position
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThe
default CIEH ha
defaults 
defaultsome concerns about placing sole reliance on the Building Regulations, firstly in terms of the consistency w
defaulthen 
defaultapplied on energy issues and secondly, while the
defaulty
default are a well-established and relatively stable mechanism, 
defaultthey have proven less successful in driving up 
defaultstandards. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultIt
default i
defaults not only in energy efficiency that Building Reg
defaultulations
default are inconsistently applied
default; t
defaulthey
default are
default also not noted for
default bringing about
default step changes in standards
default,
default while the
defaultre is resistance by
default house builders 
defaultto
default improvement
defaults.  But we do not view the solution as being in
default voluntary codes
default.

default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultWhilst this is n
defaultot an issue of great significance for 
defaultthe CIEH
default, 
defaultwe support the establishment of a 
defaultreview group
default, which
default should 
defaulthave a
default broad
default base 
defaultto reflect consumer and wider interests (e.g.
default on
default environmental
default and

default had occasional input into.
default&#xa0;default5default              defaultStandards for affordable housing default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultThe 
defaultGovernment proposes to remove separate standards for affordable housing but that its higher needs are ‘taken into account’ in implementation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCIEH Position 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultWe agree with the Chartered Institute of Housing that s
defaulteparate standards for social housing have served the sector well. Of course, if the private sector w
defaultas
default willing/able to operate to the same standards then differences may no longer be justified, but recent experience suggests that it is not. 
default&#xa0;default6default              defaultAccessibility default&#xa0;
default6.1
default              
defaultCurrent standards
default on accessibility
default are in part M of the Building Regulations but there are also discretionary standards about wheelchair access and (particularly) the Lifetime Homes (LTH) standard
default, while v
defaultarious other standards are set by local authorities. The government proposes both a minimum, compulsory standard set in Building Regulations and two further optional levels – intermediate (similar to LTH) and high (fully wheelchair accessible) which could be applied to a proportion of units in a development. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCIEH Position 
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultFor too long there ha
defaults
default been ambiguity, not only in the standards to follow when designing accessible property but to the interpretation of the guidance given. The result of interpretation of the guidance alongside the often conflicting policies (also determining the building design) 
defaulthave sometimes led
default 
defaultto “
defaulthybrid
default” properties
default that 
defaultare
default not always fit for purpose or which may have been over manufactured for ‘disability’, rather than being accessible.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default              
defaultOften when considering adaptations to a property the person requiring them has quite differing and individual needs. 
defaultCouncil Disabled Facilities Grant and adaptation 
defaultservice
defaults
default need to consider the individual anthropometrics; one size of adaptation does not always fit all.
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default              
defaultBy making the policy clear and functional, it is hoped that ‘accessible and adaptable’ 
defaulthomes will be provided 
defaultallow
defaulting
default for the easy tailoring to a person’s needs.
default&#xa0;
default6.5
default              
defaultIt is very important to make the standards the same for private and affordable housing, which would hopefully open up the housing options for people perhaps affected by the welfare reform changes, or that are inadvertently discriminated against through lack of accessible stock across tenure. Encouraging private landlords to consider accessible stock might impact on the pressures on the council housing stock.
default&#xa0;
default6.6
default              
default‘The wheelchair standard’ should be researched and be more of a culmination of other recognised guidance. 
defaultW
defaultheelchair users
default should be consulted in this research, which 
defaultshould cover not only the internals of the building, but the approach, access and the provision of parking. 
default&#xa0;
default6.7
default              
defaultSome local authorities 
defaulthave seen 
defaultincreased demand 
defaultfor one bed wheelchair accessible stock
default, following
default the introduction of the welfare reform changes, however, location of this also needs to be near community facilities or is not easily rented. 
defaultThere is some evidence also of
default a rise in families requiring accessible, level access property, so that they are able to easily and independently tend to their children and stay together as a family in their chosen community. These are mostly 3-4 bed needs. Developers have reported that costs of building such stock are high due to the land required and there is no incentive to build this type of stock, resulting in costly extensions to
default&#xa0;
defaultexisting properties, if the building structure lends itself to this in the first place.
default&#xa0;
default6.8
default              
defaultThe part M requirements essentially make a home ‘
defaultvisitable
default’ rather than fully useable overall by a disabled person.
default&#xa0;
default The debate is therefore essentially about whether LTH (or similar) should be required nationally across sectors.
default&#xa0;
default It already applies in London and several LAs outside London and the previous government planned to extend it to the private sector. The obvious arguments in favour are the ageing population and the much lower cost of incorporating higher standards from the outset. 
default&#xa0;
default6.9
default              
defaultPart M was a significant advance nevertheless it is somewhat tokenistic and can be applied that way. By contrast, LTHs are not only about the immobility of age and, for example, ought to facilitate caring for chronically sick people in the community.
default&#xa0;default7default              defaultSpace default&#xa0;
default7.1
default              
defaultNational space standards apply only in affordable housing through the HCA and GLA, although they may be enforced by LAs through planning policies. Given the variety of approaches there is obviously a case for harmonisation. 
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default              
defaultThe government has backed away from directly tackling poor space standards and prefers a voluntary approach based on labelling.
default&#xa0;
default However, if the aim is to avoid conflicting approaches
default, the Government 
defaultwould 
defaultprobably need to
default rescind current planning guidance that encourages local standards, or else 
defaultencourage
default a consistent voluntary standard which LAs would have to adopt if they wanted to 
defaultexceed
default the minimum. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCIEH Position 
default&#xa0;
default7.3
default              
defaultThe 
defaultlargely voluntary approach of the past clearly has
default 
defaultn
defaulto
defaultt delivered.
default&#xa0;
default Setting (adequate) mandatory standards would not only have significant practical benefits but be of symbolic importance in the government/construction industry relationship too.
default&#xa0;
default7.4
default              
defaultBritain currently 
defaulthas
default the lowest floor space in new build in Europe and is the only country without minimum standards.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe CIEH 
defaultfavour
defaults
default a minimum standard that applies to all housing, not just affordable housing, that could then be consistently applied across England. 
default We do not consider that an official labelling system is required above that.
default&#xa0;
default8default              defaultWater efficiency default&#xa0;
default8.1
default              
defaultB
defaultasic water efficiency is currently covered by the Building Regulations and 
defaultlocal authorities
default are able to put forward local standards, which are normally part of sustainability requirements linked to the Code. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government favours continued standards and proposes a dual approach – one based on the whole house and the other on efficiency of individual fittings.
default&#xa0;
default The standards would be aimed at a similar level as currently. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCIEH Position 
default&#xa0;default8.2
default              
defaultThe CIEH is 
defaultsceptical of 'whole house' standards since these seem harder to enforce, lead to less market transformation and in some cases have encouraged the installation of inappropriate fittings (to 'balance' other inappropriate fittings) which are then replaced. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are also not convinced on the case for
default more stringent local standards; it
default i
defaults plain that household consumption cannot be squeezed inexorably to accommodate more and more incomers and where there
default i
defaults no further scope for resource development or leakage reduction, the planning system has to say 'no'.
default&#xa0;default9default              defaultEnergy default&#xa0;
default9.1
default              
defaultThere are two main issues 
defaultof
default concern 
defaultto the 
defaultC
defaulthartered Institute
default: the proposed 
defaultwi
defaultnding
default up
default of the Code for Sustainable Homes and the scrapping of the provisions in the Planning and Energy Act 2008 which permit local standards for energy efficiency to be set. The importance of the domestic sector in energy use and the double advantage of tackling energy-inefficiency in homes (i.e. both reducing energy us
defaulte and cutting consumers’ costs)
default 
defaultmeans 
defaultit is vital that standards are as ambitious as possible if the government’s 2020 and 2050 carbon reduction targets are to be met. 
default&#xa0;default10default              defaultCode for Sustainable Homesdefault&#xa0;
defaultCIEH Position
default&#xa0;
default10.1
default              
defaultWe 
defaultare
default concerned at the loss of the Code for several reasons: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default11default              defaultLocal standards default&#xa0;default11.1
default              
defaultLocal planning authority standards have required developers to work to local sustainability goals, for example generating a proportion of energy on-site, from renewable sources.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultCIEH Position
default&#xa0;
default11.2
default              
defaultInitiatives like the "Merton Rule" 
defaulthave worked well and
default should be encouraged.
default&#xa0;
defaultAn important consideration is that planners and planning authorities have often been in the driving seat for local sustainability ideas which have then been taken up more widely.
