&#xa0;
[normal]We are pleased to submit the following evidence in the name of the Parents Circle – Families Forum
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Parents Circle
[normal]-
[normal]F
[normal]amilies 
[normal]F
[normal]orum is an organization of more than 600 bereaved 
[normal]Palestinian and Israeli families who have lost an immediate family member in the conflict. The PCFF
[normal] w
[normal]orks to solve the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis through dialogue and mutual
[normal] 
[normal]understanding.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given that the lack of trust and empathy between th
[normal]e sides allows for the cycle of violence to continue, 
[normal]t
[normal]he Forum presents a different and much-needed perspective on the reasons for the violence. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To achieve this goal we work to imbue both sides with a sense of tolerance and reconciliation rather than hat
[normal]red and revenge, sharing with others our personal and painful stories. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Each day, through our activities and outreach
[normal],
[normal] the Families Forum reaffirms the sanctity of life and the need to safeguard human dignity and freedom.
[normal]The long term vision of the organi
[normal]zation is to create a framework for a reconciliation process to be an integral part of any future political peace negotiations. Without reconciliation, we believe there can only be a ceasefire, and not a lasting peace.
[normal]To lay the groundwork for a lasting p
[normal]eace, PCFF provides, first and foremost, the opportunity for Israelis and Palestinians to meet.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the context of conflict, the two peoples remain alienated from one another, a separation which is fortified by feelings of fear, hatred, mistrust and dehuman
[normal]ization of the other.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rather than allow bereavement to serve as yet another reason to hate, PCFF’s activities aim to use the personal stories of bereaved Israelis and Palestinians to prevent further bereavement on both sides, to demand a peaceful resolutio
[normal]n to the conflict from 
[normal]p
[normal]olicymakers and to educate the public towards reconciliation.
[normal]The PCFF’s work has been recognized by highly respected international figures
[normal],
[normal] including President Obama,
[normal] former Prime Minister and Quartet Envoy
[normal] 
[normal]Tony Blair, 
[normal]Archbishop D
[normal]esmond Tutu, US President Bill Clinton, US President Jimmy Carter, Daniel Barenboim and many others.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]here is a British F
[normal]riends of the 
[normal]PCFF 
[normal]which is a registered charity
[normal] in the UK. I
[normal]ts patrons include Lord Rowan Williams, 
[normal]Lord Jonathan Sacks
[normal], Juliet Steve
[normal]nson, Dr Usama Hasan, 
[normal]Rabbi Jonathan Wittenberg
[normal], Dr Amineh Hoti, 
[normal]Karen Armstrong
[normal], 
[normal]Huw Irranca-Davies MP
[normal], 
[normal]Lord Janner of Braunstone QC
[normal] and 
[normal]Rabbi Lionel Blue
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is our deep conviction, borne out of our personal experiences, and confirmed by the impact of our activities, that promoting mutual understanding of the other within Israeli and Palestinian societies at the grass roots level is central to resolving the 
[normal]conflict. The most powerful way to do this, and the most challenging, is to bring Israelis and Palestinians face to face in a spirit of open dialogue, and not confrontation. Prior to the Second Intifada contact between the two societies was far greater. Th
[normal]at 
[normal]desperate period of conflict greatly deepened the
[normal] emotional and physical wedge between the two populations. 
[normal]Today we are struggling against the challenging political situation and the physical barriers
[normal] that separate us
[normal] which
[normal] shut down the space for dia
[normal]logue, reduce understanding, and reinforce hardline positions on both sides.  
[normal]In the context of the considerable sums spent by international donors with the aim of promoting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, we believe that grass roots reconciliati
[normal]on projects like ours are a critically important investment. 
[normal]We urge the UK government to give priority accordingly to grassroots reconciliation efforts
[normal] that
[normal] educate each side about the other and bring Israelis and Palestinians 
[normal]to the understanding that no
[normal]n-violence is the only solution to this never ending conflict
[normal].
[normal]Our 
[normal]organization
[normal] is
[normal] constantly searching for new and innovative ways to bridge the divides. Following are examples of our activities. We are proud of what we have achieved, but we are acutely a
[normal]ware that there is so much more to be done, and many more people we need to reach. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4a. 
[normal]Youth Education
[normal]The personal stories of our members hold special significance for
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the younger generation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our
[normal] high school dialogue meetings address young Israeli and Palestinian students.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Since the 
[normal]S
[normal]econd Intifada there is a whole generation who have never met the “other side” and the dialogue meetings may be their first encounter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] After hearing
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the personal nar
[normal]ratives and the joint message of an Israeli and a Palestinian representative from the PCFF in their classroom, there is a
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]definite change in attitude and a willingness to explore the possibility of a dialogue as an alternative to violence and an understand
[normal]ing of the needs of the other. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We know that these encounters work by the interesting and often very poignant feedback forms students fill in at the end of the meeting.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We manage to reach an average of 15,000 students each year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have a follow up meeting
[normal] with the students which includes the screening of “Two Sided Story”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a documentary produced by the Parents Circle – Families Forum, which illustrates the narrative of both sides.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This documentary is based on an adult workshop run by the PCFF.
[normal]4b.
[normal] 
[normal]Summer Ca
[normal]mp – Youth Programme
[normal]It is the children caught in the midst of the Israeli
[normal]-
[normal]Palestinian conflict who have paid the highest price of all:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]they have suffered the trauma of losing an immediate family member.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Each year the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] PCFF
[normal] r
[normal]uns a 
[normal]s
[normal]ummer 
[normal]c
[normal]amp for bereaved children and their friends. The children are aged 14 to 18.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some of the facilitators today have been to the 
[normal]s
[normal]ummer 
[normal]c
[normal]amp themselves and so there is an ongoing commitment to peace after they participate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Today with Face
[normal]b
[normal]ook the participants 
[normal]are able to keep in touch during the year and
[normal],
[normal] dependent on budget
[normal],
[normal] we arrange meetings. The programme includes social games, dialogue, workshops, physical activities, Arabic and Hebrew language lessons and joint creative projects and expressions of their 
[normal]learning.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These activities aim at building trust among the youth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some activities are competitive, where mixed bi-national groups experience work
[normal]ing
[normal] together as teams
[normal]. 
[normal]Palestinian and Israeli youth alike come away from their experience in the 
[normal]y
[normal]outh program
[normal] with increased knowledge of the other, with a sense of connection to one another that was built regardless of religious, cultural, national or ethnic ties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The sense of shared humanity that existed for many before
[normal],
[normal] was cemented by this experience.
[normal]4c. 
[normal]Adu
[normal]lt Education
[normal]Programmatic and People
[normal] t
[normal]o People Approach
[normal]:
[normal]The past several years of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been characterized by an absence and stalling of any political or diplomatic dialogue, therefor the current peace talks make the work on
[normal] the ground
[normal] and
[normal] the 
[normal]p
[normal]eople to 
[normal]p
[normal]eople approach more important than ever. The ongoing conflict continues to create barriers – both emotional and 
[normal]physical
[normal] – between both societies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The PCFF’s work is based on the premise that reconciliation is a multi – level
[normal] process necessary to complement and drive any future peace agreement.
[normal]The underlying basis of the 
[normal]people to people 
[normal]p
[normal]rogram
[normal]me
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] that change results from the interaction of belligerent groups when there is opportunity for increased mutual understanding and
[normal] appreciation. It also 
[normal]works on the premise 
[normal]that following the initial 
[normal]interaction
[normal], partnerships and 
[normal]collaboration
[normal]s
[normal] addressing common concerns create a real long-term commitment, on the way to 
[normal]building 
[normal]true peace between people and communities.
[normal]“History 
[normal]Through the Human Eye”
[normal] project:
[normal]Modules for social change agents, made up of unilateral and bilateral workshops and dialogue activities over time, between Israelis and Palestinians to recognize, learn about and acknowledge the personal and national narrati
[normal]ve of the other.
[normal]The Parents Circle 
[normal]h
[normal]as run 1
[normal]6
[normal] workshops which included Palestinian and Israeli doctors, 
[normal]a
[normal]rtists,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]e
[normal]ducationalists, NGOs, 
[normal]s
[normal]ocial 
[normal]activists
[normal], just to mention a few.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These workshops have created a rippl
[normal]e
[normal] effect and with each workshop we run we
[normal] 
[normal]are 
[normal]hav
[normal]ing
[normal] more and more applicants.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the present climate this is some
[normal]thing
[normal] of a miracle and demonstrates that the Palestinians and Israelis in our group each have standing in their communities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The documentary “Two
[normal] S
[normal]ided Story
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] is based on 
[normal]one of the 
[normal]workshops under this project 
[normal]with participants form every walk of life and 
[normal]shade of 
[normal]opinion in Israel and Palestine. We are screening this documentary 
[normal]throughout the
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]est Bank
[normal] and 
[normal]Israel 
[normal]as well as
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]nternationally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is an exceptional tool for understandi
[normal]ng the narrative of the other and for breaking down entrenched barriers.
[normal]4d.
[normal] 
[normal]Social
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Media
[normal]The past several years of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been characterized by an absence and stalling of any political or diplomatic dialogue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Both sides vie
[normal]w the other with distrust and skepticism and not as partners for making peace.
[normal]Today,
[normal] on the
[normal] front line in the public opinion battle are social media platforms like Facebook
[normal], which is
[normal] very influential among Israelis and Palestinians
[normal]. A 
[normal]third of 
[normal]all 
[normal]Palesti
[normal]nians and around 
[normal]45
[normal] percent of Israelis are active on Facebook
[normal],
[normal] but even on Facebook Israelis and Palestinians are mostly exposed to their own communities and to voices of criticism and hatred 
[normal]on
[normal] 
[normal]both sides.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They do
[normal] 
[normal]n
[normal]o
[normal]t hear enough 
[normal]alternative
[normal] voices and especially the unique voice of the PCFF
[normal].
[normal]The PCFF launched the Crack in the Wall (CITW)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](
[normal]http://www.facebook.com/crackinthewall
[normal])
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] in order to foster interaction between Palestinians and Is
[normal]raelis and to facilitate more opportunities for changing attitudes, breaking down stereotypes and humanizing the conflicted societies in order to break the cycle of violence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The uniqueness of this network is that all its entries are published in Hebrew a
[normal]nd Arabic
[normal],
[normal] allowing users to express themselves in their own language.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Research has shown that technologies of communication like social media platforms have an enabling effect.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They have acted as a catalyst to facilitate and accelerate social change alrea
[normal]dy happening on the ground. Since the Crack in the Wall was launched in April 2012 it has provided a platform for more than 20,000 people, the majority of them Israelis and Palestinians.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It has brought to the forefront the fact that there are Israelis and 
[normal]Palestinians who want to be engaged and who are determined to work together to 
[normal]change the
[normal] status quo. In 2013 the Crack in the Wall project won the prestigious 
[normal]United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC)
[normal]/BMW
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]award.
[normal]We are 
[normal]also 
[normal]proud of our website 
[normal]www.theparentscircle.com
[normal] which publicises our activities 
[normal]in English, Hebrew and Arabic.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4e. 
[normal]Women’s Group
[normal]Women on both sides of the conflict need to be empowered to realize their own strengths and unique abili
[normal]ty to conduct a dialogue and to acknowledge the role of women in the path to reconciliation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]UN resolution 1325 affirms the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, peace-building, peacekeeping
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and 
[normal]humanita
[normal]rian response.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] With all of this in mind
[normal],
[normal] the PCFF
[normal] h
[normal]as created a powerful group of bereaved women who are fast becoming important players in the maintenance and promotion of peace and security.
[normal]Over 2012/2013
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]some 60 Palestinian and Israeli women from the
[normal] group worked on trust building, and capacity building. They learned how to give power to the
[normal]ir
[normal] personal narratives and to be stronger agents for change.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They
[normal] 
[normal]were exposed to the 
[normal]n
[normal]ational narrative from both sides and participated in experiential tours to significant venues 
[normal]which
[normal] 
[normal]illustrate
[normal]d
[normal] the narrative of 
[normal]each side
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They were exposed to the role of women in conflict resolution all over the world in a lecture series and 
[normal]planned
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a 
[normal]successful public event
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]held in Tel-Aviv
[normal], 
[normal]attended by over 1,500 Israelis and 200 Palestinians from the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]West Bank
[normal], an extraordinary achievement in the current circumstances
[normal]. The women created a Photography Exhibition
[normal],
[normal] “The Presence of the Void
[normal]”,
[normal] along with
[normal] “Texture of Life”
[normal],
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]an exhibition of Palestinian and Israeli books which each wom
[normal]a
[normal]n created of her life.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There was also “Jam Session”
[normal], in which
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Palestinian and Israeli women made more than 750
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]bottles of jams and pickles to be sold at the event. A recipe 
[normal]book in English with the story of each wom
[normal]a
[normal]n will soon be ready to 
[normal]sell in order to raise
[normal] funds to further the activities.
[normal]The women’s group is planning a co-op of embroidery from 
[normal]six
[normal] 
[normal]West bank 
[normal]villages 
[normal]as a means of
[normal] empower
[normal]ment
[normal] and for the
[normal] women
[normal] to 
[normal]create
[normal] income.
[normal]4f. 
[normal]Exhibitions
[normal]The Parents Circle-Families Forum has created a number of  exhibitions. “Offering Reconciliation” was an 
[normal]exhibition of 135
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ceramic plates created by Palestinian and Israeli artists.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This exhibition was shown in Israel and then at 
[normal]the United Nations,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]he world Bank, and several other major venues and cities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the 
[normal]“Cartoons in Conflict” 
[normal]project
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]more than 50
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] famous international cartoonists donated cartoons 
[normal]for an 
[normal]exhibition which ha
[normal]s been displayed all over Europe
[normal] and
[normal] the 
[normal]United
[normal] 
[normal]States.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An exhibition create by the women's group - 
[normal]“
[normal]Fabric of War
[normal]”
[normal],
[normal]-
[normal]  was 
[normal]shown
[normal] at the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Royal Festival Hall and will soon be displayed in Chicago.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hese projects 
[normal]generate
[normal] media coverage and expose our message to people who would not normally know about the possibility of reconciliation.
[normal]4g. 
[normal]International activities
[normal]The Parents Circle
[normal]-
[normal]Families Forum send delegates all over the world
[normal] to promote a message of reconciliation
[normal], i
[normal]ncluding regular visits to the UK
[normal] hosted by the UK Friends of 
[normal]PCFF
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On recent trips to Britain we have spoken in
[normal] parliament
[normal], been interviewed
[normal] on three BBC programs and have had articles in the Guardian, Times and other 
[normal]UK news
[normal]papers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We 
[normal]have spoken on nume
[normal]rous university campuses and 
[normal]recently also spoke at the Regents Park Mosque and in several synagogues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We feel it is highly significant that u
[normal]niversities, 
[normal]m
[normal]osques, 
[normal]s
[normal]ynagogues and 
[normal]c
[normal]hurches are willing to host us as Palestinians and Israelis speaking 
[normal]in the 
[normal]sa
[normal]me voice. Our message 
[normal]to international audiences is clear: 
[normal]"D
[normal]o
[normal] no
[normal]t be pro 
[normal]one side or the other but 
[normal]pro
[normal]-
[normal]solution
[normal],
[normal] otherwise you import our conflict into your 
[normal]country
[normal]"
[normal]. This message is particularly important in countries like Britain which have significan
[normal]t Muslim and Jewish communities, with considerable risk of tension
[normal].
[normal]4h. 
[normal]Documentaries
[normal]We have three documentaries which have been shown internationally and have won prestigious prizes from Amnesty International and other Human Rights groups
[normal]. 
[normal]“
[normal]Two Sided 
[normal]Story
[normal]”
[normal] looks at a 
[normal]people to people reconciliation project and the impact on its participants. “
[normal]Within the Eye of the Storm
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]follows two men, one Israeli and one Palestinian, both of whom fought for their national cause, and both of whom lost a daughter in 
[normal]the conflict, in their search to understand one another.  “One Day After Peace” follows Robi Damelin, an Israeli born in South Africa whose son was shot and killed whilst on military service in the West Bank, in her quest to learn lessons from South Africa
[normal]’s 
[normal]Truth and Reconciliation Committee
[normal].
