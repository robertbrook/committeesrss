&#xa0;
defaultWe are pleased to submit the following evidence in the name of the Parents Circle – Families Forum
default.
default&#xa0;defaultThe Parents Circle
default-
defaultF
defaultamilies 
defaultF
defaultorum is an organization of more than 600 bereaved 
defaultPalestinian and Israeli families who have lost an immediate family member in the conflict. The PCFF
default w
defaultorks to solve the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis through dialogue and mutual
default 
defaultunderstanding.
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven that the lack of trust and empathy between th
defaulte sides allows for the cycle of violence to continue, 
defaultt
defaulthe Forum presents a different and much-needed perspective on the reasons for the violence. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo achieve this goal we work to imbue both sides with a sense of tolerance and reconciliation rather than hat
defaultred and revenge, sharing with others our personal and painful stories. 
default&#xa0;
defaultEach day, through our activities and outreach
default,
default the Families Forum reaffirms the sanctity of life and the need to safeguard human dignity and freedom.
defaultThe long term vision of the organi
defaultzation is to create a framework for a reconciliation process to be an integral part of any future political peace negotiations. Without reconciliation, we believe there can only be a ceasefire, and not a lasting peace.
defaultTo lay the groundwork for a lasting p
defaulteace, PCFF provides, first and foremost, the opportunity for Israelis and Palestinians to meet.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the context of conflict, the two peoples remain alienated from one another, a separation which is fortified by feelings of fear, hatred, mistrust and dehuman
defaultization of the other.
default&#xa0;
defaultRather than allow bereavement to serve as yet another reason to hate, PCFF’s activities aim to use the personal stories of bereaved Israelis and Palestinians to prevent further bereavement on both sides, to demand a peaceful resolutio
defaultn to the conflict from 
defaultp
defaultolicymakers and to educate the public towards reconciliation.
defaultThe PCFF’s work has been recognized by highly respected international figures
default,
default including President Obama,
default former Prime Minister and Quartet Envoy
default 
defaultTony Blair, 
defaultArchbishop D
defaultesmond Tutu, US President Bill Clinton, US President Jimmy Carter, Daniel Barenboim and many others.

defaultriends of the 
defaultPCFF

defaultKaren Armstrong

defaultHuw Irranca-Davies MP
default, 
defaultLord Janner of Braunstone QC
default and 
defaultRabbi Lionel Blue
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is our deep conviction, borne out of our personal experiences, and confirmed by the impact of our activities, that promoting mutual understanding of the other within Israeli and Palestinian societies at the grass roots level is central to resolving the 
defaultconflict. The most powerful way to do this, and the most challenging, is to bring Israelis and Palestinians face to face in a spirit of open dialogue, and not confrontation. Prior to the Second Intifada contact between the two societies was far greater. Th
defaultat 
defaultdesperate period of conflict greatly deepened the
default emotional and physical wedge between the two populations. 
defaultToday we are struggling against the challenging political situation and the physical barriers
default that separate us
default which
default shut down the space for dia
defaultlogue, reduce understanding, and reinforce hardline positions on both sides.  
defaultIn the context of the considerable sums spent by international donors with the aim of promoting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, we believe that grass roots reconciliati
defaulton projects like ours are a critically important investment. 
defaultWe urge the UK government to give priority accordingly to grassroots reconciliation efforts
default that
default educate each side about the other and bring Israelis and Palestinians 
defaultto the understanding that no
defaultn-violence is the only solution to this never ending conflict
default.
defaultOur 
defaultorganization
default is
default constantly searching for new and innovative ways to bridge the divides. Following are examples of our activities. We are proud of what we have achieved, but we are acutely a
defaultware that there is so much more to be done, and many more people we need to reach. 
default&#xa0;default4a. 
defaultYouth Education
defaultThe personal stories of our members hold special significance for
default&#xa0;
defaultthe younger generation.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur
default high school dialogue meetings address young Israeli and Palestinian students.
default&#xa0;
defaultSince the 
defaultS
defaultecond Intifada there is a whole generation who have never met the “other side” and the dialogue meetings may be their first encounter.
default&#xa0;
default After hearing
default&#xa0;
defaultthe personal nar
defaultratives and the joint message of an Israeli and a Palestinian representative from the PCFF in their classroom, there is a
default&#xa0;
defaultdefinite change in attitude and a willingness to explore the possibility of a dialogue as an alternative to violence and an understand
defaulting of the needs of the other. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe know that these encounters work by the interesting and often very poignant feedback forms students fill in at the end of the meeting.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe manage to reach an average of 15,000 students each year.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have a follow up meeting
default with the students which includes the screening of “Two Sided Story”
default&#xa0;
defaulta documentary produced by the Parents Circle – Families Forum, which illustrates the narrative of both sides.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis documentary is based on an adult workshop run by the PCFF.

default 
defaultSummer Ca
defaultmp – Youth Programme
defaultIt is the children caught in the midst of the Israeli
default-
defaultPalestinian conflict who have paid the highest price of all:
default&#xa0;
defaultthey have suffered the trauma of losing an immediate family member.
default&#xa0;
defaultEach year the
default&#xa0;
default PCFF
default r
defaultuns a 
defaults
defaultummer 
defaultc
defaultamp for bereaved children and their friends. The children are aged 14 to 18.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome of the facilitators today have been to the 
defaults
defaultummer 
defaultc
defaultamp themselves and so there is an ongoing commitment to peace after they participate.
default&#xa0;
defaultToday with Face
defaultb
defaultook the participants 
defaultare able to keep in touch during the year and
default,
default dependent on budget
default,
default we arrange meetings. The programme includes social games, dialogue, workshops, physical activities, Arabic and Hebrew language lessons and joint creative projects and expressions of their 
defaultlearning.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese activities aim at building trust among the youth.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome activities are competitive, where mixed bi-national groups experience work
defaulting
default together as teams
default. 
defaultPalestinian and Israeli youth alike come away from their experience in the 
defaulty
defaultouth program
default with increased knowledge of the other, with a sense of connection to one another that was built regardless of religious, cultural, national or ethnic ties.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe sense of shared humanity that existed for many before
default,
default was cemented by this experience.

defaultAdu
defaultlt Education
defaultProgrammatic and People
default t
defaulto People Approach
default:
defaultThe past several years of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been characterized by an absence and stalling of any political or diplomatic dialogue, therefor the current peace talks make the work on
default the ground
default and
default the 
defaultp
defaulteople to 
defaultp
defaulteople approach more important than ever. The ongoing conflict continues to create barriers – both emotional and 
defaultphysical
default – between both societies.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PCFF’s work is based on the premise that reconciliation is a multi – level
default process necessary to complement and drive any future peace agreement.
defaultThe underlying basis of the 
defaultpeople to people 
defaultp
defaultrogram
defaultme
default 
defaultis
default that change results from the interaction of belligerent groups when there is opportunity for increased mutual understanding and
default appreciation. It also 
defaultworks on the premise 
defaultthat following the initial 
defaultinteraction
default, partnerships and 
defaultcollaboration
defaults
default addressing common concerns create a real long-term commitment, on the way to 
defaultbuilding 
defaulttrue peace between people and communities.
default“History 
defaultThrough the Human Eye”
default project:
defaultModules for social change agents, made up of unilateral and bilateral workshops and dialogue activities over time, between Israelis and Palestinians to recognize, learn about and acknowledge the personal and national narrati
defaultve of the other.
defaultThe Parents Circle 
defaulth
defaultas run 1
default6
default workshops which included Palestinian and Israeli doctors, 
defaulta
defaultrtists,
default&#xa0;
default 
defaulte
defaultducationalists, NGOs, 
defaults
defaultocial 
defaultactivists
default, just to mention a few.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese workshops have created a rippl
defaulte
default effect and with each workshop we run we
default 
defaultare 
defaulthav
defaulting
default more and more applicants.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the present climate this is some
defaultthing
default of a miracle and demonstrates that the Palestinians and Israelis in our group each have standing in their communities.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe documentary “Two
default S
defaultided Story
default”
default&#xa0;
default is based on 
defaultone of the 
defaultworkshops under this project 
defaultwith participants form every walk of life and 
defaultshade of 
defaultopinion in Israel and Palestine. We are screening this documentary 
defaultthroughout the
default 
defaultW
defaultest Bank
default and 
defaultIsrael 
defaultas well as
default 
defaulti
defaultnternationally.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is an exceptional tool for understandi
defaultng the narrative of the other and for breaking down entrenched barriers.

default 
defaultSocial
default&#xa0;
defaultMedia
defaultThe past several years of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been characterized by an absence and stalling of any political or diplomatic dialogue.
default&#xa0;
default Both sides vie
defaultw the other with distrust and skepticism and not as partners for making peace.
defaultToday,
default on the
default front line in the public opinion battle are social media platforms like Facebook
default, which is
default very influential among Israelis and Palestinians
default. A 
defaultthird of 
defaultall 
defaultPalesti
defaultnians and around 
default45
default percent of Israelis are active on Facebook
default,
default but even on Facebook Israelis and Palestinians are mostly exposed to their own communities and to voices of criticism and hatred 
defaulton
default 
defaultboth sides.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey do
default 
defaultn
defaulto
defaultt hear enough 
defaultalternative
default voices and especially the unique voice of the PCFF
default.
defaultThe PCFF launched the Crack in the Wall (CITW)
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default(
defaulthttp://www.facebook.com/crackinthewall
default)
default&#xa0;
default in order to foster interaction between Palestinians and Is
defaultraelis and to facilitate more opportunities for changing attitudes, breaking down stereotypes and humanizing the conflicted societies in order to break the cycle of violence.
default&#xa0;
default The uniqueness of this network is that all its entries are published in Hebrew a
defaultnd Arabic
default,
default allowing users to express themselves in their own language.
default&#xa0;
defaultResearch has shown that technologies of communication like social media platforms have an enabling effect.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey have acted as a catalyst to facilitate and accelerate social change alrea
defaultdy happening on the ground. Since the Crack in the Wall was launched in April 2012 it has provided a platform for more than 20,000 people, the majority of them Israelis and Palestinians.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt has brought to the forefront the fact that there are Israelis and 
defaultPalestinians who want to be engaged and who are determined to work together to 
defaultchange the
default status quo. In 2013 the Crack in the Wall project won the prestigious 
defaultUnited Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC)
default/BMW
default&#xa0;
defaultaward.
defaultWe are 
defaultalso 
defaultproud of our website 
defaultwww.theparentscircle.com
default which publicises our activities 
defaultin English, Hebrew and Arabic.
default&#xa0;
default4e. 
defaultWomen’s Group
defaultWomen on both sides of the conflict need to be empowered to realize their own strengths and unique abili
defaultty to conduct a dialogue and to acknowledge the role of women in the path to reconciliation.
default&#xa0;
defaultUN resolution 1325 affirms the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, peace-building, peacekeeping
default&#xa0;
defaultand 
defaulthumanita
defaultrian response.
default&#xa0;
default With all of this in mind
default,
default the PCFF
default h
defaultas created a powerful group of bereaved women who are fast becoming important players in the maintenance and promotion of peace and security.
defaultOver 2012/2013
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultsome 60 Palestinian and Israeli women from the
default group worked on trust building, and capacity building. They learned how to give power to the
defaultir
default personal narratives and to be stronger agents for change.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey
default 
defaultwere exposed to the 
defaultn
defaultational narrative from both sides and participated in experiential tours to significant venues 
defaultwhich
default 
defaultillustrate
defaultd
default the narrative of 
defaulteach side
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey were exposed to the role of women in conflict resolution all over the world in a lecture series and 
defaultplanned
default&#xa0;
defaulta 
defaultsuccessful public event
default&#xa0;
defaultheld in Tel-Aviv
default, 
defaultattended by over 1,500 Israelis and 200 Palestinians from the
default&#xa0;
defaultWest Bank
default, an extraordinary achievement in the current circumstances
default. The women created a Photography Exhibition
default,
default “The Presence of the Void
default”,
default along with
default “Texture of Life”
default,
default&#xa0;
defaultan exhibition of Palestinian and Israeli books which each wom
defaulta
defaultn created of her life.
default&#xa0;
default There was also “Jam Session”
default, in which
default&#xa0;
defaultPalestinian and Israeli women made more than 750
default&#xa0;
defaultbottles of jams and pickles to be sold at the event. A recipe 
defaultbook in English with the story of each wom
defaulta
defaultn will soon be ready to 
defaultsell in order to raise
default funds to further the activities.
defaultThe women’s group is planning a co-op of embroidery from 
defaultsix
default 
defaultWest bank 
defaultvillages 
defaultas a means of
default empower
defaultment
default and for the
default women
default to 
defaultcreate
default income.

defaultExhibitions
defaultThe Parents Circle-Families Forum has created a number of  exhibitions. “Offering Reconciliation” was an 
defaultexhibition of 135
default&#xa0;
defaultceramic plates created by Palestinian and Israeli artists.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis exhibition was shown in Israel and then at 
defaultthe United Nations,
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultt
defaulthe world Bank, and several other major venues and cities.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the 
default“Cartoons in Conflict” 
defaultproject
default,
default 
defaultmore than 50
default&#xa0;
default famous international cartoonists donated cartoons 
defaultfor an 
defaultexhibition which ha
defaults been displayed all over Europe
default and
default the 
defaultUnited
default 
defaultStates.
default&#xa0;
defaultAn exhibition create by the women's group - 
default“
defaultFabric of War
default”
default,
default-
default  was 
defaultshown
default at the
default&#xa0;
defaultRoyal Festival Hall and will soon be displayed in Chicago.
default&#xa0;

defaultT
defaulthese projects 
defaultgenerate
default media coverage and expose our message to people who would not normally know about the possibility of reconciliation.

defaultInternational activities
defaultThe Parents Circle
default-
defaultFamilies Forum send delegates all over the world
default to promote a message of reconciliation
default, i
defaultncluding regular visits to the UK
default hosted by the UK Friends of 
defaultPCFF
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn recent trips to Britain we have spoken in
default parliament
default, been interviewed
default on three BBC programs and have had articles in the Guardian, Times and other 
defaultUK news
defaultpapers.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe 
defaulthave spoken on nume
defaultrous university campuses and 
defaultrecently also spoke at the Regents Park Mosque and in several synagogues.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe feel it is highly significant that u
defaultniversities, 
defaultm
defaultosques, 
defaults
defaultynagogues and 
defaultc
defaulthurches are willing to host us as Palestinians and Israelis speaking 
defaultin the 
defaultsa
defaultme voice. Our message 
defaultto international audiences is clear: 
default"D
defaulto
default no
defaultt be pro 
defaultone side or the other but 
defaultpro
default-
defaultsolution
default,
default otherwise you import our conflict into your 
defaultcountry
default"
default. This message is particularly important in countries like Britain which have significan
defaultt Muslim and Jewish communities, with considerable risk of tension
default.
default4h. 
defaultDocumentaries
defaultWe have three documentaries which have been shown internationally and have won prestigious prizes from Amnesty International and other Human Rights groups
default. 
default“
defaultTwo Sided 
defaultStory
default”
default looks at a 
defaultpeople to people reconciliation project and the impact on its participants. “
defaultWithin the Eye of the Storm
default”
default 
defaultfollows two men, one Israeli and one Palestinian, both of whom fought for their national cause, and both of whom lost a daughter in 
defaultthe conflict, in their search to understand one another.  “One Day After Peace” follows Robi Damelin, an Israeli born in South Africa whose son was shot and killed whilst on military service in the West Bank, in her quest to learn lessons from South Africa
default’s 
defaultTruth and Reconciliation Committee
