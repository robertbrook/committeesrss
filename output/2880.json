"              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Mae Tao Clinic&#xa0;\nMae Tao Clinic (MTC) is a health service provider and training centre,\n \nestablished to contribute and promote accessible quality health care among displaced Burmese and ethnic people along the Thai-Burma border. In addition to the comprehensive services provided at its onsite facilities, MTC also promotes general health through partnerships with other community based organisations. We work together to implement and advocate for social and legal services, as well as access to education for people living along the border. \n&#xa0;\nMTC has four main programmatic areas: 1) Hospital Services, 2) Community Outreach and Training, 3) Burma-based health services and 4) Education and Child Protection.\n&#xa0;\nTogether, these four programmes enable MTC to holistically serve the needs of thousands of displaced and marginalized people from Burma along the border. These services are complemented by the numerous collaborations that MTC undertakes with other CBOs, INGOs, networking groups, government and university institutions, ensuring that the plight of the displaced and migrant community is addressed by policy development and other services.\n&#xa0;\nFeedback DFID’s Health Programme for MTC specifically, has met our needs for this current period, by providing the funding for nearly all our medicine and medical supply needs for the period 2013-2015. This was particularly useful, as some other donors do not fund medicines or just fund specific programmes (i.e. Child or malaria).\nAfter 2015, we would still need DFID’s support, as the amount of change required inside Burma is considerable, in order to get the health services to the level needed.\n&#xa0;\nInitial feedback was that DFID Burma expected the pace of change inside Burma, following the election, to be rapid. It was not until several field visits to the border, that the complexities of convergence were better understood, and so expectations changed.\n \n&#xa0;\nThere are currently 3 malaria programmes running inside Burma, for which DFID funds into the 3 MDG programme. This leads to competing priorities and lack of coordinated approach, so it would help if DFID lead/facilitated a coordination group with other major donors, along similar line to the CCSDPT established on the Thai-Burma border for groups working with refugee camps. This type of coordination group would also help in general health services provision, education and other sectors.\n&#xa0;\nDFID should support existing networks and structures more, which would help empower civil society groups both sides of the border.\n&#xa0;\nDFID should leverage their good relationship with the Burma MoH more to advocate for more involvement of civil society groups in helping plan health service provision.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n              \n&#xa0;\n"
