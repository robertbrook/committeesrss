"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by BenXBenX is a group of local authority Benefits and Revenues Services. The purpose of the group is to foster close co-operation in all fields of the administration of Housing Benefit, Council Tax Support, Council Tax and National Non Domestic Rates.  The group also has a wider role in liaising with other relevant Government agencies, including the DWP, DCLG,  Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs and Pension Service.&#xa0;\nThis document states the key aims and objectives of BenX.  &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBenX will:&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAct as a discussion forum regarding new Housing Benefit/ Council Tax Support, Council Tax, NNDR (or related) legislation and policy, to assist in \nsuccessful implementation of new procedures;\n-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMake recommendations and lobby for changes to Housing Benefit/ Council Tax Support, Council Tax and NNDR policy, or related areas, to improve service delivery;\n-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\nct as a consultative working-group for other agenc\nies (for example, Department for Work and Pensions, DCLG), to assist in changes to legislation, policy and procedures.\n&#xa0;\n-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo formulate and develop best practice.\n-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInvestigate use of new systems and pro\ncesses.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo agree key performance measures relating to Benefits, Revenues and customer service – which \nBenX\n member authorities will monitor, benchmark and manage.\n&#xa0;\nLandlords (private rented sector and Registered Social Landlords):In t\nerms of \nprivate sector landlords, as Local Housing Allowance (LHA) has been in place for several years the issue of direct payment is relatively well established – although there are still instances of tenants not paying their Housing Benefit (HB) over to their la\nndlords.  Local authorities are experience\nd\n in, and have the local knowledge to make ‘vulnerability’ decisions relating to direct payment and have done this successfully for a number of years.  Customers being paid Universal Credit (UC) monthly in arrears will cause an issue to many claimants in th\ne first instance and support and financial \nadvice\n would need to be provided to assist, in \nparticularly\n, vulnerable individuals and groups.  \nSimilar issues \nwill apply for RSLs, although the added factor of direct payment would be new, and would cause issue\ns for RSLs in terms of increased rent arrears, recovery costs and potential for increased evictions due to non-\npayment\n of rent.\nIn all cases, local authorities would be well placed and have the skills and local knowledge to provide the support needed.\n&#xa0;Local authorities (including availability of Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs))UC provides a number of key challenges for local authorities:\n&#xa0;Claimants, particularly those in vulnerable groups (such as people with disabilities and families with children), and those in supported and temporary accommodation.Over many years local authorities have established well run working relationships with local housing providers and vulnerable groups.  Named contacts in HB offices \nassist to make these run effectively. \n These relationships \nare vital\n to ensure that customers receive the information, help and support they need.\n&#xa0;\nIn summary, although wholly \nrecognising\n the need for the Benefits system to be simplified, inclusion of housing costs in UC is a \nsignificant\n issue due to local variances, knowledge and expertise, established relationships with housing providers and vulnerable groups, and potential for increasing homelessness (in turn increasing the costs of housing customers in temporary accommodation).  Local\n authorities are well placed to overcome such issues.\n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
