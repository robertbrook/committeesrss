[normal]SUMMARY[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.[bold]              [bold]INTRODUCTION[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]British Transport Police (BTP) is the national police force for the main line railways throughout 
[normal]England
[normal], 
[normal]Wales
[normal] and 
[normal]Scotland
[normal].  In addition to the main national railway network, it is also responsible for policing the London Underground System, the Docklan
[normal]ds Light Railway, the Midland Metro Tram System and Croydon Tramlink
[normal], Sunderland Metro, 
[normal]Glasgow
[normal] subway and the Emirates AirLine
[normal].

[normal]BTP
[normal], since 2009,
[normal] respond to 
[normal]specific railway incidents
[normal] 
[normal]relating to severe weather e.
[normal]g.
[normal] stranded trains; in line with 
[normal]reviewed 
[normal]and revised
[normal] standing operating procedures. i.e. BTP resource response will be proportionate to the 
[normal]nature/severity of the incident
[normal] 
[normal]in support of the affected Train Operating Company or Network Rail.

[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]BTP’s response to 
[normal]severe weather incidents
[normal] is guided by the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and within 
[normal]London
[normal], by London Emergency Services Liaison Panel (LESLP) protocols. BTP utilises the principles of integrated emergency management and has an established 
[normal]planning process for ensuring that critical functions can continue dur
[normal]ing episodes of severe weather.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]Since 2009/10, 
[normal]lessons have been learn
[normal]t
[normal] and plans introduced, 
[normal]which 
[normal]have proven to be effective during subsequent 
[normal]severe weather 
[normal]periods.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]BTP, together with other partners within the Rail Industry have developed a co-ordinated and planned response to severe weather 
[normal]which 
[normal]may affect the 
[normal]UK
[normal] rail network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]BTP 
[normal]proactively monitors
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]he Meteorological Office 
[normal]Internet Site which provides a sho
[normal]rt to medium term weather forecast. 
[normal] 
[normal]This information is also 
[normal]made 
[normal]available to the Transport Providers; who use this information to proactively plan for adverse weather.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Network Rail has a 
[normal]National Coordinator for 
[normal]weather related issues; 
[normal]who reviews 
[normal]the 
[normal]potential impact 
[normal]of severe weather warnings
[normal] to a
[normal]ny 
[normal]part of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] rail network
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Upon notification of a 
[normal]severe 
[normal]weather warning, Network Rail will hold 
[normal]both regional or national teleconferences with BTP and
[normal] other 
[normal]key partners to ensure there is a
[normal] co-ordinated response.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold]              [bold]LESSONS LEARNED[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Timeliness, accuracy and a single authoritative voice is essential in times of severe weather events
[normal],
[normal] in order to minimise disruption to transport system users.  Through appropriate community resilience for
[normal]ums, industry partners and wider organisational partners, BTP seeks to ensure that communications direct from transport system users, in times of severe weather are fully contextualised and responded to, in order to minimise the impact on the travelling co
[normal]mmunity in times of disruption.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]BTP has opened communication channels in the widely used social media networks, of Twitter 
[normal]and F
[normal]acebook, enabling fast-time response to emerging issues.  This is particularly important during tim
[normal]es of severe weather, 
[normal]when time-
[normal]critical information relating to over-crowding 
[normal]at stations, 
[normal]or trains stuck on the route
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]is key to an effective operational response and minimising further disruption or risk to the travelling public on the rail transport network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]Since 2009, 
[normal]BTP 
[normal]has
[normal] 
[normal]developed comprehensive, staged implementation, 
[normal]internal 
[normal]severe weather plans that 
[normal]ensure 
[normal]primarily its own 
[normal]business continuity.
[normal] 
[normal]The severe weather plans include detailed contingencies for ensuring continuation of key policing functions
[normal] such as the response to incidents and ensuring that 
[normal]sufficient 
[normal]staff
[normal]ing levels are maintained.
[normal]  At the same time, the arrangements dove-tail into the wider industry response to such severe weather situations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]BTP has developed a proactive strategy to
[normal] ensure that there are 
[normal]adequate 
[normal]specialist 
[normal]vehicles 
[normal]available 
[normal]which are able to 
[normal]operate effectively during severe weather 
[normal]i.e. 
[normal]4x4
[normal] 
[normal]v
[normal]ehicles
[normal]. The number of such vehicles has been increased over the last two years; this includes an initiative with Network Ra
[normal]il on the 
[normal]Wessex
[normal] route, where a fully liveried 4x4 vehicle is staffed by BTP and a N
[normal]etwork Rail Mobile
[normal] 
[normal]Operations Manager.  This enables a fast-time response to incidents 
[normal]and is invaluable 
[normal]d
[normal]uring periods of severe weather.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold]              [bold]A CO-ORDINATED RESPONSE[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]BTP plays an important role in response to severe weather on the rail transport network.  In o
[normal]rder to maximise the value of w
[normal]hat BTP do, it is essential that BTP work in partnership with others.  In this respect, BTP has worked hard to ensure that we, 
[normal]as a national police service, are better connected with Lo
[normal]cal Resilience F
[normal]orums around the country, in order to fully understand the impacts of severe weather and demonstrate how we can effectively contribute to the minimisation of disruption to the Rail n
[normal]etwork during such severe weather episodes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]At present there is still an independence of operation in response to severe weather across the transport groups
[normal]:
[normal] Rail, Road, Aviation and Maritime.  
[normal]During the Summer 2012 Olympics, the DfT set up a cross-m
[normal]odal transport group, led by BTP, to plan and deliver a safe Games for those travelling.  
[normal]The group delivered a mechanism of understanding how each of the modal forms of transport would contribute to the movement of those travelling to the games and enable
[normal]d a co-ordinated approach to be undertaken.  For transport-related disruption, such a cross-modal group could have benefits in ensuring the minimisation of disruption in times of severe weather.
