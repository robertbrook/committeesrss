[[[(LTD0014)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1 Public transport is essential in allowing disabled people to live independent and active lives. Guide Dogs is an organisation dedicated to improving the independent mobility of blind and partially sighted people and, as such, we have considerable experience in this area and a body of evidence of the experiences of this group in using transport. &#xa0;1.2 Guide Dogs campaigns on transport issues which affect our service users both locally and nationally. In particular we campaign for buses to be made accessible to blind and partially sighted people through the fitting of audio-visual (AV) announcements and for streets to be accessibly designed and kept free from clutter. Guide Dogs has concerns about how changes in local transport decision-making structures will affect these accessibility issues.  &#xa0;1.3 In our capacity as a mobility organisation, we have a particular interest in:Our response is therefore focused on the Committee’s questions which relate to these areas.

[[[the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?]]]2.1 Devolution and localism are desirable objectives inasmuch as they provide greater flexibility to meet the needs of the local population. However, there is a risk that the needs of minority groups within these local populations will not be taken into account in funding decisions. Devolution has to be in the context of prevailing national standards for the accessibility of vehicles, infrastructure and networks. &#xa0;2.2 In the real world, travel is not confined by local authority or LEP boundaries and people with sight loss need to have the confidence that certain accessibility standards will be upheld throughout their journey. A door-to-door journey is only as accessible as its weakest link. This can be illustrated through the current situation on AV announcements: though trains are equipped with AV technology, this brings no benefit to a blind person if their bus to the station is not. If they cannot be confident of safely travelling to the station, then the whole journey becomes effectively inaccessible.  &#xa0;2.3 Guide Dogs concern is that unless national standards are imposed, i.e. a requirement for AV announcements on all buses across the UK, this type of accessibility improvement may become the sort of 'minor' issue which would be scrimped and saved on by a local body at the last minute to avoid budget over-runs. &#xa0;2.4 A recent report by the National Audit Office on Funding and Structures for Local Economic Growth showed that there is no plan to measure outcomes or evaluate performance comparably across different local growth progress. It also noted that LEPs were making progress at different rates: “Some partnerships continue to face significant capacity issues, a factor exacerbated by the recent step change in the demands placed upon them through introducing the Growth Deals and new responsibilities for EU structural funds.” &#xa0;2.5 These regional differences between LEPs will result in patchwork provision of transport, including accessibility improvements, reducing the ability of blind and partially sighted people to travel across the country safely and with confidence.

[[[n of the Single Local Growth Fund have?]]]3.1 Guide Dogs is concerned that the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund could result in less funding for transport projects overall. Our understanding is that the Department for Transport is the biggest departmental contributor to the Single Local Growth Fund – contributing £1.9bn of funding. Most relevant to Guide Dogs is that £100m of this is from the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, a fund for smaller projects which could, for example, be used to equip buses with AV. The money paid by the DfT into the Single Local Growth Fund is not ring-fenced so it is possible that some of the DfT’s money could be used for other local projects unrelated to transport.

[[[How clear are the lines of accountability for ]]]

[[[local decision making on transport expenditure?]]]4.1 The establishment of the £2bn Single Local Growth Fund and the transfer of decision making in respect of this fund to LEPs will increase the part that LEPs play in taking local transport decisions. Guide Dogs is concerned about the accountability of LEPs and their obligations with regard to the Public Sector Equality Duty. The Public Sector Equality Duty empowers different transport users, and particularly disabled people, to engage in the decision-making process, creating better transport solutions for all sections of society.&#xa0;4.2 Local authorities, Passenger Transport Executives and Integrated Transport Authorities come directly within the remit of the Equality Act 2010, through listing in Schedule 19. The status of Local Transport Bodies and LEPs is far less clear. These bodies carry out public functions and so should be subject to the Act, but this has not been supported by clear guidance to this effect. It is concerning that the only easily accessible guidance is contained in the Supplementary Guidance to Local Enterprise Partnerships on the Development and Delivery of European Structural and Investment Funds Strategies. This document reminds LEPs they need to “familiarise themselves” with the Public Sector Equality Duty as they will be advising Managing Authorities (which are bound by these duties) on how best to exercise public functions. This implies that LEPs do not themselves have to have regard to the Public Sector Equality Duty.&#xa0;4.3 There are further concerns about accountability. In a recent article in Transport XTra, Professor Tony Travers of the London School of Economics wrote, “LEPs and local transport bodies are not local government. At the margin they are less legitimate than local government, pure and simple”.   Further concerns come from the recent National Audit Office report which stated: ‘Locally, it is not clear that the government has achieved its objective to “increase democratic accountability and transparency, and ensure that public expenditure is more responsive to the needs of local business and people” ’ &#xa0;4.4 Furthermore, the report states ‘Local Enterprise Partnerships are not subject to the same transparency requirements as local authorities’. Not only is it unclear whether LEPs have to abide by the same equality requirements as local authorities but we are concerned that it will be more difficult for disability groups, such as Guide Dogs, to monitor the work of LEPs and hold them to account. Devolving responsibility for large amounts of transport funding to these bodies may result in less transparent and less accountable decision making, which will have a negative impact upon disabled people. &#xa0;4.5 LEPs do incorporate a voluntary sector input, but disability is much more than just a third sector issue and it would be wrong to assume that the third sector is necessarily the best way for people with disabilities to engage. In summary, with LEPs taking a greater role in decision making, we want to see LEPs placed under a clear statutory duty to take equalities into account in decision making and to meet the same standards that apply to other public authorities in respect of consultation and engagement with people with a differing range of disabilities, including visual impairment.&#xa0;December 2013
