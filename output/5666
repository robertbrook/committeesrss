[normal]Examination of Witness[bold]Emer Costello[bold] 
[normal]MEP[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Q153 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Thank you very much for giving up your time, which we know is very precious. I know you are doing lots of other things. It is very nice to meet you again. This session will probably last approximately 60 minutes. Members of the Committee with relevant interests will declare these now. Do any of you have relevant interests? No, so y
[normal]ou will receive a transcript of the session 
[normal]to check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website.
[normal]I am going to ask if you could begin by stating
[normal],
[normal] for the benefit of the transcriber
[normal],
[normal] your name and official title.
[normal]Emer Costello[bold]: My name is Emer Costello. I am the MEP for 
[normal]Dublin
[normal] region in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] and I am a Labour Party MEP for 
[normal]Dublin
[normal], 
[normal]Ireland
[normal].
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Thank you. I think you probably know what the purpose of our inquiry is: we are part of the European Union Select Committee of the House of Lords. We have the remit to look at the internal market infrastructure and employment. Of course, we do reports and send them to the Commission and to the Government. Our last witness said that she had seen our reports and thought that they were quite good. We are obviously following the 
[normal]D
[normal]irective on unemployment, and we decided to look into this because the consensus is that youth unemployment across Europe is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis. Unfortunately there are all sorts of reasons
[normal] for that
[normal]. We have had a lot of witness sessions from youth, businesses and all sorts of people involved in employment. We are nearing the end of our inquiry now
[normal],
[normal] and we will probably produce a report in mid-April before the Easter 
[normal]R
[normal]ecess. We thought it was a good idea to come over here to see how we could unravel some of the problems we still have with the information we have 
[normal]been getting
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We have 12 on the Committee
[normal]. For 
[normal]reasons of resources
[normal] and all the rest of it
[normal] 
[normal]only a few have come on this trip
[normal]—there is not a lot of point in taking too many people on trips such as this—
[normal]but
[normal] I am very grateful to 
[normal]m
[normal]embers of the Committee who have given up these two days to do this
[normal]. 
[normal]I am particularly grateful to you 
[normal]for
[normal] giving us 
[normal]your time for us.
[normal] 
[normal]We are going to ask you questions
[normal]. Y
[normal]ou have had notice of the questions?
[normal]Emer Costello[bold]: I have indeed, yes.
[normal]Q154 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] I 
[normal]said that
[normal] there is a general consensus that youth unemployment across 
[normal]Europe
[normal] is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis
[normal]. C
[normal]ould you summarise for us your own view of the 
[normal]exact 
[normal]nature of the current problems
[normal],
[normal] and the issues that you are more concerned about?
[normal]Emer Costello[bold]: I 
[normal]will 
[normal]preface any remarks by welcoming you to the European Parliament
[normal],
[normal] and commend
[normal]ing
[normal] you 
[normal]on 
[normal]taking the time to come here to the European Parliament to investigate and explore these issues at a European
[normal] level here in 
[normal]Brussels
[normal]. I think it is a fantastic initiative and I really 
[normal]do want 
[normal]to commend you.
[normal]Secondly, I am a member of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee in the European Parliament. 
[normal]Y
[normal]outh unemployment is a major issue in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal]. It has certainly been one of the issues that I have particularly focused on since taking my seat here in the European Parliament almost two years ago. To that end, I have been holding a series of meetings across the Dublin region, doing consultations with the various different stakeholder organisations, young people, people who work with young people in the business, education, youth work and training sectors, and those who come from unemployment organisations
[normal]—t
[normal]he whole gambit of stakeholder involvement. I have been holding those meeting
[normal]s
[normal],
[normal] first
[normal], to
[normal] identify the issues that are particularly relevant in the 
[normal]Dublin
[normal] region and to look at what those stakeholders feel would be the solution.
[normal] 
[normal]That 
[normal]is my background and experience and how I c
[normal]a
[normal]me to this. At the end I can give you a copy of 
[normal]the
[normal] speech 
[normal]I gave to the last meeting 
[normal]and 
[normal]a copy of the
[normal] report
[normal] that I
[normal] submitted to the Irish Government
[normal], which
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]in relation to the consultations that I have been having
[normal].
[normal] I have also given Commissioner 
[normal]László Andor
[normal] [bold]a copy of my report.
[normal]As you are aware, youth unemployment is one of the greatest crises
[normal]—
[normal]if not the greatest crisis
[normal]—
[normal]that is facing the EU. One in four under 25 year-olds is unemployed in the European Union. We have approximately 26 million unemployed across the European Union
[normal]. A
[normal]bout 5.5 million young people are unemployed.
[normal] 
[normal]There are a number of issues that concern me about that from a 
[normal]Dublin
[normal] perspective. One of the biggest issues that is facing us in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal], particularly in 
[normal]Dublin
[normal], is the huge level of emigration of young people. It is a particular issue and problem because it is causing a major brain drain. 
[normal]Even
[normal] the 1980s
[normal]—I come from that 
[normal]generation
[normal]—
[normal]a lot of people emigrated across the water to the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. However, now we find that with the crisis that is facing Europe, people are now looking much further afield and are going to 
[normal]Canada
[normal], the 
[normal]United States
[normal], 
[normal]Australia
[normal] and 
[normal]New Zealand
[normal]. They are travelling continents apart. The scale of emigration is having
[normal], 
[normal]and will continue to have
[normal], 
[normal]a major impact on 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] and on the Irish economy. We are losing some of our brightest and 
[normal]our 
[normal]best. 
[normal]That 
[normal]is not to say that those who stay are not bright and 
[normal]not 
[normal]some of our best, but at the same time it is a
[normal] very
[normal] worrying development.
[normal]I am 
[normal]very much 
[normal]an advocate of enabling and facilitating people 
[normal]to travel
[normal],
[normal] because I believe that for young people to travel to work outside their country of origin is hugely educational and very insightful and when they come home they bring back certain skills. That can be hugely important. So while I would advocate very much that people should travel, many people
[normal], 
[normal]particularly many young families
[normal], 
[normal]are leaving and are not travel
[normal]ling
[normal] with the intention of coming home. They are putting down roots in other places
[normal],
[normal] and that is particularly worrying.
[normal]Another aspect of the whole youth unemployment issue, which is relevant to 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] 
[normal]but applies to 
[normal]most European countries, is that many of the young people who are unemployed are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Many of them are a year or more unemployed. That has a real scarring effect on their own lives with their families and with their communities in terms of their ultimate ability to find employment, their earning capabilities, and even right through to their pension rights. That will have a major impact
[normal],
[normal] and one of the legacies that we 
[normal]see 
[normal]very much as a result of the austerity and 
[normal]t
[normal]roika period that we have had in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] is
[normal] long-term unemployment, particularly among young people
[normal],
[normal] who may never fully recover from that experience. They are not able to make the kind of personal decisions at milestones in their lives that young people are normally able to make. They are not able to decide to le
[normal]ave home and live independently
[normal], and i
[normal]t is very difficult for them to make decisions about getting married and starting a family. 
[normal]All
[normal] those decisions are deferred, postponed or somehow altered and there is 
[normal]no
[normal] natural progression for these young people. 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is the real scarring impact
[normal] of unemployment on young people
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The families of young people
[normal] and 
[normal]parents are absolutely heartbroken. 
[normal]O
[normal]ver the Christmas period in particular we are struck by various different stories of families on Skype to families 
[normal]in 
[normal]Australia
[normal], and 
[normal]by 
[normal]g
[normal]randparents 
[normal]who 
[normal]have never seen their grandchildren. 
[normal]It is really sad. 
[normal]Those kinds of issues are felt quite acutely
[normal], and it 
[normal]is something that I 
[normal]am 
[normal]conscious of. 
[normal]Y
[normal]outh unemployment is a major issue in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal], particularly in my own constituency of 
[normal]Dublin
[normal]. To highlight the extent of it in 
[normal]Dublin
[normal], t
[normal]he rate of youth unemployment is 
[normal]about 
[normal]28%
[normal] and 
[normal]approximately 60,000 
[normal]young people 
[normal]are 
[normal]signing on
[normal]. T
[normal]hat does not tell the whole story of those who 
[normal]may not be 
[normal]in education, employment or training either, so we know that there are more. We know that about 
[normal]a 
[normal]third of the young unemployed people in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] live in 
[normal]Dublin
[normal]; t
[normal]hey are concentrated in the capital city. That has a very negative impact on the city
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is not good for the city and it is not good 
[normal]for 
[normal]social issues or 
[normal]the 
[normal]communities where these young people are living and wandering about 
[normal]maybe 
[normal]with a sense of aimlessness. These are the huge problems that we are facing. 
[normal]It is important to say that if an economy wants to be dynamic
[normal] and 
[normal]competitive, it is very difficult to call yourself an open, dynamic, competitive economy when one in three 
[normal]or four of your 
[normal]young people 
[normal]are 
[normal]unemployed. 
[normal]That is really difficult. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is a major challenge and 
[normal]one 
[normal]that we have to address for the long term.
[normal]Q155 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Lord Freeman:[bold] Thank you very much for that introduction. Clearly, it is not just a European problem, it is an international problem, or could be in due course. The Committee may be concerned—I am certainly concerned—about 
[normal]the 
[normal]co-ordination not only 
[normal]of 
[normal]the Commission but 
[normal]of 
[normal]national Governments, trade unions and employers. Surely, we should be treating this—and I would welcome your views on this—as a major problem. 
[normal]Do you think we are getting it all together when it comes to t
[normal]he exchange of best practice between different countries, proper co-ordination and leadership?
[normal]Emer Costello:[bold] 
[normal]T
[normal]his time last year, certainly the European Parliament had long identified youth unemployment as the major issue that was facing the European Union. This time last year, under the Irish presidency the conclusion of the EPSCO 
[normal]c
[normal]ouncil 
[normal]was very clear, and the conclusions
[normal] of the 
[normal]c
[normal]ouncil at the start of the year when the Heads of Government came, was 
[normal]that it was 
[normal]very important that we dealt with the issue of youth unemployment. 
[normal]O
[normal]n 6 February 2013
[normal] t
[normal]he EPSCO 
[normal]c
[normal]ouncil put 
[normal]in place that this would be a 
[normal]priority
[normal] of the Irish presidency that this be dealt with
[normal],
[normal] that it should be dealt with in a co-ordinated way
[normal],
[normal] that there should be some kind of European funding and that there should be a programme to tackle the problem so that it was
[normal] not
[normal] tackled in an ad hoc way.
[normal]I
[normal]t was very much the European Parliament that proposed the Youth Guarantee and the concept of a 
[normal]youth guarantee
[normal]. The Commission took t
[normal]hat proposal on board 
[normal]and
[normal] w
[normal]as
[normal] very positive about it. I think it was 
[normal]an 
[normal]affirmation of that when the EPSCO Council said, “Okay, we believe 
[normal]in 
[normal]this
[normal],
[normal] and if we are seriously going t
[normal]o pursue the issue of youth unemployment we have to put financial resources behind it”. So it was agreed that €6 billion in financial resources would go into the Youth Guarantee: €3 billion from the youth employment and €3 billion from the European Social 
[normal]Fund. It was hugely importa
[normal]nt that there was that proposal.
[normal]Currently, all 
[normal]member states
[normal] in the European Union 
[normal]co
[normal]-ordinating youth employment and youth unemployment responses have been asked to put together a proposal for their youth employment programmes. The Youth Guarantee money applies to countries with regions 
[normal]where
[normal] youth unemployment 
[normal]is
[normal] over 25%. As far as I know, the Commissioner told us before that that 21 
[normal]out 
[normal]of 28 countries would be entitled to draw down funding from that.
[normal]To answer your question, it took some time to acknowledge that youth unemployment was a problem that needed to be addressed in a co-ordinated way. We have not yet seen all submissions from the 
[normal]member states
[normal] as to how they intend to draw down the money and what programmes they are putting in. I have a request in at the moment, and I understand that the Irish
[normal] Government under Joan Burton have
[normal] put in a request and their programme for funding. I am waiting to see that. I believe that the quality of 
[normal]those 
[normal]programmes will be assessed by the Commission
[normal]. I
[normal]t is important that those programmes 
[normal]do 
[normal]not just draw down European funding but are clear, co-ordinated responses and have all the stakeholders involved. That is why I engaged with the trade unions, employers’ organisations, education and training experts, people who were working in the field of youth work and young people themselves. I consulted them in a series of meetings 
[normal]I had 
[normal]across 
[normal]Dublin
[normal]. 
[normal]S
[normal]ome of the findings from that were important, but they are also saying that there is no co-ordinated approach at the moment. It is hoped that perhaps the Youth Employment Initiative will pull that together.
[normal]Q156 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Is it appropriate for the EU Commission to have a role in youth unemployment? What you have said is absolutely appropriate for 
[normal]Ireland
[normal], and certainly sharing examples with us would be useful. But there are certain countries in the European Union where that would not necessarily be appropriate. I would have thought that this was in the area of “good to have” and “let us see if whether we can produce a framework”—we the Commission—but 
[normal]is being 
[normal]so descriptive and prescriptive 
[normal]not 
[normal]going to take up a huge amount of bureaucratic time?
[normal]Emer Costello:[bold] I feel it is really important that this is seen to be a priority of the Eur
[normal]opean Union. Employment, 
[normal]and the aim and aspiration of full employment
[normal], has to be 
[normal]a priority that the European Union uphold
[normal]s
[normal] and support
[normal]s
[normal] in whatever way 
[normal]it
[normal] can. I agree with you in the sense that some countries have more acute problems than others. It is important to acknowledge that
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is why 
[normal]the Youth Employment Initiative targeted specific countries with high levels of unemployment. It is also important to acknowledge that all countries are having increasing problems of youth unemployment, even countries that did not traditionally have it. When we are looking to achieve full employment
[normal] and 
[normal]to put people into work it is important that we try to ensure 
[normal]that 
[normal]we are able to provide decent work. The decent work agenda should really 
[normal]accompany
[normal] this. That is why it is important that mechanisms 
[normal]are 
[normal]put in place to make young people job-ready. It is not as if there are no vacancies, even in the European Union, but there is a huge skills mismatch.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]You are absolutely right.
[normal]Emer Costello[bold]: That can be supported through the use of EU funds, 
[normal]such as
[normal] the ERASMUS
[normal]+
[normal] funding, which is aimed at all levels of students.
[normal]One of the issues that has also come up, very much in my own seminars in 
[normal]Dublin
[normal], is the whole issue of vocational education and training. In some countries, vocational education and training has equal status with higher education
[normal],
[normal] and people who have the accreditation from vocational training are respected as much as any of the professions. However, in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] and probably in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] also
[normal], 
[normal]because our systems are very similar
[normal], 
[normal]there is a huge respect for higher education
[normal],
[normal] and vocational education is very often treated as the Cinderella or the poor relation. 
[normal]So t
[normal]here is a need. The European Commission also, in its education and training programme, has a major role to fulfil in helping to change mindsets and to achieve parity of esteem for vocational education.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]That is e
[normal]xactly right.
[normal]Emer Costello[bold]: I am very concerned and working towards this in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] and looking to see how we can actually achieve this.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] In terms of good practice, the German system of apprenticeships is one area.
[normal]Emer Costello:[bold] That is right, 
[normal]and 
[normal]the dual system of education in 
[normal]Austria
[normal] or 
[normal]Finland
[normal] is another
[normal]. The other issue for 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] is that there are five main categories 
[normal]of apprenticeship
[normal], 
[normal]which are 
[normal]divided into trades. If you look at the experience in many other countries there are hundreds of different areas of apprenticeships.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Exactly.
[normal]Emer Costello[bold]: In 
[normal]Ireland
[normal], the Minister for Education, 
[normal]Ruairí Quinn
[normal], is currently undertaking 
[normal]a review of apprenticeship. 
[normal]O
[normal]ne of the areas that is 
[normal]being looked
[normal] at is how can we expand apprenticeships into areas like 
[normal]the 
[normal]green economy
[normal], 
[normal]caring and the hospitality industry.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] You made a point about ERASMUS. That is the first time that 
[normal]has been 
[normal]mentioned today. ERASMUS is tailing off at a time when 
[normal]it 
[normal]should be becoming more important. 
[normal]Do you know of 
[normal]any reasons for that?
[normal]Emer Costello:[bold] I would not actually agree. The new programme, ERASMUS
[normal]+
[normal], is a redesign o
[normal]f
[normal] the life-long learning programme. I come from a background
[normal]—
[normal]and have to declare my interest in this
[normal]—
[normal]of 
[normal]10 years working in
[normal] 
[normal]Léargas
[normal], 
[normal]the national agency in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal]. 
[normal]I wor
[normal]ked
[normal] very closely particularly with the British Council, 
[normal]which 
[normal]had the contract to manage the programme in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. We worked with 
[normal]all
[normal] the national agencies. I worked in the national agency that had 
[normal]the 
[normal]co-ordination responsibility for all the education programmes. We did not do ERASMUS itself, the Higher Education Authority did that, but we did all the school and adult education programmes and all the other programmes. We also did Leonardo da Vinci, the vocational training programme, 
[normal]and the 
[normal]youth programmes. I see that there is enormous potential in programmes like that. I objected to the name 
[normal]of the new programme, 
[normal]ERASMUS
[normal]+,
[normal] 
[normal]because
[normal] I think it is elitist and brings up connotations just 
[normal]with 
[normal]higher education. I was quite attached to the name of Leonardo da Vinci.
[normal]I do think 
[normal]that 
[normal]t
[normal]hose programmes have a major role to 
[normal]play.
[normal] 
[normal]Leonardo da Vinci, 
[normal]for example, 
[normal]is a really innovative programme that will equip people with employment skills. I was Lord Mayor of 
[normal]Dublin
[normal] in 2009-10
[normal], and
[normal] I established what was called the Lord Mayor’s Commission on Employment, because at that stage the crisis was very much beginning to take root in 
[normal]Dublin
[normal]. I was hugely concerned about the challenges that were facing 
[normal]Dublin
[normal] city. 
[normal]O
[normal]ne of the actions that came out of that was that we joined forces with one of the 
[normal]institutes of technology in 
[normal]Tipperary
[normal]. 
[normal]It was 
[normal]involved in a Leonardo da Vinci programme with an institute in 
[normal]Germany
[normal] retrofitting and housing insulation. It was a hugely successful programme
[normal]. A
[normal] lot of the people who 
[normal]participated
[normal] in those types of programmes, even short vocational training programmes, were able find jobs in a self-employed capacity, having completed some of that training. Programmes like Leonardo da Vinci, which develop people’s vocational training
[normal],
[normal] open up new horizons and give them the opportunity to gain work experience in another country
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] hugely important. The experience of ERASMUS students travelling abroad is important. The new ERASMUS+ programme, which will become evident as it is rolled out, is geared to try to enhance young people’s skills and try to make them job
[normal]-
[normal]ready.
[normal]Q157 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] I wo
[normal]uld like to pick up on the different elements of the actions the EU is taking
[normal]. There is 
[normal]the 
[normal]youth employment 
[normal]programme
[normal]: 
[normal]the Youth Guarantee
[normal]. T
[normal]hen there is the Youth Employment Initiative
[normal],
[normal] with the extra money that has been found
[normal] of 
[normal]€6 billion. There is als
[normal]o an emphasis 
[normal]on 
[normal]some of the European 
[normal]S
[normal]ocial 
[normal]F
[normal]und programme 
[normal]now being 
[normal]devoted to creating employment opportunities for younger people. You mentioned that you had been running seminars. I know it is early to 
[normal]judge 
[normal]how the latter part of these programmes 
[normal]is 
[normal]working, but you mentioned that there was a feeling that there was a lack of co-ordination. Can you elaborate on that? Where do you think there is a lack of co-operation and what could be done to try to change it? Are we getting best value from these initiatives or could more be done?
[normal]Emer Costello:[bold] In the first instance, a lot will depend on how the 
[normal]youth employment initiatives are rolled 
[normal]out. To date, there are a number of issues. In 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] there have been a number of training agencies and vocational and education training boards. A lot of changes 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]taking
[normal] place in relation to that at the moment. There are community employment initiatives and vocational training programmes. Sometimes there is not as much co-operation as there might be between the various different elements that are involved. I think that was one of the issues that 
[normal]Ruairí 
[normal]Quinn saw when he took on the role of Minister for Education: there are labour activation courses
[normal], 
[normal]there is community employment
[normal],
[normal] and then there are education programmes. The training courses were operated through what w
[normal]ere
[normal] then the FÁS centres, and they came und
[normal]er the Department of Enterprise, Trade 
[normal]and Employment, whereas a lot of the education programmes came out of the Department of Education
[normal] and Skills
[normal]. So in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] there is an attempt to try to co-ordinate 
[normal]that
[normal] now to see if we can come up with a more comprehensive system.
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] In a sense, you are trying to bring the business side closer to education.
[normal]Emer Costello:[bold] Yes. 
[normal]T
[normal]he other thing that we are 
[normal]doing
[normal] is 
[normal]rolling
[normal] out the new Intreo centres
[normal]. That
[normal] means when a person finds themsel
[normal]ves
[normal] unemployed and they turn up at an employment exchange for the first time to sign on, it is not that they are going in to sign on and receive money
[normal]; t
[normal]hey are going to a centre that is going to facilitate their entry back into the workforce as quickly as possible
[normal]. S
[normal]o the Intreo centres are not just places where people collect their cheques or sign on for their giros or whatever
[normal]; they are places 
[normal]they will go to where they will be provided with job advice and counselling. A personalised training and education programme can be put in place for that person. That is something 
[normal]that 
[normal]I think has been missing
[normal],
[normal] and the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton, is very keen that we should try to activate that.
[normal]That is where the Youth Guarantee will be very important. The Youth Guarantee is supposed to be based on a rights-based approach that will look at the needs of the person, rather than just try
[normal]ing
[normal] to slot people into the existing provision. As somebody who was a counsellor and worked very much underground in my local area, I could see the problem, too, 
[normal]where
[normal] you do one course, you do one programme
[normal],
[normal] and all of a sudden you are told it is two years before you can do anything else. Having done a programme or having done a course a person will say, “I know that I need to get the skills in this particular area”. But when they try to get the skills in that particular area they are told, “Sorry, because you have done this programme you are not entitled to do anything further for another two years. Go away and come back to us in two years’ time”. That is an absolutely crazy situation to have. So I think that rolling out the Intreo centres will be quite useful.
[normal]The other thing I mentioned is that we are reviewing the apprenticeship programme at the moment. A lot of the youth organisations said that it is really important that the Youth Guarantee and the youth programmes that we have should be voluntary
[normal]:
[normal] that young people should not be compelled to take part in them. Certainly, there is a major carrot involved for them
[normal],
[normal] because since we 
[normal]began
[normal] to discuss this
[normal], 
[normal]as you are probably aware
[normal] 
[normal]the budget situation in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] has become quite serious. We had a very difficult budget. We had to take
[normal] €2.5 billion out of our economy in the last budget in October. There was a request by the 
[normal]t
[normal]roika to take €3.1 billion out of the economy but the Labour Party insisted that no more than €2.5 billion would be taken out of the economy. From my perspective, o
[normal]ne of the more painful and difficult budgetary decisions was the decision to reduce the level of benefits that are given to young people. So there is a substantial incentive given to young people to start training programmes. They will certainly be paid much more than they would be paid if they were unemployed and claiming unemployment benefit.
[normal]Q158 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] I would like to pursue the question of who does what
[normal] best.
[normal] You are making a strong case for the EU being involved in doing things, and that the 
[normal]Youth Guarantee
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]one of those
[normal]. What things 
[normal]do you think 
[normal]are better done at 
[normal]that sort of level by the European Union
[normal] and what 
[normal]things are better done 
[normal]by member states? 
[normal]How would you rate that problem?
[normal]Emer Costello[bold]: I 
[normal]think
[normal] that the European Union 
[normal]through 
[normal]the 
[normal]provision of funding
[normal], 
[normal]such as provided by the Youth Guarantee
[normal] 
[normal]or the European Social Fund
[normal], 
[normal]should
[normal] provide 
[normal]member states with 
[normal]the 
[normal]capacity to 
[normal]deliver what is needed. I do not see it as, “This set of actions is youth actions and this set of funding is national
[normal] action
[normal]s”
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]hat
[normal] is i
[normal]mportant as we try to develop 
[normal]a 
[normal]European framework of qualifications and 
[normal]try to address a proper system of 
[normal]mutual recognition
[normal] of qualifications across the EU
[normal].
[normal]From that point of view, while 
[normal]member states are 
[normal]very 
[normal]well equipped to design 
[normal]and develop 
[normal]their own
[normal] national qualification systems and work within that
[normal], 
[normal]it is important that there is a 
[normal]co-ordination and transparency of qualifications 
[normal]across the European Union, which will 
[normal]facilitate 
[normal]the 
[normal]mobility and 
[normal]the 
[normal]freedom of movement
[normal] of workers across the EU
[normal]. It is 
[normal]very 
[normal]difficult to have the mobility that 
[normal]the 
[normal]EU aspires to
[normal], and 
[normal]which 
[normal]the internal market would say we should have, 
[normal]if we do not have 
[normal]a
[normal] mutual recognition of 
[normal]qualifications. There is an i
[normal]mportant role for the EU there
[normal] to come up with some funding for it
[normal],
[normal] but I would not say that one is exclusive of the other
[normal].
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] 
[normal]How do you rate 
[normal]the way in which the various 
[normal]EU policies
[normal] have been applied in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal]? How would you rate the effectiveness of the different policies?
[normal]Emer Costello:[bold] 
[normal]I
[normal] would say that 
[normal]I
[normal]reland
[normal] is one of the 
[normal]real 
[normal]success stories
[normal] of EU funding
[normal]. 
[normal]The European Social Fund is particularly important. Last year we 
[normal]celebrated 40 years
[normal] since our entry into the European Union and the referendum
[normal]. 
[normal]I think 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] and the 
[normal]UK
[normal] entered at the same time. 
[normal]At the time 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] 
[normal]entered the EU, 
[normal]from our perspective
[normal] there have been 
[normal]huge advances
[normal],
[normal] because joining the 
[normal]European Union
[normal], 
[normal]or the Common Market as it was called then
[normal], 
[normal]opened up a huge market. Quite frankly, before that 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] 
[normal]was 
[normal]very dependent on 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK
[normal]’s
[normal] cheap food policy. We were seen as 
[normal]a mechanism for 
[normal]providing 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK
[normal] with food
[normal],
[normal] but 
[normal]we had 
[normal]difficult
[normal]y 
[normal]reach
[normal]ing
[normal] markets 
[normal]outside of that. One of the s
[normal]uccess
[normal]es of 
[normal]Ireland
[normal]’s entry into the European Union 
[normal]was 
[normal]workers
[normal]’
[normal] and women’s rights. 
[normal]I am not sure what the situation was in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] at the time, but when we joined the European Union there was a
[normal] marriage bar for women in the Civil Service
[normal]; women had to resign from the Civil Service once they got married
[normal].
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] That was not so in the 
[normal]UK
[normal].
[normal]Emer Costello[bold]: 
[normal]That
[normal] was not so in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] but we had that in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal]. There was the whole equality treatment in terms of social protection
[normal], b
[normal]ut one of the big areas that helped 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]advance, with its entry into the European Union, was the d
[normal]evelopment of 
[normal]the 
[normal]i
[normal]nstitutes of 
[normal]t
[normal]echnology
[normal],
[normal] or the regional technical colleges as they were called at the 
[normal]time
[normal]. This 
[normal]goes
[normal] back to the whole idea 
[normal]of 
[normal]vocational training. Instead of developing 
[normal]a whole series 
[normal]of universities
[normal]—we had three or four universities
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]as much as we could 
[normal]sustain
[normal]—we developed a lot of the 
[normal]regional technical c
[normal]olleges 
[normal]in strategic locations. 
[normal]My own hometown, Dundalk—although I represent Dublin and I have l
[normal]ived in Dublin 
[normal]longer than I have lived anywhere else, I am 
[normal]originally from Dundalk
[normal], which is just on the border between Dublin and Belfast—had a very 
[normal]blighted history
[normal] in many ways,
[normal] being a border town
[normal], and it had developed a certain reputation over the years as well.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]B
[normal]andit country
[normal].
[normal]Emer Costello:[bold] 
[normal]So they say. I would not necessarily agree with that, but it s
[normal]uffered 
[normal]the 
[normal]consequences of being a 
[normal]town on the 
[normal]border
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]t developed an 
[normal]institute
[normal]—an RTC—which is now an 
[normal]institute of technology
[normal], and that 
[normal]has 
[normal]contributed to the overall development of the 
[normal]town 
[normal]and 
[normal]its
[normal] ability 
[normal]to attract 
[normal]major 
[normal]industr
[normal]ies there
[normal].
[normal] So I think that 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] does demonstrate success. Also, the 
[normal]structural fund 
[normal]has helped us 
[normal]to 
[normal]d
[normal]evelop a 
[normal]whole 
[normal]road network
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]our 
[normal]infrastructure
[normal] to a large extent
[normal]. Becoming a member of the 
[normal]European Union
[normal] was hugely beneficial to 
[normal]Ireland
[normal], no more so than 
[normal]the whole area of 
[normal]the Social Fund, the development of 
[normal]education and training programmes
[normal] through the ESF
[normal]. 
[normal]I know that the s
[normal]tate 
[normal]t
[normal]raining 
[normal]a
[normal]gency developed
[normal], 
[normal]apart from the 
[normal]regional technical colleges
[normal], 
[normal]many programmes 
[normal]that are 
[normal]funded 
[normal]through
[normal] ESF 
[normal]as well. M
[normal]any 
[normal]of the 
[normal]participants 
[normal]in those programmes 
[normal]became highly skilled 
[normal]and were able to go on to 
[normal]make 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]knowledge economy 
[normal]that it is now, 
[normal]an economy that 
[normal]is capable of attracting 
[normal]high-end industry. We have had 
[normal]a lot of 
[normal]various different member states
[normal] come to 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] to see how 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] has drawn down the Social Fund as well.
[normal]Q159 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] It is a great example and we all know it. 
[normal]W
[normal]hat has happened in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] 
[normal]is r
[normal]ammed down our throats all the time
[normal], which is great
[normal]. 
[normal]The point is 
[normal]that 
[normal]w
[normal]e are 
[normal]where we are and we are 
[normal]all affected by 
[normal]this high 
[normal]youth unemployment
[normal], which has 
[normal]long-term
[normal] effects on whether people who are out of work for any length of time are ever going to be employable again, and all the social problems that you have mentioned.
[normal]I am told w
[normal]e are running out of time
[normal], so I will ask you the q
[normal]uestion
[normal]. T
[normal]o what extent do you see the issue as being about the demand-side, the availability of jobs, and how well are young people prepared for the labour market with regard to their skills or employability?
[normal]Emer Costello:[bold] This is another big issue
[normal] that has come up
[normal]. 
[normal]People say, “
[normal]The 
[normal]Youth Guarantee says
[normal] that a young person 
[normal]will be made 
[normal]a quality offer
[normal] 
[normal]within four months 
[normal]of leaving full-time employment or education”. 
[normal]Perhaps we could 
[normal]touch on 
[normal]that 
[normal]before we finish: a quality offer
[normal] of an apprenticeship, 
[normal]a 
[normal]training 
[normal]place 
[normal]or education place
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]an offer of a place 
[normal]within four months
[normal]. T
[normal]he question 
[normal]comes up, “Well,
[normal] what happens at the end of th
[normal]at training
[normal] period if the jobs are not there
[normal]?”
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I suppose in the first instance, while we are e
[normal]xperiencing 
[normal]the
[normal] downturn
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]it is important that we have people who are job
[normal]-
[normal]ready for when the economy does actually recover. So t
[normal]here 
[normal]is very much that, but I think there 
[normal]has to be dual action in preparing people for 
[normal]the 
[normal]job market without 
[normal]being able to 
[normal]provid
[normal]e the jobs
[normal]. That
[normal] can be difficult. You can do so much in trying to address the s
[normal]kills mismatch
[normal], which I mentioned earlier
[normal].
[normal] I think 
[normal]it is
[normal] hugely important 
[normal]to
[normal] address the skills mismatch
[normal]. 
[normal]At the same time, t
[normal]here will be people who 
[normal]will 
[normal]emerge from these 
[normal]training 
[normal]programmes
[normal] with the expectation of getting a job
[normal]. 
[normal]That is why, from my point of view and from 
[normal]the perspective of 
[normal]my p
[normal]olitical group here 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]European Parliament
[normal], 
[normal]Europe
[normal] 
[normal]need
[normal]s
[normal] to come up with 
[normal]an injection of stimulus
[normal] or growth that will see growth in the economy that will help create jobs.
[normal]Q160 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] I 
[normal]will 
[normal]just throw a s
[normal]tatistic
[normal] at you. I do not know whether it is true or false and perhaps you can tell me
[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Irish 
[normal]Prime Minister 
[normal]said 
[normal]that if all 
[normal]the 
[normal]IT job
[normal]s that were
[normal] vacan
[normal]t
[normal] in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] 
[normal]were filled 
[normal]there 
[normal]would be no youth unemployment. In other words, the jobs are there 
[normal]but 
[normal]the 
[normal]skills are not. 
[normal]W
[normal]e a
[normal]ll think we are brilliant at IT, but 
[normal]we are not, with 
[normal]all 
[normal]the new developments in IT. 
[normal]If the EU has to be involved in 
[normal]trying to 
[normal]divvy up the whole thing, would it not be better to 
[normal]be doing something specifically 
[normal]aim
[normal]ed
[normal] at IT training
[normal] in every member state?
[normal]Emer Costello:[bold] 
[normal]Certainly i
[normal]n a country like Ireland 
[normal]IT training 
[normal]is 
[normal]particularly important. I am 
[normal]not familiar with 
[normal]that particular 
[normal]quote from the Taoiseach
[normal], Enda Kenny
[normal]. W
[normal]hat I would say is that I know a number of companies 
[normal]that 
[normal]do locate 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]Ireland
[normal], 
[normal]particularly some of the IT companies
[normal], 
[normal]m
[normal]ay locate some 
[normal]of their 
[normal]sales position
[normal]s there
[normal]. 
[normal]One of t
[normal]he 
[normal]huge problems is 
[normal]languages. The 
[normal]C
[normal]ommissioner had an interesting perspective on this
[normal]. I had a meeting with him some months ago
[normal] in relation to 
[normal]the 
[normal]roll-out of 
[normal]the Youth Guarantee
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I said that p
[normal]eople 
[normal]from countries like 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] 
[normal]are going to 
[normal]America
[normal], 
[normal]Canada
[normal], 
[normal]Australia
[normal] and 
[normal]New Zealand
[normal], and he 
[normal]said 
[normal]that 
[normal]it is interesting
[normal] to see
[normal], when you look at the level of vacancies across the European Union, 
[normal]that 
[normal]they are c
[normal]hoosing to travel 
[normal]not across the European Union but to 
[normal]different continents
[normal]. That is very often because they travel to a continent
[normal] where the
[normal]y have
[normal] a language affinity.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Yes, exactly.
[normal]Emer Costello[bold]: 
[normal]N
[normal]ot only IT training
[normal] but the way we t
[normal]each languages 
[normal]in schools 
[normal]is 
[normal]going to have 
[normal]to be revised. 
[normal]We have to look at producing people who have high quality language skills.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Yes, that is absolutely right.
[normal] 
[normal]Look, t
[normal]his has been 
[normal]fascinating 
[normal]and we could stay here for another hour 
[normal]but 
[normal]unfortunately 
[normal]we are being booted out. 
[normal]Well, not as inelegantly as that. I am sure 
[normal]that 
[normal]lots of 
[normal]ideas will 
[normal]come to 
[normal]you 
[normal]over the next few days, so can I ask if you could 
[normal]jot them down to 
[normal]help us in our report and to 
[normal]further our discussions
[normal]?
[normal] W
[normal]e 
[normal]are almost at the end of witness taking so we would be most grateful.
[normal]Emer [bold]Costello[bold]: 
[normal]C
[normal]an I leave these with you
[normal]?
[normal] These are c
[normal]opies of my report. 
[normal]I had another m
[normal]eeting in Tallaght in November. 
[normal]That is annexed there. That
[normal] is 
[normal]the
[normal] full report 
[normal]of 
[normal]all
[normal] the meetings that I 
[normal]held with 
[normal]the 
[normal]stakeholders. 
[normal]The names of the stakeholders who attended the meetings are there
[normal], s
[normal]o even though y
[normal]ou will not be familiar
[normal] with the organisations it will give you an idea of who they are and what we did
[normal].
[normal] I will leave you with all the copies of those that I have, and I will give you a c
[normal]opy of 
[normal]the
[normal] speech 
[normal]that I gave 
[normal]at 
[normal]the 
[normal]last 
[normal]meeting because that 
[normal]tried 
[normal]to encapsulate some of the issues that came up at some of the other meetings.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] If you were in my position now, what questions would you be asking you?
[normal]Emer Costello:[bold] 
[normal]Wow, now there is a question. 
[normal]To be honest, the questions 
[normal]that you had here 
[normal]are 
[normal]very 
[normal]important
[normal],
[normal] but one 
[normal]of the 
[normal]area
[normal]s that
[normal] we need to look at 
[normal]is 
[normal]how to give young people 
[normal]some kind of ownership and 
[normal]hope. 
[normal]I
[normal]f we are talking about youth employment initiatives, I think the 
[normal]involv
[normal]ement of
[normal] young people in 
[normal]the 
[normal]roll-out
[normal] of those is hugely important
[normal].
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]We have 
[normal]had 
[normal]young people
[normal] as witnesses
[normal].
[normal]Emer Costello[bold]: I am very impressed, yes.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]We ha
[normal]d them and it was really fiery
[normal]. W
[normal]hen I asked my first question
[normal] about 
[normal]which 
[normal]organisation they go 
[normal]to 
[normal]for jobs
[normal], they
[normal] just said in front of us—
[normal]we are 
[normal]Members of the House of Lords, do not forget—“
[normal]Job Centres
[normal] are crap
[normal]”
[normal],
[normal] and i
[normal]t went on from there
[normal]. 
[normal]But 
[normal]it was good
[normal]. They
[normal] said they really
[normal] felt engaged with us 
[normal]and I think they were delighted that we had 
[normal]gone to the trouble. 
[normal]We d
[normal]id the same in 
[normal]Birmingham
[normal]. 
[normal]They were tough and they b
[normal]rought us down from 
[normal]whatever 
[normal]cloud
[normal] we were on. I give you 
[normal]the 
[normal]tip 
[normal]that 
[normal]if m
[normal]ore 
[normal]European 
[normal]countries 
[normal]actually 
[normal]ask
[normal]ed
[normal] their young people
[normal],
[normal] they might get some staggering answers
[normal]—
[normal]not 
[normal]that they would 
[normal]necessarily use that word
[normal]. 
[normal]I think that w
[normal]e have covered that
[normal], but if you think of any other points that we should cover because we only have a few weeks left
[normal].
[normal]Emer Costello:[bold] The other issue 
[normal]that I mentioned to you wa
[normal]s the quality framework
[normal], which I believe is h
[normal]ugely important. 
[normal]If we are developing internships and placement programmes or whatever, it is important that we develop
[normal] that framework
[normal]. I know 
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]Commission has moved towards develop
[normal]ing a quality framework 
[normal]for 
[normal]traineeships and 
[normal]internships
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]hat has to be developed and improved on
[normal]. T
[normal]here is a
[normal] possibility 
[normal]that they 
[normal]could be open to abuse
[normal],
[normal] but a
[normal]t the same time 
[normal]I 
[normal]believe that internships can p
[normal]rovide a major stepping stone
[normal] into employment
[normal]. T
[normal]hey are good for employers
[normal], and 
[normal]they are good for employees. It g
[normal]ive
[normal]s them a chance to try
[normal] each 
[normal]other out
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]that 
[normal]is very important.
[normal]Q161 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] A
[normal]re you working 
[normal]at trying to develop a framework for those
[normal]?
[normal]Emer Costello:[bold] 
[normal]Yes, 
[normal]we
[normal] are, but I think i
[normal]t has to come with a contract. I
[normal]t has to come with something that says 
[normal]that 
[normal]a certain level of skills 
[normal]will be 
[normal]delivered. I
[normal]deally
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]I would like to see it come with 
[normal]an accreditation process
[normal] at the end, which perhaps could be tied into the accreditation of p
[normal]rior learning
[normal]. Therefore the
[normal] skills derived over a period 
[normal]of training 
[normal]in a job placement 
[normal]would be accredited in 
[normal]some
[normal] way, so that somebody w
[normal]ould 
[normal]have something that sits within the European 
[normal]q
[normal]ualifications 
[normal]f
[normal]ramework
[normal] that 
[normal]they could see.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Thank you so much.
[normal]Emer Costello[bold]: I hope that that was useful.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] In fact, 
[normal]we are not being booted out but you are.
[normal]Emer Costello[bold]: That is fine
[normal] as
[normal] I have other places to go to. It was nice to see you.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] It was nice to see you too.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
