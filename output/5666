defaultQ153 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much for giving up your time, which we know is very precious. I know you are doing lots of other things. It is very nice to meet you again. This session will probably last approximately 60 minutes. Members of the Committee with relevant interests will declare these now. Do any of you have relevant interests? No, so y
defaultou will receive a transcript of the session 
defaultto check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website.
defaultI am going to ask if you could begin by stating
default,
default for the benefit of the transcriber
default,
default your name and official title.
defaultEmer Costellodefault: My name is Emer Costello. I am the MEP for 
defaultDublin
default region in 
defaultIreland
default and I am a Labour Party MEP for 
defaultDublin
default, 
defaultIreland
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you. I think you probably know what the purpose of our inquiry is: we are part of the European Union Select Committee of the House of Lords. We have the remit to look at the internal market infrastructure and employment. Of course, we do reports and send them to the Commission and to the Government. Our last witness said that she had seen our reports and thought that they were quite good. We are obviously following the 
defaultD
defaultirective on unemployment, and we decided to look into this because the consensus is that youth unemployment across Europe is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis. Unfortunately there are all sorts of reasons
default for that
default. We have had a lot of witness sessions from youth, businesses and all sorts of people involved in employment. We are nearing the end of our inquiry now
default,
default and we will probably produce a report in mid-April before the Easter 
defaultR
defaultecess. We thought it was a good idea to come over here to see how we could unravel some of the problems we still have with the information we have 
defaultbeen getting
default.
default 
defaultWe have 12 on the Committee
default. For 
defaultreasons of resources
default and all the rest of it
default 
defaultonly a few have come on this trip
default—there is not a lot of point in taking too many people on trips such as this—
defaultbut
default I am very grateful to 
defaultm
defaultembers of the Committee who have given up these two days to do this
default. 
defaultI am particularly grateful to you 
defaultfor
default giving us 
defaultyour time for us.
default 
defaultWe are going to ask you questions
default. Y
defaultou have had notice of the questions?
defaultEmer Costellodefault: I have indeed, yes.
defaultQ154 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default I 
defaultsaid that
default there is a general consensus that youth unemployment across 
defaultEurope
default is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis
default. C
defaultould you summarise for us your own view of the 
defaultexact 
defaultnature of the current problems
default,
default and the issues that you are more concerned about?
defaultEmer Costellodefault: I 
defaultwill 
defaultpreface any remarks by welcoming you to the European Parliament
default,
default and commend
defaulting
default you 
defaulton 
defaulttaking the time to come here to the European Parliament to investigate and explore these issues at a European
default level here in 
defaultBrussels
default. I think it is a fantastic initiative and I really 
defaultdo want 
defaultto commend you.
defaultSecondly, I am a member of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee in the European Parliament. 
defaultY
defaultouth unemployment is a major issue in 
defaultIreland
default. It has certainly been one of the issues that I have particularly focused on since taking my seat here in the European Parliament almost two years ago. To that end, I have been holding a series of meetings across the Dublin region, doing consultations with the various different stakeholder organisations, young people, people who work with young people in the business, education, youth work and training sectors, and those who come from unemployment organisations
default—t
defaulthe whole gambit of stakeholder involvement. I have been holding those meeting
defaults
default,
default first
default, to
default identify the issues that are particularly relevant in the 
defaultDublin
default region and to look at what those stakeholders feel would be the solution.
default 
defaultThat 
defaultis my background and experience and how I c
defaulta
defaultme to this. At the end I can give you a copy of 
defaultthe
default speech 
defaultI gave to the last meeting 
defaultand 
defaulta copy of the
default report
default that I
default submitted to the Irish Government
default, which
default 
defaultis 
defaultin relation to the consultations that I have been having
default.
default I have also given Commissioner 
defaultLászló Andor
default defaulta copy of my report.
defaultAs you are aware, youth unemployment is one of the greatest crises
default—
defaultif not the greatest crisis
default—
defaultthat is facing the EU. One in four under 25 year-olds is unemployed in the European Union. We have approximately 26 million unemployed across the European Union
default. A
defaultbout 5.5 million young people are unemployed.
default 
defaultThere are a number of issues that concern me about that from a 
defaultDublin
default perspective. One of the biggest issues that is facing us in 
defaultIreland
default, particularly in 
defaultDublin
default, is the huge level of emigration of young people. It is a particular issue and problem because it is causing a major brain drain. 
defaultEven
default the 1980s
default—I come from that 
defaultgeneration
default—
defaulta lot of people emigrated across the water to the 
defaultUK
default. However, now we find that with the crisis that is facing Europe, people are now looking much further afield and are going to 
defaultCanada
default, the 
defaultUnited States
default, 
defaultAustralia
default and 
defaultNew Zealand
default. They are travelling continents apart. The scale of emigration is having
default, 
defaultand will continue to have
default, 
defaulta major impact on 
defaultIreland
default and on the Irish economy. We are losing some of our brightest and 
defaultour 
defaultbest. 
defaultThat 
defaultis not to say that those who stay are not bright and 
defaultnot 
defaultsome of our best, but at the same time it is a
default very
default worrying development.
defaultI am 
defaultvery much 
defaultan advocate of enabling and facilitating people 
defaultto travel
default,
default because I believe that for young people to travel to work outside their country of origin is hugely educational and very insightful and when they come home they bring back certain skills. That can be hugely important. So while I would advocate very much that people should travel, many people
default, 
defaultparticularly many young families
default, 
defaultare leaving and are not travel
defaultling
default with the intention of coming home. They are putting down roots in other places
default,
default and that is particularly worrying.
defaultAnother aspect of the whole youth unemployment issue, which is relevant to 
defaultIreland
default 
defaultbut applies to 
defaultmost European countries, is that many of the young people who are unemployed are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Many of them are a year or more unemployed. That has a real scarring effect on their own lives with their families and with their communities in terms of their ultimate ability to find employment, their earning capabilities, and even right through to their pension rights. That will have a major impact
default,
default and one of the legacies that we 
defaultsee 
defaultvery much as a result of the austerity and 
defaultt
defaultroika period that we have had in 
defaultIreland
default is
default long-term unemployment, particularly among young people
default,
default who may never fully recover from that experience. They are not able to make the kind of personal decisions at milestones in their lives that young people are normally able to make. They are not able to decide to le
defaultave home and live independently
default, and i
defaultt is very difficult for them to make decisions about getting married and starting a family. 
defaultAll
default those decisions are deferred, postponed or somehow altered and there is 
defaultno
default natural progression for these young people. 
defaultT
defaulthat is the real scarring impact
default of unemployment on young people
default.
default 
defaultThe families of young people
default and 
defaultparents are absolutely heartbroken. 
defaultO
defaultver the Christmas period in particular we are struck by various different stories of families on Skype to families 
defaultin 
defaultAustralia
default, and 
defaultby 
defaultg
defaultrandparents 
defaultwho 
defaulthave never seen their grandchildren. 
defaultIt is really sad. 
defaultThose kinds of issues are felt quite acutely
default, and it 
defaultis something that I 
defaultam 
defaultconscious of. 
defaultY
defaultouth unemployment is a major issue in 
defaultIreland
default, particularly in my own constituency of 
defaultDublin
default. To highlight the extent of it in 
defaultDublin
default, t
defaulthe rate of youth unemployment is 
defaultabout 
default28%
default and 
defaultapproximately 60,000 
defaultyoung people 
defaultare 
defaultsigning on
default. T
defaulthat does not tell the whole story of those who 
defaultmay not be 
defaultin education, employment or training either, so we know that there are more. We know that about 
defaulta 
defaultthird of the young unemployed people in 
defaultIreland
default live in 
defaultDublin
default; t
defaulthey are concentrated in the capital city. That has a very negative impact on the city
default. 
defaultI
defaultt is not good for the city and it is not good 
defaultfor 
defaultsocial issues or 
defaultthe 
defaultcommunities where these young people are living and wandering about 
defaultmaybe 
defaultwith a sense of aimlessness. These are the huge problems that we are facing. 
defaultIt is important to say that if an economy wants to be dynamic
default and 
defaultcompetitive, it is very difficult to call yourself an open, dynamic, competitive economy when one in three 
defaultor four of your 
defaultyoung people 
defaultare 
defaultunemployed. 
defaultThat is really difficult. 
defaultI
defaultt is a major challenge and 
defaultone 
defaultthat we have to address for the long term.
defaultQ155 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Freeman:default Thank you very much for that introduction. Clearly, it is not just a European problem, it is an international problem, or could be in due course. The Committee may be concerned—I am certainly concerned—about 
defaultthe 
defaultco-ordination not only 
defaultof 
defaultthe Commission but 
defaultof 
defaultnational Governments, trade unions and employers. Surely, we should be treating this—and I would welcome your views on this—as a major problem. 
defaultDo you think we are getting it all together when it comes to t
defaulthe exchange of best practice between different countries, proper co-ordination and leadership?
defaultEmer Costello:default 
defaultT
defaulthis time last year, certainly the European Parliament had long identified youth unemployment as the major issue that was facing the European Union. This time last year, under the Irish presidency the conclusion of the EPSCO 
defaultc
defaultouncil 
defaultwas very clear, and the conclusions
default of the 
defaultc
defaultouncil at the start of the year when the Heads of Government came, was 
defaultthat it was 
defaultvery important that we dealt with the issue of youth unemployment. 
defaultO
defaultn 6 February 2013
default t
defaulthe EPSCO 
defaultc
defaultouncil put 
defaultin place that this would be a 
defaultpriority
default of the Irish presidency that this be dealt with
default,
default that it should be dealt with in a co-ordinated way
default,
default that there should be some kind of European funding and that there should be a programme to tackle the problem so that it was
default not
default tackled in an ad hoc way.
defaultI
defaultt was very much the European Parliament that proposed the Youth Guarantee and the concept of a 
defaultyouth guarantee
default. The Commission took t
defaulthat proposal on board 
defaultand
default w
defaultas
default very positive about it. I think it was 
defaultan 
defaultaffirmation of that when the EPSCO Council said, “Okay, we believe 
defaultin 
defaultthis
default,
default and if we are seriously going t
defaulto pursue the issue of youth unemployment we have to put financial resources behind it”. So it was agreed that €6 billion in financial resources would go into the Youth Guarantee: €3 billion from the youth employment and €3 billion from the European Social 
defaultFund. It was hugely importa
defaultnt that there was that proposal.
defaultCurrently, all 
defaultmember states
default in the European Union 
defaultco
default-ordinating youth employment and youth unemployment responses have been asked to put together a proposal for their youth employment programmes. The Youth Guarantee money applies to countries with regions 
defaultwhere
default youth unemployment 
defaultis
default over 25%. As far as I know, the Commissioner told us before that that 21 
defaultout 
defaultof 28 countries would be entitled to draw down funding from that.
defaultTo answer your question, it took some time to acknowledge that youth unemployment was a problem that needed to be addressed in a co-ordinated way. We have not yet seen all submissions from the 
defaultmember states
default as to how they intend to draw down the money and what programmes they are putting in. I have a request in at the moment, and I understand that the Irish
default Government under Joan Burton have
default put in a request and their programme for funding. I am waiting to see that. I believe that the quality of 
defaultthose 
defaultprogrammes will be assessed by the Commission
default. I
defaultt is important that those programmes 
defaultdo 
defaultnot just draw down European funding but are clear, co-ordinated responses and have all the stakeholders involved. That is why I engaged with the trade unions, employers’ organisations, education and training experts, people who were working in the field of youth work and young people themselves. I consulted them in a series of meetings 
defaultI had 
defaultacross 
defaultDublin
default. 
defaultS
defaultome of the findings from that were important, but they are also saying that there is no co-ordinated approach at the moment. It is hoped that perhaps the Youth Employment Initiative will pull that together.
defaultQ156 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default Is it appropriate for the EU Commission to have a role in youth unemployment? What you have said is absolutely appropriate for 
defaultIreland
default, and certainly sharing examples with us would be useful. But there are certain countries in the European Union where that would not necessarily be appropriate. I would have thought that this was in the area of “good to have” and “let us see if whether we can produce a framework”—we the Commission—but 
defaultis being 
defaultso descriptive and prescriptive 
defaultnot 
defaultgoing to take up a huge amount of bureaucratic time?
defaultEmer Costello:default I feel it is really important that this is seen to be a priority of the Eur
defaultopean Union. Employment, 
defaultand the aim and aspiration of full employment
default, has to be 
defaulta priority that the European Union uphold
defaults
default and support
defaults
default in whatever way 
defaultit
default can. I agree with you in the sense that some countries have more acute problems than others. It is important to acknowledge that
default. 
defaultT
defaulthat is why 
defaultthe Youth Employment Initiative targeted specific countries with high levels of unemployment. It is also important to acknowledge that all countries are having increasing problems of youth unemployment, even countries that did not traditionally have it. When we are looking to achieve full employment
default and 
defaultto put people into work it is important that we try to ensure 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are able to provide decent work. The decent work agenda should really 
defaultaccompany
default this. That is why it is important that mechanisms 
defaultare 
defaultput in place to make young people job-ready. It is not as if there are no vacancies, even in the European Union, but there is a huge skills mismatch.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultYou are absolutely right.
defaultEmer Costellodefault: That can be supported through the use of EU funds, 
defaultsuch as
default the ERASMUS
default+
default funding, which is aimed at all levels of students.
defaultOne of the issues that has also come up, very much in my own seminars in 
defaultDublin
default, is the whole issue of vocational education and training. In some countries, vocational education and training has equal status with higher education
default,
default and people who have the accreditation from vocational training are respected as much as any of the professions. However, in 
defaultIreland
default and probably in the 
defaultUK
default also
default, 
defaultbecause our systems are very similar
default, 
defaultthere is a huge respect for higher education
default,
default and vocational education is very often treated as the Cinderella or the poor relation. 
defaultSo t
defaulthere is a need. The European Commission also, in its education and training programme, has a major role to fulfil in helping to change mindsets and to achieve parity of esteem for vocational education.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThat is e
defaultxactly right.
defaultEmer Costellodefault: I am very concerned and working towards this in 
defaultIreland
default and looking to see how we can actually achieve this.
defaultThe Chairman:default In terms of good practice, the German system of apprenticeships is one area.
defaultEmer Costello:default That is right, 
defaultand 
defaultthe dual system of education in 
defaultAustria
default or 
defaultFinland
default is another
default. The other issue for 
defaultIreland
default is that there are five main categories 
defaultof apprenticeship
default, 
defaultwhich are 
defaultdivided into trades. If you look at the experience in many other countries there are hundreds of different areas of apprenticeships.
defaultThe Chairman:default Exactly.
defaultEmer Costellodefault: In 
defaultIreland
default, the Minister for Education, 
defaultRuairí Quinn
default, is currently undertaking 
defaulta review of apprenticeship. 
defaultO
defaultne of the areas that is 
defaultbeing looked
default at is how can we expand apprenticeships into areas like 
defaultthe 
defaultgreen economy
default, 
defaultcaring and the hospitality industry.
defaultThe Chairman:default You made a point about ERASMUS. That is the first time that 
defaulthas been 
defaultmentioned today. ERASMUS is tailing off at a time when 
defaultit 
defaultshould be becoming more important. 
defaultDo you know of 
defaultany reasons for that?
defaultEmer Costello:default I would not actually agree. The new programme, ERASMUS
default+
default, is a redesign o
defaultf
default the life-long learning programme. I come from a background
default—
defaultand have to declare my interest in this
default—
defaultof 
default10 years working in
default 
defaultLéargas
default, 
defaultthe national agency in 
defaultIreland
default. 
defaultI wor
defaultked
default very closely particularly with the British Council, 
defaultwhich 
defaulthad the contract to manage the programme in the 
defaultUK
default. We worked with 
defaultall
default the national agencies. I worked in the national agency that had 
defaultthe 
defaultco-ordination responsibility for all the education programmes. We did not do ERASMUS itself, the Higher Education Authority did that, but we did all the school and adult education programmes and all the other programmes. We also did Leonardo da Vinci, the vocational training programme, 
defaultand the 
defaultyouth programmes. I see that there is enormous potential in programmes like that. I objected to the name 
defaultof the new programme, 
defaultERASMUS
default+,
default 
defaultbecause
default I think it is elitist and brings up connotations just 
defaultwith 
defaulthigher education. I was quite attached to the name of Leonardo da Vinci.
defaultI do think 
defaultthat 
defaultt
defaulthose programmes have a major role to 
defaultplay.
default 
defaultLeonardo da Vinci, 
defaultfor example, 
defaultis a really innovative programme that will equip people with employment skills. I was Lord Mayor of 
defaultDublin
default in 2009-10
default, and
default I established what was called the Lord Mayor’s Commission on Employment, because at that stage the crisis was very much beginning to take root in 
defaultDublin
default. I was hugely concerned about the challenges that were facing 
defaultDublin
default city. 
defaultO
defaultne of the actions that came out of that was that we joined forces with one of the 
defaultinstitutes of technology in 
defaultTipperary
default. 
defaultIt was 
defaultinvolved in a Leonardo da Vinci programme with an institute in 
defaultGermany
default retrofitting and housing insulation. It was a hugely successful programme
default. A
default lot of the people who 
defaultparticipated
default in those types of programmes, even short vocational training programmes, were able find jobs in a self-employed capacity, having completed some of that training. Programmes like Leonardo da Vinci, which develop people’s vocational training
default,
default open up new horizons and give them the opportunity to gain work experience in another country
default,
default 
defaultare
default hugely important. The experience of ERASMUS students travelling abroad is important. The new ERASMUS+ programme, which will become evident as it is rolled out, is geared to try to enhance young people’s skills and try to make them job
default-
defaultready.
defaultQ157 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default I wo
defaultuld like to pick up on the different elements of the actions the EU is taking
default. There is 
defaultthe 
defaultyouth employment 
defaultprogramme
default: 
defaultthe Youth Guarantee
default. T
defaulthen there is the Youth Employment Initiative
default,
default with the extra money that has been found
default of 
default€6 billion. There is als
defaulto an emphasis 
defaulton 
defaultsome of the European 
defaultS
defaultocial 
defaultF
defaultund programme 
defaultnow being 
defaultdevoted to creating employment opportunities for younger people. You mentioned that you had been running seminars. I know it is early to 
defaultjudge 
defaulthow the latter part of these programmes 
defaultis 
defaultworking, but you mentioned that there was a feeling that there was a lack of co-ordination. Can you elaborate on that? Where do you think there is a lack of co-operation and what could be done to try to change it? Are we getting best value from these initiatives or could more be done?
defaultEmer Costello:default In the first instance, a lot will depend on how the 
defaultyouth employment initiatives are rolled 
defaultout. To date, there are a number of issues. In 
defaultIreland
default there have been a number of training agencies and vocational and education training boards. A lot of changes 
defaultare
default 
defaulttaking
default place in relation to that at the moment. There are community employment initiatives and vocational training programmes. Sometimes there is not as much co-operation as there might be between the various different elements that are involved. I think that was one of the issues that 
defaultRuairí 
defaultQuinn saw when he took on the role of Minister for Education: there are labour activation courses
default, 
defaultthere is community employment
default,
default and then there are education programmes. The training courses were operated through what w
defaultere
default then the FÁS centres, and they came und
defaulter the Department of Enterprise, Trade 
defaultand Employment, whereas a lot of the education programmes came out of the Department of Education
default and Skills
default. So in 
defaultIreland
default there is an attempt to try to co-ordinate 
defaultthat
default now to see if we can come up with a more comprehensive system.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default In a sense, you are trying to bring the business side closer to education.
defaultEmer Costello:default Yes. 
defaultT
defaulthe other thing that we are 
defaultdoing
default is 
defaultrolling
default out the new Intreo centres
default. That
default means when a person finds themsel
defaultves
default unemployed and they turn up at an employment exchange for the first time to sign on, it is not that they are going in to sign on and receive money
default; t
defaulthey are going to a centre that is going to facilitate their entry back into the workforce as quickly as possible
default. S
defaulto the Intreo centres are not just places where people collect their cheques or sign on for their giros or whatever
default; they are places 
defaultthey will go to where they will be provided with job advice and counselling. A personalised training and education programme can be put in place for that person. That is something 
defaultthat 
defaultI think has been missing
default,
default and the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton, is very keen that we should try to activate that.
defaultThat is where the Youth Guarantee will be very important. The Youth Guarantee is supposed to be based on a rights-based approach that will look at the needs of the person, rather than just try
defaulting
default to slot people into the existing provision. As somebody who was a counsellor and worked very much underground in my local area, I could see the problem, too, 
defaultwhere
default you do one course, you do one programme
default,
default and all of a sudden you are told it is two years before you can do anything else. Having done a programme or having done a course a person will say, “I know that I need to get the skills in this particular area”. But when they try to get the skills in that particular area they are told, “Sorry, because you have done this programme you are not entitled to do anything further for another two years. Go away and come back to us in two years’ time”. That is an absolutely crazy situation to have. So I think that rolling out the Intreo centres will be quite useful.
defaultThe other thing I mentioned is that we are reviewing the apprenticeship programme at the moment. A lot of the youth organisations said that it is really important that the Youth Guarantee and the youth programmes that we have should be voluntary
default:
default that young people should not be compelled to take part in them. Certainly, there is a major carrot involved for them
default,
default because since we 
defaultbegan
default to discuss this
default, 
defaultas you are probably aware
default 
defaultthe budget situation in 
defaultIreland
default has become quite serious. We had a very difficult budget. We had to take
default €2.5 billion out of our economy in the last budget in October. There was a request by the 
defaultt
defaultroika to take €3.1 billion out of the economy but the Labour Party insisted that no more than €2.5 billion would be taken out of the economy. From my perspective, o
defaultne of the more painful and difficult budgetary decisions was the decision to reduce the level of benefits that are given to young people. So there is a substantial incentive given to young people to start training programmes. They will certainly be paid much more than they would be paid if they were unemployed and claiming unemployment benefit.
defaultQ158 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default I would like to pursue the question of who does what
default best.
default You are making a strong case for the EU being involved in doing things, and that the 
defaultYouth Guarantee
default 
defaultis 
defaultone of those
default. What things 
defaultdo you think 
defaultare better done at 
defaultthat sort of level by the European Union
default and what 
defaultthings are better done 
defaultby member states? 
defaultHow would you rate that problem?
defaultEmer Costellodefault: I 
defaultthink
default that the European Union 
defaultthrough 
defaultthe 
defaultprovision of funding
default, 
defaultsuch as provided by the Youth Guarantee
default 
defaultor the European Social Fund
default, 
defaultshould
default provide 
defaultmember states with 
defaultthe 
defaultcapacity to 
defaultdeliver what is needed. I do not see it as, “This set of actions is youth actions and this set of funding is national
default action
defaults”
default. 
defaultT
defaulthat
default is i
defaultmportant as we try to develop 
defaulta 
defaultEuropean framework of qualifications and 
defaulttry to address a proper system of 
defaultmutual recognition
default of qualifications across the EU
default.
defaultFrom that point of view, while 
defaultmember states are 
defaultvery 
defaultwell equipped to design 
defaultand develop 
defaulttheir own
default national qualification systems and work within that
default, 
defaultit is important that there is a 
defaultco-ordination and transparency of qualifications 
defaultacross the European Union, which will 
defaultfacilitate 
defaultthe 
defaultmobility and 
defaultthe 
defaultfreedom of movement
default of workers across the EU
default. It is 
defaultvery 
defaultdifficult to have the mobility that 
defaultthe 
defaultEU aspires to
default, and 
defaultwhich 
defaultthe internal market would say we should have, 
defaultif we do not have 
defaulta
default mutual recognition of 
defaultqualifications. There is an i
defaultmportant role for the EU there
default to come up with some funding for it
default,
default but I would not say that one is exclusive of the other
default.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default 
defaultHow do you rate 
defaultthe way in which the various 
defaultEU policies
default have been applied in 
defaultIreland
default? How would you rate the effectiveness of the different policies?
defaultEmer Costello:default 
defaultI
default would say that 
defaultI
defaultreland
default is one of the 
defaultreal 
defaultsuccess stories
default of EU funding
default. 
defaultThe European Social Fund is particularly important. Last year we 
defaultcelebrated 40 years
default since our entry into the European Union and the referendum
default. 
defaultI think 
defaultIreland
default and the 
defaultUK
default entered at the same time. 
defaultAt the time 
defaultIreland
default 
defaultentered the EU, 
defaultfrom our perspective
default there have been 
defaulthuge advances
default,
default because joining the 
defaultEuropean Union
default, 
defaultor the Common Market as it was called then
default, 
defaultopened up a huge market. Quite frankly, before that 
defaultIreland
default 
defaultwas 
defaultvery dependent on 
defaultthe 
defaultUK
default’s
default cheap food policy. We were seen as 
defaulta mechanism for 
defaultproviding 
defaultthe 
defaultUK
default with food
default,
default but 
defaultwe had 
defaultdifficult
defaulty 
defaultreach
defaulting
default markets 
defaultoutside of that. One of the s
defaultuccess
defaultes of 
defaultIreland
default’s entry into the European Union 
defaultwas 
defaultworkers
default’
default and women’s rights. 
defaultI am not sure what the situation was in the 
defaultUK
default at the time, but when we joined the European Union there was a
default marriage bar for women in the Civil Service
default; women had to resign from the Civil Service once they got married
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default That was not so in the 
defaultUK
default.
defaultEmer Costellodefault: 
defaultThat
default was not so in the 
defaultUK
default but we had that in 
defaultIreland
default. There was the whole equality treatment in terms of social protection
default, b
defaultut one of the big areas that helped 
defaultIreland
default 
defaultto 
defaultadvance, with its entry into the European Union, was the d
defaultevelopment of 
defaultthe 
defaulti
defaultnstitutes of 
defaultt
defaultechnology
default,
default or the regional technical colleges as they were called at the 
defaulttime
default. This 
defaultgoes
default back to the whole idea 
defaultof 
defaultvocational training. Instead of developing 
defaulta whole series 
defaultof universities
default—we had three or four universities
default:
default 
defaultas much as we could 
defaultsustain
default—we developed a lot of the 
defaultregional technical c
defaultolleges 
defaultin strategic locations. 
defaultMy own hometown, Dundalk—although I represent Dublin and I have l
defaultived in Dublin 
defaultlonger than I have lived anywhere else, I am 
defaultoriginally from Dundalk
default, which is just on the border between Dublin and Belfast—had a very 
defaultblighted history
default in many ways,
default being a border town
default, and it had developed a certain reputation over the years as well.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultB
defaultandit country
default.
defaultEmer Costello:default 
defaultSo they say. I would not necessarily agree with that, but it s
defaultuffered 
defaultthe 
defaultconsequences of being a 
defaulttown on the 
defaultborder
default. 
defaultI
defaultt developed an 
defaultinstitute
default—an RTC—which is now an 
defaultinstitute of technology
default, and that 
defaulthas 
defaultcontributed to the overall development of the 
defaulttown 
defaultand 
defaultits
default ability 
defaultto attract 
defaultmajor 
defaultindustr
defaulties there
default.
default So I think that 
defaultIreland
default does demonstrate success. Also, the 
defaultstructural fund 
defaulthas helped us 
defaultto 
defaultd
defaultevelop a 
defaultwhole 
defaultroad network
default,
default and 
defaultour 
defaultinfrastructure
default to a large extent
default. Becoming a member of the 
defaultEuropean Union
default was hugely beneficial to 
defaultIreland
default, no more so than 
defaultthe whole area of 
defaultthe Social Fund, the development of 
defaulteducation and training programmes
default through the ESF
default. 
defaultI know that the s
defaulttate 
defaultt
defaultraining 
defaulta
defaultgency developed
default, 
defaultapart from the 
defaultregional technical colleges
default, 
defaultmany programmes 
defaultthat are 
defaultfunded 
defaultthrough
default ESF 
defaultas well. M
defaultany 
defaultof the 
defaultparticipants 
defaultin those programmes 
defaultbecame highly skilled 
defaultand were able to go on to 
defaultmake 
defaultIreland
default 
defaultthe 
defaultknowledge economy 
defaultthat it is now, 
defaultan economy that 
defaultis capable of attracting 
defaulthigh-end industry. We have had 
defaulta lot of 
defaultvarious different member states
default come to 
defaultIreland
default to see how 
defaultIreland
default has drawn down the Social Fund as well.
defaultQ159 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default It is a great example and we all know it. 
defaultW
defaulthat has happened in 
defaultIreland
default 
defaultis r
defaultammed down our throats all the time
default, which is great
default. 
defaultThe point is 
defaultthat 
defaultw
defaulte are 
defaultwhere we are and we are 
defaultall affected by 
defaultthis high 
defaultyouth unemployment
default, which has 
defaultlong-term
default effects on whether people who are out of work for any length of time are ever going to be employable again, and all the social problems that you have mentioned.
defaultI am told w
defaulte are running out of time
default, so I will ask you the q
defaultuestion
default. T
defaulto what extent do you see the issue as being about the demand-side, the availability of jobs, and how well are young people prepared for the labour market with regard to their skills or employability?
defaultEmer Costello:default This is another big issue
default that has come up
default. 
defaultPeople say, “
defaultThe 
defaultYouth Guarantee says
default that a young person 
defaultwill be made 
defaulta quality offer
default 
defaultwithin four months 
defaultof leaving full-time employment or education”. 
defaultPerhaps we could 
defaulttouch on 
defaultthat 
defaultbefore we finish: a quality offer
default of an apprenticeship, 
defaulta 
defaulttraining 
defaultplace 
defaultor education place
default,
default and 
defaultan offer of a place 
defaultwithin four months
default. T
defaulthe question 
defaultcomes up, “Well,
default what happens at the end of th
defaultat training
default period if the jobs are not there
default?”
default.
default 
defaultI suppose in the first instance, while we are e
defaultxperiencing 
defaultthe
default downturn
default,
default 
defaultit is important that we have people who are job
default-
defaultready for when the economy does actually recover. So t
defaulthere 
defaultis very much that, but I think there 
defaulthas to be dual action in preparing people for 
defaultthe 
defaultjob market without 
defaultbeing able to 
defaultprovid
defaulte the jobs
default. That
default can be difficult. You can do so much in trying to address the s
defaultkills mismatch
default, which I mentioned earlier
default.
default I think 
defaultit is
default hugely important 
defaultto
default address the skills mismatch
default. 
defaultAt the same time, t
defaulthere will be people who 
defaultwill 
defaultemerge from these 
defaulttraining 
defaultprogrammes
default with the expectation of getting a job
default. 
defaultThat is why, from my point of view and from 
defaultthe perspective of 
defaultmy p
defaultolitical group here 
defaultin
default 
defaultthe 
defaultEuropean Parliament
default, 
defaultEurope
default 
defaultneed
defaults
default to come up with 
defaultan injection of stimulus
default or growth that will see growth in the economy that will help create jobs.
defaultQ160 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default I 
defaultwill 
defaultjust throw a s
defaulttatistic
default at you. I do not know whether it is true or false and perhaps you can tell me
default. 
defaultThe 
defaultIrish 
defaultPrime Minister 
defaultsaid 
defaultthat if all 
defaultthe 
defaultIT job
defaults that were
default vacan
defaultt
default in 
defaultIreland
default 
defaultwere filled 
defaultthere 
defaultwould be no youth unemployment. In other words, the jobs are there 
defaultbut 
defaultthe 
defaultskills are not. 
defaultW
defaulte a
defaultll think we are brilliant at IT, but 
defaultwe are not, with 
defaultall 
defaultthe new developments in IT. 
defaultIf the EU has to be involved in 
defaulttrying to 
defaultdivvy up the whole thing, would it not be better to 
defaultbe doing something specifically 
defaultaim
defaulted
default at IT training
default in every member state?
defaultEmer Costello:default 
defaultCertainly i
defaultn a country like Ireland 
defaultIT training 
defaultis 
defaultparticularly important. I am 
defaultnot familiar with 
defaultthat particular 
defaultquote from the Taoiseach
default, Enda Kenny
default. W
defaulthat I would say is that I know a number of companies 
defaultthat 
defaultdo locate 
defaultto
default 
defaultIreland
default, 
defaultparticularly some of the IT companies
default, 
defaultm
defaultay locate some 
defaultof their 
defaultsales position
defaults there
default. 
defaultOne of t
defaulthe 
defaulthuge problems is 
defaultlanguages. The 
defaultC
defaultommissioner had an interesting perspective on this
default. I had a meeting with him some months ago
default in relation to 
defaultthe 
defaultroll-out of 
defaultthe Youth Guarantee
default.
default 
defaultI said that p
defaulteople 
defaultfrom countries like 
defaultIreland
default 
defaultare going to 
defaultAmerica
default, 
defaultCanada
default, 
defaultAustralia
default and 
defaultNew Zealand
default, and he 
defaultsaid 
defaultthat 
defaultit is interesting
default to see
default, when you look at the level of vacancies across the European Union, 
defaultthat 
defaultthey are c
defaulthoosing to travel 
defaultnot across the European Union but to 
defaultdifferent continents
default. That is very often because they travel to a continent
default where the
defaulty have
default a language affinity.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, exactly.
defaultEmer Costellodefault: 
defaultN
defaultot only IT training
default but the way we t
defaulteach languages 
defaultin schools 
defaultis 
defaultgoing to have 
defaultto be revised. 
defaultWe have to look at producing people who have high quality language skills.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, that is absolutely right.
default 
defaultLook, t
defaulthis has been 
defaultfascinating 
defaultand we could stay here for another hour 
defaultbut 
defaultunfortunately 
defaultwe are being booted out. 
defaultWell, not as inelegantly as that. I am sure 
defaultthat 
defaultlots of 
defaultideas will 
defaultcome to 
defaultyou 
defaultover the next few days, so can I ask if you could 
defaultjot them down to 
defaulthelp us in our report and to 
defaultfurther our discussions
default?
default W
defaulte 
defaultare almost at the end of witness taking so we would be most grateful.
defaultEmer defaultCostellodefault: 
defaultC
defaultan I leave these with you
default?
default These are c
defaultopies of my report. 
defaultI had another m
defaulteeting in Tallaght in November. 
defaultThat is annexed there. That
default is 
defaultthe
default full report 
defaultof 
defaultall
default the meetings that I 
defaultheld with 
defaultthe 
defaultstakeholders. 
defaultThe names of the stakeholders who attended the meetings are there
default, s
defaulto even though y
defaultou will not be familiar
default with the organisations it will give you an idea of who they are and what we did
default.
default I will leave you with all the copies of those that I have, and I will give you a c
defaultopy of 
defaultthe
default speech 
defaultthat I gave 
defaultat 
defaultthe 
defaultlast 
defaultmeeting because that 
defaulttried 
defaultto encapsulate some of the issues that came up at some of the other meetings.
defaultThe Chairman:default If you were in my position now, what questions would you be asking you?
defaultEmer Costello:default 
defaultWow, now there is a question. 
defaultTo be honest, the questions 
defaultthat you had here 
defaultare 
defaultvery 
defaultimportant
default,
default but one 
defaultof the 
defaultarea
defaults that
default we need to look at 
defaultis 
defaulthow to give young people 
defaultsome kind of ownership and 
defaulthope. 
defaultI
defaultf we are talking about youth employment initiatives, I think the 
defaultinvolv
defaultement of
default young people in 
defaultthe 
defaultroll-out
default of those is hugely important
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultWe have 
defaulthad 
defaultyoung people
default as witnesses
default.
defaultEmer Costellodefault: I am very impressed, yes.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultWe ha
defaultd them and it was really fiery
default. W
defaulthen I asked my first question
default about 
defaultwhich 
defaultorganisation they go 
defaultto 
defaultfor jobs
default, they
default just said in front of us—
defaultwe are 
defaultMembers of the House of Lords, do not forget—“
defaultJob Centres
default are crap
default”
default,
default and i
defaultt went on from there
default. 
defaultBut 
defaultit was good
default. They
default said they really
default felt engaged with us 
defaultand I think they were delighted that we had 
defaultgone to the trouble. 
defaultWe d
defaultid the same in 
defaultBirmingham
default. 
defaultThey were tough and they b
defaultrought us down from 
defaultwhatever 
defaultcloud
default we were on. I give you 
defaultthe 
defaulttip 
defaultthat 
defaultif m
defaultore 
defaultEuropean 
defaultcountries 
defaultactually 
defaultask
defaulted
default their young people
default,
default they might get some staggering answers
default—
defaultnot 
defaultthat they would 
defaultnecessarily use that word
default. 
defaultI think that w
defaulte have covered that
default, but if you think of any other points that we should cover because we only have a few weeks left
default.
defaultEmer Costello:default The other issue 
defaultthat I mentioned to you wa
defaults the quality framework
default, which I believe is h
defaultugely important. 
defaultIf we are developing internships and placement programmes or whatever, it is important that we develop
default that framework
default. I know 
defaultthat 
defaultthe 
defaultCommission has moved towards develop
defaulting a quality framework 
defaultfor 
defaulttraineeships and 
defaultinternships
default. 
defaultT
defaulthat has to be developed and improved on
default. T
defaulthere is a
default possibility 
defaultthat they 
defaultcould be open to abuse
default,
default but a
defaultt the same time 
defaultI 
defaultbelieve that internships can p
defaultrovide a major stepping stone
default into employment
default. T
defaulthey are good for employers
default, and 
defaultthey are good for employees. It g
defaultive
defaults them a chance to try
default each 
defaultother out
default,
default and 
defaultthat 
defaultis very important.
defaultQ161 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default A
defaultre you working 
defaultat trying to develop a framework for those
default?
defaultEmer Costello:default 
defaultYes, 
defaultwe
default are, but I think i
defaultt has to come with a contract. I
defaultt has to come with something that says 
defaultthat 
defaulta certain level of skills 
defaultwill be 
defaultdelivered. I
defaultdeally
default,
default 
defaultI would like to see it come with 
defaultan accreditation process
default at the end, which perhaps could be tied into the accreditation of p
defaultrior learning
default. Therefore the
default skills derived over a period 
defaultof training 
defaultin a job placement 
defaultwould be accredited in 
defaultsome
default way, so that somebody w
defaultould 
defaulthave something that sits within the European 
defaultq
defaultualifications 
defaultf
defaultramework
default that 
defaultthey could see.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you so much.
defaultEmer Costellodefault: I hope that that was useful.
defaultThe Chairman:default In fact, 
defaultwe are not being booted out but you are.
defaultEmer Costellodefault: That is fine
default as
default I have other places to go to. It was nice to see you.
defaultThe Chairman:default It was nice to see you too.
