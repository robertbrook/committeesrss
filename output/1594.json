"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, The University of Manchester (CCS13)A\nll views contained within \nthis submission \nare attributable to the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of \nother \nresearchers \nfrom\n the wider Tyndall Centre\n or University of Manchester. Our research activity that has contributed to this submission has predominantly been funded by the EPSRC and National Grid. No other interests are declared.\nThe Tyndall Centre at University of Manchester has conducted a number of research projects both directly and indirectly relevant to this inquiry. \nThis submission presents an overview of research on three topics, namely; i) public responses to CCS technology\n, and\n ii) \nthe performance of \nCCS\n in relation to emissions budgets\n. Our conclusions drawn from these research areas are structured according to th\ne questions specified in the terms of the inquiry rather than by topic.\nWhat are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they b\ne overcome?\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the consequences of failing to develop CCS and what alternatives are available for decarbonisation if CCS fails?\n&#xa0;\nReferencesAnderson, K., Bows, A., 2011.
