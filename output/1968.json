"                                          &#xa0;\nNorfolk Wildlife Trust – Written evidence&#xa0;Evidence Submission on Draft De-regulation Bill&#xa0;Use and classification of restricted byways&#xa0;Norfolk Wildlife Trust wishes to make the following comments regarding or experience of the use of green lanes/unsealed unclassified roads (UUCR) and whether they should become restricted byways that are not open to all traffic\n.\n&#xa0;\nAlthough we have not collected evidence regarding this issue we do have anecdotal evidence of disturbance to nesting birds caused by use of UUCRs that cross nature reserves in the \nBreckland\n area of Norfolk. This relates to UUCRs that cross East \nWretham\n Heath and \nWeeting\n Heath, which are both part of \nBreckland\n Special Protection Area (SPA), which is designated for stone curlew. Nesting density of Stone curlew have been shown to decrease in the proximity of both new development and by roads according and \nBreckland\n Council has adopted polices with strict guidelines relating to development within 1500m of nests that are on the SPA.   A change of use from UUCR to restricted byway would lessen disturbance to this European protected species.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJohn \nHiskett\n \nCEnv\n MCIEEM\nSenior Conservation Officer\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
