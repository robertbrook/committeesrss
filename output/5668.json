I am a Labour Peer.\nMax Uebe: John Monks is also\n there\n.\nThe Chairman: Yes, indeed.\nMax Uebe: I used to work with him a lot when I was in the Cabinet\n.\nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: Yes, John is a frequent speaker in the House of Lords.\nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: David Wilson. I am an independent \nC\nross\n-B\nench Peer. I have been about 20 years in the House of Lords\n. My career was \nin public service, to some extent universities and some industry.\nLord Freeman: Roger Freeman, a Conservative Life Peer, having served also in the House of Commons for 15 years, \nbut \nI am 15 years now in the House of Lords.\nMax Uebe: That is possible? Apologies for my ignorance.\nThe Chairman: Not simultaneously.\nLord Freeman: Not simultaneously, you can move on from the Commons.\nMax Uebe: So if you move from the Commons, you are—\nThe Chairman: You are a Lord.\nThe Chairman: The difference between us is that, of course, in the Commons they are elected.\nMax Uebe: That I am aware of.\nLord Freeman: And we are appointed.\nQ179 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: \nI \nam \nDetta O'Cathain\n. I\n have been in the House for 23 years. I came through the business route not the political route, but I sit on the Conservative \nB\nenches.\n Of \ncourse you know Dominique Gracia\n,\n who has organised all of this.\nWe started this inquiry taking witness statements from October last year, although it seems a long time ago. We are doing it on the basis of our remit as a \nS\nub\n-C\nommittee of the European Union Select Committee in the House of Lords to scrutinise\n.\n \nW\ne have three specific areas: the internal market, infrastructure and employment. We have done various reports since this Parliament began. We have a five-year Parliament span and we are just towards the end of the fourth year. We have done things like women on boards, innovation and research and the Channel Tunnel. So you can see the disparate types of work we do.\nWe decided to look at youth unemployment because without doubt it is probably the most serious problem facing the European Union. There are some countries that are managing to sort it out.\nWe have taken evidence from all sorts of people. We have taken statements from \nyoung people\n themselves, which was a really good thing that we did. \nW\ne had two very interesting sessions: one in Birmingham and one in Liverpool. We found just how \ndifficult\n it is out there, with the interaction of social problems\n.\n \nT\nhe real problem is that\n, \nwhile some people can be unemployed and then pick themselves up and get into the labour market, and then have careers and go steaming on\n, \nsome of these people are without hope. I do not think they can see it on their radar screen. Then there are the implications of that not only for the people themselves, who are going to have a much worse life than other people born at the same time as them in different circumstances, but there are the social implications\n—\nriots and all sort of things. We have seen very little of it in the United Kingdom\n—it does not happen every weekend—but \nit is destabilising and very upsetting for those who have tried to do something about it. \nT\nhat is one of the major problems.\nWe also took evidence from business on the day-to-day operations of things like apprenticeships and that was very helpful. \nT\nhere are definitely some areas we can look at that are going to help us throughout.\n \nNow we have decided that, as it was the European Union, we had better come here. It is the first time our Committee ha\ns \ntaken evidence \nin \nBrussels\n in this Parliament, so \nwe are very grateful to you. We have a series of questions that you have been given in advance.\n M\ny first question is: to what extent do you see the issue as being about the demand side\n—\nthe availability of jobs\n—\nand to what extent is \nit \nthe supply side: how well young people are prepared for the labour market, in terms of skills and education, the point really being their employability?\nMax Uebe: First, let me thank you for coming over and for your interest. We very much look forward to your final report. It is when?\nThe Chairman: April 2014, just a couple of months.\nMax Uebe: So a couple of months to go. When I started in the Cabinet with Commissioner Andor’s predecessor, Commissioner \nŠ\npid\nl\na, there was a report by the House of Lords on labour law. It was early days for me and I was not involved very much but I remember the high quality of the report, which was very much appreciated. Our relations with the \nUK\n are not always the easiest, so also in this context we look forward to the report based on the sound evidence that you have collected, which perhaps can also help the debate from our point of view. \nThe Chairman: \nThank you for that comment. That is very important. Thank you.\nMax Uebe: On your question on demand and supply\n, we \ntry to address it from both angles. There is clearly both a demand side and a supply side problem in most member states. Of course it is dangerous to generalise because the situation across the European Union is very diverse. It is no secret. If you look at the map, at the Mediterranean countries, in \nGreece\n and \nSpain\n youth unemployment is up to almost 60%, whereas in the centre it \nis \n4% or 5%. In general, we try to address the fact that young people without the right skills will never have a chance. You mention young people who are caught in this cycle of unemployment over generations. They will not have the opportunity to enter the labour market to find sustainable labour market attachment. Obviously, on the other side, what we always say is that, whatever we do here in terms of apprenticeship reform, the Youth Guarantee and so on, it will not work if the economy as a whole is not picking up. We are not naive. Without that it will not be possible. But our objective is to at least have young people ready and prepared for jobs that hopefully will come up soon\n,\n because there is some light now at the end of the tunnel. Recovery is coming. The big question is: will it be a jobless recovery or will there be new jobs? I would argue that it is both. It is very important.\nIf you look at the Youth Guarantee—and I assume you have looked at the recommendation behind the Youth Guarantee—this is our flagship in the unit. This is our umbrella for all the policy measures we take in the fight against youth u\nnemployment. It can be argued that \nthere \nyou have both in a way. There is a recommendation to reinforce youth entrepreneurship. You can use money from the \nyouth employment initiative\n—this €6 billion package—to finance recruitment or wage subsidies, and a large part of course is upskilling and so on. We try to tackle both\n,\n the Commissioner will argue. \nPerhaps I should say here, in brackets, that it \nis not usual for me to speak to you before you speak to the Commissioner. It is not the most normal or pleasant\n way. It is a bit tricky.\nThe Chairman: For you?\nMax Uebe: Yes, of course, because I do not \nwant\n you to say later on, “But Max said so and so”\n.\nThe Chairman: We will not.\nMax Uebe: I also like to keep questions more on a technical level. For example, this is a question that the Commissioner would love to address. He is an economist and he thinks a lot about these macroeconomic questions as well.\nThe Chairman: Thank you. Does anyone want to comment on any points that Mr Uebe has mentioned? The thing that struck me is what you said about this total commitment to the flagship policy, which is the Youth Guarantee.\nQ180 &#xa0; \n \nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: On the second question, I would like to tease you out a little on the Commission’s programme for developing standards for training and apprenticeship quality. As you know, there is quite a focus in the \nUK\n on returning to what we had 20 or 30 years ago, which were quality apprenticeships. We are now trying to very substantially increase the number of young people undergoing apprenticeships. Could you explain a little bit more\n what you believe that centrally\n—without any question there is a role for you—\nyou can contribute\n, because there is such a diverse application of apprenticeships between one nation and another? Are you hoping to achieve minimum standards or a minimum quality? Do you think it is possible or preferable to give a general exhortation that people should be moving in this direction but leave it to them to develop the systems as they see appropriate to their own circumstances? \nMax Uebe: First, we have to clearly distinguish between traineeships and apprenticeships. Those are dealt with here in the unit by two different people. \nI should say, in brackets, to give you an idea that we \nare the policy unit working on youth unemployment. You mentioned that \nthis \nis one of the biggest problems in the European Union\n,\n but we have 3.5 people working on that. \nI say that t\no give you an idea. We have staff cuts and I just managed to get one additional post. But, given the magnitude of the problem, it is always interesting to see the reaction of people \nwhen \nI give this information. It is quite something. We have one colleague working on traineeships. Of course they cover other issues as well but mainly traineeships\n and \napprenticeships\n,\n and another is working on the Youth Guarantee. So we have to distinguish between apprenticeships and traineeships.\nWe are fully aware of the differences between member states. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. It simply does not work. In particular, \nwhen you look at apprenticeship\n schemes, we have different traditions. You cannot compare countries, like \nGermany\n, \nAustria\n or \nSwitzerland\n. Their systems have grown over decades if not centuries. Then you have member states—let us take \nSpain\n or \nPortugal\n—that want to build up a system. It is a very, very difficult task because there are so many different players: there are the links with educational institutions and you have to get businesses and trade unions on board. We are starting from a very low point in these countries. \nThe European Alliance for Apprenticeships was launched in July. One of its main objectives is, first, to change the mindsets of those member states that do not have apprenticeship schemes yet. That means the mindsets of the companies. If you speak to an Italian company they will tell you, “Why should I have an apprentice? He or she will leave after finishing the apprenticeship and go to my competitor”. When we speak to the trade unions they say, “This is exploitation of young people because they are paid much less”. When we speak to young people\n,\n they prefer to go to a construction site and earn three times as much now in the short term, and you speak to the parents and they say, “It is much more prestigious if my daughter and my son go to university”. So there is a big, big mindset problem to start with.\nYou also asked about the European role. What we try to do with the European alliance is to bring a lot of pilot projects that are taking place under the European umbrella. There is a lot of interest in many member states \nin doing \nsomething. I have told you that I have been working for a long time in the area of employment and social affairs. I can tell you that usually member states say, “This is not our business. We do a little bit here and there”. This is the one of first times I have seen a real, genuine interest on the part of member states to learn from each other and build up something that works in other member states. Why are apprenticeships so much in vogue these days? It might be a coincidence, but if you look at the map the member states that have well\n \nestablished apprenticeship schemes usually have relatively low youth unemployment rates. \nMy personal opinion is \nthat \nI am a bit sceptical. For me, the apprenticeship scheme is not a panacea. It can help to develop the right skills but it will not solve the dramatic level of youth unemployment. It can be a step. We have all these pieces, like a mosaic, and an apprenticeship is an important part.  But if you speak to some Ministers from some of the countries that want to establish a scheme, they believe that if they establish a system everything will be fine. There is also some scepticism on this side. From our point of view, what is very important is to involve the social partners and the employers when drawing up curricula for the apprenticeships. Successful schemes have that. Only then will young people acquire the skills and the competencies that are needed in the market. It is very important to have a connect between what the market needs, which employers can tell you best, and what the young people will learn.\nThis is on the apprenticeship scheme, and while we have some declarations on minimum standards, and some idea of what a good traineeship would look like, we are far from setting standards as we do now in the other area of apprenticeships. In December the Commission adopted a proposal for a European quality framework on traineeships that we are currently negotiating with member states. Like the Youth Guarantee it is in the form of a Council recommendation, so it is not binding but recommending member states to ensure a number of things. There we start with the kind of standard that we would like to see\n. E\nvery trainee \nshould have \nat least a written traineeship agreement setting out a number of issues\n—\nfor example, the length of the traineeship. We want to ensure that there are learning objectives during the traineeship. We want to avoid repetitive traineeships because there is a major concern that young people are caught in a number of traineeships even with the same employer. In terms of setting standards, we are further advanced than in the area of apprenticeships because there again the apprenticeship system is much more complicated. In \nGermany\n the traditions are different. There are many more players involved\n—\nthe chambers, employers and educational institutions. That is a broad overview.\nThe Chairman: Thank you very much.\nQ181 &#xa0; \nLord Freeman: It is difficult for me to read the map, but could you give us some examples of how different countries are using the \nyouth employment initiative\n?\nMax Uebe: That is a very important and interesting question. We are also interested in learning more about that. You may be aware that we are at the very beginning of everything\n and\n as often happens—I always forget that this is being recorded—things are delayed. We are doing our best but the negotiations on this instrument between the Council and Parliament took a long time. You might be aware that member states have benefited from this money. They were supposed to submit plans—so called Youth Guarantee \nemployment plans\n—by the end of the year. These plans are currently \nbeing \nassessed by colleagues\n.\n \nT\nhey also indicate what member states have in mind to do. There are examples\n,\n but I am not allowed yet to give you concrete examples or mention specific member states. But I mentioned, for example, the wage and recruitment subsidies; apprenticeship reforms are being financed; entrepreneurship support is an issue. Also, in the context of mobility, again the map is quite useful. Obviously mobility can be short-term relief for young people in the south\n,\n because there is a high demand for skilled labour at least in the centre. So, to facilitate mobility, how could you do that? You could finance a language course or help with an allowance to enable someone to move and so on. These are issues that could and will be financed, but we do not have a clear idea of what member states want to do. We can get back to you as soon as we have—\nLord Freeman: \nWh\nen could we have the information of what different member states are doing\n?\nMax Uebe: We will give the first feedback to member states starting in the week beginning 3 February.\nThe Chairman: I see, in two weeks’ time.\nMax Uebe:\n T\no\n be fully transparent\n, the \nplans that have come in are now with the ESF country desk. They do a first assessment. Also other DGs contribute: DG \nEAC and\n DG \nECFIN\n, because all of that has an important budget\nary\n financial impact. They are particularly interested in the programme—\nLord Freeman: What sort of timescale do you think would apply for our Select Committee to be briefed on what different member states are doing?\nMax Uebe: One tricky question we will address, hopefully today or tomorrow, is\n whether we can \nmake these plans public or not\n.\n Already the first request—\nThe Chairman: \nYes, we have heard a rumour.\nMax Uebe: Yes. Yesterday \nI\n attended a meeting of a think tank here. They have set up a task force. A colleague from the OECD said, “We want to see these plans”. I told him we will ask our member states and if they agree we can pass them on. If not, it is possible to formally request access to documents. I do not see any reason to justify a rejection. The rules are extremely generous for the public to request that. I think we have had the first request\n, which is I think from \nIreland\n.\nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: We heard the Irish have gone in.\nMax Uebe: No, someone has requested access to the Irish employment implementation plan.\nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: I am with you, yes.\nMax Uebe: But as you can imagine, i\nt\n can be tricky for member states because journalists also do that. You have an overview of member states and how much money they are willing to put into the fight against youth unemployment. I can imagine a nice story could be made out of that.\nLord Freeman: But in due course \nwill \nthe information be available\n,\n because I think it is directly relevant to our report\n?\nThe Chairman: \nYes\n. We really need the information in the next four weeks.\nMax Uebe: What exactly do you need? What kind of measures are financed in which country or in general or—\nThe Chairman: \nYes\n.\nLord Freeman: Also the nature of the approach, the nature of the plans.\nQ182 &#xa0; \nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: The EU’s role is to co-ordinate and to share best practice, and o\nne of the \ncriticisms that we hear is \nthat \npeople ask, “But where does it actually happen? How do you get access to see what is happening elsewhere, when they do not release information as freely as perhaps they ought to do?” We would like to leave the point with you. I take the issue that you can have newspapers interfering and running stories and using it for their own particular ends, but overall I think this is a major initiative for the Commission and for the EU generally. If they could try some new initiatives on openness, I think you would only benefit from it rather than be seen to say, “We cannot do that. We would like to do it but we cannot do it”. Why does it not go on the net? If the plans go in\n,\n why are they not made public so that people can then say, “There is a good idea there for us to consider”\n?\nThe Chairman: Exactly. This is the point because with 28 member states I am sure there are going to be at least 40 different ideas, and some of them would be directly relevant to the problems that some other member state might have.\nMax Uebe: We fully agree that there should be full transparency, but it is a problem that we have with the member states. When it comes to best practice and sharing, you might be aware of a range of what we call \nmutual learning programmes\n, MLP\ns\n. We had a big seminar on the Youth Guarantee here in October, in La Hulpe. There was one on early intervention I think in \nThe Hague\n. There is one on Youth Guarantee implementation. Soon there will be another \nmutual learning programme \nin \nFinland\n. So for member states at least—and you know we also have Youth Guarantee co-ordinators appointed in all member states—there is a lot \nof \nexchange. We had an EMCO automatic review\n—by\n the Employment Committee\n—i\nn early December where perhaps 10 to 12 member states presented what they do, and then there is always a discussion with other member states coming in and commenting. At that level at least there is a lot of exchange. When it comes to the wider public, I agree it could be better.\nThe Chairman: I have just been reminded that we have five minutes left\n, so \nI just make the point at this stage that if you have the sort of information that you think might help us to support our views—and I think you can see where we are tracking to—it would be very useful if you could send us some stuff. \nQ183 &#xa0; \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: Can\n you clarify the role of the European Social Fund in dealing with youth unemployment and the Youth Guarantee? The memo put out by the Commission in November says, “It is important that member states devote a significant proportion of their European Social Fund allocations for 2014-20 to implementing the Youth Guarantee”. How do you see the ESF fitting in\n?\n \nC\nan I try to get my mind clear? The suggestions are made by the Council as recommendations. They are not binding. The money is given out by the Commission. That means the Commission is saying, “Okay, this idea is good and we will support it. That idea is not good, we will not support it”. So there is a great deal of power there in the Commission of what—\nMax Uebe: Ideally, yes, but with shared management you have to agree with a member state. In general, when it comes to the fund, we try to introduce what we call \nex ante \nconditionality. We want to make payments conditional. This is\n, in my personal view, in the interest not only \nof the Commission but also of a number of member states. At least we can control in a certain way where the money goes. When it comes to EU funding of the Youth Guarantee, first, we say the Youth Guarantee needs national funding. EU funding alone will not suffice. Then you have to distinguish between the \nyouth employment initiative—\nthe €6 billion package, two years’ short-term Youth Guarantee\n—\nand the ESF, \nwith \nmuch larger amounts, \nfor \nmuch longer and covering all member states because\n. As \nyou see from th\nis year’s\n money\n,\n a number of member states do not benefit at all. So this is an i\nmportant difference between the two.\nQ184 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: This has been a terrific session and thank you very much indeed. I know you only have three and a half people, but I wonder if the half person could look at the questions that you had notice of and see if they can give us any more information.\nOn a final note, \nand \nthis is a psychological sort of problem \nfor us \nin the United Kingdom—and I am not speaking for the United Kingdom but I can understand where they are coming from—one of the points is: why is the EU so prescriptive? Why do you take this role and not allow more flexibility? Can you consider that\n,\n because I am thinking about what is going to happen when our report comes out\n?\n I am also thinking that we have a situation in the \nUK\n at the moment \nthat \nis slightly tricky. I think that one of the advantages for the pro-European \nside, so to speak, \nwould be if \nthey\n could point to something that is really likely to work, but not without the great hand of the EU getting right into the dross of the business.\nMax Uebe: I am not so sure that we are overly prescriptive. Again, \non \nour flagship\n,\n the Youth Guarantee, we have recommendation number one, which is the core. \nMember \nstates are committed to ensure that all young people up to 25 have \nthis \nwithin four months. How they achieve it, honestly we do not care at all. What counts for us is the outcome\n, which is that \nideally young people are not for longer than four months on the streets\n or\n in the suburbs\n, for example\n. If you call that prescriptive\n, fine\n. There then follow a number of guidelines and recommendations on how to achieve this objective. Again, when it comes to monitoring the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, what we will look at is the outcome\n,\n and how a member state achieves that honestly I do not care at all. Obviously there should be a certain quality in the jobs and \ntraining and \nso on, but your tools, your ideas, where to put the money—\nThe Chairman: Thank you. \nA\nll of this is being transcribed. You will get a copy of the transcript, which you can correct. Please keep in touch\n.\n&#xa0;\n"
