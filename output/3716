defaultWritten Evidence from Peter SmithdefaultI am writing this letter as an individual who has been a qualified Electrician for over 30 years, with experience of working in Domestic, Commercial and Industrial sites all over the UK, carrying out installation and 
defaultmaintenance contracts.
defaultI am qualified to the latest standard for BS7671 i.e. the 17
defaultth
default edition of the IEE Wiring Regulations, and hold the City and Guilds 2391 qualification for Electrical test
defaulting
default and Inspection.
defaultMy concerns about Part P are as follows.
default&#xa0;
default1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTh
defaulte whole
default competitive
default 
defaultframework for registering companies, such as Napit and Elecsa, offers no benefits to the consumer from a safety aspect, whi
defaultch is what the regulation is supposedly
default about.
default2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe fact that thousands of qualified Electricians, like myself, ar
defaulte not considered competent to carry out Domestic installations
default, and in fact may have to pay for the services of an unqualified person who has taken a short course
default is insulting and impractical.
default3)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWithout a single reference point for consumers there will alway
defaults be confusion and ultimately many will simply not bother to have work carried out by professionals or indeed at all.
default&#xa0;
default I
defaultn my opinion the industry definitely needs to be regulated, but not in a way where the emphasis is on a competitive market with several
default companies touting for business from contractors.
defaultInstead it should be on ensuring that a consumer can find the a fully qualified contractor, locally to carry out their work in the safest and most economical way, this cannot be achieved by companies fillin
defaultg their pockets by offering registration and training to whoever knocks at their door.
defaultAt this moment in time it seems the Government are not happy because the whole framework of Part P was set up as a knee jerk reaction, without enough thought and plannin
defaultg.
defaultConsumers are still unclear as to regulations and where to look for an appropriate contractor.
defaultThousands of highly qualified tradeâ€™s people are being excluded from carrying out work in favour of people with next to no qualifications or experience.
defaultIn co
defaultnclusion the clock needs resetting, introduce one regulating and authorising body that is not merely concerned with making profit, but actually works towards offering the best deal to the consumer.
