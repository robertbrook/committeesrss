[normal]Written Evidence from Peter Smith[bold]I am writing this letter as an individual who has been a qualified Electrician for over 30 years, with experience of working in Domestic, Commercial and Industrial sites all over the UK, carrying out installation and 
[normal]maintenance contracts.
[normal]I am qualified to the latest standard for BS7671 i.e. the 17
[normal]th
[normal] edition of the IEE Wiring Regulations, and hold the City and Guilds 2391 qualification for Electrical test
[normal]ing
[normal] and Inspection.
[normal]My concerns about Part P are as follows.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Th
[normal]e whole
[normal] competitive
[normal] 
[normal]framework for registering companies, such as Napit and Elecsa, offers no benefits to the consumer from a safety aspect, whi
[normal]ch is what the regulation is supposedly
[normal] about.
[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The fact that thousands of qualified Electricians, like myself, ar
[normal]e not considered competent to carry out Domestic installations
[normal], and in fact may have to pay for the services of an unqualified person who has taken a short course
[normal] is insulting and impractical.
[normal]3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Without a single reference point for consumers there will alway
[normal]s be confusion and ultimately many will simply not bother to have work carried out by professionals or indeed at all.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I
[normal]n my opinion the industry definitely needs to be regulated, but not in a way where the emphasis is on a competitive market with several
[normal] companies touting for business from contractors.
[normal]Instead it should be on ensuring that a consumer can find the a fully qualified contractor, locally to carry out their work in the safest and most economical way, this cannot be achieved by companies fillin
[normal]g their pockets by offering registration and training to whoever knocks at their door.
[normal]At this moment in time it seems the Government are not happy because the whole framework of Part P was set up as a knee jerk reaction, without enough thought and plannin
[normal]g.
[normal]Consumers are still unclear as to regulations and where to look for an appropriate contractor.
[normal]Thousands of highly qualified tradeâ€™s people are being excluded from carrying out work in favour of people with next to no qualifications or experience.
[normal]In co
[normal]nclusion the clock needs resetting, introduce one regulating and authorising body that is not merely concerned with making profit, but actually works towards offering the best deal to the consumer.
