[normal]Written evidence submitted by Dr[bold].[bold] E.A.S. Linley[bold] (LCI0003)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Executive [bold]summary[bold] :
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The absence of a strategy embracing all arms of government is making the delivery of low carbon innovation exceptionally difficult – and the current disconnect with polic
[normal]y
[normal], exacerbated by 
[normal]existing 
[normal]p
[normal]oorly targeted
[normal] 
[normal]instruments, h
[normal]ave combined to un
[normal]dermine the group
[normal]’
[normal]s achievements
[normal] and business confidence
[normal] in the low C sector
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Climate change remains an inappropriate 
[normal](and weak) 
[normal]driver of behavioural change and innovation in businesses
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]home
[normal]s – and for the vast majority of people
[normal],
[normal] needs to be interpreted in terms of 
[normal]‘
[normal]energy 
[normal]efficiency
[normal]’ 
[normal] 
[normal]reducing costs, 
[normal]‘
[normal]energy security
[normal]’ 
[normal] keeping lights and heat on and the UK infrastructure functioning (hospital, traffic lights etc.) 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]By intensifying the ‘bottom approach’
[normal] to complement the current 
[normal]top down approach
[normal], 
[normal]the LCICG should 
[normal]engag
[normal]e
[normal] and mentor SME
[normal]’
[normal]s 
[normal]using the substantial
[normal] knowledge base in government 
[normal]to 
[normal]facilitate 
[normal]innovat
[normal]ion
[normal],
[normal] through use of flexible
[normal] and smaller 
[normal]value 
[normal]funding mechanisms
[normal], the LCICG
[normal] 
[normal]could 
[normal]then 
[normal]deliver incremental but solid steps 
[normal]towards innovating across all sectors
[normal]. This could be 
[normal]based on a ‘developme
[normal]nt plan‘ 
[normal]for each of the TINA priorities
[normal] broken down into manageable steps
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many SMEs cannot contemplate taking on high risk projects but they can offer a
[normal] desk
[normal] in their company. I
[normal]nvestment in paid interns could mobilise a graduate workforce with a common mission – mentored via web based tutorials. This would help companies to 
[normal]gather the information needed
[normal] and help them to identify where the opportunities might be. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It’s important 
[normal]to acknowledge that innovation can be difficult and slow work – it is really only in extreme conditions of emergency / war / need that humans innovate 
[normal]ad libitum
[normal] as a survival strategy. Neverthel
[normal]ess,
[normal] ‘necessity is the mother of invention’ 
[normal]can be used to go
[normal]od effect NOW 
[normal] to drive the low C innovation agenda
[normal], but it must be 
[normal]interpreted in terms that businesses and homeowners will understand (ie. enlightened self interest). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In response to the specific questions posed : 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It may  - but a strategy is absolutely essential to engage all arms of government around this agenda in 
[normal]a coordinated way – the 
[normal]current 
[normal]disconnect with policy (eg.
[normal] 
[normal]delay in 
[normal]EMR reform
[normal] – and
[normal] 
[normal]knock on effects for market pull) and 
[normal] 
[normal]‘warmist’ 
[normal]/ ambivalent 
[normal]rhetoric 
[normal]by government
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]are 
[normal]undermin
[normal]ing
[normal] business confidence
[normal] to the point where many are asking  - do the lights have to go out before government wakes up to the fragile state of our energy system
[normal] 
[normal]?
[normal] This has recently been compounded by the withdrawal of RWE from R3 Atlantic array
[normal] which had the potential to bring £4
[normal]bn investment to the SW and South Wales
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Low Carbon Innovation agenda needs to be framed differently in government
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] ensure policy and the LCIC
[normal] group 
[normal]are pulling in the same direction.
[normal]A
[normal]t the moment 
[normal]for too many UK nationals 
[normal]‘green
[normal]ness’ is 
[normal]anachronis
[normal]tic 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]and mainly 
[normal]associated with a failed 
[normal]political
[normal] party 
[normal]and logically 
[normal] green deal
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal] / 
[normal]green taxes = saving the 
[normal]environment 
[normal]= tree huggers = a luxury we can
[normal]’
[normal]t afford.
[normal] 
[normal]The vast majority of UK population 
[normal](whether business or homeowner) are too remote 
[normal]from climate change 
[normal]to 
[normal]take it seriously as a driver for innovation in their business - much less 
[normal]change their own behaviour 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]o
[normal] 
[normal]engage people with the low C agenda, we 
[normal]need to play
[normal] to ‘enlightened self inte
[normal]rest’
[normal] 
[normal]ie. energy security (
[normal]=
[normal]light and heat stay on),
[normal] resource and energy 
[normal]efficiency 
[normal](=
[normal]saving money
[normal])
[normal], 
[normal]new / 
[normal]growing innovative 
[normal]businesses
[normal] =
[normal] 
[normal]jobs
[normal])
[normal] and (by the way) also reduces C emissions
[normal] =
[normal] 
[normal]the only 
[normal]responsible 
[normal]way forward
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Moreover 
[normal]LCICG urgently 
[normal]needs a strategy which is future proofed 
[normal]against 
[normal]changes in 
[normal] gove
[normal]rnment
[normal] – this is too important to be subject to whims of change in gov
[normal]ernemnt
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The LCIC group 
[normal]are doing a very good job but i
[normal]t
[normal]’
[normal]s hard to judge whether 
[normal]current 
[normal]measures are adequate
[normal] or not
[normal]  –
[normal] dithering over
[normal] EMR has had very serious consequences and the concern is that over the n
[normal]ext few months we will see many
[normal] 
[normal]offshore wind
[normal] R3
[normal] 
[normal]consortia deserting the UK for more attractive investments overseas. The offshore wind sector is such a fantastic opportunity for the UK – where else 
[normal]do we have the opportunity f
[normal]o
[normal]r
[normal] this sc
[normal]ale of investment at the moment ?
[normal] 
[normal]it is particularl
[normal]y galling to witness parliament justifying the 
[normal]UK 
[normal]slippage by
[normal] reference to othe
[normal]r European countries – which they claim are moving more
[normal] slowly than the UK – not so - 
[normal]four 
[normal]EU countries 
[normal]have already reached the
[normal]ir 2020 renewables 
[normal]target
[normal] !
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As above the lack 
[normal]of joined up policy means that p
[normal]olicy is working against the LC
[normal]I
[normal]C group
[normal] 
[normal]aims 
[normal]f
[normal]or
[normal] eg;  pricing 
[normal]of water and energy are 
[normal]precisely the 
[normal]reverse of 
[normal]those 
[normal]which would yield an immediate effect
[normal] in terms of changing behaviour
[normal]. 
[normal]At the moment the more energy you use
[normal] the less you pay - ! 
[normal]Nor are t
[normal]he instruments which could be adopted in the commercia
[normal]l and domestic housing sectors 
[normal]sufficiently 
[normal]targeted
[normal] or ambitious enough to effect real movement towards more energy efficient buildings. 
[normal]The wealthy and 
[normal]even not-so-
[normal]wealthy but employed 
[normal]middle classes 
[normal]can currently easily afford their energy bills
[normal],
[normal] so they 
[normal]need to be mobilised vi
[normal]a legislation
[normal]. T
[normal]his is the sector which has the potential to deliver 
[normal]a high number of 
[normal] jobs 
[normal]into the construction industry and 
[normal]even 
[normal]a whole n
[normal]ew industry around retrofitting our buildings stock for energy efficiency – and 
[normal]much 
[normal]more quickly than any other sector
[normal] because of re
[normal]latively low skill base required on the ground.
[normal]    
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely to achieve? How 
[normal]should its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]LCI
[normal]C
[normal]G needs to 
[normal]adopt a
[normal]n expanded and more ambitious
[normal] ‘bottom up’ approach to build confidence and 
[normal]intensify its engagement with SMEs –
[normal] where 
[normal]after
[normal] all &gt;90% of 
[normal] innovation characteristicall
[normal]y
[normal] occurs (whether
[normal] in UK, Mexico 
[normal] or Singapore
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Noting that 
[normal]o
[normal]nly 35 of the 170 applications from ene
[normal]rgy entrepren
[normal]e
[normal]urs
[normal] were funded
[normal] by the LCICG
[normal], 
[normal]perhaps 
[normal]the residue mer
[normal]it fu
[normal]r
[normal]ther 
[normal]scrutiny 
[normal]? a 
[normal]relatively 
[normal]small amount of funding (£
[normal]100k)
[normal] 
[normal] can 
[normal]make 
[normal]a significant diff
[normal]erence
[normal] to 
[normal]the 
[normal]ability of
[normal] SMEs to innovate esp
[normal]ecially 
[normal] when collaborating with R
[normal]esearch 
[normal]C
[normal]ouncils 
[normal] –
[normal] 
[normal]as this is equiv
[normal]alent
[normal] to one year of post doc time
[normal] / two years of post grad time
[normal].
[normal] These amounts are also relatively low risk in terms of an SME
[normal]’
[normal]s 
[normal]ability to take on additional staff
[normal] / manage the risk
[normal], 
[normal]and 
[normal]do not tie them up in extended periods of writing bids.
[normal] The public sector needs to lead this activity at grass roots to ensure that 
[normal]innovation is in line with strategic 
[normal]low C innovation 
[normal]priorities and to provide adequate mentoring / practical support. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]ithout a 
[normal]low C innovation 
[normal]strategy document
[normal] to refer to
[normal], 
[normal] 
[normal]it is not clear why
[normal],
[normal] but
[normal] the TINAs 
[normal]appear to 
[normal]have omitted the environmental dimension from 
[normal]almost 
[normal]every aspect of driving the Low C innovation agenda for offshore wind, wave and tidal energy – to the point that consideration of novel (low C) materials, streamlined technologies for monitoring /
[normal] assess
[normal]ment (sensors/ automated
[normal] / satellite systems / multi use platforms 
[normal]are 
[normal]all 
[normal]omitted. This is
[normal] despite the fact that they contribute 
[normal]very significantly 
[normal]to reductions in energy use
[normal] through reduction in 
[normal]ship time
[normal], 
[normal]dematerialisation and 
[normal]potential removal of unsu
[normal]stainabl
[normal]e materials from supply chain, 
[normal]material
[normal] and resource efficiencies and reductions
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Are the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the innovation process, including over the l
[normal]ong-term?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A
[normal]s a general point the desertion of private investors wanting returns 
[normal]within 5 years from many 
[normal]renewable projects
[normal],
[normal] has highlighted the need for longer term sustained support as the sector gets to grips with technologies which a
[normal]re cost effective to build, ar
[normal]e reliable and deliver energy as predicted.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The TINAs provide a clear indication 
[normal]of what is needed 
[normal]per 
[normal]sector –
[normal] but 
[normal]it 
[normal]may 
[normal]be beneficial to break them down into manageable bite sized chunk
[normal]s
[normal] of work and to
[normal] formulate a development plan f
[normal]o
[normal]r each priori
[normal]ty – then 
[normal]to 
[normal]proactively engage prospective businesses around the issues rather than 
[normal]progress via 
[normal]open en
[normal]ded calls ?
[normal] this saves time and ensures optimal use of  the knowledge base within the LCIC team in DECC.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Innovation 
[normal]is 
[normal]not always a linear process
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]diversions and unconventional 
[normal]trajectories
[normal] towards the 
[normal]end game
[normal],
[normal] which can have false starts as well as surprising results
[normal], mean that entrepreneurs and innovative companies 
[normal]benefit 
[normal]significantly 
[normal]from flexible funding mechanisms
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]What is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment? 
[normal]              
[normal]Short term funding timelines undermine
[normal] business confidence – and make
[normal] it 
[normal]almost 
[normal]impossible for ev
[normal]en the most 
[normal]innovative companies to 
[normal]contemplate carrying 
[normal]the 
[normal]risk invol
[normal]ved 
[normal]if other aspects of their business are under strain 
[normal]or to 
[normal]plan how they might interact with public sector to achieve their potential. Essential that LCI team
[normal] 
[normal]facilitates confidence building as result of interacting with 
[normal]its team
[normal] -
[normal] 
[normal]mentoring proposals t
[normal]owards 
[normal]achieving the desired 
[normal]end game should be a recognised role rather than simply as agency to procure the science. Engagement 
[normal]will roll out to a larger pool of businesses and 
[normal]improve 
[normal]significantly 
[normal]as businesses experience successful outcomes.
[normal] 
[normal]Timescales to achieve effective outcomes need to be of the order of decades not 3 to 5years. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]How should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low carbon innovation will be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]By adopting a 
[normal]‘
[normal]bottom up
[normal]’
[normal] approach to complement th
[normal]e 
[normal]measures 
[normal]in place at present. (Apologies if you are already doing these things
[normal] but I do not have enough information
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal](1) 
[normal]go back to the 170 
[normal](less
[normal] 35
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]energy 
[normal]entrepreneurs projects not funded and check whether any 
[normal]of them cou
[normal]ld be re shaped and assessed to
[normal] fit with TINA priorities
[normal] 
[normal]- whilst noting that this is already a group of companies which have an appetite to innovate and carry the necessary risk in their business
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal](2) 
[normal]run calls 
[normal]via RCs 
[normal]in every TINA sector 
[normal]aimed at achieving smaller 
[normal]but 
[normal]solid incremental steps
[normal] in 
[normal]the 
[normal]priorities identified
[normal],
[normal] involving 
[normal]more modest sums 
[normal]of money (not millions- perhaps £100 to 300k). Make sure these calls are supported by 
[normal]webinars 
[normal]via KTNs
[normal] eg. the Energy generation and Supply KTN
[normal] 
[normal] or other networks 
[normal]to 
[normal]ensure wider 
[normal]engage
[normal]ment of
[normal] the right businesses
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal](3) put as much as possible into paid internships –the demand is a bottomless pit;
[normal] 
[normal]every business 
[normal]is unique but could / 
[normal]should have paid intern 
[normal]to investigate some aspect of business 
[normal]which needs
[normal] improving / cost cutting
[normal], energy resource efficiency - 
[normal]plus
[normal] interns often 
[normal]have good ideas – there
[normal] is no need for any 
[normal]‘good’ 
[normal]graduate
[normal] or post grad
[normal] to be out of work
[normal]. 
[normal]Progressing
[normal] this workforce via web based mentoring would be very cost effective and efficient and facilitate group learning. 
[normal](4) make the LCI
[normal]C
[normal] team much more visible and proactive – perhaps secondments into regional partner organisations, make sure 
[normal]all team are able
[normal] to attend 
[normal] 
[normal]appropriate industry 
[normal]conferences / seminars
[normal] regularly
[normal],
[normal] are
[normal] out talking to people / businesses to make sure that they have up to date intelligence from 
[normal]priority 
[normal]sectors and maintain an opportunities pipeline based on intelligence gathered from d
[normal]iscussions w
[normal]i
[normal]th businesses.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]How is the 
[normal]Government maximising opportunities to learn from and partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]G
[normal]overnment IS
[normal] NOT
[normal] maximising opportunities
[normal] to learn within and beyond EU.
[normal] There is much to learn from Denmark for eg. which 
[normal]as is 
[normal]now 
[normal]well known 
[normal]built its wind industry on the back of UK lead – 
[normal] also for eg. 
[normal]the Cornwall energy project in 1986 twinned villages in Denmark and Cornwall to map their energy resources – the Danish v
[normal]illage is now self sufficient 
[normal]in en
[normal]e
[normal]rgy 
[normal]and earns income from its windmill whereas the Cornish village is still in the same situation as in 1986
[normal] despite have energy resources for a town 30X its own population
[normal]; Germany on the other hand has very strong 
[normal]policy drivers through its commitment to a non nuclear future
[normal] – this means they HAVE 
[normal]t
[normal]o succeed in the renewable
[normal]s
[normal] sector
[normal] and this 
[normal]is a
[normal] significant driver for innovation
[normal]; South Africa has taken the lead as the 
[normal]nation with the 
[normal]fastest growing renewable
[normal]s sect
[normal]or
[normal] - 
[normal]when 
[normal]persistent 
[normal]power cuts 
[normal]hit 
[normal]the western Cape lead
[normal]ing 
[normal] to chaos in h
[normal]ospitals, traffic control systems 
[normal] etc.
[normal] and threatened the future of
[normal] its tourism industry
[normal] SA 
[normal], government finally acted !
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal]Cardiff city is already having to manage energy use acros
[normal]s the city to minimis
[normal]e the likelihood of black outs....
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At the moment 
[normal]we have many approa
[normal]ches from international organisations
[normal] 
[normal](mainly government)
[normal] 
[normal]wanting to learn from our research in offshore wind
[normal],
[normal] wave and tidal sectors
[normal], and to build their own industries. 
[normal]UK consultancies have benefitted from the 
[normal]R&amp;D / consultancy 
[normal]experience in UK and we currently have a narrow lead in wave and tidal internationally. It is imperative that we maximise our efforts to bring these sectors to
[normal] fruition 
[normal]in the UK 
[normal]alongside
[normal] other 
[normal]low C 
[normal]initiatives
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is incomprehensible that 
[normal]we 
[normal]would risk the opportunity to 
[normal]exploit
[normal] UK 
[normal]offshore 
[normal]resources
[normal] (eg. 
[normal]Atlantic Array ) to 
[normal]bring energy production within UK
[normal] national 
[normal]boundaries
[normal]. Why is it a 
[normal]good idea to ‘save’ Grangemouth on the basis of fracked shale gas shipped in fr
[normal]om the US ? and ‘feed’ Milford H
[normal]aven on the basis of shipped gas from the middle east ?  
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Finally
[normal] important to note that innovating can be difficult and 
[normal]slow wo
[normal]rk –
[normal] 
[normal]we 
[normal]n
[normal]eed to be patient – we are talking about re vitalising the innovative spirit 
[normal]in 
[normal]a nation of box tickers 
[normal]! 
[normal]in our efforts to maintain the status quo we have
[normal] stymied entrepreneurship and 
[normal]innovation
[normal], 
[normal] so we h
[normal]ave to start with education, 
[normal]encouraging l
[normal]ateral thinking
[normal], rewarding innovative thought and left field thinking, by 
[normal] not straight
[normal] - 
[normal]jacketing youn
[normal]g
[normal] people by
[normal] asking them to  regurgitate
[normal] text book answers. 
[normal]This will take time – so a long term strategy is essential.
