[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Although it is still 
[normal]relatively 
[normal]early to gauge
[normal] the 
[normal]full 
[normal]impact of welfare reform
[normal] on the livelihoods of tenants
[normal],
[normal] a number of clear trends are beginning to emerge following the introduction of the under-occupation penalty
[normal]. The NHF’s
[normal] report;
[normal] “
[normal]The Bedroom Tax in Merseyside
[normal], 100 Days On” gives an
[normal] account of the situation in 
[normal]the region
[normal], and
[normal] much of this can be extrapolated to the north of England as a whole.
[normal] More recently, the NH
[normal]F have revealed results of a
[normal] survey
[normal] 
[normal]of 51 housing associations around England, finding that more than half (32,432) of residents affected by the bedroom tax have bee
[normal]n unable to pay their rent between April and June. A quarter of those affected are in rent arrears for the 
[normal]first time
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This is reflected in Riverside’s
[normal] direct
[normal] experience
[normal]. 
[normal]Over 6,000 Riverside tenants are affected by the under-occupation penalty, or over a
[normal] third of working age claimants
[normal], with the overwhelming majority
[normal] (98%)
[normal] of those affected living in general needs properties
[normal]. Tenants 
[normal]across the country
[normal] are
[normal] facing the penalty
[normal], includ
[normal]ing London and the South East, with o
[normal]ver 45s and disabled tenants 
[normal]being
[normal] ove
[normal]r-represented. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Two years ago – as part of 
[normal]Housing Futures Network
[normal] – we undertook a survey of tenants likely to be affected by the under-occupation penalty. It suggeste
[normal]d that 25
[normal]% wer
[normal]e likely to seek to downsize,
[normal] 
[normal]83
[normal]% were concerned about meeting
[normal] the shortfall in their rent
[normal], with 35% considering it likely or very likely that they would go into rent arrears
[normal]. Two
[normal] years on
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the real 
[normal]experience
[normal] of tenants
[normal] is 
[normal]echoing
[normal] these early indicators of behavioural response.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Housing Futures Network Survey, 20
[normal]11
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]R
[normal]ent arrears
[normal] are increasing and this is largely driven by tenants affected by the under-occupation penalty not meeting the shortfall in their rent. Nearly half (47%) of tenants affected by the under-occupation penalty are in arrears, around double the 
[normal]percentage of those unaffected. Whilst the majority of affected tenants have met some of the shortfall in their rent (77%), arrears are have risen by an average of £150,000 each month since April.
[normal] 
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]despite Riverside having a general shortage of housing to 
[normal]help tenants who want to downsize, many are moving – 370 since the beginning of April. Whilst over half are moving to other affordable homes
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]– either Riverside’s or other social landlords
[normal]’
[normal] – at least a third may be moving into the high-rent private rented 
[normal]sector, far more than the Government has assumed in its forecasts. If this continues, by the end of the year over 1,100 tenants could have moved, close to 20% of those affected. And it is fea
[normal]red that it may be more, as some
[normal] tenants find that they simply ca
[normal]nnot afford to stay, particularly as energy costs rise with the advent of winter. 
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]in the year to the
[normal] end of August
[normal] (2013)
[normal], 
[normal]there has
[normal] been a 
[normal]50% + 
[normal]rise in the number of
[normal] empty properties
[normal], an increase of over 200. 
[normal]This has been
[normal] fuelled by 
[normal]increased turnover 
[normal]and 
[normal]growing re-
[normal]let times, which by the end of August had
[normal] increased by 8
[normal].3 days or 28% compared to the full year figure for 2012/13.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]t
[normal]here 
[normal]is 
[normal]little evidence of significant number
[normal]s
[normal] of affected tenants moving into work. 
[normal]The rate of
[normal] worklessness amongst River
[normal]s
[normal]ide’s working age tenants is high
[normal] 
[normal]at around 60%, and qualitative research indic
[normal]ates that even where tenants have been
[normal] successful in moving into work, it is often temporary and insecure.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]All of these have factors have a combined
[normal] impact on
[normal] the association’
[normal]s bottom line, and ultimately our capacity to do other things. We have built a financial model to forecast the impact of welfare reform (including under-occupation penalty and the roll out of Universal Credit) on ou
[normal]r income and expenditure
[normal], primarily throu
[normal]gh 
[normal]lost income (expressed as
[normal] void rent loss and bad debt
[normal])
[normal] and
[normal] increased
[normal] cash col
[normal]lection costs. Given the evidenc
[normal]e we have
[normal] to date
[normal], we forecast that 
[normal]in the worst case, 
[normal]the annual bottom line i
[normal]mpact is likely to be £22m over 5 years
[normal]. This will have a 
[normal]significant impact on our capacity to invest in other
[normal] priority
[normal] activities
[normal], such as the provision of new homes
[normal].
[normal] Expressed in lost development capacity, we estimate that the[bold] forecast[bold] annual[bold] net[bold] loss of [bold]around [bold]£4[bold].3m[bold],[bold] translates into over 500[bold] new homes foregon[bold]e.[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are doing what we can to support
[normal] tenants
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] our 12-strong money advice tea
[normal]m is bringing some benefits. On the basis of current experience, we project that o
[normal]ver the year we may help tenants affected by the u
[normal]nder-occupation penalty secure
[normal] a
[normal]round 
[normal]£500,000 of extra income through discretionary housing payments and the maximisation of other benefits. From the beginning of March 2013 to the end of July we had successfully helped just under 300 tenants secure D
[normal]iscretionary Housing Payments, totalling
[normal] n
[normal]early £49,000.
[normal] However the majo
[normal]rity of payments are short term,
[normal] and will not necessarily be repeated. In addition
[normal] Riverside’s employment 
[normal]support and 
[normal]affordable warmth programme
[normal]s
[normal] are
[normal] helping 
[normal]boost the earning potential and disposable income of our tenants a
[normal]nd residents. 
[normal]However
[normal], despite
[normal] this positi
[normal]ve activity
[normal],
[normal] the net benefit to customers
[normal] are
[normal] dwarfed by the massive £4.53m our tenants will lo
[normal]se in housing benefit as a result of the under-occupation penalty alone.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Whilst landlord support 
[normal]is a really important
[normal] element in
[normal] helping tenants make the transition in the wake of welfare reform, in itself it is not the answer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]n addition to monitoring
[normal] the operation
[normal]al
[normal] i
[normal]mpact of welfare reform, we are undertaking
[normal] a number of 
[normal]related 
[normal]research projects. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We
[normal] 
[normal]have conducted a sample
[normal] survey
[normal] of tenants
[normal], 
[normal]to explore
[normal] mon
[normal]ey management, 
[normal]financial skills and 
[normal]spending habits in the lead up to the introduction of
[normal] 
[normal]UC
[normal]. 
[normal]The findings are alarming, 
[normal]and 
[normal]suggest that many
[normal] of our
[normal] tenants 
[normal]will
[normal] not have the capacity to handle a
[normal] welfare
[normal] system based on on-line claims 
[normal]and monthly direct payments 
[normal]without significant support
[normal]. 
[normal]In particular:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Almost half 
[normal]of Riverside tenants have 
[normal]no access to the in
[normal]ternet
[normal], however 
[normal]49% of tenant
[normal]s currently in receipt of housing benefit would
[normal] not feel 
[normal]comfortable making 
[normal]an on-line
[normal] 
[normal]claim
[normal],
[normal] even with support –
[normal] including 31% of those who already have access to the internet via their own
[normal] computer
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]lthough most
[normal] tenants (84%)
[normal] have bank accounts
[normal],
[normal] t
[normal]he
[normal] majority (74
[normal]%)
[normal] still like to manage their money through cash
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]with only 25% paying their rent through direct debit or a stand
[normal]ing order, and nearly 50% retaining
[normal] pre-paid utility meters, despite higher tariffs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]In this context the Government’s ambition to roll out a successful ‘digital by default’ approach
[normal] to UC
[normal], wi
[normal]thout the need for 
[normal]unsustainable
[normal] levels of support and
[normal] arrangements for
[normal] exceptions, seems extremely ambitious.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In a separate piece of research, we are 
[normal]currently 
[normal]assessing 
[normal]the likely level of savings
[normal] (to Government)
[normal] generated 
[normal]by the under-occupation 
[normal]penalty, working with 3 other
[normal] social
[normal] landlords - 
[normal] Affinity Sutton, Gentoo and
[normal] Wigan and Leigh
[normal] Housing
[normal] -
[normal] 
[normal]with support from
[normal] the
[normal] Centre for Housing Policy (University of York)
[normal]. 
[normal]Using the DWP’s own savings
[normal] impact
[normal] model, and 
[normal]re-
[normal]running it with data drawn from ‘
[normal]real’ experience
[normal] across the four organisations
[normal] since April,
[normal] our
[normal] i
[normal]nitial findings indicate
[normal] that the level of 
[normal]savings
[normal] projected by DWP
[normal] are l
[normal]ikely to have been overstated to a significant extent, and
[normal] possibly by as much as a third
[normal]. Despite
[normal] savings
[normal] generation
[normal] 
[normal]being one of the Government’s key objectives for the policy, and central to Parliamentary debates during the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill, our study
[normal] confirms
[normal] the DWP’s own assessment that
[normal] 
[normal]“uncertainty about likely claimant and landlord responses to t
[normal]he introduction of the social sector size criteria [which] creates uncertainty about the benefit saving likely to be realised” 
[normal](DWP 2012 p13).
[normal] 
[normal]Our
[normal] work
[normal] also
[normal] highlights significant deficiencies in the design of the model which are likely to have further ove
[normal]rstated the level of savings generated through the implementation of the under-occupation penalty.

[normal] the
[normal] indirect 
[normal]costs 
[normal]which 
[normal]should be taken into account in an overall assessment of the 
[normal]financial impact of the 
[normal]policy. These include potential extra net costs to tenants, landlords, local author

[normal]including:

[normal]Whilst it is difficult to quantify these 
[normal]additional 
[normal]costs with
[normal] 
[normal]accuracy, taken together with the reduced savings 
[normal]discussed 
[normal]in 3.4 
[normal]above, we believe there is a powerful case for 
[normal]further
[normal] scrutiny of the 
[normal]DWP’s 
[normal]£93
[normal]0
[normal]m two year savings
[normal] estimate, which has
[normal] b
[normal]een presented as 
[normal]one of the central objectives of this policy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We 
[normal]support the overall
[normal] need to 
[normal]reform
[normal] the welfare benefit system to be fairer, encour
[normal]age more people into work and take
[normal] responsibility
[normal] for
[normal] managing
[normal] their money.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]However we bel
[normal]ieve that
[normal] significant challenges are emerging which will mean
[normal] that it is difficult for the Government to meet its wider
[normal] welfare and housing objectives. We
[normal] urge 
[normal]the Select Committee
[normal] to consider the following 
[normal]practical 
[normal]changes
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Change the [bold]size criteria for social housing[bold],[bold] allowing one extra bedroom –[bold]We recognise t
[normal]here is a need to free up properties to tackle the urgent issue of overcrowding
[normal] in social housing
[normal]. H
[normal]owever
[normal],
[normal] the response needs to be proportionate, and
[normal] Government figures on overcrowding and under-occupation 
[normal](through 
[normal]DCLG’s 
[normal]latest English Housing Survey) 
[normal]s
[normal]how
[normal] that this objective could be met by
[normal] changing the definition of under-occupation
[normal] (for the purpose of calculating housing benefit/UC)
[normal] to allow
[normal] one extra bedroom.
[normal] 
[normal]This would br
[normal]ing the DWP definition close to 
[normal]the definition used by DCLG and the 
[normal]social housing 
[normal]sector for many years. It would help claimants living in social housing to thrive, supporting payment for modest additional space to allow separate bedrooms for teenage children to study, couples who face illness and disability and separated
[normal] parents with access to children. It would reduce the numbers facin
[normal]g reduced benefi
[normal]t by 75%, and focus
[normal] on dealing with ‘problematic’ levels of under-occupation. It would also give landlords the capacity to deal with the significant numbers of elderly tenan
[normal]ts (exempt from the penalty) who are under-occupying their homes and wish to move. A 
[normal]revised definition 
[normal]wo
[normal]uld 
[normal]reduce the need to rely on inconsistently delivered discretionary assistance (DHP)
[normal], reduce the risk of tribunal challenge
[normal] and 
[normal]end the need for an 
[normal]ever growing list of 
[normal]exemptions. It would introduce a standard which reflects the way low income households live in the 21
[normal]st
[normal] century.
[normal] Furthermore, our research suggests that such a change may not result in the loss of savings an
[normal]ticipated by Government, and
[normal] that
[normal] the basis 
[normal]for the savings already claimed
[normal] requires urgent re-examination
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Give tenants choice about how to manage their benefit by developing an on-line portal, empowering claimants to manage their [bold]UC[bold] payments[bold] ‘at source’[bold] similar to on-line banking.[bold] [bold]Given the results of our recent 
[normal]tenant 
[normal]su
[normal]r
[normal]vey, and evidence emerging from
[normal] the direct payment demonstration projects, 
[normal]we are very concerned abo
[normal]ut the extent
[normal] of support that will be required to enable tenants to manage
[normal] UC
[normal], and in particular the direct 
[normal]payment of the housing cost element
[normal].
[normal] We fear that the sheer volume of claimants seeking payment exceptions, or being forced into ‘switchback’ arrangements because of accumulating arrears, will overwhelm the administration of UC.
[normal] 
[normal]We recommend that
[normal] tenants
[normal] a
[normal]re given
[normal] real choice 
[normal]and appropriate tools 
[normal]to
[normal] manage their housing payments under UC
[normal], which reflect the way in which low income households manage money
[normal]. W
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]strongly
[normal] commend the ‘Budgeting Portal’ 
[normal]proposal 
[normal]made
[normal] by the Social Market Foundation
[normal], which would 
[normal]sit alongs
[normal]ide the normal claims process under
[normal] Universal Credit.
[normal] The portal 
[normal]would enable claimants to manage their Universal Credit ‘at source’
[normal] through an online tool
[normal], and direct regular electronic payments to their landlord, child-care provider etc. withou
[normal]t the need for the development of
[normal] new, expensive banking products.
[normal] [bold]It 
[normal]would enable financial ownership and responsibility by claimants, whilst giving landlords increased rent certainty
[normal] and a real incentive to support tenants develop their financial capacit
[normal]y and digital skills.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Give clarity about the position of vulnerable tenants living in supported housing under Universal Credit. [bold]Despite encouraging
[normal] comments from Ministers, there is still uncertainty
[normal] about the way in which housing cost support
[normal] for vulnerable tenants living in supported housing will be dealt with following the introduction of UC. In particular urgent 
[normal]clarity
[normal] is required
[normal] on the definition of ‘exempt accommodation’ to ensure that
[normal] support for
[normal] all legitimate suppor
[normal]ted housing tenanc
[normal]ies can be
[normal] dealt with outside UC (for not-for-profit providers)
[normal], including 
[normal]cases where 
[normal]support 
[normal]services are delivered by a third party
[normal]. 
[normal]There also needs to be consultation on the detail
[normal]s
[normal] of any
[normal] proposed options
[normal] for
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]localisation of 
[normal]support for housing c
[normal]osts
[normal], ensuring it is based on a system of entitlement, rathe
[normal]r than subject to
[normal] the whim of local political priorities.
[normal] 
[normal]This would provide greater protection for vulnerable households, and certainty for providers seeking to invest in much needed existing and
[normal] new 
[normal]housing support 
[normal]services.
