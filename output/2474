defaultAlthough it is still

defaultearly to gauge
default the 
defaultfull 
defaultimpact of welfare reform
default on the livelihoods of tenants
default,
default a number of clear trends are beginning to emerge following the introduction of the under-occupation penalty
default. The NHF’s
default report;
default “
defaultThe Bedroom Tax in Merseyside
default, 100 Days On” gives an
default account of the situation in 
defaultthe region
default, and
default much of this can be extrapolated to the north of England as a whole.
default More recently, the NH
defaultF have revealed results of a
default survey
default 
defaultof 51 housing associations around England, finding that more than half (32,432) of residents affected by the bedroom tax have bee
defaultn unable to pay their rent between April and June. A quarter of those affected are in rent arrears for the 
defaultfirst time
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is reflected in Riverside’s
default direct
default experience
default. 
defaultOver 6,000 Riverside tenants are affected by the under-occupation penalty, or over a
default third of working age claimants
default, with the overwhelming majority
default (98%)
default of those affected living in general needs properties
default. Tenants 
defaultacross the country
default are
default facing the penalty

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTwo years ago – as part of 
defaultHousing Futures Network
default – we undertook a survey of tenants likely to be affected by the under-occupation penalty. It suggeste
defaultd that 25

defaultR
defaultent arrears
default are increasing and this is largely driven by tenants affected by the under-occupation penalty not meeting the shortfall in their rent. Nearly half (47%) of tenants affected by the under-occupation penalty are in arrears, around double the 
defaultpercentage of those unaffected. Whilst the majority of affected tenants have met some of the shortfall in their rent (77%), arrears are have risen by an average of £150,000 each month since April.
default 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultdespite Riverside having a general shortage of housing to 
defaulthelp tenants who want to downsize, many are moving – 370 since the beginning of April. Whilst over half are moving to other affordable homes
default&#xa0;
default– either Riverside’s or other social landlords
default’
default – at least a third may be moving into the high-rent private rented 
defaultsector, far more than the Government has assumed in its forecasts. If this continues, by the end of the year over 1,100 tenants could have moved, close to 20% of those affected. And it is fea
defaultred that it may be more, as some
default tenants find that they simply ca
defaultnnot afford to stay, particularly as energy costs rise with the advent of winter.

default,

defaultThis has been

defaultAll of these have factors have a combined

defaultand
default our 12-strong money advice tea

defaultnder-occupation penalty secure
default a
defaultround 
default£500,000 of extra income through discretionary housing payments and the maximisation of other benefits. From the beginning of March 2013 to the end of July we had successfully helped just under 300 tenants secure D
defaultiscretionary Housing Payments, totalling
default n
defaultearly £49,000.
default However the majo
defaultrity of payments are short term,
default and will not necessarily be repeated. In addition
default Riverside’s employment

defaultHowever
default, despite

default still like to manage their money through cash

defaulting order, and nearly 50% retaining
default pre-paid utility meters, despite higher tariffs.
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultIn this context the Government’s ambition to roll out a successful ‘digital by default’ approach
default to UC
default, wi
defaultthout the need for

default levels of support and
default arrangements for
default exceptions, seems extremely ambitious.

default&#xa0;defaultHowever we bel

default urge 
defaultthe Select Committee
default to consider the following 
defaultpractical 
defaultchanges
default:
default&#xa0;default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChange the defaultsize criteria for social housingdefault,default allowing one extra bedroom –defaultWe recognise t
defaulthere is a need to free up properties to tackle the urgent issue of overcrowding
default in social housing
default. H
defaultowever
default,
default the response needs to be proportionate, and
default Government figures on overcrowding and under-occupation 
default(through 
defaultDCLG’s 
defaultlatest English Housing Survey) 
defaults
defaulthow
default that this objective could be met by
default changing the definition of under-occupation
default (for the purpose of calculating housing benefit/UC)
default to allow
default one extra bedroom.
default 
defaultThis would br
defaulting the DWP definition close to 
defaultthe definition used by DCLG and the 
defaultsocial housing 
defaultsector for many years. It would help claimants living in social housing to thrive, supporting payment for modest additional space to allow separate bedrooms for teenage children to study, couples who face illness and disability and separated
default parents with access to children. It would reduce the numbers facin
defaultg reduced benefi
defaultt by 75%, and focus
default on dealing with ‘problematic’ levels of under-occupation. It would also give landlords the capacity to deal with the significant numbers of elderly tenan
defaultts (exempt from the penalty) who are under-occupying their homes and wish to move. A 
defaultrevised definition 
defaultwo
defaultuld 
defaultreduce the need to rely on inconsistently delivered discretionary assistance (DHP)
default, reduce the risk of tribunal challenge
default and 
defaultend the need for an 
defaultever growing list of 
defaultexemptions. It would introduce a standard which reflects the way low income households live in the 21
defaultst
default century.
default Furthermore, our research suggests that such a change may not result in the loss of savings an
defaultticipated by Government, and
default that
default the basis 
defaultfor the savings already claimed
default requires urgent re-examination
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGive tenants choice about how to manage their benefit by developing an on-line portal, empowering claimants to manage their defaultUCdefault paymentsdefault ‘at source’default similar to on-line banking.default defaultGiven the results of our recent 
defaulttenant 
defaultsu
defaultr
defaultvey, and evidence emerging from
default the direct payment demonstration projects, 
defaultwe are very concerned abo
defaultut the extent
default of support that will be required to enable tenants to manage
default UC
default, and in particular the direct 
defaultpayment of the housing cost element
default.
default We fear that the sheer volume of claimants seeking payment exceptions, or being forced into ‘switchback’ arrangements because of accumulating arrears, will overwhelm the administration of UC.
default 
defaultWe recommend that
default tenants
default a
defaultre given
default real choice 
defaultand appropriate tools 
defaultto
default manage their housing payments under UC
default, which reflect the way in which low income households manage money
default. W
defaulte
default 
defaultstrongly
default commend the ‘Budgeting Portal’ 
defaultproposal 
defaultmade
default by the Social Market Foundation
default, which would 
defaultsit alongs
defaultide the normal claims process under
default Universal Credit.
default The portal 
defaultwould enable claimants to manage their Universal Credit ‘at source’
default through an online tool
default, and direct regular electronic payments to their landlord, child-care provider etc. withou
defaultt the need for the development of
default new, expensive banking products.
default defaultIt 
defaultwould enable financial ownership and responsibility by claimants, whilst giving landlords increased rent certainty
default and a real incentive to support tenants develop their financial capacit
defaulty and digital skills.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGive clarity about the position of vulnerable tenants living in supported housing under Universal Credit. defaultDespite encouraging
default comments from Ministers, there is still uncertainty
default about the way in which housing cost support
default for vulnerable tenants living in supported housing will be dealt with following the introduction of UC. In particular urgent 
defaultclarity
default is required
default on the definition of ‘exempt accommodation’ to ensure that
default support for
default all legitimate suppor
defaultted housing tenanc
defaulties can be
default dealt with outside UC (for not-for-profit providers)
default, including 
defaultcases where 
defaultsupport 
defaultservices are delivered by a third party
default. 
defaultThere also needs to be consultation on the detail
defaults
default of any

default for

default 
defaultlocalisation of 
defaultsupport for housing c
defaultosts
default, ensuring it is based on a system of entitlement, rathe
