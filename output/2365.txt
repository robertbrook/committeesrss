[[[nstitution of Engineering and Technology (IET (GSH0008)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; IET members’  involvement, both externally and internally, with some studies suggests that:(a)              there is reluctance to consider commissioning work at the horizon because of the perceived lack of detail especially on costs and timing;(b)              what can be seen at the horizon is too easily ridiculed by cynics or the media, so studies tend to be launched somewhat later and are thus on issues that have already appeared over the horizon; and(c)              successful adoption and utilisation of a study depends on the extent to which the work was locked in to internal strategic thinking and option analysis and also the degree to which there was a political involvement either directly or via Special Advisers.In our experience, many Departments are less than enthusiastic about publicising their Horizon Scanning / Foresight studies.&#xa0;1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; The best examples have been when Departmental stakeholders appoint champions from the Civil Service to push forward the studies and have an enthusiastic Minister who endorses it, for example the Foresight “Intelligent Infrastructure Futures” study that reported in 2006 had this in terms of a Departmental lead from DfT and an interested Minister (Dr Stephen Ladyman).&#xa0;1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; The definitive response to this question needs to come from Departments’ setting out their policies and practices.  &#xa0;&#xa0;2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; It is very difficult to address this question from an external perspective; it is surely more productive to ask Departments to specify the studies they have been involved in over the last 7–10 years, and to report on what actions were taken as a consequence. An alternative way to get a good answer would be to poll 100 experts who have been involved in studies to ask if they can see any changes 18 months or so after they completed their work.&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; People who have been involved in Foresight reviews have noted the additional vigour regarding follow-up and regular post hoc monitoring when a Minister has been involved as Principal Client.  There has been very uneven practice regarding publicity and the opportunity for open debate on studies and their findings.  Indeed, the allegation that for many studies the analytic community has enjoyed the chase rather than the capture is probably correct.  The Committee might find it useful to review the short-term and long-term reviews of many of the Foresight projects to determine the impact of the work.&#xa0;3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; There are a number of perceived shortcomings with the current position and it is not clear that the Day Review has recognised them, let alone addressed them.  The recommendations of the review seem to concentrate almost exclusively on the commissioning and governance processes.  Governance is at best of academic interest and the problem with commissioning is the apparent reluctance to act at a very early stage.  To be effective, horizon scanning genuinely has to operate at the horizon and look forward; not wait until issues are visible and beginning to smoulder.&#xa0;3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; But perhaps the weakest elements of the review are implementation and follow-up.  The interpretation of senior customers as Permanent Secretaries et al is too narrow and there is no mention of the need to link horizon scanning to the work of the Technology Strategy Board.  There is also a gap regarding the non-public sector –  the delivery of policy for many Departments (Health, Defence, Transport for example) rests heavily on public and private industry and it would seem sensible to expand the membership of both the CSAG and HSOG to reflect this.&#xa0;3.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; The 2010 Science and Engineering Assurance Review (SEA) of how the DfT used science and engineering evidence in its policy making showed that there were some significant dysfunctional disconnects in this process that would inhibit horizon scanning and subsequent strategic policy making.&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; It is very difficult to address this question from an external perspective; it is surely more productive to ask Departments or the Cabinet Office?

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; See also response to Q1.  Government has frequently been too slow and too private, not least because Chief Scientific Advisers are only loosely tied in to top level strategy and planning in many Departments. There is a general flaw within Departments of having too few external advisory bodies.  These tend to be relatively informal bodies operating at about Deputy Director level, discussing technology movements, industry trends and scientific developments and thus acting as the very early detectors of issues where a more structured approach would be justified.  There are particular problems in Transport where the fact that delivery rests with Local Authorities and Industry has been seen as a reason to justify too much inactivity regarding tactical technology thinking.&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
