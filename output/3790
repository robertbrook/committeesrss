defaultSubmission from Donald Neamedefault&#xa0;defaultPdefaultlanning applicationdefaultsdefault BE/default42/10 and BE/default151/11default&#xa0;defaultI 
defaultam writing to you regarding the above planning applications and my (and other residents’ long-standing battle to show that the approval of these applications were wrong – and
default, I believe, 
defaultfraudulent).
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Local Government Ombudsman
default’s
default steadfast refusal to investigate these matters has caused me significant financial loss, health problems and a degradation of my standard of living. I am requesting you 
defaultinvestigate this matter.
default&#xa0;
defaultI attach background to the applications
default for your information, but the crux of the issue is the Ombudsman’s incredibly poor decision-making and judgement
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Local Government Ombudsmandefault’s conduct re BE/42/10default defaultI complained about the actions of the 
defaultplanning 
defaultdepartment
default to the Council. They 
defaultinvestigated but never concluded a report and what little investigation was done was woeful, inconsistent and avoided responding to the issues.
default I complained to t
defaulthe Local Government Ombudsman. She
default decided that 
defaults
defaulthe would not i
defaultnvestigate as I had not suffered any injustice. In coming to this conclusion the Ombudsman decided that:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Ombudsman made it clear that although the caravan park joined my property, because my house was some 70m away at the other end of the
default garden, there was no detriment to me. I find this unfair. My home is in a conservation area. The end of my garden used to look out to beautiful views of the Downs
default and I used to enjoy sitting in my garden
default. The Ombudsman tells me I have no right to a view. 
defaultWhether I have a right or not, 
defaultI do believe I have the right to the quiet enjoyment of my garden which has been severely limited and so 
defaultI have suffered significant injustice.
default&#xa0;
defaultI asked the Ombudsman why 
defaults
defaulthe thought there was screening of the site from my ga
defaultrden and 
defaults
defaulthe said he had looked at Google maps. I sent him a photo of the ‘view’ clearly showing no such screening.
default I find it quite bizarre that the Ombudsman will not believe my word, but will accept what he or she thinks she sees on an out of date, fuzzy map.
default&#xa0;
defaultI 
defaultalso 
defaultpointed out that the Ombudsman had 
defaultmade up 
defaultmade 
defaultup 
defaultthis road 
defaultthat carried traffic away from my house 
default– the Ombudsman admitted he had
default made 
defaulta 
defaultmistake when looking at Google maps and would reconsider the decision. The Ombudsman 
defaultthen 
defaultissued another decision, 
defaultagain decid
defaulting
default not to investigate 
defaulton the basis that whilst the traffic would 
defaultindeed 
defaulthave to go past my
default house, the road was a busy one, linking two A roads together. I pointed out that the Ombudsman had again made up this ‘fact’ and 
defaultmisread google maps and 
defaultthat my road did not join t
defaultw
defaulto A roads. I also told the Ombudsman that the developer had told my childr
defaulten not to ride in the road as 
defaultthe road was 
defaultnow too dangerous – one would have thought another injustice. I also said I disagreed with the principle that there had to be an injustice to me for the Ombudsman to investigate
default. In my opinion whether there is inj
defaultustice or not, the Ombudsman should have the power to investigate allegations of a serious nature, which, in this case, includes planning officers providing false information
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Ombudsman continued to refuse to 
defaultaccept that my road did not join two A roads, and refused to 
defaultinvestigate
default. In 
defaultaddition 
defaultthe Ombudsman 
defaultclaimed that 
defaults
defaulthe was 
defaultlegally preventeddefault from investigating a case where there was no 
defaultpersonal significant 
defaultinjustice.
default&#xa0;
defaultI wrote to the Ombudsman 
default(Ms Seez) 
defaulthers
defaultelf to put the key points to her. She responded by saying:
default1. My road links t
defaultw
defaulto A roads and therefore the additional traffic was insignificant (can I repeat that this is simply untrue – my road is a dead end road and the caravan park is adding considerably to the traffic. I object most strongly to the Ombudsman 
defaulteffectively 
defaultcalling m
defaulte a liar
default)
default.
default2. She agreed with her officers – that she was legally prevented from investigating a
defaultny
default case where there was no injustice
default “primary legislation that forbids the Ombudsman to review actions if they do not cause a significant injustice on the compl
defaultainant
default.
default”
default3. She would entertain no more correspondence.
default&#xa0;
defaultNot only has the Ombudsman got her facts wrong regarding the roads, she is also unacquainted with the legislation that covers her organisation. There is NO legislation that prevents her from 
defaultinvestig
defaultating wrongdoing if there is no perceived injustice. There 
defaultis 
defaultcase law that says that she can decide what she investigates, but this is completely different. I
defaultf
default the Ombudsman is using this as the reason for not investigating, she must then answer properly 
defaultfor 
defaultfailing to use 
defaulther powers to not investigate a case where officers have clearly abused their positions of authority
default and not blame the legislation for preventing her from taking action
default. It beggars belief that the Ombudsman does not know this distinction
default.
default Common sense would tell you that this cannot be right. If the Council is guilty of maladministration that causes £400,000 of loss then each resident is ‘losing’ only £1 (if there are 400,000 residents) – 
defaultthe 
defaultlaw 
defaultdoes not 
defaultforbid the Ombudsman to investiga
defaultte such a case.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn reading other complainants’ blogs and correspondence on websites 
defaultI know I am not the first to come across the 
defaultOmbudsman
default’s 
defaultalmost pathological desire not to apologise and to blame the law on not being able to investigate serious cases o
defaultf maladministration.
default&#xa0;
defaultI would like clarity on a) why Ms Seedefaultxdefault did not believe my clear direction that my road does NOT link two A roads and b) whether the defaultcommittee defaultagrees defaultwith defaultMs Seedefaultxdefault defaultthat she defaultis prevented by defaultprimary defaultlegislation defaultfrom defaultinvestigatdefaulting any defaultmatters of maladministrationdefault if there is no significant cause of injustice on the complainantdefault.default&#xa0;
defaultThe Local Government Ombudsman’s conduct re BE/default151default/1default1default defaultFollowing the inaction of the Ombudsman re BE/42/10, the developer ignored all the planning conditions s
defaultet out, extended the site without planning permission, built new buildings, placed the caravan sites closer to people’s gardens 
defaultand generally did whatever he wanted
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe developer applied again BE/151/11 – trying to get retrospective permission for all th
defaulte 
defaultdevelopments and trying to put right the quite appalling mistakes on BE/42/10. The 
defaultapplication was meant to put them right, but it didn’t. For instance I told the council that the land was wrongly delineated, that there was a new road that had been built
default – both of which they denied, but both of which have been proved to be correct as the developer has recently put in a third application!
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultI complained once again to the council – who failed to 
defaultproperly investigate or 
defaultprovide a report. In fact, after corre
defaultsponding for some time with the
default council and 
defaultgiving them a final warning (I think after 6 months) that I wanted the response, they admitted that they couldn’t 
defaulteven 
defaultfind my complaint. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI complained 
defaultto the Ombudsman about the handling of BE/151/11. The 
defaultOmbudsman again rejected my claim
default. She claimed the main points on why it was rejected w
defaultere
default because
default:
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultI hope you can feel my frustration. The basis of the original Ombudsman’s rejection of my request for an investigation is almost entirely based on the false premise that 
defaultmy lane is a link road – despite my repeated denials t
defaulthat this is the case.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultI 
defaultwrote to the 
defaultOmbuds
defaultman to point out all the differences in BE/151/11
default and to argue again that she had got her facts 
defaultwrong
default. I copy my letter and the Ombudsman’s response. I have tabularised the po
defaultints in the two letters in order to
default add comment.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy complaintdefaultThe Ombudsman’s responsedefaultMy commentdefault1. I asked for the primary legislation reference which states that the Ombudsman is prevented from investigating matters where there is not significant personal injustice
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQuotes S26(1) of the Local Government Act which gives the Ombudsman the power to investigate complaints of ‘...injustice in consequence of maladministration...’. States that it follows that there must be some personal injustice. 
defaultThis legislation gives the
default power to investigate 
default– not 
defaultto not investigate – it is being abused by the Ombudsman
default and I would like the
default Select Committee
default to make this clear to the LGO
default.
default2. 
defaultI asked why the Ombudsman 
defaultdecided that the risk of someone dying on the dual carriageway was not a
default ‘material risk that could be directly attributed to the council’s decision’. I said it was
default known that the lane floods
default, 
defaultthe council knows that cars park there if they cannot get up the lane
default, and 
defaulta young man was recently killed at the very spot where people
default park
default&#xa0;
defaultI 
defaultalso comp
defaultlained that the development has caused power cuts thus preventing me from working 
default(and a loss of income since I work as a contractor) 
defaultand causing inconvenience
default to my family
default. I was told by the Ombudsman that this could not have been for
defaulte
defaultse
defaulten by the council.
default I asked for the legislation that says that issues unforeseen by the council cannot be used to show significant injustice. 
default 
defaultThe Ombudsman replies that 
defaultthere is not a sufficiently close connection between the council’s actions and the pos
defaultsibility that people may park on the road if and when it floods.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ombudsman claims that there is no legislation but that she is using her judgement and discretion to investigate or not investigate.
defaultThis is ridiculous. I am being called a 
defaultliar 
defaultagain. It is a fact that people park on the road when the lane floods – which is very regularly!
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis argument is based on a false premise. The ombudsman firstly claimed that the inconvenience could not have been foreseen
default and therefore it was irr
defaultelevant
default. Now
default, given that she cannot provide any legislative evidence
default she is claiming that she used her general discretion to determine whether she should investigate
default and found there was no significant injustice
default.
default&#xa0;
default Whether the council could have for
defaulte
defaultseen th
defaulte cutting of the electric cables is irrelevant and cannot be used as an argument under any legislation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ombudsman only had authority to determine whether there was any injustice to me – which there was.
default She has changed her argument. I have lost hundr
defaulteds of pounds in lost income due to the electricity cuts – in this time of austerity, that’s a lot of money. Given that the Ombudsman refuses to tell me what would be a ‘significant injustice’, I would be grateful if the committee would let me know how muc
defaulth loss I would have to have for the Ombudsman to consider it significant.
default3. I said the Information Commissioner has told me that he is only responsible for ensuring the authority provides the information requested 
defaultnot whether this is correct and that I 
defaultneed to take my complaint up with the LGO if I think I have been deceived
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, the ICO says he is not responsible for any consequences to the complainant regarding the lack of providing information. The council’s failure to provide me with inform
defaultation (and then providing me with false 
defaultinformation) meant that I was unable to prepare the appropriate judicial review case that I would have been able to had I been provided with the information.  
defaultThe ombudsman 
defaultoriginally said that this was a matter for
default the 
defaultICO
default and so she would not investigate.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ombudsman 
defaulthas 
defaultnow changed her argument and says that she does not consider significant personal injustice has been done.
defaultQuite apart from the many hours I have wasted in trying to obtain evidence from the cou
defaultncil (which all costs me loss of income), I cannot for the life of me understand why 
defaulta) 
defaultthe Ombudsman considers that
default providing false information to the ICO is not worthy of investigation and b) why withholding evidence so that I am unable to present it to 
defaultthe court is 
defaultanythin
defaultg but significant i
defaultnjustice.
default 
default4. 
defaultI complained about dumping (and burying) of potentially toxic rubbish on grade 1 agricultural land next to my garden. I complained a number of times with no sensible response from the council. 
defaultThe ICO said that I hadn’t used the council’s formal complaints procedure and she would therefore not investigate but write to the council. 
defaultI hadn’t used the council’s formal complaints procedure as doing so previously had cost me hundreds of pounds of lo
defaultst income, hundreds of hours of lost time with NO final report ever being produced. 
default&#xa0;
defaultGuess what, since the Ombudsman wrote to the council
default (in July)
default the council wrote me (and presumably copied in the Ombudsman) a very nice letter saying how concerned they 
defaultwere about these serious allegations and they would investigate thoroughly and properly and get back to me.
default Have I heard anything since? Of course not. Does the 
defaultcommittee t
defaulthink 
default(like I do) that 
defaultthe Local Government Ombudsman is 
defaultsimply encouraging bad pract
defaultice amongst councils.
default5. I 
defaultcomplained that the council had not responded to my complaints. 
defaultThe Ombudsman’s provisional statement simply dismisses my complaint saying there has been no significant injustice so whether the council can be bothered to investigate my complaint or not is immaterial.  
defaultAgain, I would appreciate the 
defaultcommittee’s 
defaultview on 
defaultwhether the LGO is serving the public well.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have not made serial complaints. I have made a few, serious complaints. The one complaint that has been decided upon (by the ICO) judged that the council had failed on a number of counts.
default The council has faile
defaultd to investigate any complaint and the Ombudsman has failed to investigate any complaint.
default&#xa0;
defaultI spent hours drafting the complaints, providing evidence that the council had got things wrong etc. Common sense tells you that this is a council which has lost tou
defaultch with reality, treats its taxpayers with utter disdain and should be investigated – injustice to me or not.
default6.
default I 
defaultmad
defaulte a number of points to the Ombudsman (most of which have been previously made but studiously ignored) to support my claim that the 
defaultdevelopment has had a devastating effect on me and my family. For instance
default&#xa0;
defaulta) 
defaultI rectify the Ombudsman’s view says it doesn’t matter that I have lost the view of the Downs. 
defaultI clarify that 
defaultI have regularly said that my point is more than this, it is that th
defaulte development has 
defaulta 
defaultdetrimental effect on t
defaulthe quiet enjoyment of my garden.
default&#xa0;
defaultb)  I 
defaultrestate that the lane in which the caravan site is situated is too small for the traffic and has 
defaultruined my walk up the road to the footpath across the fields and my children
default's ability to ride bicycles in the lane. The developer of the site has told me and my children that the lane is now too dangerous to cycle up. If you proceed with your current decision, please can you provide me with your assessment as to why not being abl
defaulte to use the lane for walking or cycling is not considered to be not a significant injustice to me – from my point of view I expect to be able to enjoy the countryside in which I live.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultc) I 
defaultpoint out the O
defaultmbudsman
default is yet again basing the argument on a fictitious geography of the area regarding the roads.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI ask for the Ombudsman’s 
defaultassessment of what percentage increase of traffic 
defaultshe 
defaultconsider
defaults
default significant.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultd) I spent £6,000 
defaulton legal fees on a judicial 
defaultreview which was 
defaultnot heard by the courts
default. This a) shows the sense of injustice (and I believe it to be real) and b) shows my ‘loss’
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaulte) I noted th
defaulte time I spent
default reminding the council of its duty (e.g. to ensure the developer actually complies with the conditions)
default and other points that they would otherwise have ignored.
default This has meant that I 
defaulttook 
defaulttime off work to write letters and STILL almost none of the conditio
defaultns have been met even though the timeframes have long since expired. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPlease can I have your assessment as to how much time and loss of earnings I have to suffer before you consider I have suffered a significant amount.
default&#xa0;
defaultf) My health has suffered through 
defaulta combination of residents (friends) leaving (they have sold up due to the injustices caused), due to the council’s lack of action (not responding to letters, not completing investigations, providing false information etc). 
default&#xa0;
defaultPlease can I have your assessm
defaultent as to what is considered an injustice – I am happy to provide various letters of support if required.
default&#xa0;
defaultI offered to buy the field and run it as an agricultural business. Officers told councillors that the land 
defaultcould not be used for agricultural purpose
defaults despite the land being grade 1 and having an offer from me to buy it and use it as farmland
default. They support this claim by stating they had asked Langmeads (the biggest farmer in the area) if they wanted the land. Aside from the fact that the Council has re
defaultfused to back up this statement with any evidence – 
default(
defaultwhich is now subject to a complaint to the ICO), this is not how planning law works. This is allowing unfair trading. By failing to state that they were in possession of a letter from me 
defaultthat I would lik
defaulte to buy the land and by failing to take the view that the land could be used as agricultural land by someone other than Langmeads, I have suffered injustice. I could have run a thriving business which I am sure would have worked wonders for my health and 
defaultwell-being. That opportunity has been denied me.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst I understand that the Ombudsman, by law, needs to exercise judgement, that judgement should be based on common sense and facts.This view from the ombudsman follows on from her arguing for the past year that a) there was a northern road out of the ca
defaultravan site – which was untrue b) that the road outside my house was a link road (which was untrue) and c) that my garden was screened from the caravan park by trees (untrue) ie. from a very bad interpretation of google maps. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn the side of fact it is
default imp
defaultortant to note that:
default&#xa0;
defaultI earnestly re
defaultquest the 
defaultcommittee 
defaultgive
defaults
default a view as to whether the LGO is properly exercising its responsibilities. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIncredible. After two years of telling the Ombudsman that basing her decision that no injustice has been done, on the ‘fact’ that my lane links to A roads
default the Ombudsman finally, finally, finally... just removes the statements. No apology, no recognition that I may be right, no admission that the Ombudsman has been wrong. Simply removal of really key points – and then a statement saying that that they do not
default affect her reasoning anyway. I am sorry, but I hope you can see why my health has suffered under the breathtaking stance taken by the Ombudsman.
default&#xa0;
defaultI cannot see what business it is of the Ombudsman to know my legal 
defaultadvice. Nor do I see the relevance. The po
defaultint is, has this decision by the council brought about significant injustice.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe point I made was that I was spending time and losing income in ensuring the council did what it was supposed to do. I would like the
default committee’s view 
defaultas to whether the LGO 
defaultis simply allowed to dismiss any loss of income in such a cavalier fashion.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI think the Ombudsman has a duty to consider all the evidence I provide
default and respond to my valid queries.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is outrageous that the Ombudsman hasn’t bothered to consider this issue. The grade 1 farming land
default adjoins my own. I offered to buy the land well above grade 1 farming land price. The council reported to councillors that the land could not be used as farming land 
defaultand denied the existence of a
default letter from me offering to buy it. I cannot see how this is 
defaultnot a significant injustice. It denied me the potential opportunity to enter negotiations with the landowner. I can’t see how denying me the right to run a business is not a significant injustice.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAs you can see from the above commentary, I think the 
defaultOmbudsman is guilty of a dereliction of duty.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Ombudsman’s final decision notice.default&#xa0;
default1. In deciding that she would not investigate my 
default2
defaultnd
default 
defaultcomplaint
default (re BE/151/11)
default, the ombudsman cites two reasons:
default&#xa0;
defaulta) that 
default‘the ombudsman cannot look
default into a complaint once court action has commenced.’ I do not believe this is true. The legislation (local government act 1974, s26 para 6) says that “a
default Local Commissioner shall not conduct an investigation under this Part of this Act in respect of any of t
defaulthe following matters, that is to say... 
default(c) any action in respect of which the person aggrieved has or had a remedy by way of proceedings in any court of law. Provided that a Local Commissioner may conduct an investigation notwithstanding the existence of 
defaultsuch a right or remedy if satisfied that in the particular circumstances it is not reasonable to expect the person aggrieved to resort or have resorted to it.
default”
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultFirstly, i
defaultn this instance I only resorted to requesting a judicial review as the LGO had refus
defaulted to investigate the original request for assistance in dealing with the matter
default – if the LGO had performed her duty the JR would not have been necessary
default. 
defaultSecondly, I was unable to exercise my right as, having lodged the request for a judicial review, it b
defaultecame clear that I was unable to fund even a commentary on the Council’s defence. Therefore it was not reasonable for me to pursue the JR and I did not have a remedy in a court of law. In addition, 
defaultthe council with
defaultheld
default information
default necessary for a judicial 
defaultreview
default. This was finally extracted by the ICO just a couple of days after the judge decided not to hear the case. In refusing a JR the judge made it clear that he
default did so ’given the realities following the grant of the fourth application’. This 
defaultwould 
defaulthave b
defaulteen very different had the LGO been prepared to investigate the planning. I am a basic rate taxpayer and spent £6,000 on a very basic application. I was simply unable to afford further rebutting of the council’s 
defaultuntrue 
defaultdefence. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMy application was turned 
defaultdown. There was no judicial review. I do not believe I have been able to properly resort to 
default‘
defaultproceedings in a court of law
default’
default. 
defaultI
default was 
defaultnot afforded the opportunity 
defaultto present a wealth of evidence which I presented to the Ombudsman – which she dismissed as not ‘significantly different from the issues before the court’. I 
defaultjust 
defaultdo not agree. The 
defaultcourt 
defaultwas not presented with the evidence that the land was in fact grade 1
default agricultural land, and therefore afforded special protection. The court did not see the evidence that the council had 
defaultdenied the existence of a letter from me offering to buy the land
default. The 
defaultcourt 
defaultdid not hear evidence of how the council had failed to compl
defaulty with the directions of HM Planning Inspectorate
default nor see the pictures of farmland that the council insists is ‘built up’
default. I believe the Ombudsman did not take these 
default(and other) 
defaultfacts into account in any way.
default&#xa0;
defaultb) The Ombudsman’s previous decision not to i
defaultnvestigate the first planning application – a decision I have shown above, to be based on false premises. Bizarrely, whilst the 2
defaultnd
default decision eventually removes the reliance of the Ombudsman on the existence (untrue) of a link road, the 1
defaultst
default decision still c
defaultontains this premise – and therefore is clearly a 
default‘
defaultbad
default’
default decision.
default&#xa0;
defaultI hope you can appreciate the distress this issue has, and continues to cause, myself and my family and request 
defaultyour 
defaultinvolvement.
default I would be very happy to present my grievances to the commi
defaultttee in person if this would be helpful.
