default1. The latest version of the HS2 Economic Case published at the end of October 2013 still contains faults 
defaultsome of 
defaultwhich have been pointed out in earlier versions. 
defaultSome other shortcomings are detailed too.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2. My recommendation is to cancel HS2 now. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOverstated Benefitsdefault&#xa0;
default3. 
defaultThe economic case still uses
default the basis that people do not work on trains and therefore any journey time saving results in added work (productivity). While
default the value of time has been changed, the principle that a shorter journey time leads to more worker output has not changed. 
defaultIt is well known that many people work on trains whether using a laptop, iPad, smartphone or simply reading documents. To continue t
defaulto ignore what happens in the real world is absurd.
default&#xa0;
default4. 
defaultPreviously the Department for Transport had anticipated that about 30% of HS2 passengers would be on business. National Passenger Surveys have regularly reported a similar proportion of business travellers on intercity routes on the West Coast Mainline (WC
defaultML), Midland Mainline (MML) and East Coast Mainline (ECML).

default5. 
defaultThe latest HS2 economic case now anticipates a much higher proportion of business travellers than previously, e.g. 66% for London Manchester. Such a high proportion of business travellers 
defaultis no longer in line with National Passenger Surveys.
default&#xa0;
default6. 
defaultThe HS2 economic case for HS2 is still calculated on the basis that passenger 
defaultticket prices will carry no premium over those for classic rail journeys. This lack of premium ticket pricing in the DfT’s HS2 passenger demand modelling was strongly challeng
defaulted by the Public Accounts Committee in 2012.

default and their answers.
default7. 
defaultCurrently there is a 20% ticket price premium for Ashford to London travellers on HS1 compared to a classic rail journey. In Europe, the ticket price premium is typically 70%. Recently the Secretary of State for Transport was quoted 
defaultas saying 
defaultin the context of HS2, 
default“
defaultIf you turn up at the last minute, you are going to be paying a lot of money.”

default9. Ticket pricing does have an effect on demand, and to construct a HS2 passenger forecast without a price premium l
defaulteads to overs
defaulttated level of passenger demand.
default&#xa0;
default10. 
defaultAll of the factors listed above result in a grossly overstated amount of 
defaultbenefits. Independent bodies
default suggest a realistic be
defaultnefit cost ratio for HS2 is 0.5, i.e. 50p back for every £1 spent.
default 
defaultThat would be 
defaultunsatisfactory by Treasury rules as well as being an irresponsible use of taxpayers’ money.
default&#xa0;
defaultDesigned in Bottleneckdefault&#xa0;
default11. 
defaultMany of the main 
defaultrail 
defaultlines serving London are close to the maximum number of train paths that they can accommodate at peak times. 
defaultUltr
defaulta high speed trains require g
defaultreater stopping distances than
default classic trains as a result of their greater kinetic energy. So an ultra high speed line can accommodate fewer trains per hour than a classic line. The UIC (International Union of Railways) has indicated that it is not safe to run more than 16 trains per h
defaultour at 350 kph. 
defaultSee Figure 2
defaulthttp://www.greengauge21.net/wp-content/uploads/Final-Report-Appendices-B-J.pdf
default&#xa0;
default12. The indicative schedule for HS2 phase two shows
default 16 trains per hour planned for the Birmingham Interchange to 
defaultthe junction for the 
defaultHeathrow spur section of the route. See figure 6-2 in PFMv4.3 Assumptions Report. 
defaulthttp://assets.hs2.org.uk/sites/default/files/inserts/S%26A%2020_PFM%20assumptions%20report.pdf
default13. 
defaultIn addition
default there are tentatively two trains
default 
defaultper hour to serve Heathrow. Lastly there are two more trains per hour to link with HS1 and 
defaultpresumably these go further north than Heathrow; this is in addition to the Old Oak Common service to HS1 service. So this shows that up to t
defaultwenty trains per hour are intended on a 
defaultsection of 
defaultline that can
default safely handle 
defaultonly 
default16 trains per hour. In other wo
defaultrds there is an intention to spend £50 billion on a line that has no room for expansion s

defaultThe Victorians had considerably more foresight.

default19. Euston had just 2,821 standing passengers and the majority of 
defaultthese were on London Overground and London Midland trains. Virgin Trains carry just 2% of national rail passengers. So why build an ultra high speed intercity line serving the North West when its trains are s

defaultDisrupdefaulttion effectsdefault&#xa0;
default20. While being ready to criticise alternatives to HS2 due to the disruption that they will supposedly cause, the DfT has not indicated how much disruption will be caused by the construction of HS2 itself.
default&#xa0;
default21. The building of HS2 will cause 
defaultvery 
defaultsevere disruption at Euston for approximately 9 years. It is likely that Euston station will be closed for some weekends and for some bank holiday periods. The number of platforms serving classic rail will be permanently reduced from 18 to 13 and the 
defaultnumber of approach tracks from 6 to 4. This will almost certainly reduce the peak time capacity o
defaultf Euston on a permanent basis (for classic trains).

default.co.uk/news/2013/04/19-hs2-set-to-abandon-complete.html
default&#xa0;
default22. There will be severe disruption in Camden. This will affect London Overground services which carry 25,000 passengers daily. It will also affect freight operations on the most important cross L
defaultondon freight route. It will also cause traffic chaos and se
defaultriously impact Camden Market. HS2
default will also have effects on the 
defaultexisting 
defaultrail network where it joins other routes such as at north of St Pancras (HS1), Old Oak Common, north of Lichfield, Crewe, n
defaultear Wigan, Toton and Church Fenton. 
default&#xa0;
default23. 
defaultIn addition HS2’s
default construction will affect road users for an extended period with the need to cross the M1 (6
default 
defaulttimes), M42 (6 times), M56 (3 times), M6 (3 times) and M62 (2 times) as well as 47 crossings of trunk ro
defaultads.
default To bring about its construction, many large trucks will be using any roads from motorways to narrow country lanes for several years.

default&#xa0;
default24. By contrast the 51M Optimised Alternative which does meet the DfT’s forecast passenger growth requirements 
default(through an increase of standard class capac
defaultity on each train) 
defaultwould need work at just three points on the WCML. Grade separated junctions 
defaultwould need to be built 
defaultat Ledburn and Colwich, and laying of additional track to increase freight capacity between Rugby and 
defaultNuneaton. For the latter, weekend se
defaultrvices could be diverted via other rail routes while the work is undertaken. 
defaultThe 51M Optimised Alternative requires no disruption at Euston, Camden or the other places which will be affected by the construction of HS2. 
defaultTalk of 14 years of weekend working i
defaults nothing other than unfounded scaremongering. A journalist can see through that deception.

defaultIt has been estimated that HS2 will provide an extra 10,000 passengers per hour into the Underground network at Euston in addition to the existing 7000 per hour at peak periods. Source: Section 3.6, (page 20) HS2 Ltd Route Engineering Report.  
default(This appea

default26. 
defaultAs is well known, the Underground is another British railway system that is very short of capacity at peak times. To more than double the demand at Euston without providing add
defaultitional Underground capacity is unworkable. As Transport for London has pointed out, it will require the building of Crossrail 2.
default This has not been included in the HS2 budget.

defaultJapan was the pioneer of high speed rail in the 1960s but within two decades had accumulated massive debts. The system was privatised and the $280 billion debt was transferred to 
defaultthe taxpayer and is still being paid off. Apparently four of the seven operators are still government owned, and it is thought that the privately owned operators receive concessionary usage fees. In addition, the three private operators receive another $2 
defaultbillion annually from the government. These subsidises are needed despite Japan having the highest rate of rail use in the developed world.

defaultThe French accounting system treats taxpayer subsidies as “commercial revenues”. So the French programme’s $1
default.75 billion “profit” occurs through a $10 billion annual subsidy according to a study by Amtrak in 2008. The national rail infrastructure assets were transferred to 
defaultRéseau Ferré de France (RFF) in 1997. Between RFF and SNCF there was an accumulated debt of
default €38 billion from building lines for the TGV by 2011. To deal with this debt, RFF is expected to increase track fees by 40% between 2008 and 2012 to reduce this debt. SNCF has threatened to cancel low ridership routes and has indicated that its reduced pro
defaultfitability will make it impossible to renew its 1981 fleet of TGVs before 2020. TGV fares are being increased by more than twice the rate of inflation and in some cases even more.

defaultAdverse effect on classic raildefault&#xa0;default36. 
defaultThe president of
default the SNCF, Guillaume Pépy thought that France wa
defaults going too fast in its further construction of high speed lines. TGV fares have increased by 100% in the last decade compared to about 30% for car travel. Pépy went on to say: 
defaultThe whole basis of the high-speed rail revolution – that the TGV should be the 
default"normal" means of travel, not just something affordable by the business elite – is under threat. 
defaultThe SNCF president also described the state railways as: 
defaultDecaying... facing a financial impasse... and heading for the wall. 
defaultHe should know better than most.

default38. While significant spending 
defaultfor rail 
defaultis planned 
defaultin the UK 
defaultfor Control Period 5 (2014 – 19), there is nothing to say that such a level of spending is affordable on an ongoing basis alongside HS2. It should not be forgotten that our classic rail will continue to transport most of our rail passengers; such
default lines need regular maintenance and many parts of the country seek further enhancements e.g. electrification from Bristol to the South West.

default40. 
defaultI believe HS2 will not address the most pressing issue of o
defaultvercrowded commuter trains to the south and east of London. If the Government is determined to increase the capacity for users of the West Coast Main Line, then it should adopt the 51M Optimised Alternative which is far cheaper
default, can be introduced much soon
defaulter and with less disruption than HS2. There is no logical basis for spending £50 (+) billion to supplement the capacity of a line which carries 
defaultjust 
default2% of our rail passengers and does not have the standing passenger issues which ma
defaultny other lines have. How 
defaultwill HS2
default be helping the other 98% of rail travellers? HS2 is a totally ill conceived project and many people have not even studied the finer details.
default If they did, they would understand its many
