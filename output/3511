[normal]Dart Energy (Europe) Ltd via 
[normal]subsidiaries,
[normal] GP Energy Ltd and Dart Energy (West England) Ltd
[normal],
[normal] hold a 75% interest in 6 contiguous petroleum exploration and development licen
[normal]s
[normal]es (PEDL) which straddle the Wales-England border 
[normal]around Wrexham and a 100% interest in further licen
[normal]s
[normal]e in the South Wales Coalfield near Swansea.  All seven of these licen
[normal]s
[normal]es are considered to have significant unconventional resource potential in the form of coal bed methane, shale gas and potentially shale oil.

[normal]The importance of gas to the UK’s overall energy needs and the potential role shale gas could play within it;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]              
[normal] 
[normal]All prediction
[normal]s
[normal] indicate that 
[normal]gas will continue to play a significant and increasing role in primary power generation for the 
[normal]forseeable
[normal] future, 
[normal]however 
[normal]the role of natural gas in supporting other UK industries should not be underestimated.  
[normal]A large proportion of the n
[normal]atural gas 
[normal]demand in the UK 
[normal]is
[normal] due to a 
[normal]myriad of industrial applications 
[normal]which cannot be replaced by renewables 
[normal]including
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition to industrial uses outlined above approximately 1/3
[normal]rd
[normal] of UK gas demand is driven by domestic heating and cooking.

[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]The recent uncertainty around the future of the 
[normal]Ineos
[normal] petrochemical facility near 
[normal]Grangemouth
[normal] was in part due to the lack of access to competitively priced feedstock.  This is in
[normal] stark 
[normal]contrast to the US example where lower energy prices and 
[normal]access to 
[normal]cheap ethane 
[normal]feedstocks
[normal] due to 
[normal]the 
[normal]emergence 
[normal]of 
[normal]shale gas
[normal] has seen a major resurgence in
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]US 
[normal]petrochemicals industry

[normal]The potential for shale gas exploration and commercial level extraction in Wales;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]To date the focus has been on the shale gas potential of the Carboniferous 
[normal]Bowland
[normal] and 
[normal]Hodd
[normal]er
[normal] 
[normal]Shales
[normal] and Dart has independe
[normal]ntly certified gas in place best estimates fo
[normal]r the 6 contiguous licens
[normal]es straddling the Welsh-English border of 
[normal]30.4 
[normal]TCF (range 
[normal]11.1
[normal]- 
[normal]52.4 TCF
[normal]).
[normal]  A number of other geological formations present in Wales may also have significant shale gas and/or oil potential including
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]Cambrian 
[normal]Tremadoc
[normal] 
[normal]Shales
[normal] and Silurian shales.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Until the exploration and appraisal testing phases are completed over the coming years it is difficult to estimate what level of commercial development could be achieved.  The commerciality of any particular unconventional resource play is determined by a number of 
[normal]social
[normal], environmental, economic and geological criteria and at this early stag
[normal]e every scenario from zero
[normal] commer
[normal]c
[normal]i
[normal]al production through to the development of a major new industry 
[normal]are still possible outcomes for the unconventional gas industry in the 
[normal]Wales

[normal]The potential environmental and climate change impact of extraction and use of the gas;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Various recent studies by the 
[normal]Royal Society, 
[normal]Royal Academy 
[normal]of Eng
[normal]in
[normal]eering
[normal] and Public Health England 
[normal]have all indicated a well regulated and 
[normal]well 
[normal]executed shale 
[normal]gas 
[normal]operation should 
[normal]not 
[normal]have a 
[normal]significant 
[normal]impact on the environment 
[normal]or public health
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Nearly all the examples of environmental damage used by those opposed 
[normal]to 
[normal]the 
[normal]development of an indigenous 
[normal]unconventional gas industry 
[normal]in the UK 
[normal]can be easily classified into the following groups: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]or 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] UK has
[normal] long history of gas processing, pipeline operation and onshore hydrocarbon drilling
[normal] and production
[normal] demonstrat
[normal]ing 
[normal]that 
[normal]environmental risks associated with these operations 
[normal]can be effectively managed rather 
[normal]than 
[normal]poor environmental performance 
[normal]being a systemic and unavoidable consequence. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]Climate change is a global issue and given 
[normal]that the UK contribution to global greenhouse emissions i
[normal]s
[normal] &lt;1
[normal].7
[normal]% of the global total it is unlikely that, in isolation, any commercial shale production in Wales
[normal],
[normal] or 
[normal]indeed the
[normal] UK
[normal],
[normal] would have a significant impact on 
[normal]g
[normal]lobal 
[normal]climate c
[normal]hange.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]However events over the last few years in the US have shown that low
[normal]er
[normal] gas prices on a continental scale can lead to a shift away from high CO
[normal]2 
[normal]coal fired generation to lower emission gas fired generation with a net benefit in total CO
[normal]2
[normal] output.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6
[normal]              
[normal]Given the presence of prospective shale gas plays being identified on every inhabited continent a simple extrapolation of the US example would suggest that global development of shale gas
[normal],
[normal] in conjunction with renewables and nuclear energy
[normal],
[normal] would displace coal fired power generation and lead to significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades.

[normal]Whether the current regulatory regime covering such activity is adequate;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK has a long history of regulating onshore hydrocarbon exploration and production through the DECC onshore licen
[normal]s
[normal]ing regime, local or minerals planning regime, 
[normal]Coal Authority, 
[normal]Environment Agency or Natural Resource Wales licen
[normal]s
[normal]ing provisions and the Health and Safety Executive. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] current
[normal] regulatory
[normal] regime is considered to provide robust protection to the environment, local communities and workforce
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]Notwithstanding the previous statement 
[normal]there is a considerable amount of duplication both in the information being submitted and the number of public consultations required throughout the 
[normal]planning
[normal] and permitting regime that introduces significant uncertainty, costs and time delays to the well planning process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]              
[normal]A clarification of responsibilities of each of the regulators between surface and sub-surface development and a single application for the permitting of well operations to remove the duplication currently inherent in the permitting system would be of significa
[normal]nt benefit to 
[normal]op
[normal]erators and would speed up the exploration and 
[normal]appraisal
[normal] of the shale resource.

[normal]The potential economic impact of shale gas production in Wales[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]Given very early stages of shale gas exploration and appraisal in Wales with only 
[normal]8.5
[normal]% of the total area of Wales currently licensed for oil and gas exploration it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of future shale gas development
[normal].  A
[normal]s previously stated the range of potential outcomes 
[normal]varies 
[normal]from almost nothing to very significant.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]The US example and recent reports by the Institute of Directors suggest that in the success case the unconventional hydrocarbons industry would benefit the UK, including Wales
[normal],
[normal] due to:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]The exact scale of th
[normal]e benefits would be directly proportional to the eventual scale of the industry in the UK, however given the UK’s leading role in unconventional development the first mover advantage could result in the export of skills, processes and supply chain to others that follow in the European or North African markets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4
[normal]              
[normal]Ignoring effects on gas price on primary energy production the benefits of an increased supply of low cost ethane
[normal],
[normal] via domestic shale gas production
[normal],
[normal] could have game changing effect on the petrochemicals industry.  A 2011 report by the American Chemicals Council modelled the impacts of a 25% increase in ethane availability on the petrochemicals industry in the US and concluded the following:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5
[normal]              
[normal]While no-one is suggesting a direct replication of this in the UK or Wales 
[normal]it does go some way to demonstrating the transformational effect that domestic shale gas could have on one particular sector of the economy.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.0[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T[bold]he role of the Wales Office and the Welsh Government in developing a policy framework for the exploration of shale gas.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]7.1
[normal]              
[normal]The onshore hydrocarbon industry welcomes strong
[normal], consistent and evidence 
[normal]based
[normal] regulation policed by 
[normal]a strong regulator
[normal](s)
[normal] with defined 
[normal]terms of reference
[normal].
[normal]  A clear demarcation between surface
[normal] planning
[normal] and sub-surface regulatory regimes and removal of unnecessary burden in terms of cost and 
[normal]human 
[normal]resources 
[normal]for both regulator(s) and operator through overlapping regulation should be a priority of any government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]              
[normal]Any new policy framework should aim to encourage early exploration activities
[normal] through the removal unnecessary regulatory burdens, provision of clear and consistent guidance and encouraging investment by ensuring a stable fiscal regime during the development of this industry.
