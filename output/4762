defaultThe role of the IPCC
default&#xa0;
defaultIn considering the matter at hand it is crucial 
defaultto appreciate the role of the IPCC, which is set out in “Principles 
defaultgoverning IPCC work”
default.
default “[The IPCC] shall concentrate its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the UN Framework Convention on Cl
defaultimate Change process
default…
defaultThe role of the IPCC is to assess on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change
default, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation. IPCC reports should be neutral with respect to policy…”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese statements make it clear that the IPCC is not an academic scientific defaultorganization defaultand defaultthat it has clear governmental – hencedefault political – input.default  Furthermore its aim is not to investigate the reasons for changes in the climate, but to seek out “human induced climate change” – which presupposes there is such climate change.default&#xa0;defaultAt the end of September the IPCC published versions of 
defaultthe Working Group 1 (WG1) 
defaultreport “
defaultThe Physical Science Basis
default” and the related “
defaultSummary 
defaultfor 
defaultPolicy Makers
default”
default (SPM)
default; the former was prepared by scientists, the latter by a mix of scientists and representatives of governments
default.  The comments here are more often 
defaultmade about the SPM, which is the more widely read document.

defaultThe character of the submissions

defaultThere are

default and two were from organisations that had an obvious commercial interest in promoting anthropogenic climate change (ACC)
default.

defaultA
defaultssessment
default&#xa0;
defaultThe British warmist establishment accepted with few caveats the views expressed by 
defaultthe IPCC, singing from the same hymn sheet:-
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAll 
defaultthe 
defaultsubmissions avoided discussion of, or attempted to finesse the unreliability of models
default 
defaultand consequently none addressed the question of the magnitude of natural variability; all danced around the issue of whether AR5 has sufficiently 
defaultexplained the hiatus in the global surface temperature; none addressed the empirical mea
defaultsurement of climate sensitivity.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn adopting their approach that “all was for the best of all possible worlds”
default re the IPCC’s work
default, the warmists ignored 1) the IPCC’s 
defaultpast promotion of pseudo science such as the “hockey stick” and “Himalayagate”; 2) its past baseless claims of increased hurricanes and the spread of malaria due to ACC; 3) the exposure in Climategate of the unethical practices of a coterie of climate scie
defaultntists involved with the IPCC; 4) its association with the inconvenient inaccuracies promoted by Senator Al Gore; and 5) the various shortcomings of both science and process discussed 
defaultin this submission.  
defaultFrom the sceptic’s perspective they live in a Briti
defaultsh bubble of consensus about settled science that is not disturbed by the reality outside the bubble!
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultsceptic
default scientists included some leading North American 
defaultclimate 
defaultscientists and a physicist of international stature
default, who provides 
defaultthe advantage of an
default independent p
defaulter
defaultspective from the debates that vex climate scientists.
default 
defaultThe main scientific criticisms of AR5 are:-
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe public policy analysts (and some of the 
defaultsceptic
default scientists) 
defaultargue 
defaultthat the IPCC process is not all that it is cracked up to be, notably:-
default&#xa0;

default2.1
default              
defaultDECC
default&#xa0;
defaultDECC
default stated “
defaultthat the conclusions of the AR5 Physical Science Basis report are robust.
default&#xa0;
default The report was produced by over 850 independent expert scientists, all leaders in their fields
default (209 Lead Authors, 50 Review Editors and Over 600 Contributing Authors
default).
default&#xa0;
default The report took over 2 years to produce and underwent multiple rounds of expert review.
default&#xa0;
default It was also reviewed by the 194 governments which form the IPCC.
default&#xa0;
default They have all accepted th
defaulte findings.”
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultDECC c
defaultlaimed “
defaultThe IPCC is a highly effective
default&#xa0;
defaultmechanism for assessing scientific knowledge. It is
default&#xa0;
defaultindependent, transparent and
default&#xa0;
defaultattracts top scientists who give of their own time to participate
default. It has well laid out procedures and is open to
default both expert and Government Review. We see no evidence that it has deliberately sought to justify political commitment or indeed to propose a policy response.
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultDECC has backed down from a previous claim by Secretary of State 
defaultDavey 
defaultthat “the science is set
defaulttled” to
default the more modest claim that
default “much of the climate science may reasonably be considered, in an everyday sense, to be settled…For example…rising concentrations of greenhouse gases (
defaultwhich no one disputes
default),
default 
defaulta warming wo
defaultrld
default (
defaultbut it has not warmed for 16
default or so
default years
default), and related effects such as ice loss (
defaultbut ice in the Antarctic has increased
default) and the sea level has risen (
defaultwhich has continued at the same rate as for several 
defaultcenturies
default).
default&#xa0;
defaultThen it admits “However, the complexities of clouds and various feedb
defaultack
default mechanisms add uncertainties”.
default  
defaultI
defaultt is
default, however,
default not clear whether the reference
defaults
default to feedback mechanisms
default and
default 
defaultis an allusion to the uncertainty over the magnitude of climate sensitivity to the level of CO2
default.  
defaultDECC 
defaultavoided the question of the validation of
default the climate models
default, and of the temperature pause
default.  
defaultIt does not mention 
defaultthe possible effect of the sun on 
defaultthe

defaultissues the submission refers to ignorance of

defaultHe comments “
defaultThe enclosed testimony begins with an examination of the assertions made by many that severe weather events are increasing and are caused by human interference with the climate system.  The evidence shows this is a false claim.  
defaultI then address the IPCC assertion that the warming of the past few decades was caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases, yet the tools used for that assertion, climate models, fail a most simple comparison test with observations of the tropical atmosp
defaulthere
default.  Thus, the models are unable to depict WHAT the climate has done, therefore they are unable to tell us WHY the climate behaved as it did

defaultHe 
defaultneatly 
defaultobserves 
default“…
defaultthe IPCC was written by IPCC-selected scientists
default 
defaultand that the document represents their 
defaultopinions. Many of the conclusions are fine but
default 
defaultsome of the key ones do not represent the views of many in the broader climate
default 
defaultcommunity.
default 
defaultThe headline statement from the 2013 
defaultSummary for Policy Makers 
defaultbaffles me. It reads:-
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is extremely likely that huma
defaultn influence has been the dominant cause of
default 
defaultthe observed warming since the mid-20th century.
default”
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultRegarding the questions the Committee asks I do not consider the conclusions of the AR5 Physical Sciences Report robust – there is extensive scope to question it
defaults conclusions, too many of which are based on climate models which do not reflect reality.
default&#xa0;
default There is also scope to question many aspects of climate science which are far from settled.
default&#xa0;
default As an Expert Reviewer on the most recent AR5, I found the current set o
defaultf Lead Authors unwilling to inform the readers of many of the failings of the models on which the main IPCC conclusions are based
default…T
defaulthe IPCC authors, who have the last word on the material to be included, were selected because they were known to agree with 
defaultthe "consensus" and thus the final product is simply the consensus of those who agree with the consensus.

default Were there any "

default&#xa0;
default No.
default&#xa0;
default In view of its bias and shortcomings, the conclus

default“
defaultThe

defaultThe IPCC expect us to accept that with hundreds of climate models which
default 
defaultdo not match observations and measurements, they are 95% confi
defaultdent that
default 
defaultwarming since 1951 is human caused
default. The global average surface record
default 
defaultonly shows warming in concert with increased CO2 between 1978 -1997.
default  
defaultThat is only 19 of the past 63 years amounting to only 30%. There is

defaulttherefore a 70% chance that CO2 and 
defaultatmospheric warming are not
default 
defaultcorrelated and the claim that warming is human caused can not be

defaultsupported

defaultn order to characterize modern warming as unprecedented the IPCC

defaultsimply evade the eight Holocene warming and cooling cycles

defaultof which our
default 
defaultmodern warming is the last and coolest. Evidence is incontrovertible that

defaultIPPC simply ignore the evidence from

default of the earth…
default 
defaultThe focus by the IPCC on only the last 50 years of

default 
defaulttrying to describe a large richly furnished d

default&#xa0;
defaultIPCC in an effort to preserve credibility have simply written off the Sun
default,
default the
default 
defaultmajor source of our planetary energy
default.
default Because solar output is relatively
default constant
default, IPCC have chosen to ignore a large body of evidence linking

defaultsolar variability with climate which has the support of abundant peer

defaultun, together with

defaultThe worst aspect of the IPCC report is their total disregard of the solar

defaultinfluence 
defaultwe have 
defaultthe most active solar cycles of the 20th Century showing solar maxima 30 to 40% greater than the 19th Century or the first half of the 20th

defaultNicholas Lewis defaultis an independent self-funded 
defaultAmerican 
defaultclimate researcher whose specialism is climate sensitivity.  He points out that 
default“
defaultThere are two principal issues with the IPCC’s handling of the climate sensitivity area
default.
default  
defaultFirstly the inclusion of sensitivity estimates from flawed observational studies tha
defaultt used
default 
defaultunsuitable data, were poorly designed and/or employed inappropriate statistical
default 
defaultmethodology
default. 
default[Lewis is very critical of the poor statistical methodology of climate scientists
default].
default 
defaultTh
defaultat obscured what should have been a key message from AR5 – that the
default 
defaultbe
defaultst observational evidence now points to the climate system being substantially less
default 
defaultsensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought. Secondly, the elevation of computer
default 
defaultmodels over observational evidence. Virtually all the projections of future clima
defaultte change
default 
defaultin AR5 are based on simulations by
default General Climate Models
default despite these being out of line with the best
default 
defaultobservational evidence.
default”
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultHe argues that “
defaultA particularly robust way of empirically estimating climate sensitivity is the so-called
default 
default‘energy-budget’ method, which is based on a fundamental physical law – the conservation
default 
defaultof energy. Energy-budget best estimates of 
defaultECS fall
default in a range between 1.5°C and
default 
default2.0°C (1.25–1.4°C 
defaultfor TCR
default), depending on the exact periods chosen for analysis. Using
default 
defaultt
defaulthe longest available periods that were free of major volcanism gives a ECS best estimate
default 
defaultof approximately 1.7°C (1.3°C for TCR)
default…
defaultFor the shorter-term TCR measure, the discrepancy between the average of the best
default 
defaultobservational estimates is, at 1.4°C, also sub
defaultstantially lower than the average of the
default 
defaultGCM value of 1.8°C, but close to the energy budget estimate based on the best AR5 data

defaultThe claim that 51% of

defaultfudged…to replicate the observed warming…As concerns the more serious questions such as what the sensitivity of the climate is or
default 
defaultwhat the relationship is between global warming and various purported disa

default 
defaultgenerally admits to ignorance…As the attached paper notes, virtually all observational tests point to sensitivity less than that of any models, and

default“In August 2013, IPPC lead author Dr Hans von Storch, told 
defaultSpeigel Online:-
default&#xa0;
default“So far, no one has been able to provide a compelling answer to why climate change seems to be taking a break.... There are two conceivable explanations -- and neither is very pleasant for us. The first possibility is that less global war
defaultming is occurring than expected because greenhouse gases, especially CO2, have less of an effect than we have assumed. ... The other possibility is that, in our simulations, we have underestimated how much the climate fluctuates owing to natural causes.”

defaultFor the first time, the IPCC finds itself unable to reach consensus on a ‘most likely’ sensitivity (ECS)

defaultIf a TCR of 1.5°C is adopted, RCP4.5 [RCP=representative concentration pathways, a term introduced by the IPCC] provides a warming range of 1.1 to 1.6°C. Deducting t

default4, this leaves 0.38-0.88°C as 
defaultthe 
defaultlikely 
defaulttemperature increase during the 21st century (midpoint less than the 20th century). If the most likely estimate of ECS proves to be less than 2°C, AR5 does not project worrisome future warming, or sea level rise, except in the extreme case of RC

defaultMarcel Crok defaultis a Dutch freelance science writer who published a critica
defaultl book in 2010 that focused on A

defaultterm persistence”.  When taken into account, the statistical significance of the 0.8
default0
defaultC warming since 1860 “is seriously overestimated”.  He also notes how AR5 uses presentational devices to finesse the reliability of models and to avoid accepting that the 
defaultTransient Climate Response in the models is “considerably higher than based on best observational evidence.”  He concludes “
defaultThe case for mitigation is less urgent and this means that as a society we could first focus on new

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHe concluded: “(a) there is insufficient evidence to support a satisfactory answer to the Commi

defaultf the IPCC c
defaultlaim that “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millenia…there just isn’t any nice way to say this—it’s is an outright lie.” 
defaultHe points to other errors and

defaultHe noted that a scientist at the Hadley Centre forecast in 2000 that “British children could have only virtual experience of snow”

defaultC warming over the decade 2004-2014.  He applied Richard Feynman’s concept of “cargo cult science” to climate models

default:-
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultIf climate science were a “normal” science 
defaultthe 
defaultfailure of the models to predict the

defaultCC tries to massage the failure of the climate models and absurdly
default 
defaultto claim an increased confidence in the models as the discrepancy between models and

default&#xa0;
defaultHe drew attention to papers that attributed much of climate change to changes i

default  
defaultGiven, the views already formed by the majority

defaultIn “Solar and planetary oscillation control on climate change: hind-cast, forecast and a comparison with the CMIP5 GCMs”, Nicola Scafetta of Duke University argues that 
default“global surface temperature 
defaultrecords since 1850 are characterized by climatic oscillations synchronous with specific solar, planetary and lunar harmonics superimposed on a background warming modulation. The latter is related to a long millennial solar oscillation and to changes in the
default chemical composition of the atmosphere (e.g. aerosol and greenhouse gases). However, current general circulation climate models, e.g. the CMIP5 GCMs, to be used in the AR5 IPCC Report in 2013, fail to reconstruct the observed climatic oscillations. As an
