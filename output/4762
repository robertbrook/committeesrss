[normal] AND SUMMARY
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The role of the IPCC
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In considering the matter at hand it is crucial 
[normal]to appreciate the role of the IPCC, which is set out in “Principles 
[normal]governing IPCC work”
[normal].
[normal] “[The IPCC] shall concentrate its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the UN Framework Convention on Cl
[normal]imate Change process
[normal]…
[normal]The role of the IPCC is to assess on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change
[normal], its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation. IPCC reports should be neutral with respect to policy…”. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These statements make it clear that the IPCC is not an academic scientific [bold]organization [bold]and [bold]that it has clear governmental – hence[bold] political – input.[bold]  Furthermore its aim is not to investigate the reasons for changes in the climate, but to seek out “human induced climate change” – which presupposes there is such climate change.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]At the end of September the IPCC published versions of 
[normal]the Working Group 1 (WG1) 
[normal]report “
[normal]The Physical Science Basis
[normal]” and the related “
[normal]Summary 
[normal]for 
[normal]Policy Makers
[normal]”
[normal] (SPM)
[normal]; the former was prepared by scientists, the latter by a mix of scientists and representatives of governments
[normal].  The comments here are more often 
[normal]made about the SPM, which is the more widely read document.

[normal]The character of the submissions
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are 
[normal]4
[normal]5
[normal] submissions
[normal] of which two did not appear relevant to the matter at hand
[normal] and two were from organisations that had an obvious commercial interest in promoting anthropogenic climate change (ACC)
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Of the remaining 
[normal]41

[normal]A
[normal]ssessment of 
[normal]A
[normal]ssessment
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The British warmist establishment accepted with few caveats the views expressed by 
[normal]the IPCC, singing from the same hymn sheet:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All 
[normal]the 
[normal]submissions avoided discussion of, or attempted to finesse the unreliability of models
[normal] 
[normal]and consequently none addressed the question of the magnitude of natural variability; all danced around the issue of whether AR5 has sufficiently 
[normal]explained the hiatus in the global surface temperature; none addressed the empirical mea
[normal]surement of climate sensitivity.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In adopting their approach that “all was for the best of all possible worlds”
[normal] re the IPCC’s work
[normal], the warmists ignored 1) the IPCC’s 
[normal]past promotion of pseudo science such as the “hockey stick” and “Himalayagate”; 2) its past baseless claims of increased hurricanes and the spread of malaria due to ACC; 3) the exposure in Climategate of the unethical practices of a coterie of climate scie
[normal]ntists involved with the IPCC; 4) its association with the inconvenient inaccuracies promoted by Senator Al Gore; and 5) the various shortcomings of both science and process discussed 
[normal]in this submission.  
[normal]From the sceptic’s perspective they live in a Briti
[normal]sh bubble of consensus about settled science that is not disturbed by the reality outside the bubble!
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]sceptic
[normal] scientists included some leading North American 
[normal]climate 
[normal]scientists and a physicist of international stature
[normal], who provides 
[normal]the advantage of an
[normal] independent p
[normal]er
[normal]spective from the debates that vex climate scientists.
[normal] 
[normal]The main scientific criticisms of AR5 are:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The public policy analysts (and some of the 
[normal]sceptic
[normal] scientists) 
[normal]argue 
[normal]that the IPCC process is not all that it is cracked up to be, notably:-
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]ESTABLISHMENT
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]DECC
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DECC
[normal] stated “
[normal]that the conclusions of the AR5 Physical Science Basis report are robust.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The report was produced by over 850 independent expert scientists, all leaders in their fields
[normal] (209 Lead Authors, 50 Review Editors and Over 600 Contributing Authors
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The report took over 2 years to produce and underwent multiple rounds of expert review.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It was also reviewed by the 194 governments which form the IPCC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] They have all accepted th
[normal]e findings.”
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DECC c
[normal]laimed “
[normal]The IPCC is a highly effective
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge. It is
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]independent, transparent and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]attracts top scientists who give of their own time to participate
[normal]. It has well laid out procedures and is open to
[normal] both expert and Government Review. We see no evidence that it has deliberately sought to justify political commitment or indeed to propose a policy response.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DECC has backed down from a previous claim by Secretary of State 
[normal]Davey 
[normal]that “the science is set
[normal]tled” to
[normal] the more modest claim that
[normal] “much of the climate science may reasonably be considered, in an everyday sense, to be settled…For example…rising concentrations of greenhouse gases (
[normal]which no one disputes
[normal]),
[normal] 
[normal]a warming wo
[normal]rld
[normal] (
[normal]but it has not warmed for 16
[normal] or so
[normal] years
[normal]), and related effects such as ice loss (
[normal]but ice in the Antarctic has increased
[normal]) and the sea level has risen (
[normal]which has continued at the same rate as for several 
[normal]centuries
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Then it admits “However, the complexities of clouds and various feedb
[normal]ack
[normal] mechanisms add uncertainties”.
[normal]  
[normal]I
[normal]t is
[normal], however,
[normal] not clear whether the reference
[normal]s
[normal] to feedback mechanisms
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]is an allusion to the uncertainty over the magnitude of climate sensitivity to the level of CO2
[normal].  
[normal]DECC 
[normal]avoided the question of the validation of
[normal] the climate models
[normal], and of the temperature pause
[normal].  
[normal]It does not mention 
[normal]the possible effect of the sun on 
[normal]the 
[normal]climate.  Instead of these
[normal] fundamental 
[normal]issues the submission refers to ignorance of 
[normal]what are in effect 
[normal]secondary issues.

[normal]The Granthams

[normal]Institute is headed by

[normal]Nicholas Stern, 
[normal]who 
[normal]both in his Review published in 2007 and subsequently 
[normal]has made exaggerated claims for the magnitude and 
[normal]consequences of ACC
[normal]; the Institute is noted less for science than for
[normal] political advocacy and criticizing 
[normal]sceptic
[normal]s
[normal].  T
[normal]he Imperial College Grantham submission was led by

[normal]I would argue also, the scientific community is traditionally conservative, blinkered and self-preserving…Some would argue that the academic scientific establishment is

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All 
[normal]of the

[normal]ssentially sang from the same hym

[normal] namely
[normal]:-

[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]John Christy[bold], who is 
[normal]Distinguished 
[normal]Professor of Atmospheric Science and Director of the Earth System Science Center
[normal] at the University of Alabama in 
[normal]Huntsville
[normal] and is Alabama’s State Climatologist, 
[normal]recently 
[normal]presented testimon
[normal]y
[normal] (which is part of his submission) 
[normal]to 
[normal]a Congressional Subcommittee
[normal].  
[normal]He has served as expert reviewer, key c
[normal]ontributor, and Lead Author of 
[normal]IPCC 
[normal]Assessments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]He comments “
[normal]The enclosed testimony begins with an examination of the assertions made by many that severe weather events are increasing and are caused by human interference with the climate system.  The evidence shows this is a false claim.  
[normal]I then address the IPCC assertion that the warming of the past few decades was caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases, yet the tools used for that assertion, climate models, fail a most simple comparison test with observations of the tropical atmosp
[normal]here
[normal].  Thus, the models are unable to depict WHAT the climate has done, therefore they are unable to tell us WHY the climate behaved as it did
[normal]…”
[normal]He 
[normal]neatly 
[normal]observes 
[normal]“…
[normal]the IPCC was written by IPCC-selected scientists
[normal] 
[normal]and that the document represents their 
[normal]opinions. Many of the conclusions are fine but
[normal] 
[normal]some of the key ones do not represent the views of many in the broader climate
[normal] 
[normal]community.
[normal] 
[normal]The headline statement from the 2013 
[normal]Summary for Policy Makers 
[normal]baffles me. It reads:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is extremely likely that huma
[normal]n influence has been the dominant cause of
[normal] 
[normal]the observed warming since the mid-20th century.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]Regarding the questions the Committee asks I do not consider the conclusions of the AR5 Physical Sciences Report robust – there is extensive scope to question it
[normal]s conclusions, too many of which are based on climate models which do not reflect reality.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There is also scope to question many aspects of climate science which are far from settled.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] As an Expert Reviewer on the most recent AR5, I found the current set o
[normal]f Lead Authors unwilling to inform the readers of many of the failings of the models on which the main IPCC conclusions are based
[normal]…T
[normal]he IPCC authors, who have the last word on the material to be included, were selected because they were known to agree with 
[normal]the "consensus" and thus the final product is simply the consensus of those who agree with the consensus.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Were there any "
[normal]sceptic
[normal]al" Lead Authors to provide the true range of views on climate change?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] No.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In view of its bias and shortcomings, the conclus
[normal]ions of AR5 should have little relevance for any government’s policy-making regarding mitigation of alleged long-term climate changes.

[normal] for the high 
[normal]intellectual 
[normal]quality of contributions and the well mannered behavior of the bloggers
[normal].  
[normal]Her response to some of the Committee’s questions were:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]A large number of
[normal] climate scientists disagree with the v
[normal]iews portrayed by IPCC; many of t
[normal]hese
[normal] 
[normal]scientists are included in desmogblog’s list of al
[normal]most 300 climate change deniers…
[normal]A reflection of disagreement with the ‘consensus’ is a recent survey of the
[normal] 
[normal]professional members 
[normal]of the American Meteorological Society that found only 
[normal]52% agree that
[normal] 
[normal]most of the warming since 1850 is anthropogenic, which is the principal tenet of the IPCC.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]I have argued that the characterization of uncertainty by the IPCC is
[normal] 
[normal]inadequate and leads to overconfidence in the conclusions, particularly with regards to the IPCC
[normal] 
[normal]statement on 
[normal]attribution.
[normal]  
[normal]Anthropogenic climate change is a 
[normal]proposed theory whose basic mechanism is well understood,
[normal] 
[normal]but whose magnitude is highly uncertain owing to feedback processes.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]Figure 11.25 AR5
[normal] 
[normal]shows that climate models have significantly 
[normal]over-predicted the warming effect of CO2
[normal] 
[normal]since 1990, a period during which CO2 increased from 335 to over 400 parts per million.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]The 
[normal]failure of the IPCC to predict this stagnation in warming is raising serious questions about
[normal] 
[normal]whether climate models are over sensitive to increasing greenhouse gases. The IPCC’s dismissal
[normal] 
[normal]of the stagnation as being associated with unpredictable climate 
[normal]variability raises the question as
[normal] 
[normal]to what extent the warming between 1975 and 2000 can also be explained by unpredictable
[normal] 
[normal]climate variability.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]The climate community has worked for
[normal] 
[normal]more than 20 years to establish a scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change. However,
[normal] 
[normal]the ongoing
[normal] scientific consensus seeking process has had the unintended consequence of
[normal] 
[normal]oversimplifying both the problem and its solution and hyper-politicizing both, introducing biases
[normal] 
[normal]into the both the science and related decision making processes.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On her blog she
[normal] wrote 
[normal]“Kill the IPCC
[normal].
[normal] After years and billions [of dollars], IPCC has failed to document a link between human-CO2 emissions and warning of the earth’s climate…the

[normal]The Friends of Science Society, [bold]a Canadian organization, provides many graphs showing the unreliability of climate models, then develops the theme that climate change has been clos
[normal]ely 
[normal]linked to changes in the solar magnetic field
[normal].  
[normal]Indeed 
[normal]t
[normal]he IPCC WGI Technical Assessment section 7.4.6 says 
[normal]“Many studies have reported
[normal] 
[normal]observations that link solar activity to particular aspects of the climate system. Various
[normal] 
[normal]mechanisms have been 
[normal]proposed that could amplify relatively small variations in total solar
[normal] 
[normal]irradiance, such as changes in stratospheric and tropospheric circulation induced by changes
[normal] 
[normal]in the spectral solar irradiance or an effect of the flux of cosmic rays on clouds
[normal]…
[normal]The IPCC
[normal] 
[normal]ignored
[normal] many [the paper claims 123]
[normal] 
[normal]peer-reviewed articles published 2008 – 2012 tha
[normal]t show the sun is a main driver of climate change.”  The submission cites three studies which show strong correlation between aspects of climate and 
[normal]changes in the solar ma
[normal]gnetic field
[normal]…
[normal]The solar
[normal] 
[normal]magnetic field has doubled from 1900 to 1991 causing warming. The maximum temperature
[normal] 
[normal]response is delayed about 10 years to 2001 due to the large heat capacity of the oceans. The solar
[normal] 
[normal]magnetic field strength has since declined
[normal]…”:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]Using NOAA radiosonde humidity data and Mauna Loa CO2 data from 1963, and a line-by-line
[normal] 
[normal]radiation code, we calculate the greenhouse effect has increased by only 0.11 °C from 1963 to 2008.
[normal] 
[normal]Extrapolating to a doubling of CO2, we estimate the transient clim

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Neil Hutton [bold]is a past President Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists 
[normal]and 
[normal]has written articles on climate science. He comments:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]The IPCC expect us to accept that with hundreds of climate models which
[normal] 
[normal]do not match observations and measurements, they are 95% confi
[normal]dent that
[normal] 
[normal]warming since 1951 is human caused
[normal]. The global average surface record
[normal] 
[normal]only shows warming in concert with increased CO2 between 1978 -1997.
[normal]  
[normal]That is only 19 of the past 63 years amounting to only 30%. There is
[normal] 
[normal]therefore a 70% chance that CO2 and 
[normal]atmospheric warming are not
[normal] 
[normal]correlated and the claim that warming is human caused can not be
[normal] 
[normal]supported
[normal]…I
[normal]n order to characterize modern warming as unprecedented the IPCC
[normal] 
[normal]simply evade the eight Holocene warming and cooling cycles 
[normal][i.e. over the last 15,000 y
[normal]ears] 
[normal]of which our
[normal] 
[normal]modern warming is the last and coolest. Evidence is incontrovertible that
[normal] 
[normal]the Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period had world wide
[normal] 
[normal]effect and were at least 1degree C warmer
[normal]. 
[normal]IPPC simply ignore the evidence from 
[normal]the early history
[normal] of the earth…
[normal] 
[normal]The focus by the IPCC on only the last 50 years of 
[normal]c
[normal]limate variability is like
[normal] 
[normal]trying to describe a large richly furnished d
[normal]rawing room through the keyhole.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]IPCC in an effort to preserve credibility have simply written off the Sun
[normal],
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]major source of our planetary energy
[normal].
[normal] Because solar output is relatively
[normal] constant
[normal], IPCC have chosen to ignore a large body of evidence linking
[normal] 
[normal]solar variability with climate which has the support of abundant peer
[normal] 
[normal]reviewed measurement observation and experi
[normal]ment to corroborate the
[normal] 
[normal]s
[normal]un, together with
[normal] c
[normal]osmic influences, are the main driver of climate
[normal]…
[normal]The worst aspect of the IPCC report is their total disregard of the solar
[normal] 
[normal]influence on climate. In the very period where they are 95% confident of human
[normal] 
[normal]influence 
[normal]we have 
[normal]the most active solar cycles of the 20th Century showing solar maxima 30 to 40% greater than the 19th Century or the first half of the 20th
[normal]. [bold]From 
[normal]1950 there are six cycles numbered

[normal]from

[normal]“The IPCC is a deeply flawed process not scientific but political…

[normal]The latest release of the IPCC AR5 SPM leaves

[normal] 
[normal]linkage between warming of the earth’s climate of the last fifty years with increasing
[normal] 
[normal]concentrations of human-CO2, but provides NO substantive evidence to support this
[normal] 
[normal]claim! Further the SPM has failed to explain the hiatus in t
[normal]he warming for the last 16
[normal] 
[normal]years! Finally the SPM has totally ignored the reality of earth’s climate, which is that
[normal] 
[normal]“The earth’s climate now appears to be entering into a colder epoch!” With the
[normal] 
[normal]approaching of the solar grand minima in the next decade or a
[normal]bout, there is now a distinct
[normal] 
[normal]possibility that the

[normal]Nicholas Lewis [bold]is an independent self-funded 
[normal]American 
[normal]climate researcher whose specialism is climate sensitivity.  He points out that 
[normal]“
[normal]There are two principal issues with the IPCC’s handling of the climate sensitivity area
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Firstly the inclusion of sensitivity estimates from flawed observational studies tha
[normal]t used
[normal] 
[normal]unsuitable data, were poorly designed and/or employed inappropriate statistical
[normal] 
[normal]methodology
[normal]. 
[normal][Lewis is very critical of the poor statistical methodology of climate scientists
[normal]].
[normal] 
[normal]Th
[normal]at obscured what should have been a key message from AR5 – that the
[normal] 
[normal]be
[normal]st observational evidence now points to the climate system being substantially less
[normal] 
[normal]sensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought. Secondly, the elevation of computer
[normal] 
[normal]models over observational evidence. Virtually all the projections of future clima
[normal]te change
[normal] 
[normal]in AR5 are based on simulations by
[normal] General Climate Models
[normal] despite these being out of line with the best
[normal] 
[normal]observational evidence.
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]He argues that “
[normal]A particularly robust way of empirically estimating climate sensitivity is the so-called
[normal] 
[normal]‘energy-budget’ method, which is based on a fundamental physical law – the conservation
[normal] 
[normal]of energy. Energy-budget best estimates of 
[normal]ECS fall
[normal] in a range between 1.5°C and
[normal] 
[normal]2.0°C (1.25–1.4°C 
[normal]for TCR
[normal]), depending on the exact periods chosen for analysis. Using
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]he longest available periods that were free of major volcanism gives a ECS best estimate
[normal] 
[normal]of approximately 1.7°C (1.3°C for TCR)
[normal]…
[normal]For the shorter-term TCR measure, the discrepancy between the average of the best
[normal] 
[normal]observational estimates is, at 1.4°C, also sub
[normal]stantially lower than the average of the
[normal] 
[normal]GCM value of 1.8°C, but close to the energy budget estimate based on the best AR5 data
[normal] 
[normal]of 1.3°C.

[normal]Richard Lindzen[bold], Emeritus Professor, Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences of MIT
[normal],
[normal] is a leading US climate scientist.  He comments that “
[normal]The claim that 51% of 
[normal]the small warming over the past 60 years
[normal] 
[normal]is due to man’s activities is completely consistent with there being no problem worth bothering
[normal] 
[normal]about. The concern arises because of the c
[normal]laim that models with high sensitivity can still be
[normal] 
[normal]fudged…to replicate the observed warming…As concerns the more serious questions such as what the sensitivity of the climate is or
[normal] 
[normal]what the relationship is between global warming and various purported disa
[normal]sters, even the IPCC
[normal] 
[normal]generally admits to ignorance…As the attached paper notes, virtually all observational tests point to sensitivity less than that of any models, and
[normal] 
[normal]there is no evidence of any relationship between extreme weather and global warm
[normal]ing.”  
[normal]His 
[normal]submission includes 
[normal]his
[normal] paper “Falsification of climate models used in experimentation and scenario construction” which explains how the models are constructed and their limitations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In a blog he observed
[normal] 
[normal]“I think that the latest IPCC report has truly
[normal] sunk to level of hilarious incoherence. They are proclaiming increased confidence in their models as the discrepancies between their models and observations increase.”

[normal]“In August 2013, IPPC lead author Dr Hans von Storch, told 
[normal]Speigel Online:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“So far, no one has been able to provide a compelling answer to why climate change seems to be taking a break.... There are two conceivable explanations -- and neither is very pleasant for us. The first possibility is that less global war
[normal]ming is occurring than expected because greenhouse gases, especially CO2, have less of an effect than we have assumed. ... The other possibility is that, in our simulations, we have underestimated how much the climate fluctuates owing to natural causes.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]“
[normal]For the first time, the IPCC finds itself unable to reach consensus on a ‘most likely’ sensitivity (ECS) 
[normal][E
[normal]quilibrium clim
[normal]ate sensitivity, see footnote 14
[normal]] 
[normal]figure. 
[normal]There are two distinct (and mutually exclusive) schools of thought at about 1.7°C and 3°C respectively. If the former group is correct (so the TCR is &lt;1.5°)

[normal]“
[normal]If a TCR of 1.5°C is adopted, RCP4.5 [RCP=representative concentration pathways, a term introduced by the IPCC] provides a warming range of 1.1 to 1.6°C. Deducting t
[normal]he 0.72°C that occurred pre-199
[normal]4, this leaves 0.38-0.88°C as 
[normal]the 
[normal]likely 
[normal]temperature increase during the 21st century (midpoint less than the 20th century). If the most likely estimate of ECS proves to be less than 2°C, AR5 does not project worrisome future warming, or sea level rise, except in the extreme case of RC

[normal]Marcel Crok [bold]is a Dutch freelance science writer who published a critica
[normal]l book in 2010 that focused on A
[normal]R
[normal]3 and AR4.  He notes that AR5 failed to give an estimate for climate sensitivity that implied warming will be less than previously anticipated.  He draws attention to the IPCC’s failure to address the significance of “long 
[normal]term persistence”.  When taken into account, the statistical significance of the 0.8
[normal]0
[normal]C warming since 1860 “is seriously overestimated”.  He also notes how AR5 uses presentational devices to finesse the reliability of models and to avoid accepting that the 
[normal]Transient Climate Response in the models is “considerably higher than based on best observational evidence.”  He concludes “
[normal]The case for mitigation is less urgent and this means that as a society we could first focus on new
[normal] 
[normal]technologies that make decarboni
[normal]sation possible with lower costs than the now available options like

[normal]She commented 
[normal]that “
[normal]If the IPCC reports are to be seen as truly 
[normal]authoritative, a far more challenging review process
[normal] 
[normal]should be instituted. This could take the form of a ‘Red Team’ in which experts from other

[normal]scientific disciplines would be commissioned to undertake a critical review of the IPCC

[normal]fact that it has been established that there are many authors with biases, whether they are
[normal] 
[normal]vested interests (grants/funding), political or ideological, or simply just assumed prestige.

[normal]Robin Guenier [bold]is a barrister with a varied career in business and as CEO of the Central Computing and Telecommunications Agency reporting to the Cabinet Office.  He examines the question 
[normal]“
[normal]To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate
[normal] 
[normal]scientists?”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]He concluded: “(a) there is insufficient evidence to support a satisfactory answer to the Commi
[normal]ttee’s question; (b) the only way to establish a satisfactory answer would be to carry out a full, properly conducted worldwide opinion survey (considered likely to be impracticable); and (c) such evidence as does exist indicates that the answer may well b
[normal]e that AR5 reflects climate scientists’ views to only a very limited extent.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Alex Henney[bold] specializes in electric markets and regulation.  He has taken an interest in climate science because of the manner in which the government’s belief in ACC 
[normal]is destroying 
[normal]the electricity market and is adding to costs.  He 
[normal]pointed to errors in some of the science that the IPCC had promoted
[normal] in the past
[normal], and cites Professor Don Easterbrook as identifying factual errors in AR5.  Easterbrook commented o
[normal]f the IPCC c
[normal]laim that “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millenia…there just isn’t any nice way to say this—it’s is an outright lie.” 
[normal]He points to other errors and 
[normal]conclude
[normal]s “These are only a few examples of the highly biased, misrepresentations of material in the 2013 IPCC report.  As seen by the examples above, it isn’t science at all – it’s dogmatic, political, propaganda.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Hen
[normal]n
[normal]ey drew attention t
[normal]o the lack of reliabilit
[normal]y of climate models. 
[normal]He noted that a scientist at the Hadley Centre forecast in 2000 that “British children could have only virtual experience of snow”
[normal],
[normal] and in 2007 climate scientists at the Met Office used their new climate model to 
[normal](incorrectly) 
[normal]forecast
[normal] 0.3
[normal]0
[normal]C warming over the decade 2004-2014.  He applied Richard Feynman’s concept of “cargo cult science” to climate models
[normal], and argues
[normal]:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]If climate science were a “normal” science 
[normal]the 
[normal]failure of the models to predict the
[normal] 
[normal]temperature pause would lead many 
[normal]scientists to conclude that the assumptions underlying
[normal] 
[normal]the models were wrong and
[normal] 
[normal]they 
[normal]would 
[normal]go back to the drawing b
[normal]oard
[normal]. But climate science is
[normal] 
[normal]politicised with extensive commercial, reputational and grant funding vested interests
[normal] 
[normal]hanging on it. So the IP
[normal]CC tries to massage the failure of the climate models and absurdly
[normal] 
[normal]to claim an increased confidence in the models as the discrepancy between models and
[normal] 
[normal]observations increase.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]He drew attention to papers that attributed much of climate change to changes i
[normal]n solar activity
[normal] and to a
[normal] ne
[normal]w report issued by the National Research Council
[normal] 
[normal]“The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth’s Climate
[normal]”,
[normal] which 
[normal]lays out some of the surprisingly complex ways that solar activity can make itself felt on our planet.”
[normal]  Also 
[normal]Jasper K
[normal]irby, Head of the CLOUD Experiment at CERN, 
[normal]recently gave 
[normal]a presentation 
[normal]showing strong correlations between cosmic rays, so
[normal]lar cycles and earth’s climate
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]He[bold]nney [bold]pointed out that the very costly green/decarbonizing agenda is neither particularly [bold]effective in achieving its basic objectives or reducing CO2 emissions[bold] 
[normal]because
[normal] t
[normal]he few nuclear plants will 
[normal]at a vast cost 
[normal]have a marginal effect
[normal]; 
[normal]CCS is not proven; 
[normal]wind farms 
[normal]are not only expenisve, they 
[normal]do not achieve what they claim on the tin
[normal] by way of 
[normal]mitigation of CO2; r
[normal]esidential solar makes offshore wind look cheap
[normal]; and fresh cut wood chips masquerading as biomass actually increase CO2 emissions
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Nor will ou[bold]r[bold] effort do much if anything to save the planet[bold].[bold] [bold]While the British government is obsessed with driving unabated coal plants off the system, 
[normal]in 2012 the World Resources Institute identified 1,199 new coal fired plants with a capacity of 1400GW being proposed
[normal].  T
[normal]en 900MW new coal plants are being completed
[normal] in Germany and the Netherlands.  
[normal]The IPCC failed to provide a sound assessment of the state of climate science.  We need a truly independent as[bold]s[bold]essm[bold]e[bold]nt undertaken by people who have no vested commercial or reputational interest in the outcome.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]David Hol[bold]land [bold]describes some of the abuses of process and of science in the first four ARs of the IPCC, summarizing “…
[normal]the IPCC process has
[normal] 
[normal]always been over presumptive of the scientific knowledge and has failed to
[normal] 
[normal]ensure that the experts, who serve it, meet the 
[normal]required professional and ethical
[normal] 
[normal]standards. The IPCC has conspicuously failed to ensure any compliance with its
[normal] 
[normal]fundamental principle of requiring a 
[normal]“comprehensive, objective, open and
[normal] 
[normal]transparent” 
[normal]process.
[normal]  
[normal]Given, the views already formed by the majority
[normal] of its founders and their
[normal] 
[normal]lack of any enforcement of its Principles and Procedures, the IPCC is seen by
[normal] 
[normal]many as established to provide a justification for political commitment. For these
[normal] 
[normal]reasons it has never been fit for purpose.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Michael Kelly[bold], Prince P
[normal]hilip Professor of Tech
[normal]nology, University of Cambridge,
[normal] comments that “
[normal]Empirical studies of the global climate during the 20th century all suggest another century
[normal] 
[normal]like the last and another temperature rise of order 1C. It is only the computer models that p
[normal]roduce
[normal] 
[normal]the hi
[normal]gher temperatures and the alarm…
[normal] 
[normal]The most 
[normal]serious defect of the IPCC 5th A
[normal]ssessment 
[normal]Review
[normal], as published, was the truculent
[normal] 
[normal]and obfuscatory manner with which it admitted the temperature statis since 1996, halved its
[normal] 
[normal]estimate of the rate of global warming over the last 60 years, and when insisting that it was 
[normal]m
[normal]ore
[normal] 
[normal]certain than ever that man was playing a role, that role is still small in the context of the last 150
[normal] 
[normal]years of climate change. A scientific report 
[normal]written b
[normal]y neutral consultants would have been much
[normal] 
[normal]more upfront, yes, and honest, about these facts.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]He
[normal] then proposed th
[normal]at if (and he is not persuaded)
[normal] 
[normal]we should reduce CO2 emissions, then 
[normal]w
[normal]e should do it cost effectively.  He points out “
[normal]Renewable energy source
[normal]s are intrinsically dilute at source. One needs all 1000 square
[normal] 
[normal]kilometres of the Fen Country (now producing food) to generate 0.8-1GW from biomass if we
[normal] 
[normal]harvested and burned miscanthus, a rapidly growing grass. We already get 1.3GW from Sizewell B,
[normal] 
[normal]the ac
[normal]tual nuclear plant for which is less than one tenth of a square kilometre in area. The factor of
[normal] 
[normal]10,000 in energy efficiency of the use of land is not something that can be closed by tinkering with
[normal] 
[normal]the renewable energy efficiency. Furthermore one can grow 
[normal]food or miscanthus or cover the lan
[normal]d 
[normal]with solar panels, but not do more than one of these with the land at any one time.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]In 2050 most of the 9
[normal]bn
[normal] population of the earth will live in megacities. Only nuclear energy
[normal] 
[normal]and the burning of fossil fuels with 
[normal]complete carbon capture and storage produce energy numbers
[normal] 
[normal]that add up to make global sense, but the latter technology (i.e. capture and storage) has not been
[normal] 
[normal]demonstrated as effective and safe at anything like the scale needed. Everything else, and
[normal] 
[normal]especi
[normal]ally renewable energy technologies, is hubris as far as energising megacities is concerned.

[normal]which 
[normal]is a detailed
[normal] 
[normal]analysis of the flaws in previous IPCC reports. H
[normal]e points out that in order to understand part of the agenda of the IPCC it is necessary to 
[normal]appreciate the history of its formation and that it “
[normal]is focussed on the narrow issue of any human influences on climate and has no mandate
[normal] 
[normal]to examine all possible causes (which means it cites only material relevant to its
[normal] 
[normal]charter)
[normal]; it 
[normal]benefits through the 
[normal]massive government funding to research aligned with the IPCC
[normal] 
[normal]view because such research produces a large number of peer-reviewed papers
[normal]; 
[normal]attracts researchers who benefitted 
[normal]from the research funding above
[normal] as Lead Authors
[normal] 
[normal]and Coordinating Lead Authors
[normal]; 
[normal]does
[normal] not include sceptical authors (and yet scepticism is an essential part of science)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The IPCC “

[normal] 
[normal]effectively dictate what will be said in the Summary for Policymakers

[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he IPCC
[normal] is ineffective because of its narrow focus and this distorts its outlook into a

[normal]form of political justification
[normal].”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]He points out “
[normal]The writing of an IPCC

[normal]s made much easier if there is general
[normal] 
[normal]agreement between the Lead Authors and Coord
[normal]inating Lead Authors of a given chapter.
[normal] 
[normal]One way to achieve this is to avoid involving any potential authors who might be sceptical of

[normal]Conor McMenamie [bold]is an inventor.  He opines that AR5 has an agenda to promote global climate

[normal]The climate research institutions, upon whom we rely for an honest and accur
[normal]ate
[normal] 
[normal]provision of information, are quickly becoming the least reliable authorities at
[normal] 
[normal]providing that same information, since it is their ambition to adhere to the

[normal]Christopher Monkton, [bold]a well know
[normal]n 
[normal]sceptic
[normal], responded to the question of “How robust are the conclusions in AR5?” with an effective set of exhibits showing the discrepancy between various model predictions and aspects of global temperatures.  He linked the exhibits to 1) the failure of re
[normal]liability of the models; 2) the failure to explain the temperature hiatus; and 3) the lack of credibility of the IPCC.  In response to the question of whether AR5 reflected the range of scientific views he pointed out that he had not been allowed to attend
[normal] the initial scoping meeting for AR5 and the IPCC also tried to exclude Professor Paul Reiter, a world expert on epidemiology of malaria, who had disagreed with the IPCC line on the spread of malaria due to ACC.  He claimed “only one viewpoint is allowed”.

[normal]Fenton Robb [bold]comments “
[normal]IPCC AR5 is unashamedly presented, not as the outcome of scientific
[normal] 
[normal]observation, but as a compilation of the opi
[normal]nions of a close community of experts.
[normal]  
[normal]This is made abundantly clear in Sect
[normal]ion A Introduction paragraph 3.”  He considers that “
[normal]Climatologists form a closely-knit peer group that shares an interest in promoting
[normal] 
[normal]public alarm and provoking continued 
[normal]research.
[normal]”  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Scottish Climate and Energy Forum [bold]states that notwithstanding its claim to the contrary the IPCC does not know enough about climate science to model it accurately; it cannot determine the effects of climate change; and it provides no basi
[normal]s for government action.

[normal]comments:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]He developed the latter point that [IPCC] “B
[normal]eing a ‘Governmental’ organisation makes it difficult to summarise and report
[normal] 
[normal]scientific research objectively because of political pressures, interference,
[normal] 
[normal]interpretation and spin. This is particularly so in the case of the Summary for
[normal] 
[normal]Policymakers, which 
[normal]is all that most people read. The IPCC should, therefore, be
[normal] 
[normal]replaced by a purely scientific panel free from any political involvement whatsoever.
[normal] 
[normal]The IPCC is increasingly perceived by many as having a political agenda,
[normal] 
[normal]undermining the excellent scientific
[normal] work behind it.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Richard Tol [bold]is a professor of economics at the University of Sussex and of the economi
[normal]cs of climate change at the Vrij
[normal]e Universiteet Amsterdam.  He does not regard the IPCC as an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge, co
[normal]mmenting “
[normal]The IPCC reports justify the existence of a large bureaucracy which, judging from the lack
[normal] 
[normal]in progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and vulnerability to climate change, seems
[normal] 
[normal]primarily occupied with maintaining and expanding said 
[normal]bureaucracy.
[normal]”  
[normal]He also opines:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]“
[normal]The UK could be a leader in international climate policy if it would demonstrate that
[normal] 
[normal]greenhouse gas emissions can be cut substantially without causing economic pain. Current
[normal] 
[normal]UK climate policy shows the opposite: Climate 
[normal]policy can cause real hardship without
[normal] 
[normal]making a dent in emissions.

[normal]ASSESSMENT OF ASSESSMENT
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The British Warmist establishment took no notice of 1) the IPCC’s past promotion of pseudo science such as the “hockey stick” and “Himalayagate”; 2) its pas
[normal]t baseless claims of increased hurricanes and the spread of malaria due to ACC; 3) the exposure in Climategate of the unethical practices of a coterie of climate scientists involved with the IPCC; 4) 
[normal]its 
[normal]association with the inconvenient inaccuracies promo
[normal]ted by Senator Al Gore; 
[normal]and 5) the various shortcomings cited in the previous two sections
[normal].  It continued living in its politically correct bubble of consensus settled science, claiming

[normal]I[bold]n view of the close involvement of the various organisations[bold] and people in the IPCC none can be regarded as independent judges of AR5.  Furthermore they variously have political face, grant income[bold], expenditure on bigger and faster computers[bold],[bold] [bold]and reputations at stake.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]Public policy criticisms are that the IPCC process is not all that it is cracked up to be, notably:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Climate models have improved since the [
[normal]Fourth Assessment Report
[normal]published in 2007]. Models reproduce observed continental-scale surface temperature patterns and trends over many decades, including the more rapid warming since the mid-20th c
[normal]entury and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions (
[normal]very
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]high confidence
[normal]).”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]     Followed immediately by
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]this
[normal]:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“The long-term climate model simulations show a trend in global-mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2012 that agrees with
[normal] the observed trend (
[normal]very high confidence
[normal]). There are, however, differences between simulated and observed trends over periods as short as 10 to 15 years (e.g., 1998 to 2012).”

[normal]i.e. those who claim that climate warming over the period 1996-1998 is mainly – if not entirely – a consequence of CO2 emissions due to mankind.  Note that in the period prior to 1976 
[normal]there was concern about global cooling while since 1998 the surface temperature has been stable
[normal], 
[normal]the so called “hiatus” or “pause”
[normal].  That does not stop the more enthusiastic warmists claiming that the earth is still warming, perhaps with the heat going int

[normal]Interestingly this included the Imperial Granth
[normal]am.  However, in an interview with the Economist on 18/3/10 Professor Hoskins stated of climate models “they’re still pretty lousy.”  Clearly the submission is being politically correct.
[normal] 
[normal]Sceptics
[normal] are those who accept that the climate is (as ever) changing and warmed up from 1976 to 1998, but that the reasons for the warming are complex and far from fully understood, and cannot all be laid at the door of CO2 emissions due to mankind.
[normal] 
[normal]He notes tha
[normal]t 
[normal]the IPCC relies on climate models to distinguish “natural” from “human” caused climate change
[normal], but “
[normal]these 
[normal]m
[normal]odels on average fail by a significant amount to reproduce the climate of the past 35 years
[normal]…the
[normal] IPCC now has even more confidence that the models c
[normal]an distinguish “natural” from “human” change over a period the models clearly fail to simulate well. It doesn’t make sense to me.”

[normal]CO2 without amplification or positive feedbacks cannot warm the atmosphere in the mann
[normal]er proposed by IPCC scientists and a doubling world other things being equal increase the global temperature by about 1
[normal]0
[normal]C. The IPCC and climate models assume positive feedback which amplifies the effect.  Thus the 
[normal]IPCC AR4 conclusion on climate sensitivity is as:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“The equilibrium climate sensitivity…is likely to be in the range 2
[normal]0
[normal]C to 4.5
[normal]0
[normal]C with a best estimate of about 3
[normal]0
[normal]C and is very unlikely to be less than 1.5
[normal]0
[normal]C.  Values higher than 4.5
[normal]0
[normal]C cannot be excluded…”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is the increase in sensitivity which leads to the predictions of significant future increases in temperature.  AR5 avoided setting an official 
[normal]figure
[normal] for climate sensitivity beca
[normal]use of disagreement
[normal].  
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The
[normal]re are two measures of sensitivity.  The first is Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), which is the equilibrium change in global mean near surface air temperature that would result from a sustaine
[normal]d doubling of CO2 concentration.  The second is Transient Climate Response (TCR), which is the average temperature respo0nse over a 20 year period.

[normal] 
[normal]I have read a number of papers by the Met Office and o
[normal]thers purporting to claim ACC.  A noted characteristic of most of them is a reliance on models to show whatever (e.g. 
[normal]a “probabilistic” seeming 
[normal]distribution to outcomes) followed by an assertion that the event is probably due to ACC
[normal], but in reality there i
[normal]s no empirical link

[normal] 
[normal]In “Solar and planetary oscillation control on climate change: hind-cast, forecast and a comparison with the CMIP5 GCMs”, Nicola Scafetta of Duke University argues that 
[normal]“global surface temperature 
[normal]records since 1850 are characterized by climatic oscillations synchronous with specific solar, planetary and lunar harmonics superimposed on a background warming modulation. The latter is related to a long millennial solar oscillation and to changes in the
[normal] chemical composition of the atmosphere (e.g. aerosol and greenhouse gases). However, current general circulation climate models, e.g. the CMIP5 GCMs, to be used in the AR5 IPCC Report in 2013, fail to reconstruct the observed climatic oscillations. As an 
[normal]alternate, an empirical model is proposed that uses
[normal] 
[normal]a specific set of decadal, multidecadal, secular and millennial astronomic harmonics to simulate the observed climatic oscillations…
[normal]and performs the GCMs by better hindcasting the observed 1850-2012 clima
[normal]te patterns…
[normal]about 50-60% of the warming observed since 1850 and since 1970 was induced by natural oscillations likely resulting from harmonic astronomical forcings that are not yet included in the GCMs.”
