[[[ in the Draft Deregulation Bill (Clauses 12 to 18 and Schedule 6)]]]&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Amendments to the 'cut-off' provisionsClauses 12, 13, 14 and Schedule 6 paragraphs 5 and 8 amend the 'cut-off' provisions. Those provisions are contained in sections 53-56 of the 2000 Act and section 54A of the 1981 Act, but have not yet been commenced.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Amendments to the public path order application provisionsClauses 15 and 17 amend the provisions for applications for public path orders contained in section 118ZA, 118C, 119ZA, 119C and 121A-121E of the Highways Act 1980, none of which have yet been commenced.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Other proposalsOther provisions are contained in Clause 16 and Schedule 6 paragraphs 2,3,4,6,7 and 9.              County councils              27              Metropolitan district councils              36              Shire unitaries              55              Outer London boroughs              20              TOTAL              138              &#xa0;              Shire districts              201              National park authorities and Broads Authority              10              Inner London boroughs and City of London              13              sub-total              224              Total number of authorities with path order-making powers              362              &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Implementation of the cut-off provisions will be a major project. Defra's estimates (in the Impact Assessment) are that there will be 20,000 additional applications, costing local authorities on average £2,900 to determine. That adds up to £58 million, with extra costs to be added for both central and local government in order-making and dealing with appeals against refused applications and with objections to orders. The total cost to the public purse could easily be £100 million. b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Such a major project justifies proper management. But not only are there no plans in place: the provisions in the Bill for the Secretary of State's jurisdiction over applications for directions to be transferred to the courts (Schedule 6 paragraph 6(4)), and for applications to be recorded in the register only after the preliminary assessment (Schedule 6 paragraph 4) means that keeping track of what is happening will be much more difficult than would otherwise be the case.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the Explanatory Notes (para 64) it is acknowledged that "The investigations of applications based on evidence about the position before 1949 can be very difficult for authorities". That difficulty, which will apply also to applicants, may well lead to applicants erring on the side of caution and submitting applications for routes that would not, in practice, be extinguished at the cut-off date.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The increased complexity of dealing with applications made after the cut-off date - judging whether a right of way existed in 1949 and, if so, whether it was extinguished at the cut-off date or whether an exemption from extinguishment applied - will give rise to increased, continuing, costs for both local and central government. e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 extinguished rights for mechanically-propelled vehicles in certain circumstances, essentially a trial run of similar provisions. It has led to extra work considering whether exemptions apply and several court cases on its interpretation. The greater extent and complexity of the cut-off provisions in the 2000 Act suggests that the extra work involved will be significant.f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The main purpose of the provisions was supposed to be greater certainty. But this must be questionable, as the lack of resources means progress will be slow. Defra is estimating that there will be 20,000 additional applications, which means an average of 2,000 per year. There is no evidence that authorities will be able to cope with anything like that number. If so, many thousands will remain undetermined at the cut-off date, and it will be many years before they are all resolved, with al the associated uncertainty. g)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Moreover the proposals in the Bill on preliminary assessment of applications and associated delays in recording in the register mean that many of those will be hidden from public view by not being in the public register, nor will they have been notified to landowners, with consequent implications for property sales. Furthermore the provisions do not extinguish rights over ways that might be considered to have the greatest impact on landowners - ways not presently recorded at all, but which qualify to be recorded as either byways open to all traffic or restricted byways.h)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However the Act is worded that if a footpath or bridleway that existed as a public right of way in 1949 is not recorded on the definitive map at the cut-off date it will be extinguished (unless an exemption applies). This means that in any question about the status of a way after the cut-off date the starting point is that the rights were extinguished unless it can be shown that the right of way did not exist in 1949 or that an exemption applies. The difficulty of ascertaining the status in 1949 is accepted by Defra (see above): the exemptions are in section 54 of the 2000 Act (which I, as a practitioner with many years' experience, find very difficult to understand) and possibly in regulations. Defra has not published any draft regulations, so it is impossible to judge what effect any regulations might have.i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The extinguishment of footpaths and bridleways is likely to have a particular effect in urban areas, where many such ways (mostly footpaths) are often not currently recorded on definitive maps. The Act provides no exemption for ways that are in regular daily use, nor for those that are maintained by the local authority at public expense, so the only certain safeguard will be recording of the way on the definitive map. I consider that there are many thousands of such ways in regular daily use by people going to school, shops, work, etc that will be put at risk by implementation of the cut-off provisions. They range from centuries-old routes in towns and cities to ways on housing estates built in the 1930s.j)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Local authorities that are highway authorities have a duty to keep an up-to-date list of those ways that are publicly maintainable, including footpaths and bridleways. They use that information not only to plan their maintenance work, but also, for example, to answer questions related to property transfer. At the cut-off date, there will be considerable uncertainty about the status of footpaths and bridleways included in that list: do authorities amend the list, or, if they continue to maintain ways where the rights have been extinguished, will they be spending money unlawfully?k)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The implementation of the cut-off provisions does not have universal support. The Equestrian Access Forum, whose members are the British Horse Society, the Byways and Bridleways Trust, the British Driving Society, the National Federation of Bridleway Associations and the South Pennine Packhorse Trails Trust, published a report in 2012 Making Ways for Horses, in which proposal 2 was the repeal of the cut-off provisions.Clause 12 Clause 13&#xa0;Clause 14&#xa0;Schedule 6 paragraphs 5 and 8 (modification consent orders)&#xa0;&#xa0;Modifications arising from administrative errors (Schedule 6 paragraph 3)&#xa0;Definitive map modification order applications and appeals (Schedule 6 paragraphs 4 and 6)&#xa0;Preliminary assessment of applications&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Examine the application and associated evidence.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Research any documentary evidence relied on by the applicant but for which copies have not been supplied under sub-paragraph 1(3).c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Having regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State, decide whether the application and the evidence show that there is a reasonable basis for the applicant's belief that the map and statement should be modified.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Notify the applicant of the decision.e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; If the decision is that there is a reasonable basis (Defra expects this to occur 90% of the time), investigate who are the owners and occupiers of all the land to which the application relates, and serve notice on them.Dealing with non-determination of an application&#xa0;Other detailed comments&#xa0;Publicity for definitive map and public path orders (Schedule 6 paragraphs 7 and 9)&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is a lack of consistency, in that these will be the only provisions that enable a change to be made to rights of way to be advertised in this way. See Appendix 2 for a full list of provisions and current publicity requirements.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The alternative proposed is very weak, in that there is no way of knowing when               an order will be publicised or where to look on a council's website."The Government has decided not to take forward this amendment. This means that the statutory requirement to publish certain applications in newspapers remains. It is clear from the responses that some members of the public and community groups rely on the statutory notices in newspapers to learn about planning applications in their area. The Government is not convinced that good alternative arrangements can be readily rolled out."&#xa0;15 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;Birmingham&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Essex&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Leicestershire&#xa0;&#xa0;Luton&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Northamptonshire&#xa0;&#xa0;Northumberland &#xa0;&#xa0;North Tyneside&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Southend&#xa0;&#xa0;Warwickshire &#xa0;
