[normal]Cycling Safety
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please do not try to re-invent the wheel. There is widespread application of successful techniques in northern Europe and especially the Netherlands. Drivers
[normal], cyclists and pedestrians can all make mistakes and infrastructure should prioritise making such 
[normal]mistakes non-lethal. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Restrict through traffic to main roads. Shopping centres to be pedestrian priority with cycling and careful deliveries tolerated. Minor roads to be limited to 20mph.
[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]On main roads the provision of segregated cycling facilities as ess
[normal]ential as the provision of footways. (This does not mean cycling on footways). 
[normal]3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Main junctions should have clear separation of motor vehicles, cycles and pedestrians.
[normal]4)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] As different vehicles cause different degrees of danger a greater responsibility lies wi
[normal]th the driver of a heavier vehicle. Some form of default liability operates in most European countries. Making cyclists default liable in collision with pedestrians might make this more palatable. 
[normal]5)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]HGVs that are allowed into towns need to be designed to be
[normal] able to operate safely in the presence of pedestrians and cyclists. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]You will have heard these ideas before â€“ please do not allow yourselves to be deflected into a futile blame-game between drivers and cyclists.
