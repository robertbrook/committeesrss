[normal]Written evidence from the Soil Association[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important issue. This 
[normal]written evidence
[normal] is made on behalf of the Soil Association and produced by its policy department.  The Soil Association is
[normal] the UK's leading membership charity campaigning for healthy, humane and sustainable food, farming and land use
[normal], with over 20,000 members.
[normal]  
[normal]The Soil Association also owns an accredited organic certification company with around 4,000 licensees. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would b
[normal]e happy to discuss or send further information regarding the issues outlined below if required.

[normal]Background[bold]1 
[normal]C
[normal]urrently there is enough food to feed everyone in the world, yet nearly one billion people remain hungry and another billion are maln
[normal]ourished. The current problems we are facing are those of lack of access to food: the ability to buy, or produce food
[normal] where it is needed most
[normal]. This is true in a UK, EU and global context.
[normal]2 
[normal]At the same time we are facing issues of very high and quickly gro
[normal]wing levels of obesity and diet related ill health. More than one billion people across the world are overweight of which 300 million are overweight. This poses a major risk for illnesses such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
[normal]3 
[normal]The British Me
[normal]dical Association predicts that by 2020, over one quarter of UK children will be obese and they will have a shorter life expectancy than their parents.
[normal]4 
[normal]An accepted definition of food security in the past has been that provided by the United Nations Food 
[normal]&amp; Agriculture 
[normal]Organisation
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5 
[normal]“Food security exists when all people, at all times, have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6 
[normal]That thirteen 
[normal]year old definition d
[normal]oesn’t adequately reflect the need for food security to be founded on sustainable production, given current understanding of the scale and urgency of the challenges brought by climate change. UK, EU and global food security must be considered in that conte
[normal]xt
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How best to improve UK (and EU) food security, including using resources more efficiently;
[normal]7 
[normal]I
[normal]n order to achieve UK food security we need to change the way we eat in the UK and other Western countries
[normal]. We need to move towards eating less but 
[normal]better-quality meat from grass-fed beef and sheep
[normal],
[normal] a wider range of cereals for direct human consumption, more root crops and more production of fruit and vegetables. With one-third of each European citizen’s carbon footprint coming from what they choose t
[normal]o eat and drink, helping consumers make easy, low-carbon food choices is crucial.
[normal]8 
[normal]This can be driven by demand and adequate government support for suitable food production systems. The Soil Association’s Food for Life Catering Mark is now serving almost 
[normal]800,000 meals each weekday (almost 150 million per year
[normal]). This large-scale intervention significantly increases the amount
[normal] of meals served outside of the home which use fresh, seasonal, local and organic ingredients, high welfare meat and sustainable fish
[normal].
[normal]9 
[normal]Policy advice now also advocates changing diets to achieve sustainability and security in food and farming systems. For example the Government commissioned Foresight report said it should be a priority for policy makers to 
[normal]‘work 
[normal]to change consumption p
[normal]atterns
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]and ‘contain demand for the most resource-intensive types of food
[normal].
[normal]’ 
[normal] ’The UK Committee on Climate Change now acknowledge that ‘re-balancing’ diets is one of the more ‘radical’ solutions needed if the agriculture sector is going to continue to re
[normal]duce its GHG emissions after 2030
[normal]. 
[normal]10 
[normal]Currently one-third of the UK and global grain harvest goes to feed animals—mainly as concentrates for intensive livestock production and 
[normal]70% of all EU livestock feed is imported, underlining the inherent 
[normal]unsustainab
[normal]ility
[normal] of intensive meat production
[normal]11 
[normal]Reducing food waste is an important part of the solution, globally about one third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted, but much more food (about 280–380kg per person per year) is wasted in Europe 
[normal]and North America, compared to 125–165kg in low-income countries in the Global South. Reducing this wastage would have a significant impact on food security.
[normal]12 
[normal]Scientists have 
[normal]model
[normal]l
[normal]ed
[normal] how we can feed 9 billion people in 2050 with a healthy diet in an environmentally sustainable way. French researchers assumed 3,000kcal per person per day, with 500kcal from animals, a decrease for higher income consumers, but an increase in Asia and s
[normal]ub-Saharan Africa. Waste reduction would reduce food demand by 25% in richer countries. Worldwide, people would eat more diverse and healthy diets, with a 25% decline in demand compared to the business as usual scenario. 
[normal]13 
[normal]A similar scientific study in G
[normal]ermany and Austria found that organic agriculture can probably feed the world population of 9.2 billion in 2050 if relatively modest diets are adopted, with a low level of inequality in food distribution required to avoid malnutrition. These scenarios assu
[normal]me that in countries like the UK, we will both produce food differently and eat differently, as it is clear for health and environmental reasons that diets must change.
[normal]14 
[normal]In the UK little 
[normal]mode
[normal]l
[normal]ling
[normal] has been done, but one study in England and Wales found t
[normal]hat if all farming was organic, we would produce more grass-fed beef and sheep, far less grain fed dairy, pigs and poultry, more grain would be available for humans. We do not need to increase production in the UK to help feed the world. 
[normal]15 
[normal]According to t
[normal]he UN Food and Agriculture 
[normal]Organisation
[normal], IAASTD and development charities, helping to feed those currently starving or malnourished means increasing food production, supply and availability in those countries where the problems are occurring, and to the po
[normal]orest people in those countries, and local agro-ecological systems are best suited to achieve this. This is particularly the case when considering future threats to agricultural production, as the resources currently needed to produce food, oil based 
[normal]ferti
[normal]lisers
[normal] and pesticides, mined phosphates and fresh water, become scarcer and more 
[normal]expensive. Organic and other agro-ecological farming systems can help the world feed itself, but as well as changing our farming systems, we need to eat differently, feed our 
[normal]livestock differently, and waste less food.
[normal]16 
[normal]The Government can support moves towards more sustainable production systems via e.g. adequate support through CAP payments. Our definition of sustainable agriculture includes agriculture that produces healthy
[normal], safe and high quality food, which is reasonably priced, with no hidden costs. It should respect the investment made by taxpayers, provide rewarding jobs and a contribution to the economic and social well being of rural areas and should use resources wise
[normal]ly. It should also support other EU strategies (e.g. EU Strategy on Sustainable Development), policy objectives (such as halting the loss of biodiversity) and international commitments (such as the UN Climate Convention).
[normal]17 
[normal]Though not a perfect system, or
[normal]ganic farming can meet many of these goals. The 
[normal]reformed 
[normal]CAP 
[normal]will recognise the role organic farming plays by granting organic farmers automatic rights to the new 30% greening element
[normal].  However, national implementation of Pillar 2 
[normal]should recognise the effi
[normal]ciency of supporting organic farming systems over a policy of individual interventions seeking to achieve environmental and social objectives separately.
[normal]18 
[normal]Organic farms deliver the public goods that citizens expect as part of the farm business and organ
[normal]ic is currently the only legally defined systems approach to sustainable farming. It needs a holistic policy in which public money is used to support the farming system as a whole, such as with flat-rate area payments decoupled from production.
[normal]19 
[normal]It is crucial that the Government whole-heartedly supports ‘
[normal]agri
[normal]-innovation’ and not just ‘
[normal]agri
[normal]-tech’. By this we mean innovation in the round – including practices, knowledge a
[normal]nd services – that are needed to address the challenges 
[normal]20 
[normal]facing food security as opposed to only focusing on technology. Government has an important role in enabling such innovation.
[normal]21 
[normal]Meeting the challenge of providing better nutrition for more people 
[normal]sustainably, in spite of rapid environmental change, will take research and innovation, as well as changes in the ways we eat, farm and do business. It calls for joined-up research that bridges the natural and social sciences
[normal], takes an ecological approach,
[normal] 
[normal]responds to people’s real needs and respects farmers’ know-how. Government promised they
[normal] would
[normal] change the way research is done after the public rejected GM crops 10 years ago, but we
[normal] have
[normal] yet to see that. So we’re pioneering a radically different approach
[normal]: our 
[normal]Duchy Originals Future Farming programme
[normal] promotes practical innovation in sustainable agriculture by helping farmers to think more like scientists, and scientists to listen better to farmers.
[normal]22 
[normal]The Soil Association supports technologies that help p
[normal]roduce food with care for human health, the environment and animal welfare, and which put farmers in control of their own livelihoods. Where GM crops have been planted they are doing the opposite, locking farmers into buying herbicides and costly seed, whi
[normal]le 
[normal]breeding resistant weeds and insects. They are the product of a narrow, top-down approach driven not by the needs of farmers, consumers or the environment, but of seed and chemical companies. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23 
[normal]Farmers and the public deserve to choose the kind of fut
[normal]ure they want for our food, agriculture and countryside, and the risks they are willing to take. But once GM crops are out in the environment they cannot be contained, so they deny that choice. Meanwhile, regulators do
[normal] not
[normal] make 
[normal]effective
[normal] safety checks or e
[normal]ven ask whether new technologies are in the public interest. We are committed to preserving people’s choice through our standards and we are campaigning for clear labelling which identifies all GM ingredients or derivatives in foods, and labelling for prod
[normal]ucts from animals fed on GM feed. 
[normal]24 
[normal]GM scientists and industry have consistently over-promised and under-delivered, and there is no sign that will change. Countless tried, tested and successful ways of tackling hunger and food insecurity are underused fo
[normal]r lack of investment, so it does not make sense to throw good money after bad on GM, and to open the floodgates to a torrent of risky and unneeded GM crops. Instead we need to support farming systems which are truly innovative.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25 
[normal]The International Agricu
[normal]ltural Assessment of Science, Technology and Development (IAASTD)
[normal], a global colloquium of over 400 scientists, signed-up to by over 60 governments, including the UK concluded:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26 
[normal]“…despite significant scientific and technological achievements in our 
[normal]ability to increase agricultural productivity, we have been less attentive to some of the unintended social and environmental consequences of our achievements.
[normal]Business as usual is no longer an option…Policies that promote sustainable agricultural practice
[normal]s (…) stimulate more technology innovation, such as 
[normal]agroecological
[normal] approaches and organic farming to alleviate poverty and improve food security.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27 
[normal]The 
[normal]“
[normal]agroecological
[normal] approaches and organic farming” 
[normal]that IAASTD calls for have been starved of research a
[normal]nd development funding
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28 
[normal]Similarly at an EU level, the main EU scientific committee on agriculture, the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research (SCAR)
[normal] says we will need radically new farming systems and research to support them, which move in the agro-ecological direction - not intensification, high-tech or GM.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29
[normal] [bold]“
[normal]Approaches that promise building blocks towards low-input high-output systems, integrate
[normal] historical knowledge and 
[normal]agroecological
[normal] principles that use nature´s capacity, should receive the highest priority for funding”.
[normal](SCAR, 2011)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30 
[normal]The SCAR committee published the major report:  
[normal]‘Sustainable food consumption and production in a resource-c
[normal]onstrained world’
[normal].  This was a cornerstone in SCAR’s ‘Foresight’ process which 
[normal]aimed to identify innovative solutions which will enable agriculture to cope with the range of complex and interlinked challenges over the next 30-40 years. The report calls for a radically different farming system to the one we have at present. It also hi
[normal]ghlights the 
[normal]concept of scarcity as guiding principle, both with respect to natural resources and to socio-economic issues. This idea of scarcity encompasses the time left we have to move our present, resource intensive farming systems towards those which 
[normal]have sustainability and resilience at their core. It recommends that research which takes account of the interactions between productivity, environmental and social sustainability goals should be prioritised.
[normal]31 
[normal]We believe that some of 
[normal]useful goals for the
[normal] UK Government in this context are:
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]32 
[normal]Measuring agricultural productivity in a way that is consistent with addressing the challenges set out in the UK Foresight report, 
[normal]by incorporating the use of inputs and greenhouse gas emissions, 
[normal]supports the sector’s
[normal] long-term economic resilience
[normal],
[normal] and reflects the external costs and benefits of agriculture. 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Valuing the environmental, animal welfare, amenity and social benefits of agriculture, including employment. For example the agriculture sector employs the equiva
[normal]lent of 11.2 million full time jobs (290,000 in the UK)
[normal]. 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Involving diverse farmers and rural stakeholders, in shaping investment priorities and reviewing progress. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How food and farming supply chains, and the current systems for traceability,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]can contr
[normal]ibute to increased resilience;
[normal]33 
[normal]Resilience is the key measure by which the Soil Association believes that our national food and farming security should be judged. Resilience is a term used by business and government to indicate what is necessary to ‘keep
[normal] the show on the road’ in times of crisis. For government, one feature is preparing for civil contingencies. It is not just the resilience of our food supply to such short-term shocks that needs to be considered, but also the underlying, long-term resilien
[normal]ce of our predominant food system and farming model.
