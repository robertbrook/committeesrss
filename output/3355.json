It is committed to setting and maintaining professional standards and to promoting excellence in the teaching and practice of pathology. \nPathology \nis the science at the heart of modern medicine and is \na core component in 70\n%\n of clinical interventions (di\nagnosis, \nchoice of treatment, efficacy of treatment)\n. The College aims to advance the science and practice of pathology, to provide public education,\n to promote research in pathology and to disseminate the results. We have members across 19 \nspecialties \nworking in hospital laboratories, universities and industry worldwide to diagnose, treat and prevent illness.\n2              Introduction&#xa0;2.1\n              \nIn this submission \nthe \nRCPath focusses on where efficiency ga\nins can be made and where there \nis a risk of money being wasted.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nPathology is a major clinical service and is involved in most clinical interventions. \nIt drives most \nhealthcare decisions\n and is a core componen\nt in 70\n%\n of clinical interventions (diagnosis, choice of treatment, efficacy of treatment). \nIt employs 25,000 staff and costs the NHS in the order of £2.5 billi\non a year, representing nearly \n4%\n of total NHS expenditure.\n \nDemand across virtually all discipli\nnes of pathology has been rising at an average of 10\n%\n per annum between 2003-2006 (latest available figures).\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nThe \nReport of the Second Phase of the Review of NHS Pat\nhology Services in England\n (The \nCarter Review) suggested that savings of between 10\n%\n a\nnd 20\n%\n could be achieved through the reconfiguration and consolidation of pathology services. At a national level, this would imply annual savings of £250 \n-\n £500 million in total, based on figures for 2005.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nThe \nRCPath welcomes this opportunity to \nsubmit evidence to the Health Select Committee on this important issue.\n&#xa0;\n3.              Evidence that requests for pathology tests and services are variable&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nThe increasing importance of pathology in relation to healthcare cannot be overstated. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nThere has been a large rise in requests for pathology tests over the past decade, with the not unexpected associated effect on expenditure. Much of this rise seen in pathology test use is justified, and can be related to the development of new clinical gui\ndance, patient pathways, health screening initiatives, Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF) targets and the availability of new, more useful tests – especially in the field of \nmolecular pathology.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nThere are a number of reasons \nwhy \ndemand for pathology services \nis \nlikely to continue to rise:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nThere is also evidence that shows \na \nconsiderable level of inappropriate requesting\n -\n some have estimated this to be anywhere between \n5%\n and 98\n% (\nVan Walraven C, Naylor CD. \nDo we know what inappropriate laboratory utilization is? A systematic review of laboratory clinical audits\n. JAMA 1998; 280: 550-\n55\n8).\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nMany benchmarking studies have been carried out looking at the variation in laboratory test ordering between countries, regions and individual hospital wards or general practices. \nThe Diagnostic Atlas of Variation\n uses audit data that collects information \nabout the entire GP pathology workload reported within England. The data highlights huge differences in test requesting rates for commonly requested \ntests, much of which cannot be \nexpl\nained by differences in patient \ncase mix between primary care trusts or \ngeneral practices. \nWhile there may be other factors to explain \nsome of the variation, t\nhe implication is that there are large instances of both over-requesting and under-requesting of pathology tests.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nWhile this may be down to variable knowledge of ho\nw to b\nest use laboratory tests among\n GPs, there is also the problem of specific test availability, with an effective “diagnostics by postcode” system in place\n. This means\n that some of the newer tests are not available at all in some regions of the country \ndue to cost or lack of awareness\n. An example of this is\n B-type natriuretic peptide\n testing for heart failure, where there is patchy use ranging from high to none at all.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nInappropriate over-testing has significant effects on financial expenditure, not only on the direct cost to the laboratory, but also as a result of the costs of subsequent \nunnecessary, knock-\non investigations that may be ordered following the inevitable fa\nlse positive result. The damage to patient care may\n,\n however\n,\n be even more significant, with inappropriate investigations leading to inappropriate interpretation and indeed incorrect diagnoses. In addition, the diversion of much valued resources towards pa\nying for unnecessary investigations means that the opportunity cost that could be used to accelerate much needed new developments and services is delayed or even lost. Under-requesting has similar effects with many patients missing out on much needed inves\ntigations\n,\n resulting in missed or delayed diagnosis or management.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n              \nPatients rely on their GP\ns\n to request the right tests to correctly diagnose and monitor a range of health conditions\n, such as diabetes or heart disease\n. GPs also use a range of tests t\no screen people at risk of a disease \neven where there\n is no evidence of the disease. The National Institute for Health \nand \nCare Excellence (NICE) has issued a number of guidelines for the use of pathology laboratory tests by GPs. Despite this, The Royal Co\nllege of Pathologists has evidence that GPs’ use of\n these tests is highly variable. It is \ntoo often not cost-effective and not always in the best interests of patients. The College thinks that more specialist pathologist input into GP requesting of tests c\nan improve efficiency.  \n&#xa0;\n4              Magnitude of variation&#xa0;4.1\n              \nThe College has collated evidence \nthat \nincludes studies \nexamining\n the use by GP practices\n of a number of tests including:\n&#xa0;4.2\n              \nHbA1C (diabetes): O’Kane et al (Annals of Clinical Biochemistry 2011;48: 155-158)\n reported on the requests for  HbA1C (diabetes) and thyroid function tests in one year by 58 practices covering 284,609 patients in N\northern\n Ireland. There was wide variability in test request rates and the practices with the highest requ\nest rates for these tests were also the highest requesters for all other blood tests. \nThere was no relationship between request rates for HbA1c and thyroid function and the known prevalence of diabetes and hypothyroidism respectively or with Quality and \nOutcome Framework scores used through the \nGeneral Medical Services \ncontract to remunerate GP practices.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nThe Atlas of Variation Data (not yet published) showed wide variation in the testing for and monitoring of ovarian cancer. \nCarbohydrate antigen 125\n (CA-125)\n, is\n \na protein found on the surface of ovarian cancer cells, and in some normal tissues\n. It \nis a \ntumour marker for ovarian cancer. Traditionally, the C\nA-\n125 test has been used to monito\nr treatment for ovarian cancer and to \ndetect whether cancer has returned after treatment has been completed. CA-125 is also elevated in association with other ovarian pathologies. Most of the use for both of these tests is in the confirmation of a suspected diagnosis and in the monitoring of t\nhe response to treatment. Specialist units are the main users of these tests, although some testing takes place in general practice. Data regarding use of this test is available for Primary Care Trust \n(PCT) \nlevel only\n.\n&#xa0;4.4\n              \nFor PCTs in England, the estimat\ned rate of use for CA\n-\n125 tests ordered by GPs ranged from 0.11 to 9.0 per 1\n,\n000 practice population (80-fold variation). When the five PCTs with the highest estimated rates and the five PCTs with the lowest estimated \nrates are excluded, the range \nis \n0.92-\n8.4 per 1\n,\n000 practice population and the variation 9-fold. This is not due to differences in the prevalence of ovarian cancer. Some variation probably reflects differences in professional practice and commissioning prioritisation. \n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nThe variation show\nn for\n the CA-125 \ntest is seen across almost every test investigated in this study for the Atlas of Variation\n.\n (The \nAtlas of Variation Data has not yet been released for publication; \nthe data are obtained as part of a data quality audit and subject to stric\nt governance protocols. Pathology messages to primary care were intercepted for a period of 23 days in June 2012. In all 1.8 million messages containing samples of 38 million test results for approximately \n3 \nmillion patients on 1,029 tests from 152 NHS lab\noratory sources were analysed\n. \nI\nt\ns data is intended to support local decision making to increase the value \nthat \na population receives from the resources spent on their healthcare\n.\n)\n&#xa0;\n4.6\n              \nRegardless of whether the variation reveals over or under requesting, this variation reflects inefficient use of NHS resource and may indicate overall unacceptable levels of health care. \n&#xa0;\n5.              Pathology Demand Optimisation (PDO)&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nIn 2013, the RCPath set\n up a Pathology Demand Optimisation (PDO) Group comprised of representatives from the major pathology disciplines, pathology societies, industry representatives, the National Pathology Programme and lay involvement. The purpose of this initiative was to al\nlow the major pathology stakeholders to work with already established leaders in the field of Laboratory Demand Management research to enable the development of specific Pathology Demand Management Guidance in the form of a toolkit of recommendations and a\n Minimum Retesting Interval (MRI) advisory strategy. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nThe \nuse of \nMRIs is\n of vital importance and aim\ns\n to define the minimum time interval whereby tests should be repeated\n. This avoids\n unnecessary repeat testing – a common problem in secondary care with laboratory tests frequently being repeated whenever the patient crosses an interface of care\n,\n such as a ward transfer. This is of increasing importance following commissioning and the in\nherent risk of multiple pathology providers. While developments with the N\na\nt\nional Laboratory Medicine Catalogue\n (NLMC)\n, which should improve communication and transferability of pathology \nresults, will help, the availability of consensus, peer reviewed or \nin some cases evidence based MRIs are essential.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nWhen MRIs are defined\n,\n they will need to be implemented.\n&#xa0;\n The benefits of defining and implementing MRI\ns\n include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nIn summary, Pathology Demand Optimisation is of vital importance to \nensure the right test is done to\n th\ne right patient at the right time, ensuring the \nbest \nuse of scarce NHS resource and the best possible outcomes for patients. The RCPath continues to drive this process through initiatives such as the NLMC \nto improve \nthe\n interoperability (sharing) of p\na\nthology test results and the Pathology Demand Optimisation\n guidance \nto provide \na c\nonsistent approach to managing requests for pathology testing\n.\n.\n6.              Reconfiguration&#xa0;6.1\n              \nThe RCPath\n \nsupports the development of consolidated networks for pathology \nservices t\no\n help improve the quality and safety of patient care as outlined in \nThe Report of the Second Phase of the Review of NHS Pathology Services in England\n, December 2008\n (\nT\nhe Carter Review). \nThis said that, “\nService consolidation is necessary to transform path\nology services so that they can respond swiftly to the challenges presented by innovation …, system reform across the NHS and reform of the workforce. \nConsolidation provides \nthe means\n of improving service quality, responsiveness and cost-effectiveness by \ne\nnabling resources\n to be reinvested in pathology services. Reinvestment of savings is essential to\n \ndeliver and assure service quality, and to support the rapid adoption of innovative new\n \ntechnology and new approaches to the delivery of pathology services.\n”\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nThe College thinks that \nthe \npicture today is radically different from Lord Carter’s vis\ni\non; far from a service that is integrated and patient-centred the commissioning process \nhas so fare \nbeen driven by \nfinancial\n considerations. \n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nThe College has warned that that there will be a detrimental effect on services from failed reconfigurations, as well as \nthe \nhigh cost\ns\n incurred. Using information from a Freedom of Information request, the \nHealth Service Journal\n (HSJ) put at £2\n \nm\nillion\n th\ne central costs of three regional pathology reorganisations in th\ne former NHS Midlands and East Strategic Health a\nuthority (\nHSJ\n 30 August 2013).\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nMost recently, a \n£500\n \nm\nillion\n pathology reorganisation \nin \nthe West\n Midlands \ncollapsed after \nthe \ncommissioners opted to abandon a controversial procurement exercise\n (\nH\nSJ\n, 16 September 2013).\n6.5\n              \nOther \ndrains\n on resources when there is uncertainty over \nreconfiguration include\n:\n wasted staff time; lower productivity and \npoor \nstaff morale; problems retain\ning and \nrecruiting \nstaff\n and \nthe resulting need to recruit from agencies. All of these issues risk affecting affect the service provided and the quality of patient care.\n&#xa0;\n6.6\n              \nThe College is \nworking to address some of these concerns with the \nproduction of:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.7\n              \nIt \nis vital\n that pathology services are designed and built around patient need. As a \nmajor clinical service dri\nving most healthcare decisions, pathology is the keystone of diagnoses and treatment. \nDuring this period of large scale pathology reconfiguration and commissioning of services to multiple providers it is vital that pathology services are efficient and reta\nin sufficient quality and consistency across the NHS. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
