[normal]Written evidence from

[normal] (CYS0078)
[normal]I urge the committee to conduct a full economic assessment of the costs to society of motorised transport.  These costs should include measure of:
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]costs
[normal] of road maintenance, with consideration to the fact that damage to roads increases exponentially with vehicle weight (basic physics).

[normal]costs of lung diseases caused by pollution
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]costs of obesity and diabetes (among other diseases) which are in large part c
[normal]aused by immobility

[normal]cost
[normal]s
[normal] of dedicating massive areas of cities to road surfaces and parking. This would include for example damage caused by flooding due to poor water absorption in areas that are heavily sealed

[normal]costs of environmental damage

[normal]costs of clea
[normal]ning up after cars

[normal]costs of having to sound proof buildings near roads
[normal]-

[normal]costs of pollution damage to public and private buildings
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]costs of licencing, policing, administration and accounting associated with motorised transport
[normal]This is a partial list, but a
[normal] t
[normal]ally of such costs 
[normal]will help:
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the committee to begin to appreciate that any costs absorbed through infrastructure investment in cycling are miniscule in comparison to the massive costs absorbed to maintain motorised transport.

[normal]to counter the idiotic statem
[normal]ents made by motorists who suggest that the road tax they pay covers the costs of damage
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]us to begin to understand that motorised vehicles cost society heavily in many different ways
[normal]Finally, the committee should appreciate that
[normal],
[normal] with the majority of voter
[normal]s being motorists, politicians will find it 
[normal]difficult to do the right thing with regard to transport policy. 
[normal] 
[normal]There will always be costs associated with the need for transport.   We should understand these costs and then appreciate that progress can be ma
[normal]de with cycling, which incurs far fewer costs and even provides health benefit.
[normal]It is a no-
[normal]brainer, but there are a lot of
[normal] low-brainers out there 
[normal]who
[normal] have been stopping progress away
[normal] from our bike unfriendly infrastructure.
