[[[&#xa0;]]]About ACCAACCA is the global body for professional accountants. We aim to offer business-relevant, first-choice qualifications to people around the world who seek a rewarding career in accountancy, finance and management.&#xa0;We support our 162,000 members and 428,000 students in 173 countries helping them to develop successful careers in accounting and business, with the skills needed by employers. We work through a network of over 89 offices and centres and 8,500 Approved Employers worldwide, who provide high standards of employee learning and development. Through our public interest remit, we promote appropriate regulation of accounting and conduct relevant research to ensure accountancy continues to grow in reputation and influence.&#xa0;The expertise of our senior members and in-house technical experts allows ACCA to provide informed opinion on a range of financial, regulatory, public sector and business areas, including: taxation (business and personal); small business; pensions; education; and corporate governance and corporate social responsibility. &#xa0;The new approach to tax policy making &#xa0;1.      be fair. The Committee accepts that not all commentators will agree on the detail of what constitutes a fair tax, but a tax system which is considered to be fundamentally unfair will ultimately fail to command consent.&#xa0;2.      support growth and encourage competition.&#xa0;3.      provide certainty. In virtually all circumstances the application of the tax rules should be certain. It should not normally be necessary for anyone to resort to the courts in order to resolve how the rules operate in relation to his or her tax affairs.&#xa0;4.      provide stability. Changes to the underlying rules should be kept to a minimum and policy shocks should both be avoided. There should be a justifiable economic and/or social basis for any change to the tax rules and this justification should be made public and the underlying policy made clear.&#xa0;5.      The Committee also considers that it is important that a person's tax liability should be easy to calculate and straightforward and cheap to collect. To this end, tax policy should be practicable.&#xa0;6.      Finally, the tax system as a whole must be coherent. New provisions should complement the existing tax system, not conflict with it.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Taxation of partnerships  Specific provisions of Sch 1,2,3,4 1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Partnerships have been identified by HMRC as an area where existing tax provisions are particularly susceptible to abuse. While it is of course important that abuse is targeted and counteracted, it is important that the pursuit of wrongdoing is not allowed to cloud HMRC judgement in seeking to frame changes to tax treatment which will have significant commercial impact on otherwise compliant taxpayers. 2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the impact assessments, the new provisions are consistently described as ensuring that affected individuals ‘will now be required to pay the correct amount of tax and NICs at broadly the right time’. As a matter of legislative interpretation, it might be considered impossible for the existing provisions to ensure that the wrong amount of tax is collected, but if, as appears to be the case, the existing provisions allow the ‘wrong amount’ of tax to be paid, or at the ‘wrong time’ then it is the legislation, or the individuals taking advantage of it, which are at fault. The compliant majority of partnerships are not at fault, and should not suffer either materially or reputationally as a result of their choice of business form.     Part 1, Salaried members3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is an underlying structural trend to the broader relationship between taxpayer and state that entrepreneurs who take the risks and rewards of self-employment pay a lower burden in taxes to the State. However, they are also entitled to fewer tax-funded benefits from the State, and many of the legal protections available to employees are not available to the self-employed. It is of course the case that they are not really appropriate in the business relationship between a self-employed individual and their customers/trading partners, as the counterparty will not have assumed the responsibilities which are attendant upon an employer. Conversely, employees, who are granted a higher level of statutory protections and State benefits, pay a higher price in taxation. 4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Accordingly, if the true nature of the relationship is one of employment, rather than entrepreneurial assumption of risk on the part of the ‘partner’ then it is perhaps reasonable to reflect this in the taxation of the parties to the relationship. But the corollary to imposing the burden of employee taxation on the relationship should be extending the corresponding benefits of it to the parties. It should be the case that those being taxed as employees are treated for all purposes as employees and not simply the case that the payments are taxed ‘as if they were employment income’. 5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The payment should become employment income, and the individuals treated in every way as employees (and the LLP as employer). If that is the legal reality then it should apply as such in every aspect of the State’s relationship with the parties to the relevant contract. Where LLP membership has been imposed as an abusive treatment of low paid workers, the additional imposition of employment taxes without extension of the full protections of employment status in law could effectively place the workers in a worse position than before. 6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In terms of the practical application of the 3 tests, there are a number of potential practical issues. While it is understandable that the existing Employment Status Manual Tests have been rejected as in inappropriate in a significant proportion of partnership cases (as they do not take adequate account of capital contributions in a partnership context) the shift to a new test will inevitably introduce some element of short term uncertainty. 7)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is likely to be a degree of uncertainty in the longer term arising out of the introduction of a new test of ‘significant influence’ in the legislation, which is not further defined in the legislation. While HMRC guidance is welcome in this area, the fact remains that this will of course not be binding and greater certainty for taxpayers must wait upon judicial pronouncement.8)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While the quanta of the two financial tests will always be subject to debate, there is a more fundamental aspect of their measurement which is likely to give rise to some practical administrative difficulty for partnerships. The measurement of fixed/variable salary appears from the guidance to be tied to the partnership’s accounting year, which aligns with the usual allocation of profits. The measurement of salary by reference to capital contribution however falls to be measured over the fiscal year, which may or may not align with the partnerships accounting year. The inconsistency in measurement will impose an administrative burden for any partnerships which account other than on the fiscal year, doubling the number of calculations required.Part 2, Mixed memberships9)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Underlying these provisions is the difficult policy question of whether LLPs should have a level playing field with other corporate bodies when accumulating reserves for future investment. A growing company will retain profits after deduction of corporation tax at the appropriate rates; to the extent that its members are individuals an LLP will lose the additional capacity to invest equivalent to the additional income tax and NICs. 10)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The counter proposition is of course that individual members can effectively defer an element of their personal tax liability if they can divert profits to a personally controlled corporate member of the partnership. Equally, if partnerships are presumed to be transparent on the part of the partner, there should be no policy objection to taxing the profits arising relate to investment of capital on the basis otherwise set down in law for returns to capital, in the knowledge that this will incur a corresponding loss of State benefits and statutory entitlements. 11)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Once again, we find ourselves quickly exposing the bedrock of tax principles – should returns on capital be taxed at a differential rate to returns on labour? And should entrepreneurial returns be taxed at a differential rate to employed labour? Currently the position in the UK is that an individual can effectively ‘buy the right’ to capital tax treatment on returns by purchasing or setting up a limited company, a relatively cheap and trivial operation. Having once established the machinery for transmission of funds under the guise of returns on capital, it becomes a question of fact in each individual case whether that treatment is actually in line with the legal provisions of the taxing acts. 12)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Analysis of the intention of Parliament when considering the taxation of returns on capital, or ‘unearned income’, is notoriously complex as legislation and case law may span many decades and radical shifts in policy intent, and indeed rates of taxation which can fundamentally change the impact of given provisions over time. 13)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The mere fact that a mechanism can be abused is not in itself justification for outlawing it, if there also exist legitimate and indeed beneficial uses for that mechanism. Accordingly any restriction on the use of the mechanism should be appropriate and proportionate, and not unduly hamper legitimate activities. However, the proposals as drafted would effectively prevent LLPs from accruing reserves at the same rates as other limited liability trading vehicles, since any control on the part of the members of the partnership over the corporate member would subject all those profits to the differential taxation which the mechanism seeks to counteract. Equally, the partnership as a body of individuals with a common aim could not reasonably be expected to pass control of the partnership profits to a totally unconnected and uncontrollable third party. 14)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The provisions in relation to allocation of losses appear less potentially controversial given that loss allocation is more likely to be tax motivated in its entirety.Part 3, AIFM partnerships deferred remuneration15)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As befits the complexity of the underlying provisions which require the adjustments to the tax accounting in respect of deferred remuneration, the partnerships provisions (especially in respect of capital gains tax treatment) appear initially complex. However, it is relevant in this context that those partnerships and individuals involved in this aspect of the tax system should by definition be financially literate and able to deal with complicated legislation. 16)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One aspect which may be of commercial concern to those partnerships affected is the treatment of deferred remuneration which does not ultimately vest. In such cases, the Exchequer will retain the initial payment of tax at 45%, but will in addition collect tax at the appropriate rate from any further member to whom the available funds are allocated, effectively subjecting the partnership to double taxation on those profits. 17)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While there may be some policy justification behind such provisions to curtail the award of unrealistic or utterly speculative awards, there is nevertheless a concern that in the event of a significant market fall, effectively preventing any managers from achieving their targets, the partnership (which is already likely to be in financial difficulty) will have suffered a heavier burden of taxation than an equivalent business not subject to the rules. 18)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Part 4, Disposal of assets through partnerships19)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The taxation of capital assets in partnerships is equally an area of difficulty for partners and tax practitioners alike. The targeted anti-avoidance rule proposed in the relevant provisions of the draft Finance Bill consider a comparatively restricted subset of possible transactions within the partnership itself, and should by their nature be applicable only in limited circumstances. While they are potentially burdensome in application, the reliance upon an ‘intention’ test should restrict their imposition to those situations where taxpayers are deliberately seeking an advantage by means of contrived and artificial mechanisms, thereby levelling the playing field for compliant taxpayers. As such, the complexity can be rationalised, but as is a theme of the OTS Interim Report on Partnerships) there would be a broader benefit in wider simplification of the tax regime for partnerships based upon a clear recognition by HMRC and policy makers of the difficulties caused by the current failure to clearly and explicitly address the issues faced by one of the most popular and important business structures in the UK’s economy. Broader policy considerations20)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As is noted by the OTS Interim Report, to which Chas Roy-Chowdhury, ACCA head of taxation contributed as a member of the Consultative Committee, the taxation of partnerships generally is an area where the technical complexities of dealing with an extremely flexible and diverse vehicle are exacerbated by the administrative difficulties of the law and policy being at times difficult to identify. A more coordinated approach to the presentation of the tax law on partnerships, and clearer lines of communication with, and within, HMRC would help to resolve many of the practical difficulties which aggravate the compliance burden for partnerships. 21)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The problems are particularly pronounced for smaller partnerships undertaking the sorts of transactions which, while significant and (across the population as a whole) perhaps relatively common, they will only enter into exceptionally – for example, introduction of new members/capital, or departure of the same. Uncertainty or ignorance around the tax implications of what will in any case be significant commercial decisions for the partnership should be reduced as far as possible. ACCA fully supports the 12 “Short Term Fixes” identified by the OTS in their Interim Report.22)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The OTS report also considers the more fundamental step of bringing LLPs within the charge to corporation tax, or alternatively treating them as taxable persons subject to income tax in their own right (with appropriate relief for taxes already paid being given on subsequent drawings). As the OTS notes, both options would fundamentally change the tax treatment of LLPs away from that envisaged in the original legislation involving significant redrafting. Nevertheless, the quoted example of a purported partnership of 20,000 members highlights the issues facing HMRC. 23)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A longer term review of partnership structures might consider a greater degree of regulation for larger partnerships, along the lines of the differential regulation for different sizes and types of limited liability companies. A requirement for registration and returns in respect of any partnership with memberships above a certain threshold might enable HMRC to manage resources and compliance more effectively. While there may be a growth in partnerships manufactured to fall just below the threshold, this would in itself be a factor in risk assessment. Such issues are however matters of business law rather than tax law, and would therefore fall outside the scope of any pure tax review. APPENDIX – ACCA Report: Simplicity in the Tax System.
