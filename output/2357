defaultCranfield University’s Centre for Environmental Risks and Futures 
default(CERF) 
defaultwelcomes this opportunity to offer written evidence to the Science and Technology Committee’s inquiry into 
defaultGovernment Horizon Scanning. CERF 
defaultforms part of the Department for Environmental Science and Technology in Cranfield University’s School of Applied S

defaultCERF 
defaultis currently commissioned by Defra to provide a full programme of horizon scanning and futures research to the Department, its network of agencies and both the Scottish and Welsh Governments. 
defaultOn behalf of Cranfield University, this 
defaultevidence
default 
defaulthas been prepared by Fiona Lickorish, who is Head of the Centre for Environmental Risks and Futures at Cranfield University.

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFiona Lickorish
default has over 20 years experience in undertaking environmental futures research and long-term impact assessment in the private, third and public sectors. She joined Cranfield University in April 2011, prior to which she was Head of Horizon Scanning and Futures
default at Defra from 2005 to 2011, where she led a programme of futures research, that included a review of all the research undertaken within the Defra Futures Programme between 2002 and 2005. 
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHorizon scanning is one of a number of tools that futures research
defaulters use which can be employed to test future policy and strategy
default. P
defaultractitioners do not normally use the term horizon scanning to describe all futures research techniques: it is one method in a wider toolkit used by futures research practitioners
default and is
default the
default act of gathering new insights that may point us towards affirming or discrediting existing trends and developments, as well as identifying new and emerging trends and developments which will impact on our lives in the future.
default The Jon Day Review appears to
default use the term to describe wider futures research methods. For the purposes of this submission, we will use the term ‘futures research’ to describe the
default full range of
default methods used by futures practitioners to analyse possible futures. 
defaultWhere the term ‘horizon 
defaultscanning
default’
default is used, 
defaultit describes the action set out above. 
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are a number of observable differences in undertaking futures research from other, perhaps more familiar research methods. We do not go into detail here, but suggest that should Committee me
defaultmbers so wish, they may find value in reading the review of futures research undertaken by Defra (2006), but which does not appear as part of the literature review undertaken as part of the Day Review. We consider that a good understanding of these differe
defaultnces is key in helping Ministers and senior officials to understand, develop and use the outputs of futures research. Additionally, it should be noted that a number of the recommendations made in the Day Review reflect those identified in the earlier Defra
default work.

defaultHow do Government departments make use of horizon scanning?
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment departments, and 
defaultoften 
defaultgroups within departments, vary both in the way they use futures research, and in the depth to which they 
defaultapply such 
defaultresearch
default to policy and practice
default. In our experience the main uses are to: 
default&#xa0;default4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow effective is horizon scanning in Government? Do Ministers and senior officials consider horizon scanning outputs appropriately?
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe effectiveness o
defaultf futures research in Government is variable, and is conditioned by a range of factors, some of which are internal to 
defaultD
defaultepartments, some of which are driven by external imperatives and pressures.
default Below, we identify some key factors that
default, in our experience,
default condition whether futures research is effective or not.
default&#xa0;default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne key factor is the need for 
defaultconsiderable resource input from, and engagement by, domain experts
default 
default(e.g. 
defaultscientific specialists in the subject in question
default)
default, and policy- and decision-makers in Govern
defaultment. 
defaultWhilst successful research generally requires a measure of user engagement
default, 
defaulteffective 
defaultfutures research requires continuous involvement of those wishing to use the outputs of the research from procurement to delivery. 
defaultIn short, t
defaulto benefit from 
defaultfutures
default 
defaultresearch
default 
defaultrequires
default 
defaultan investment of 
defaultsustained effort from all those involved, things that are often in short supply in today’s Government. Lack of time 
defaultunderstandably 
defaultoften leads officials
default and 
defaultMinisters
default 
defaultto have to 
defaultconcentrate on delivery of the current age
defaultnda with little time to focus on the future. 
default&#xa0;default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe effectiveness of futures research is dependent on those commissioning the research understand
defaulting
default what it can, but 
defaultequally
default importantly, what it cannot provide. For example, there is a tendency to want prediction
default. Futures
default research cannot provide 
defaultthis because the future is generally not predictable
default,
default so 
defaultthe research is
default a tool 
defaultto
default enable policy
default-
defaultmakers
default and politicians 
defaultto reflect on
default how their recommendations and decisions might unfold in a number of possible futures rather than rely on a single explicit or implicit route to the future. This is important, for example, in infrastructure planning and implementation given the timescales 
defaultinvolved which can span decades
default: the imperatives of today, may - or may not - be relevant at the point at which the infrastructure development is completed, so thinking in structured terms about what that future might look like should be helpful
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTherefor
defaulte, to be truly effective, futures research should be used as a tool to enable policy
default-
defaultmakers to test assumptions against a range of possible futures, and to provide orientation around how policy development and decision
default-
defaultmaking may work – or may need to work
default – in the future. The outputs will not be a reflection of the status quo: some methods are specifically designed to shift recipients from their current world view and to enable them to think about what is possible and plausible, not just what is probable. 
defaultIt can therefore create discomfort because it challenges the current world view.
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUsing f
defaultutures research can be
default challenged by the 
defaultpragmatic 
defaultneed to b
defaultalanc
defaulte
default responding to immediate policy imperatives
default against emergent ones or those where impacts may not be f
defaultelt until years to come. 
defaultHarold M
defaulta
defaultcMillan may be 
defaultmis
defaultquoted in apparently speaking of  
default“events
default,
default dear boy
default,
default events”
default, but there is a reality in
default this that often favours
default 
defaultthe immediate 
defaultrather than 
defaultthe 
defaultemergen
defaultt.
default Yet, considering the 
defaultfuture
default 
defaultcan enable a more 
defaultefficient and effective use of diminishing resources
default,
default which has the potential to gain savings for the tax payer
default. P
defaultolicies that are 
default‘
defaultfuture
default-
defaultproofed
default’
default can be more sustainable and adaptable to changing circumstances, which saves resources. 
defaultFor 
defaultexample
default, 
defaultfutures
default research 
default(in this case, grounded in understanding demography) 
defaultcould have 
defaulthelped school place planning:
default we effectively count births and changes in the birth rate, yet seem challenged to relate this to planning the requisite number of school places.
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPoliti
defaultcians as well as policy makers can find futures research challenging: a proportion understand and engage with it and promote its use, bu
defaultt 
defaultthe imperatives of short-term pressures 
defaultmay 
defaultsimply crowd out 
defaulttaking the 
defaultlonger-term view
default that often drives the reason 
defaultto engage in politics in the first 
defaultplace. 
defaultWe understand th
defaultis
default, not least in an era of economic challenge and austerity, but suggest that better embedding of futures research into the fabric 
defaultof 
defaultdecision-making, coupled with senior political 
defaultand official’s 
defaultsu
defaultpport for it, might help in balancing the short- and longer-terms.  
default&#xa0;
default5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat changes could be made to improve existing horizon scanning activity? Will the recommendations made in Jon Day’s review of cross-government horizon scanning capability address current shortcomings? What progress has been made implementing these? 
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe be
defaultlieve that the Day recommendations are generally well founded, but that some further nuances and steps would help to deliver the recommendations.
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFutures research uses recognised social science and organisational management participatory 
defaultmethods (expert e
defaultlicitation interviews, questionnaires and workshop techniques)
default, coupled with secondary research including desk-based analysis of relevant research and datasets,
default to identify all aspects of whichever issue being investigated. These include using domain exper
defaultts to identify and understand the interactions between the political, economic, social, technological, legislative and environmental drivers of change (PESTLE analysis), to gain an understanding of whole systems, rather than projections of individual drive
defaultrs
default of change
default. 
defaultGiven this, i
defaultt
default 
defaultmay 
defaultbe best placed under the management of 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment social science profession whose members have a better understanding of the utility of the outputs of research using social science techniques.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCurrently
default, many futures 
defaultresearch projects
default and programmes
default are managed by and report to, central departmental evidence and strategy teams. The research programmes of these teams 
defaultcan be 
defaultdominated by economic research and managed by 
defaultspecialists
default whose training 
defaultrightly 
defaultlends them to gi
defaultve more weight to data
default sourced by more traditional means
default, but who can sometimes find it 
defaultchallenging
default to understand and give credence to the less 
defaultdefined
default outputs gathered using 
defaultfutures research methods
default. Futures research outputs therefore, are
default often perceived
default to be less robust
default, which can lead to a perception that there is less imperative to take action
default. Many 
defaultspecialist
default evidence managers and policy-
defaultmakers are therefore, reluctant to allocate precious time and resources to 
defaultthe 
defaultissues identified by futures resear
defaultch until a greater weight of evidence to sup
defaultport action is available. T
defaulthere is a delicate balance to be 
defaultstruck
default between acting too early and potentially wasting resources or waiting until the weight of evidence is overwhelming
default. However, this has potential to 
defaultleav
defaulte
default action too late
default: at best, this may involve additional cost, at worst, it results in the sort of failure that 
defaultthe 
defaultpolicy process seeks to avoid.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFutures research has a creative dimension and 
defaultmethods are often describ
defaulted in 
defaultlanguage that isn’t
default necessarily familiar to policy-
defaultmakers. We 
defaultfind
default that 
defaultdescribing outputs 
defaultusing the language of risk 
defaultassessment and 
defaultman
defaultagement
default,
default 
defaultwhich is more familiar to Government senior officials, can greatly assist in embedding understanding
default. Cra
defaultnfield University has pioneered the integration of risk analysis tools to complement the outputs of futures research with more robust analysis of where future risks and opportunities might lie, and where and when to intervene to gain best value for 
defaultthe tax
defaultpayer. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultwhilst this has helped improve use of outputs for those already familiar with risk terminology, 
defaultwe also identify that training for officials needs to include developing familiarity and understanding of the applications and benefits of both 
defaultfutures and risk research in the policy-making community. 
defaultAdditionally
default, the involvement of Departmental risk managers can be key in 
defaultchallenging, supporting and 
defaultembedding the outputs of futures research with 
defaultpolicy-makers, senior officials and politicians. 
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst the Day Review sets out a new definition for ‘horizon scanning’ 
defaultacross Government 
defaultthis actually appears to be a definition of futures research. As described earlier, horizon scanning is one of a number of futures research techniques. Government’s 
defaultcontinued use of ‘horizon scanning’ as a catch-all term for all futures research techniques is detrimental in facilitating understanding between policy
default advisors, politicians as decision makers, 
defaultand practitioners. This has the potential to lead to misunders
defaulttandings during 
defaultresearch commissioning and 
defaultprocess, which wastes time and resources on both sides
default, and can create frustration
default. Additionally, it does not demonstrate to 
defaultresearchers
default that Government is an intelligent customer of futures research
default, 
defaultcompromising
default best value
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Day Review proposes the identification and use of high-level champions for futures research in Government. This 
defaultreflects established wisdom and experience, and 
defaultwe agree that high-level champion
defaults
default for futures research would be instrumental
default in helping to embed futures thinking across Government and in individual Departments
default. This should 
defaultbuild on the work undertaken by Prof Sir David King and the late Prof Sir Howard Dalton, who 
defaultboth 
defaultpioneered the use of futures research methods to support de
defaultcision-making, across Government and in Defra respectively. 
default&#xa0;
default5.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFutures research outputs are a tool to test developing policy to ensure 
defaultresilience
default to future requirements. The next step in using this research to test policy and identify future implications
default,
default h
defaultas until recently been undertaken or led by policy experts within Departments. However, the Day Review suggests that policy-makers now have an expectation that futures research practitioners will identify and provide implications for the future. 
defaultWe presume
default that this reflects Cabinet Office guidance and thinking in outsourcing policy. 
defaultThis is challenging
default for futures research
default: futures researchers are only rarely domain or policy experts in the policy areas they help Departments to investigate – more often, th
defaultey bring new dimensions, evidence, insight and act as facilitators to help experts to identify the implications of future developments for themselves. Policy makers and politicians 
default– or their advisors or delegates - 
defaultneed to be equipped to seek and absorb 
defaultt
defaulthis 
defaultexpertise and insight, compute it, and then make informed decisions. 
defaultTherefore, taken at face value, the recommendation
default represents a step change that will demand a shift in the role of researchers, and has accompanying resource shift implications
default.

defaultHow effective is the Government at responding to policy or regulatory challenges presented by new technologies? 
default&#xa0;
default6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe consider that futures research could help Government in the early identification of the challenges presented by new technologies and use the
default followi
defaultng examples to illustrate this:
