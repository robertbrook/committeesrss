[normal]Introduction
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cranfield University’s Centre for Environmental Risks and Futures 
[normal](CERF) 
[normal]welcomes this opportunity to offer written evidence to the Science and Technology Committee’s inquiry into 
[normal]Government Horizon Scanning. CERF 
[normal]forms part of the Department for Environmental Science and Technology in Cranfield University’s School of Applied S
[normal]cience
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]CERF 
[normal]is currently commissioned by Defra to provide a full programme of horizon scanning and futures research to the Department, its network of agencies and both the Scottish and Welsh Governments. 
[normal]On behalf of Cranfield University, this 
[normal]evidence
[normal] 
[normal]has been prepared by Fiona Lickorish, who is Head of the Centre for Environmental Risks and Futures at Cranfield University. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Fiona Lickorish
[normal] has over 20 years experience in undertaking environmental futures research and long-term impact assessment in the private, third and public sectors. She joined Cranfield University in April 2011, prior to which she was Head of Horizon Scanning and Futures
[normal] at Defra from 2005 to 2011, where she led a programme of futures research, that included a review of all the research undertaken within the Defra Futures Programme between 2002 and 2005. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Horizon scanning is one of a number of tools that futures research
[normal]ers use which can be employed to test future policy and strategy
[normal]. P
[normal]ractitioners do not normally use the term horizon scanning to describe all futures research techniques: it is one method in a wider toolkit used by futures research practitioners
[normal] and is
[normal] the
[normal] act of gathering new insights that may point us towards affirming or discrediting existing trends and developments, as well as identifying new and emerging trends and developments which will impact on our lives in the future.
[normal] The Jon Day Review appears to
[normal] use the term to describe wider futures research methods. For the purposes of this submission, we will use the term ‘futures research’ to describe the
[normal] full range of
[normal] methods used by futures practitioners to analyse possible futures. 
[normal]Where the term ‘horizon 
[normal]scanning
[normal]’
[normal] is used, 
[normal]it describes the action set out above. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are a number of observable differences in undertaking futures research from other, perhaps more familiar research methods. We do not go into detail here, but suggest that should Committee me
[normal]mbers so wish, they may find value in reading the review of futures research undertaken by Defra (2006), but which does not appear as part of the literature review undertaken as part of the Day Review. We consider that a good understanding of these differe
[normal]nces is key in helping Ministers and senior officials to understand, develop and use the outputs of futures research. Additionally, it should be noted that a number of the recommendations made in the Day Review reflect those identified in the earlier Defra
[normal] work.

[normal]Key Points

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How do Government departments make use of horizon scanning?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government departments, and 
[normal]often 
[normal]groups within departments, vary both in the way they use futures research, and in the depth to which they 
[normal]apply such 
[normal]research
[normal] to policy and practice
[normal]. In our experience the main uses are to: 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How effective is horizon scanning in Government? Do Ministers and senior officials consider horizon scanning outputs appropriately?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The effectiveness o
[normal]f futures research in Government is variable, and is conditioned by a range of factors, some of which are internal to 
[normal]D
[normal]epartments, some of which are driven by external imperatives and pressures.
[normal] Below, we identify some key factors that
[normal], in our experience,
[normal] condition whether futures research is effective or not.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One key factor is the need for 
[normal]considerable resource input from, and engagement by, domain experts
[normal] 
[normal](e.g. 
[normal]scientific specialists in the subject in question
[normal])
[normal], and policy- and decision-makers in Govern
[normal]ment. 
[normal]Whilst successful research generally requires a measure of user engagement
[normal], 
[normal]effective 
[normal]futures research requires continuous involvement of those wishing to use the outputs of the research from procurement to delivery. 
[normal]In short, t
[normal]o benefit from 
[normal]futures
[normal] 
[normal]research
[normal] 
[normal]requires
[normal] 
[normal]an investment of 
[normal]sustained effort from all those involved, things that are often in short supply in today’s Government. Lack of time 
[normal]understandably 
[normal]often leads officials
[normal] and 
[normal]Ministers
[normal] 
[normal]to have to 
[normal]concentrate on delivery of the current age
[normal]nda with little time to focus on the future. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The effectiveness of futures research is dependent on those commissioning the research understand
[normal]ing
[normal] what it can, but 
[normal]equally
[normal] importantly, what it cannot provide. For example, there is a tendency to want prediction
[normal]. Futures
[normal] research cannot provide 
[normal]this because the future is generally not predictable
[normal],
[normal] so 
[normal]the research is
[normal] a tool 
[normal]to
[normal] enable policy
[normal]-
[normal]makers
[normal] and politicians 
[normal]to reflect on
[normal] how their recommendations and decisions might unfold in a number of possible futures rather than rely on a single explicit or implicit route to the future. This is important, for example, in infrastructure planning and implementation given the timescales 
[normal]involved which can span decades
[normal]: the imperatives of today, may - or may not - be relevant at the point at which the infrastructure development is completed, so thinking in structured terms about what that future might look like should be helpful
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Therefor
[normal]e, to be truly effective, futures research should be used as a tool to enable policy
[normal]-
[normal]makers to test assumptions against a range of possible futures, and to provide orientation around how policy development and decision
[normal]-
[normal]making may work – or may need to work
[normal] – in the future. The outputs will not be a reflection of the status quo: some methods are specifically designed to shift recipients from their current world view and to enable them to think about what is possible and plausible, not just what is probable. 
[normal]It can therefore create discomfort because it challenges the current world view.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Using f
[normal]utures research can be
[normal] challenged by the 
[normal]pragmatic 
[normal]need to b
[normal]alanc
[normal]e
[normal] responding to immediate policy imperatives
[normal] against emergent ones or those where impacts may not be f
[normal]elt until years to come. 
[normal]Harold M
[normal]a
[normal]cMillan may be 
[normal]mis
[normal]quoted in apparently speaking of  
[normal]“events
[normal],
[normal] dear boy
[normal],
[normal] events”
[normal], but there is a reality in
[normal] this that often favours
[normal] 
[normal]the immediate 
[normal]rather than 
[normal]the 
[normal]emergen
[normal]t.
[normal] Yet, considering the 
[normal]future
[normal] 
[normal]can enable a more 
[normal]efficient and effective use of diminishing resources
[normal],
[normal] which has the potential to gain savings for the tax payer
[normal]. P
[normal]olicies that are 
[normal]‘
[normal]future
[normal]-
[normal]proofed
[normal]’
[normal] can be more sustainable and adaptable to changing circumstances, which saves resources. 
[normal]For 
[normal]example
[normal], 
[normal]futures
[normal] research 
[normal](in this case, grounded in understanding demography) 
[normal]could have 
[normal]helped school place planning:
[normal] we effectively count births and changes in the birth rate, yet seem challenged to relate this to planning the requisite number of school places.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Politi
[normal]cians as well as policy makers can find futures research challenging: a proportion understand and engage with it and promote its use, bu
[normal]t 
[normal]the imperatives of short-term pressures 
[normal]may 
[normal]simply crowd out 
[normal]taking the 
[normal]longer-term view
[normal] that often drives the reason 
[normal]to engage in politics in the first 
[normal]place. 
[normal]We understand th
[normal]is
[normal], not least in an era of economic challenge and austerity, but suggest that better embedding of futures research into the fabric 
[normal]of 
[normal]decision-making, coupled with senior political 
[normal]and official’s 
[normal]su
[normal]pport for it, might help in balancing the short- and longer-terms.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What changes could be made to improve existing horizon scanning activity? Will the recommendations made in Jon Day’s review of cross-government horizon scanning capability address current shortcomings? What progress has been made implementing these? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We be
[normal]lieve that the Day recommendations are generally well founded, but that some further nuances and steps would help to deliver the recommendations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Futures research uses recognised social science and organisational management participatory 
[normal]methods (expert e
[normal]licitation interviews, questionnaires and workshop techniques)
[normal], coupled with secondary research including desk-based analysis of relevant research and datasets,
[normal] to identify all aspects of whichever issue being investigated. These include using domain exper
[normal]ts to identify and understand the interactions between the political, economic, social, technological, legislative and environmental drivers of change (PESTLE analysis), to gain an understanding of whole systems, rather than projections of individual drive
[normal]rs
[normal] of change
[normal]. 
[normal]Given this, i
[normal]t
[normal] 
[normal]may 
[normal]be best placed under the management of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government social science profession whose members have a better understanding of the utility of the outputs of research using social science techniques.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Currently
[normal], many futures 
[normal]research projects
[normal] and programmes
[normal] are managed by and report to, central departmental evidence and strategy teams. The research programmes of these teams 
[normal]can be 
[normal]dominated by economic research and managed by 
[normal]specialists
[normal] whose training 
[normal]rightly 
[normal]lends them to gi
[normal]ve more weight to data
[normal] sourced by more traditional means
[normal], but who can sometimes find it 
[normal]challenging
[normal] to understand and give credence to the less 
[normal]defined
[normal] outputs gathered using 
[normal]futures research methods
[normal]. Futures research outputs therefore, are
[normal] often perceived
[normal] to be less robust
[normal], which can lead to a perception that there is less imperative to take action
[normal]. Many 
[normal]specialist
[normal] evidence managers and policy-
[normal]makers are therefore, reluctant to allocate precious time and resources to 
[normal]the 
[normal]issues identified by futures resear
[normal]ch until a greater weight of evidence to sup
[normal]port action is available. T
[normal]here is a delicate balance to be 
[normal]struck
[normal] between acting too early and potentially wasting resources or waiting until the weight of evidence is overwhelming
[normal]. However, this has potential to 
[normal]leav
[normal]e
[normal] action too late
[normal]: at best, this may involve additional cost, at worst, it results in the sort of failure that 
[normal]the 
[normal]policy process seeks to avoid.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Futures research has a creative dimension and 
[normal]methods are often describ
[normal]ed in 
[normal]language that isn’t
[normal] necessarily familiar to policy-
[normal]makers. We 
[normal]find
[normal] that 
[normal]describing outputs 
[normal]using the language of risk 
[normal]assessment and 
[normal]man
[normal]agement
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]which is more familiar to Government senior officials, can greatly assist in embedding understanding
[normal]. Cra
[normal]nfield University has pioneered the integration of risk analysis tools to complement the outputs of futures research with more robust analysis of where future risks and opportunities might lie, and where and when to intervene to gain best value for 
[normal]the tax
[normal]payer. 
[normal]However, 
[normal]whilst this has helped improve use of outputs for those already familiar with risk terminology, 
[normal]we also identify that training for officials needs to include developing familiarity and understanding of the applications and benefits of both 
[normal]futures and risk research in the policy-making community. 
[normal]Additionally
[normal], the involvement of Departmental risk managers can be key in 
[normal]challenging, supporting and 
[normal]embedding the outputs of futures research with 
[normal]policy-makers, senior officials and politicians. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Whilst the Day Review sets out a new definition for ‘horizon scanning’ 
[normal]across Government 
[normal]this actually appears to be a definition of futures research. As described earlier, horizon scanning is one of a number of futures research techniques. Government’s 
[normal]continued use of ‘horizon scanning’ as a catch-all term for all futures research techniques is detrimental in facilitating understanding between policy
[normal] advisors, politicians as decision makers, 
[normal]and practitioners. This has the potential to lead to misunders
[normal]tandings during 
[normal]research commissioning and 
[normal]process, which wastes time and resources on both sides
[normal], and can create frustration
[normal]. Additionally, it does not demonstrate to 
[normal]researchers
[normal] that Government is an intelligent customer of futures research
[normal], 
[normal]compromising
[normal] best value
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Day Review proposes the identification and use of high-level champions for futures research in Government. This 
[normal]reflects established wisdom and experience, and 
[normal]we agree that high-level champion
[normal]s
[normal] for futures research would be instrumental
[normal] in helping to embed futures thinking across Government and in individual Departments
[normal]. This should 
[normal]build on the work undertaken by Prof Sir David King and the late Prof Sir Howard Dalton, who 
[normal]both 
[normal]pioneered the use of futures research methods to support de
[normal]cision-making, across Government and in Defra respectively. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Futures research outputs are a tool to test developing policy to ensure 
[normal]resilience
[normal] to future requirements. The next step in using this research to test policy and identify future implications
[normal],
[normal] h
[normal]as until recently been undertaken or led by policy experts within Departments. However, the Day Review suggests that policy-makers now have an expectation that futures research practitioners will identify and provide implications for the future. 
[normal]We presume
[normal] that this reflects Cabinet Office guidance and thinking in outsourcing policy. 
[normal]This is challenging
[normal] for futures research
[normal]: futures researchers are only rarely domain or policy experts in the policy areas they help Departments to investigate – more often, th
[normal]ey bring new dimensions, evidence, insight and act as facilitators to help experts to identify the implications of future developments for themselves. Policy makers and politicians 
[normal]– or their advisors or delegates - 
[normal]need to be equipped to seek and absorb 
[normal]t
[normal]his 
[normal]expertise and insight, compute it, and then make informed decisions. 
[normal]Therefore, taken at face value, the recommendation
[normal] represents a step change that will demand a shift in the role of researchers, and has accompanying resource shift implications
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How effective is the Government at responding to policy or regulatory challenges presented by new technologies? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We consider that futures research could help Government in the early identification of the challenges presented by new technologies and use the
[normal] followi
[normal]ng examples to illustrate this:
