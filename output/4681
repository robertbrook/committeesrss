[normal]AFS0085[bold]South East Strategic Leaders Response[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]South East Strategic Leaders (SESL) 
[normal]does
[normal] not have a shared view on the Government’s programme of academisation; individual South East authorities have their own 
[normal]policies 
[normal]on
[normal] academies and free school
[normal]s. This submission is, therefore, intended to 
[normal]be considered alongside
[normal] more detailed local authorit
[normal]y 
[normal]evidence
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Regardless of stance towards academies, it is a fact that under the current Government, the number of academies in the South East has 
[normal]increased
[normal]. Between 2011/12 and 2012/13 no SESL authority saw a drop in the percentage of pupils educated in 
[normal]secondary academies, although growth has varied across the region. 
[normal]The introduction of academies and free schools has changed the education landscape and raised questions about the role and responsibilities of local authorities in education and, in particu
[normal]lar, in respect to academies and free schools.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]SESL has determined to submit a collective response as whilst South East Councils hold different positions on the concept of academies, we hold firmly that local authorities retain a role in promoting learnin
[normal]g across all schools
[normal]. We
[normal] recognise the need for the local authority as a strong ‘Middle Tier’ between all schools and the Secretary of State. 
[normal]We agree that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Local authorities have an on-going role in [bold]promoting learning[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The duties placed on English local authorities under Section 13 of the Education Act 1996, relating to promoting high standards of education, ensuring fair access to opportunity and promoting the fulfilment of learning potential, apply
[normal] to 
[normal]all
[normal] children and young people across 
[normal]all
[normal] schools and alternative education providers, which includes academies. 
[normal]Whilst there is some debate as to the exten
[normal]t
[normal] to which a local authority is ‘capable
[normal]’
[normal] of exercising 
[normal]these functions with respect to 
[normal]non-maintained schools, academies are not independent fro
[normal]m these local authority duties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As long as these duties remain, local authorities have a role to engage constructively with, and seek to influence, all schools to ensure their responsibilities towar
[normal]ds children are being met. 
[normal]South East Councils continue to relate to all schools in carrying out responsibilities for admissions, SEN exclusions and commissioning new school places. I
[normal]n respect to championing vulnerable pupils and ensuring equality of oppor
[normal]tunity, for example, there are 
[normal]cases
[normal] of South East Councils taking a very active role. In Kent, the County Council and local schools are focusing intensively on narrowing the attainment gap for vulnerable groups. In the same way as local authority maintain
[normal]ed schools, Kent County Council expects academies to focus on ensuring that vulnerable groups are identified, strategies personalised and pupil premium monies effectively targeted. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To fulfil their role successfully, councils need to build strong relation[bold]ships with all schools[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Establishing strong relationships
[normal] is a prerequisite to constructive engagement
[normal] with any school.
[normal] 
[normal]Where 
[normal]a local authority
[normal] do
[normal]es
[normal] have direct powers of intervention, these are often only effective where 
[normal]that local authority
[normal] has
[normal] the capacity to invest in building constructive relationships with 
[normal]its 
[normal]schools and the history of doing so. Nurturing strong, positive, trusting relationships with academies 
[normal]is important as t
[normal]he quality of relationship
[normal]s
[normal] is likely to determine the level of 
[normal]information shared by 
[normal]academies
[normal] with their local 
[normal]counci
[normal]l
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Across 
[normal]SESL 
[normal]there are many examples of where local authorities have invested in build
[normal]ing positive relationships with
[normal] schools
[normal] 
[normal]in a variety of ways. To give one example, 
[normal]through collaboration with 
[normal]Robert Bloomfield Academy, Central Bedfordshire Council has established The Central Bedfordshire Teaching School Partnership and Council 
[normal]Commissioning Officers
[normal] sit on the Partnership’s Strategic Board. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The partnership has published an on
[normal]line workforce 
[normal]development tool
[normal] and is helping to broker school-to-school support using National and Local Leaders of Education and Governance, Advanced Skills Teachers and Specialist Leaders. Central Bedfordshire already has four National Leaders in Governance. The Coun
[normal]cil would like to approach other Chairs but 
[normal]has
[normal] been prevented from doing so due to tight, nationally imposed 
[normal]qualifying criteria
[normal] regarding length of service prior to applying
[normal]. The Committee may wish to see if this is an issue for other areas and subsequen
[normal]tly to explore loosening the criteria on qualifying Governors. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Where relationships are not good, [bold]Government should support councils to exercise their democratic mandate.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There exist a number of means by which local authorities can seek to influence academies; for example, through meeting with the Chairs of overarching Trusts and regular meetings with regional HMI. There are many examples of positive endeavour on this front
[normal]. In Kent, for example, the local authority has been inviting academies to work in partnership with other schools to create a sustainable, self-improvement school system, which is working well. Despite many examples of positive engagement, difficulties can
[normal] and do arise where, 
[normal]for whatever reason, an academy refuses to engage constructively with the local authority.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] Persistent un-cooperation and disengagement 
[normal]can
[normal] lead to a situation where it becomes difficult for a local authority to be
[normal] a)
[normal] assured of the health of a school and thus to fulfil its statutory duties towards pupils
[normal] and b) to drive improvement within that school
[normal]. 
[normal]In the current system, where relationships break down and attempts to influence through exerting soft powers fail, it 
[normal]is the 
[normal]DfE’s
[normal] responsibility to intervene and drive necessary improvements at pace. It would therefore be prudent for the Committee to explore further whether the 
[normal]DfE
[normal] has the 
[normal]local knowledge 
[normal]of underperforming academies and the capacity 
[normal]and capability 
[normal]to in
[normal]tervene quickly and support sustained improvement.
[normal] The decision to recruit Schools Commissioners in eight regions across the country and to charge them with responsibility for monitoring performance and 
[normal]driving improvement
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]underperforming academies impl
[normal]ies that there is a 
[normal]gap not currently being met by the Department. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In keeping with localism, it is essential that local politicians, alongside their schools, are able to be held to account by their communities for the education that their children and yo
[normal]ung people receive
[normal].
[normal] Local politicians are far better placed than Whitehall or any regional representative to keep abreast of and address local issues.
[normal] Indeed, when difficulties arise, residents rarely turn first to the Secretary of State bu
[normal]t
[normal] rather to thei
[normal]r locally elected politicians. Local Councillors need to be supported to influence schools and to hold providers to account for the delivery of the local system through their democratic mandate.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To this end, Regional Schools Commissioner
[normal]s
[normal] should be required to cooperate with local authorities, sharing information about underperforming academies 
[normal]with which they are working and 
[normal]involving 
[normal]local authorities
[normal] in 
[normal]both 
[normal]discussions about the most appropriate remedial action and securing school impr
[normal]ovement services. Local authorities, have a wealth of local knowledge, practical expertise and experience in this area that Regional Commissioners ought to draw upon. In light of Councils’ broad systems oversight
[normal] and democratic mandate
[normal], Commissioners ought
[normal] also to involve them in decisions to approve an academy conversion application. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local Councillors could be further supported to exercise their democratic mandate by 
[normal]structuring the Funding Agreement between the 
[normal]DfE
[normal] and 
[normal]a
[normal]cademies in a way that reinforces
[normal] to academies that whilst they are funded centrally, they have a responsi
[normal]bility towards locally elected M
[normal]embers. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Convertor academies – a potential line for future enquiry[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The principle that no school is beyond falling into difficulties is an impor
[normal]tant one and raises 
[normal]questions around convertor academies. 
[normal]Whi
[normal]lst we celebrate in the successes
[normal] of such schools, we have concerns regarding the longevity of that success and the potential vulnerability of convertor academies in particular. We suggest there 
[normal]is value in the Committee exploring the basis of convertor academy success, whether their success is likely to be sustained
[normal] and what securities are needed/exist
[normal] that will help
[normal] convertor academies
[normal] to guard against potential deterioration or failure in the f
[normal]uture. 
[normal]Being proactive, not reactive relies on access to [bold]real time[bold] information and data [bold]sharing[bold]2.12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local authorities have a role, alongside an array of other partners, to support schools throughout their improvement journey. This involves identifying and 
[normal]acting upon early warning signs that might, for example, suggest that educational standards are slipping.
[normal] Councils’ ability to track individual pupil data 
[normal]in real time, over a period of time, is important to spotting warning signs. Local authorities ought 
[normal]not to be in a position where they must wait for the Department to publish Key Stage data, for example, several months after it is received by local schools; rather, they need access to robust, real time information before it is placed in the public domain
[normal].
[normal] Access to more sensitive information also plays an important part in supporting councils to fulfil their safeguarding responsibilities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As referenced above, building strong relationships with schools overtime will underpin 
[normal]their 
[normal]willingness to share
[normal] 
[normal]information. 
[normal]              
[normal]A
[normal]cross the South East there are 
[normal]examples of locally negotiated information sharing protocols between 
[normal]C
[normal]ouncils and academies which are proving effective. For locally-led initiatives, such as the Troubled F
[normal]amilies Programme, there may be
[normal] need f
[normal]or further 
[normal]data sharing
[normal] within locally agreed timescales. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Academy sponsors should be strongly encouraged to cooperate with councils and encourage their schools to do likewise.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is sometimes the case that academies, which enjoy a good relationship with
[normal] their local authority and are open to sharing information in principle, come under pressure from their Sponsor not
[normal] to
[normal] share data with their local authority. This causes unnecessary obstacles locally which could be
[normal] easily overcome if nationally 
[normal]academy spo
[normal]nsors were encouraged
[normal] by the 
[normal]DfE
[normal],
[normal] and
[normal] in the future
[normal] Regional Schools Commissioners
[normal],
[normal] to willingly and 
[normal]constructively 
[normal]engage with local authorities
[normal] directly. Moreover, Sponsors should actively encourage academies within their sphere to communicate with their local authority. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The capacity of local authorities to exercise due diligence towards all schools, regardless of status, is diminishing[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is 
[normal]increasingly difficult for local authorities to know all of their schools well due to limited capacity and SESL questions whether existing 
[normal]funding 
[normal]is
[normal] sufficient to sustain the capacity of local authorities to exercise due diligence with their schools, rega
[normal]rdless of status.
