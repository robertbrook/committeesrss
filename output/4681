default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSouth East Strategic Leaders (SESL) 
defaultdoes
default not have a shared view on the Government’s programme of academisation; individual South East authorities have their own 
defaultpolicies 
defaulton
default academies and free school
defaults. This submission is, therefore, intended to 
defaultbe considered alongside
default more detailed local authorit
defaulty 
defaultevidence
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRegardless of stance towards academies, it is a fact that under the current Government, the number of academies in the South East has 
defaultincreased
default. Between 2011/12 and 2012/13 no SESL authority saw a drop in the percentage of pupils educated in 
defaultsecondary academies, although growth has varied across the region. 
defaultThe introduction of academies and free schools has changed the education landscape and raised questions about the role and responsibilities of local authorities in education and, in particu
defaultlar, in respect to academies and free schools.
default&#xa0;
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSESL has determined to submit a collective response as whilst South East Councils hold different positions on the concept of academies, we hold firmly that local authorities retain a role in promoting learnin
defaultg across all schools
default. We
default recognise the need for the local authority as a strong ‘Middle Tier’ between all schools and the Secretary of State. 
defaultWe agree that:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultLocal authorities have an on-going role in defaultpromoting learningdefault default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe duties placed on English local authorities under Section 13 of the Education Act 1996, relating to promoting high standards of education, ensuring fair access to opportunity and promoting the fulfilment of learning potential, apply
default to 
defaultall
default children and young people across 
defaultall
default schools and alternative education providers, which includes academies. 
defaultWhilst there is some debate as to the exten
defaultt
default to which a local authority is ‘capable
default’
default of exercising 
defaultthese functions with respect to 
defaultnon-maintained schools, academies are not independent fro
defaultm these local authority duties.
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs long as these duties remain, local authorities have a role to engage constructively with, and seek to influence, all schools to ensure their responsibilities towar
defaultds children are being met. 
defaultSouth East Councils continue to relate to all schools in carrying out responsibilities for admissions, SEN exclusions and commissioning new school places. I
defaultn respect to championing vulnerable pupils and ensuring equality of oppor
defaulttunity, for example, there are 
defaultcases
default of South East Councils taking a very active role. In Kent, the County Council and local schools are focusing intensively on narrowing the attainment gap for vulnerable groups. In the same way as local authority maintain
defaulted schools, Kent County Council expects academies to focus on ensuring that vulnerable groups are identified, strategies personalised and pupil premium monies effectively targeted. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo fulfil their role successfully, councils need to build strong relationdefaultships with all schoolsdefault&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEstablishing strong relationships
default is a prerequisite to constructive engagement
default with any school.
default 
defaultWhere 
defaulta local authority
default do
defaultes
default have direct powers of intervention, these are often only effective where 
defaultthat local authority
default has
default the capacity to invest in building constructive relationships with 
defaultits 
defaultschools and the history of doing so. Nurturing strong, positive, trusting relationships with academies 
defaultis important as t
defaulthe quality of relationship
defaults
default is likely to determine the level of 
defaultinformation shared by 
defaultacademies
default with their local 
defaultcounci
defaultl
defaults
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAcross 
defaultSESL 
defaultthere are many examples of where local authorities have invested in build
defaulting positive relationships with
default schools
default 
defaultin a variety of ways. To give one example, 
defaultthrough collaboration with 
defaultRobert Bloomfield Academy, Central Bedfordshire Council has established The Central Bedfordshire Teaching School Partnership and Council 
defaultCommissioning Officers
default sit on the Partnership’s Strategic Board. 
default&#xa0;
default2.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe partnership has published an on
defaultline workforce 
defaultdevelopment tool
default and is helping to broker school-to-school support using National and Local Leaders of Education and Governance, Advanced Skills Teachers and Specialist Leaders. Central Bedfordshire already has four National Leaders in Governance. The Coun
defaultcil would like to approach other Chairs but 
defaulthas
default been prevented from doing so due to tight, nationally imposed 
defaultqualifying criteria
default regarding length of service prior to applying
default. The Committee may wish to see if this is an issue for other areas and subsequen
defaulttly to explore loosening the criteria on qualifying Governors. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhere relationships are not good, defaultGovernment should support councils to exercise their democratic mandate.default&#xa0;
default2.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere exist a number of means by which local authorities can seek to influence academies; for example, through meeting with the Chairs of overarching Trusts and regular meetings with regional HMI. There are many examples of positive endeavour on this front
default. In Kent, for example, the local authority has been inviting academies to work in partnership with other schools to create a sustainable, self-improvement school system, which is working well. Despite many examples of positive engagement, difficulties can
default and do arise where, 
defaultfor whatever reason, an academy refuses to engage constructively with the local authority.
default&#xa0;
default2.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default Persistent un-cooperation and disengagement 
defaultcan
default lead to a situation where it becomes difficult for a local authority to be
default a)
default assured of the health of a school and thus to fulfil its statutory duties towards pupils
default and b) to drive improvement within that school
default. 
defaultIn the current system, where relationships break down and attempts to influence through exerting soft powers fail, it 
defaultis the 
defaultDfE’s
default responsibility to intervene and drive necessary improvements at pace. It would therefore be prudent for the Committee to explore further whether the 
defaultDfE
default has the 
defaultlocal knowledge 
defaultof underperforming academies and the capacity 
defaultand capability 
defaultto in
defaulttervene quickly and support sustained improvement.
default The decision to recruit Schools Commissioners in eight regions across the country and to charge them with responsibility for monitoring performance and 
defaultdriving improvement
default 
defaultin 
defaultunderperforming academies impl
defaulties that there is a 
defaultgap not currently being met by the Department. 
default&#xa0;
default2.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn keeping with localism, it is essential that local politicians, alongside their schools, are able to be held to account by their communities for the education that their children and yo
defaultung people receive
default.
default Local politicians are far better placed than Whitehall or any regional representative to keep abreast of and address local issues.
default Indeed, when difficulties arise, residents rarely turn first to the Secretary of State bu
defaultt
default rather to thei
defaultr locally elected politicians. Local Councillors need to be supported to influence schools and to hold providers to account for the delivery of the local system through their democratic mandate.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo this end, Regional Schools Commissioner
defaults
default should be required to cooperate with local authorities, sharing information about underperforming academies 
defaultwith which they are working and 
defaultinvolving 
defaultlocal authorities
default in 
defaultboth 
defaultdiscussions about the most appropriate remedial action and securing school impr
defaultovement services. Local authorities, have a wealth of local knowledge, practical expertise and experience in this area that Regional Commissioners ought to draw upon. In light of Councils’ broad systems oversight
default and democratic mandate
default, Commissioners ought
default also to involve them in decisions to approve an academy conversion application. 
default&#xa0;
default2.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal Councillors could be further supported to exercise their democratic mandate by 
defaultstructuring the Funding Agreement between the 
defaultDfE
default and 
defaulta
defaultcademies in a way that reinforces
default to academies that whilst they are funded centrally, they have a responsi
defaultbility towards locally elected M
defaultembers.

defaultConvertor academies – a potential line for future enquirydefault&#xa0;default2.11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe principle that no school is beyond falling into difficulties is an impor
defaulttant one and raises 
defaultquestions around convertor academies. 
defaultWhi
defaultlst we celebrate in the successes
default of such schools, we have concerns regarding the longevity of that success and the potential vulnerability of convertor academies in particular. We suggest there 
defaultis value in the Committee exploring the basis of convertor academy success, whether their success is likely to be sustained
default and what securities are needed/exist
default that will help
default convertor academies
default to guard against potential deterioration or failure in the f
defaultuture. 
defaultBeing proactive, not reactive relies on access to defaultreal timedefault information and data defaultsharingdefault2.12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal authorities have a role, alongside an array of other partners, to support schools throughout their improvement journey. This involves identifying and 
defaultacting upon early warning signs that might, for example, suggest that educational standards are slipping.
default Councils’ ability to track individual pupil data 
defaultin real time, over a period of time, is important to spotting warning signs. Local authorities ought 
defaultnot to be in a position where they must wait for the Department to publish Key Stage data, for example, several months after it is received by local schools; rather, they need access to robust, real time information before it is placed in the public domain
default.
default Access to more sensitive information also plays an important part in supporting councils to fulfil their safeguarding responsibilities.
default&#xa0;
default2.13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs referenced above, building strong relationships with schools overtime will underpin 
defaulttheir 
defaultwillingness to share
default 
defaultinformation. 
default              
defaultA
defaultcross the South East there are 
defaultexamples of locally negotiated information sharing protocols between 
defaultC
defaultouncils and academies which are proving effective. For locally-led initiatives, such as the Troubled F
defaultamilies Programme, there may be
default need f
defaultor further 
defaultdata sharing
default within locally agreed timescales. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAcademy sponsors should be strongly encouraged to cooperate with councils and encourage their schools to do likewise.default&#xa0;
default2.14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is sometimes the case that academies, which enjoy a good relationship with
default their local authority and are open to sharing information in principle, come under pressure from their Sponsor not
default to
default share data with their local authority. This causes unnecessary obstacles locally which could be
default easily overcome if nationally 
defaultacademy spo
defaultnsors were encouraged
default by the 
defaultDfE
default,
default and
default in the future
default Regional Schools Commissioners
default,
default to willingly and 
defaultconstructively 
defaultengage with local authorities
default directly. Moreover, Sponsors should actively encourage academies within their sphere to communicate with their local authority. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe capacity of local authorities to exercise due diligence towards all schools, regardless of status, is diminishingdefault&#xa0;
default2.15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is 
defaultincreasingly difficult for local authorities to know all of their schools well due to limited capacity and SESL questions whether existing 
defaultfunding 
defaultis
default sufficient to sustain the capacity of local authorities to exercise due diligence with their schools, rega
defaultrdless of status.
