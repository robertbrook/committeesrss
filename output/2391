defaultCase Study AdefaultAA
default received a sentence of detention at Her Majesty’s pleasure for a murder committed when she was 15 years old.  She was convicted on the basis of joint enterprise having arranged a meeting that resulted in the fatal confrontation. She has a history of abuse and is traumatised by the events.  The prison service has never conducted a psychological assessment on her.  Through legal advice she has been able to have a detailed psychological assessment prepared that properly identifies her areas of risk and need and a future treatment pathway. This could no longer be carried out. 
default&#xa0;
defaultShe will not be entitled to legal aid to assist her in making an application to have her minimum term reviewed at the half way point.
default&#xa0;
defaultShe will not be entitled to 
defaultlegal 
defaultrepresentation
default before the Parole Board
default to assess her suitability to move to open conditions before her tariff expires.

defaultCase Study BdefaultBB
default was a foreign national who gave birth to a baby with disabilities while on remand.  She spoke no English. After her sentence she was informed that the baby would be removed as they did not know if she would be allowed to remain with her baby when she was eventually returned to Spain.  After taking legal advice it was possible to establish that the Spanish authorities would accept her home to serve her sentence and would allow her to remain with her baby.  The decision was reversed.  This case could no longer be funded under the prison law contact.  Aside from the human costs of an unnecessary separation
default of mother and child
default, the cost to the public purse would have been enormous
default.

default had a category A review where he has b
defaulte
defaulten informed that he will remain category A due to security concerns that will not be disclosed to him.  Investigations with the CPS have established that an allegation was made that he had been involved in placing a 
default‘
defaultcontract
default’
default on a prisoner
default,
default but that they now considered this evidence to be unsubstantiated and unreliable.  Without legal advice, the prisoner would never know the nature of the allegations against him, less still that th
defaulte
defaulty are 
defaultunreliable
default.
default All the internal complaints system can produce is a reply that the decision was based on material that will not be disclosed.
