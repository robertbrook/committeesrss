[normal]Case Study A[bold]AA
[normal] received a sentence of detention at Her Majesty’s pleasure for a murder committed when she was 15 years old.  She was convicted on the basis of joint enterprise having arranged a meeting that resulted in the fatal confrontation. She has a history of abuse and is traumatised by the events.  The prison service has never conducted a psychological assessment on her.  Through legal advice she has been able to have a detailed psychological assessment prepared that properly identifies her areas of risk and need and a future treatment pathway. This could no longer be carried out. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]She will not be entitled to legal aid to assist her in making an application to have her minimum term reviewed at the half way point.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]She will not be entitled to 
[normal]legal 
[normal]representation
[normal] before the Parole Board
[normal] to assess her suitability to move to open conditions before her tariff expires.

[normal]Case Study B[bold]BB
[normal] was a foreign national who gave birth to a baby with disabilities while on remand.  She spoke no English. After her sentence she was informed that the baby would be removed as they did not know if she would be allowed to remain with her baby when she was eventually returned to Spain.  After taking legal advice it was possible to establish that the Spanish authorities would accept her home to serve her sentence and would allow her to remain with her baby.  The decision was reversed.  This case could no longer be funded under the prison law contact.  Aside from the human costs of an unnecessary separation
[normal] of mother and child
[normal], the cost to the public purse would have been enormous
[normal].

[normal]Case Study C[bold]CC
[normal] had a category A review where he has b
[normal]e
[normal]en informed that he will remain category A due to security concerns that will not be disclosed to him.  Investigations with the CPS have established that an allegation was made that he had been involved in placing a 
[normal]‘
[normal]contract
[normal]’
[normal] on a prisoner
[normal],
[normal] but that they now considered this evidence to be unsubstantiated and unreliable.  Without legal advice, the prisoner would never know the nature of the allegations against him, less still that th
[normal]e
[normal]y are 
[normal]unreliable
[normal].
[normal] All the internal complaints system can produce is a reply that the decision was based on material that will not be disclosed.
