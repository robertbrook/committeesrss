"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Friends of the Supergrid (LCI0012)&#xa0;How is the UK Government maximising opportunities to learn from and partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?&#xa0;\nAbout Friends of the Supergrid&#xa0;\nThe Friends of the Supergrid (FOSG) is a group of companies which have a \nmutual interest in promoting and influencing the policy and regulatory framework required to enable large-scale interconnection in Europe.\n  \nFOSG combines companies in sectors that \nunderstand, and \nwill deliver the High Voltage infrastructure and related technology, together with companies that will develop, install, own and operate that infrastructure. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;A Single EU Electricity Market&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.              Supergrid&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTarget\n&#xa0;\nThe \nmost effective route\n \nto the \ndeliver\ny of\n a single EU electricity market is Supergrid, which will also help \nachieve\n: \n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n 2020 (first links becoming future parts of Supergrid),\n 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction objectives\n;\n \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe reduction of \nimport \ndependence \nespecially of gas and oil,\n which in 2010 exceeded 50% of \nEU\n gross energy consumption\n;\n \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nan increase in security of energy supply for all EU Member States;\n and\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe integration of\n renewable energy sources \nacross \nthe EU\n;\n&#xa0;\nThe development of Supergrid \nwill\n also provide additional benefits such as:  \n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nenhanced opportunities for the development and export of key European technology including\n \nHigh Voltage Direct Current (\nHVDC\n)\n control systems and cabling;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nan increase in\n production of vessels, cables and technology devices;\n and\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nskilled employment opportunities\n across the EU\n&#xa0;\nThe development of an integrated European electricity network w\nould support\n the UK and other Member States to progress towards a decarbonised economy\n while better utilising existing sources of energy within the EU. \n&#xa0;\nWith increased interconnection, r\nather than build\ning\n capacity markets in each Member State, countries will be \nbetter \nable to share capacity and by so doing reduce the cost to the consumer \nof system balancing.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoadmap\n&#xa0;\nIn this transition phase to sustainable (zero carbon) electricity supply, fossil fired gas and coal plants will become less used.  With Supergrid this spare plant, which is now becoming semi redundant, c\nould\n provide back\n-\nup \nacross the EU\n reducing the need for investment in short-term capacity in individual Member States\n.  \nThe UK for instance could envisage i\nnstead of \nsome of its generation plants including the \ncapacity payment for their availability, \nto \ntap into existing spar\ne capacity \nacross a wider market\n and avoid the costs of some of those investments in new generation\n. \n&#xa0;\nErgo: \nless capital expenditure in the UK on new fossil plant.\n \nErgo: higher capacity utilisation for existing \nfossil \nplant\n across Europe\n. Ergo: \ncheaper \nelectricity for the entire European customer base.\n&#xa0;\nSupergrid will also deliver\n enhanced security of supply of primary fuel.  It is the means of building \nnew renewable capacity in the Northern seas and across the Mediterranean\n. Ergo:\n \na\nccess to free fuel in\ndefinitely. \n&#xa0;\nMoreover, with Supergrid there would be a replacement of\n imports with domestic supply. \nA r\necent stud\ny\n by the CEBR in the UK show\ned\n that the multiplier effect from such replacement is between 2 and 3 depending on the productivity of the econom\ny.\n \n&#xa0;\nAs an addition to the above, a massive export market for European technology would be created.   Currently Siemens, ABB\n \nand Alstom are the \npredominant suppliers\n of HVDC technology\n outside of \nChina.\n  \nTwo \nof these companies \nhave their global centres of excellence in the UK. \nWhile Prysmian, Nexans and ABB are the main manufac\nturers of transmission cables. \nThey are a\nll European\n or European based\n.  The US, China and some large emerging mar\nkets\n \nare \nall \nconsidering the development\n of their own \n Supergrid\ns\n.\n Europe can develop it here and export the technology.  \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResult\n&#xa0;\nCurrently, \nEuropean\n electrical utilities are suffering.  Low profitability, following on from low fossil plant utilisation, and long term punitive gas contracts is the current European norm.  There is a strategic space for multinational utilities to take synergies from diffe\nring peak times and scarcities of fossil plant in some markets, while surpluses exist in others.  None of this can happen without Supergrid.  European trading \nin electricity is minimal now. \nWith Supergrid trading activity will ensure that, on a pan-Europea\nn scale, the electricity is produced from the lowest cost sources \nreducing the overall price \nto the consumer across the EU\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.              One example of the benefits of trade – UK, France and Spain&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nOpportunity\n&#xa0;\nThe UK has the opportunity to trade electricity with several Member States, not just in the North Seas region. Improved interconnection could deliver electricity from the south of Europe where excess \nw\nind\n, gas\n and \ns\nolar capacity can be balanced with UK dom\nestic generation. The UK Government’s design of its future capacity market must include generation from sources outside the UK if the country is to fully benefit. Limiting the market to domestic generation reduces competition, locks in inefficiencies of su\npply and raises costs for consumers. It also limits the UK’s exploitation of its marine renewable resources, which could be harnessed to supply power across a single market.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nInvestment\n&#xa0;\nThe costs of additional HVDC transmission needed to interconnect \nmarkets with the UK are significantly less than building new additional generation capacity, and will not run the risk of “locking in” new fossil generation.\n \nT\nhe European Commission \nhas shown\n \nthat \nfrom now to 2020 \n€\n500b\nn\n \nwill\n \nbe needed for \nnew power \ngeneration, \n€\n400b\nn\n for distribution and \n€\n140b\nn\n for transmission\n.\n&#xa0;\nAs an example, the UK, France and Spain have an opportunity to interconnect their markets\n which would enable the trade of UK generation to balance Iberian renewables, and French, Spanish an\nd Portuguese power into the UK at times of peak demand\n.\n Such an interconnector would offer a cost competitive option to building new plant in the UK to provide domestic system balancing.\n&#xa0;\nThe \n€2bn estimated \ncost\n of the interconnector can be contrasted with the estimated €\n19\nbn of Hinkley C. In addition, the link would deliver electricity into the UK for between \n€\n4\n2\n-\n€\n100 MWh from a mix of existing nuclear and renewables generation in France\n (cost of nuclear in Fran\nce as defined by \nARENH (“accès régulé à l’électricité nucléaire historique”) is 42€/MWh since Jan 1\nst\n 2012)\n,\n Spain and Portugal\n (\n€\n50-\n€\n100 MWh corresponding to index prices based on different offers depending on the technology used. M\nI\nBEL prices (power \nexchange of Spain and Portugal) are lower and for 1\nst\n \nquarter\n of 2014 \nare\n foreseen at 56.4\n€\n/MWh)\n, in contrast to Hinkley which will receive an\n index linked price of \n€\n109 MWh\n for 35 years\n.\n There are therefore clear cost benefits from investment in new HVDC \ninterconnection and this should be factored into the UKs future energy policy, complementing investment in domestic low carbon generation in ensuring a sustainable, affordable and secure electricity supply for future generations.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.              Summary&#xa0;Supergrid is the fundamental architecture of an integrated European electricity market.  Without it we have a collection of sub-optimal national markets, and the EU will struggle to meet its emissions reduction goals, while keeping electricity prices higher than they would otherwise be.&#xa0;The UK should continue to champion the delivery of an integrated EU electricity market, which will reduce the cost of energy for consumers, create significant industrial benefits for the country, and enable a low cost pathway to meet our emissions reduction goals.&#xa0;December 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n The economic impact of offshore wind CEBR 2012: \nhttp://www.cebr.com/reports/economic-impact-of-offshore-wind/\nSee p.7 \net seq\n: \nBalance of Trade Benefits: \nUnder our Accelerated Growth scenario, by 2030, the estimated increase in net exports is £22.5 billion, sufficient to almost entirely plug the UK’s current balance of trade deficit (recorded at £25.6 billion in 2009, the year corresponding with our forecasts). These positive trade impacts are driven by our assumptions about red\nuced fossil fuel imports and offshore wind electricity exports as a result of greater offshore wind capacity. They are also driven by our assumptions about the development of the supply chain for offshore wind investments, the increase in UK content of UK \noffshore wind investments (relative to imports) and the share of continental European offshore wind investment that can be expected to be captured by the UK industry as these supply chain developments occur. \n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.energy-regulators.eu/portal/page/portal/EER_HOME/EER_INTERNATI\nONAL/CEER_Eastern_Partnership/2nd_EaP_Workshop/2_3_Eurpean%20Commission_Tbilisi_2013_updated.pdf\n&#xa0;\n"
