FBA0002/13-14&#xa0;Dear Mr Sinton,&#xa0;As Chairman of the New City Initiative, I feel compelled to write to you on behalf of our members, many of whom are limited liability partnerships, about the proposed changes to the taxation of partnerships contained in the draft Finance Bill 2014.  The New City Initiative believes the proposed legislation on partnership tax throws up a number of concerns which could sound the death knell for investment management partnerships.&#xa0; It may even produce an own goal for the UK tax authorities.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Yours sincerely&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Magnus SpenceChairmanNew City Initiative&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The NCI is a think tank that offers an independent, expert voice in the debate over the future of financial regulation.Founded in 2010, NCI counts amongst its members some of the leading independent asset management firms in the City and the continent.
