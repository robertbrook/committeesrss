A primary objective of the research is to examine the structure\n of the decision making processes adopted by banks in Northern Ireland in regard to lending.\n \nThis submission describes a number of findings of relevance here, identified as part of the overall study:\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe general structure of the banking system in Norther\nn Ireland, with the mixture of domestic and international banks in the current climate\n,\n can be viewed as advantageous from a consumer viewpoint.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe structure of decision making in regard to lending has become more \ncentralised\n post crisis. \nCentralised\n deci\nsion making increases the quality, standard and consistency of decision making in regard to lending decisions. It can however, also be problematic due to less negotiation at the local level, a lack of local knowledge and understanding and the lower speed a\nt which decisions are often reached. \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLending policy post 2007 has become more stringent which impacts on the ability of firms and individuals to access finance.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are consequences for the ownership structure of banks in Northern Ireland, including a l\nack of control over the \nbehaviour\n of these institutions. This area warrants further research. \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is not only the sale of assets by NAMA that may be impacting on Northern Ireland property values. Other financial institutions are affecting recovery through \ntheir asset disposal strategies also.\nThe submission also makes a number of suggestions in relation to the issues raised by the inquiry:\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImmediate clarity over the\n future of Ulster Bank and NAMA is necessary to aid the recovery process.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsider the potential role for NISRA in producing regional lending statistics for Northern Ireland in order to increase transparency and allow for a clearer understanding of the nature and scale of the problem in Northern Ireland. \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurther analysis into t\nhe regulatory implications of the varying ownership structures adopted by the banks operating in Northern Ireland would enable a better understanding of the impact of the structure on Northern Ireland.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe implication of recent changes to the branch networ\nk in Northern Ireland is that new delivery channels may be necessary. Substitutes to the rural branch network include extending the services currently provided through the Post Office, increase the services that Credit Unions are permitted to engage in and\n the implementation of off-site banking kiosks. \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEncourage further education initiatives and awareness raising activities surrounding the use of online and mobile banking facilities. \nIntroduction and Background1. This submission is based on the experiences of a team of academics based in Northern Ireland. They are members of the Ulster Business School's Department of Business &amp; Enterprise, University of Ulster. The response is based on \ndata collected as part of an\n on-\ngoing doctoral research study into Northern Ireland’s property market. The aim of the study is to explore the causes and consequences of the recent property market bubble in Northern Ireland. \n2. One aspect of the study involved examining the banking s\nector in Northern Ireland. In particular, evidence was gathered regarding the structure of the decision making processes adopted by the banks in Northern Ireland in relation to lending, in particular mortgage lending. Data was gathered on the changes in th\ne operations and policies of banks in Northern Ireland in recent years. To achieve this, semi structured interviews were conducted with a range of key stakeholders in the study, including banks and property developers. This was complemented by secondary \nco\nntent\n analysis\n.\n \n3. Five banks that currently operate in Northern Ireland have participated in the study and findings have been triangulated within each participant organisation.\n \nFor competitive reasons the identity of these organisations has been \nanonymi\nsed\n.\n4. The main reason for submitting a response is because the primary evidence gathered as part of this study contributes to the debate and the inquiry into the banking structure in Northern Ireland.\nQuestions and ResponsesThe structure and governance of banks in Northern IrelandIs there a difference in the structure of banks in Northern Ireland, compared to their structure in Great Britain?5. The following provides a brief summary of the structure of the banking sector in Northern Irel\nand. The main banks in Northern Ireland often referred to as the ‘Big Four’\n are structured as follows:\nUlster Bank:\n Ulster Bank Limited part of the Ulster Bank Group is a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group headquartered in Edinburgh. \nBank of I\nreland:\n Bank of Ireland (UK) \nplc.,\n is a subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland Group incorporated in the Republic of Ireland. The Irish government currently hold a minority stake in the Bank of Ireland Group. \nFirst Trust:\n In Northern Ireland, the bank trades a\ns First Trust Bank of the AIB Group (UK) \nplc.,\n which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks plc.,\n \nand is incorporated in Northern Ireland. Allied Irish Bank \nplc.,\n is headquartered in Dublin. Currently, the Irish government hold a majority stak\ne in the bank.\nDanske\n Bank:\n \nDanske\n Bank is a trading name of Northern Bank Limited. Northern Bank Limited is a member of the \nDanske\n Bank Group which is headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n6. The Big Four, two of which are Irish owned and two of which are internationally owned, have traditionally played the largest role in the market. However, the banking sector in Northern Ireland has undergone significant change in recent years. Some of the n\newer international entrants to the market include HSBC Bank \nplc.,\n Barclays Bank plc., both headquartered in London; Santander UK plc., a wholly owned by the Spanish Santander Group, headquartered in Spain; and Halifax plc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Llo\nyds Banking Group headquartered in London. \n7. The following describes the structure of the mortgage lending processes adopted by banks operating in Northern Ireland. Traditionally, banks in Northern Ireland operated under a decentralised model whereby, b\nranch managers had local discretions of varying amounts that enabled them to make loans up to a certain value so long as they complied with head office credit policy. With recent technological advancement, the study investigated the impact of these develop\nments on the mortgage decision making process. \n8. Our findings suggest that three of the banks that participated in the study have adopted a centralised mortgage lending process whereby all mortgages are reviewed and sanctioned from one central location.\n For these banks in the sample, the location of their centralised credit functions is also either Belfast or England. In the case of one of the banks, this model was adopted over a decade ago but for the others this change had occurred more recently and in\n the majority of cases was implemented after the crisis of 2007. Prior to 2007, each of these banks operated under a decentralised model.\n9. The findings of the study also indicate that currently two of the international banks that participated in the stu\ndy operate under a mixed model of centralisation and decentralisation. These banks have always operated under such a structure and currently have no plans to change the model. Under this approach, certain products are reviewed centrally but in general mort\ngages continue to be assessed under a decentralised model with branch managers retaining local discretion.\n \nFor these banks, the location of their centralised credit functions is either Belfast or England.\n10. The level of IT that is used within the proc\ness varies among all the banks. One of the banks has implemented an automated and largely standardised system whereas others have adopted systems of a more bespoke nature. Regardless of the model adopted however, there is still scope for internal change an\nd there is still a large element of judgement based evaluation of applications. \n&#xa0;Is there any disadvantage for customers, both private and business, in NI as a result?11. In terms of the general structure of the banking system in Northern Ireland, the mi\nxture of domestic and international banks in the current climate can be viewed as advantageous. Non-Irish banks with wider access to funding from their overall group and parent banks may be more willing to lend. In addition, consumers have access to more p\nroduct choice and may enjoy more favourable rates. \n12. Specifically in regard to the mortgage lending process, preliminary findings indicate that centralised decision making has both advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages include less negotiatio\nn at the local level, a lack of local knowledge and in some instances understanding of the market and decision making is often slower. There are also often wider economic implications in terms of the reduced number of branches and staff required to operate\n in the area.\n \nHowever, the centralised model also offers a number of advantages. These include the ability to achieve economies of scale and thereby reduce costs. In addition, the specialisation of knowledge that is associated with centralisation raises q\nuality and standards and is seen to result in independent and consistent decision making. \nDo banks that operate in both GB and NI, e.g. Barclays and Santander, operate differently in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK? Does this result in customers in NI being at a disadvantage compared to customers in GB?13. No comment. The study examined Northern Ireland only. \nWhat are the consequences for customers in NI of banks and bank debts being owned by non-UK banks?14. There are implications due to \nthe lack of control over the behaviour of these institutions, particularly in relation to their asset disposal strategy (see below for further details). There are also regulatory implications. \nWhat role does the Republic of Ireland play in NI banking?15. As outlined above, officially the Republic of Ireland plays a relatively small role in Northern Ireland banking. Although some of the institutions operating in Northern Ireland, are foreign owned, in theory they operate under the UK regulatory framework.\n However, there may be an impact in terms of the different cultural and operating environments of the parent banks headquartered in other jurisdictions. As subsidiaries, the conditions imposed on some of the banks as a result of state support, specifically\n those incorporated in the Republic of Ireland could also lead to restrictions on their activities in Northern Ireland.\n \nWhat effect does the sale of bank assets by NAMA have on NI property values?16. All property developers and banks that participated\n in the study were questioned on the perceived impact of NAMA on the Northern Ireland market.\n \nThere was a general feeling among respondents that the sale of bank assets by NAMA has created a negative perception in the market place which may be hindering r\necovery. While some respondents initially regarded the concept of NAMA as a positive move, the actual performance of NAMA in relation to the disposal of assets situated in Northern Ireland, was repeatedly questioned. The issue of whether NAMA is ‘drip feed\ning’ the market was also raised. Respondents felt that there was an incentive for potential buyers to delay purchasing, as NAMA still holds a substantial proportion of assets in the market that must be disposed of within its limited lifespan.\n17. Other respondents, mainly property developers, commended NAMA for its long term view towards asset disposal unlike other institutions. One interviewee commented on how NAMA was the ‘best place to be’ at present. However, concerns were raised over the futur\ne strategy of NAMA as it was felt that to date, they had disposed of ‘all the low hanging fruit’ in order to achieve targets. In general, the lack of transparency over NAMA's activities and future strategy has created a feeling of insecurity among those in\nvolved with the organisation.\n \n18. The behaviour of financial institutions with large property debt exposures, other than NAMA, was also raised. Thus, it is not only the sale of assets by NAMA that is impacting on Northern Ireland property values. There \nwas a general feeling among those involved with Ulster Bank that it has been more aggressive in attempting to recoup losses. The uncertainty over Ulster Banks future was also highlighted as a source of constant concern and confusion for respondents.\nThe possible break up of RBS/Ulster bankIt has been reported that HM Treasury are considering trying to persuade the Irish Government to take control of Ulster bank. This would involve removing Ulster Bank from the RBS group and swapping all or part, of the bank for the British loans and investments currently owned by NAMA. What would be the implications of such a move for NI? 19. While this was outside the parameters of the current study, we wish to make the following comments:\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt present the general feeling \nof uncertainty surrounding the future of Ulster Bank and NAMA is impacting on Northern Ireland’s recovery. \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWithout further information, it is difficult to ascertain the benefits of such a move for NAMA and the impact on the Republic of Ireland.\n \nHowever, \nfor Northern Ireland, the move would bring back control of assets currently owned by NAMA which would have implications for Northern Ireland’s recovery. \nThe position of the staff of the former Irish Bank Resolution CorporationDue to legislation introduced in the republic of Ireland, those people formerly employed in Dublin by IBRC, the successor of Anglo-Irish bank would be able to transfer to Capita, whereas those involved in Belfast had no such rights, and had been made redundant.20. No comment\nAccess to finance, particularly for SMEsHistorically, finance for start-ups and expansions have been largely provided through Government agencies- i.e. Invest NI and its various predecessors- with the result that bank finance traditionally played a lesser role in NI than in GB. Have NI banks continued to play a lesser role in commercial finance than elsewhere- in particular, have economic and financial conditions since 2008 exacerbated that position? 21. Previous reports have indicated that this has traditiona\nlly been the case in Northern Ireland. The issue of whether banks continue to play a lesser role in commercial finance since 2008 is a complex one. Although outside the scope of our main study, some evidence suggests SMEs have faced difficulties in accessi\nng finance post 2008.\n \nOn one hand, banks have adopted a more conservative stance and lending policy has become more stringent, while on the other, as the EAG (2013) report finds that demand has remained subdued in recent years. It is probable that a combi\nnation of these factors have impacted on the ability of SMEs to access commercial finance. \n22. Our findings suggest some SMEs operating in Northern Ireland, invested in commercial and ‘buy to let’ properties prior to 2007, financed mainly through overdra\nft facilities and bridging loans. This is consistent with the findings of the EAG (2013) survey which suggests that around one fifth of medium sized enterprises in Northern Ireland purchased property since 2005. However, and as noted below further transpar\nency in regard to the level and the nature of exposure is necessary to examine what measures could potentially be taken to resolve the issue and ensure that SMEs are able to access the finance necessary to sustain their primary operations.\nIf so, what impact does the problem have on (a) business, (b) Government and (c) economic growth/ rebalancing the economy and what measures might be taken to tackle it? 23. No comment\nLack of availability of detailed regional lending dataThe lack of available data means that it is difficult to properly assess the impact of the reduced availability of credit in NI, and also means that there is not sufficient visibility about whether banks are reaching their agreed lending targets.24. The lack of availability of regi\nonal lending data in Northern Ireland is an issue. Currently, the main source of lending data at the regional level for Northern Ireland is published by the Council of Mortgage Lenders but it is limited in nature to those who are not members or associates \nof the organisation. The potential role for NISRA in producing regional lending statistics for Northern Ireland should be considered in order to increase transparency and allow for a clearer understanding of the nature and scale of the problem in Northern \nIreland. \n25. While property prices can be used as a proxy for lending, there are also issues with the regional data in this regard for Northern Ireland. And while much progress has been made by LPS/NISRA in recent years to resolve these, the index commen\nces from the 1\nst\n of January 2005 and as such any long term analysis is restricted. \nHow is ‘new’ lending recorded? How much ‘new’ lending recorded is actually made up of extensions or additions to existing loans; and what are banks actually doing compared to what they are advertising?26. No comment\n&#xa0;The lack of effectiveness of national initiatives to help aid economic recoveryIs the population of NI at a disadvantage to the rest of the UK as a result of the lack of uptake of national economic recovery initiatives by banks in NI?27. While Northern Ireland has experienced a much deeper and prolonged recession in comparison to other areas of the UK, there is little evidence to suggest that this was a result of the lack of uptake of national economic recove\nry initiatives by banks operating in Northern Ireland. It is however, important to consider that these banks are often influenced by polices of state regulators in which their headquarters are located.\n \nIf so, is a more tailored approach from the HM Treasury required for NI? 28. No, economic recovery is a challenge facing all of the UK; it is not solely a regional issue.\nAccess to banking in rural communitiesFollowing the closure of Danske Bank of some branches in rural areas, are the interests of those living in more rural areas, particularly the elderly, sufficiently fulfilled by the banking structure as it currently stands? How significantly will the situation be exacerbated if Ulster Bank also closes some of its rural branches?29. Northern Ireland \nhas a different demographic profile and a lower degree of urbanisation than other parts of Great Britain and as such the delivery of banking services in rural areas is a general issue. While anecdotal evidence suggests that the needs of the elderly may not\n be sufficiently fulfilled by the banking structure currently, there is no easy solution. \n30. The role of the branch network has changed in recent years. Technological advancement and changing consumer behaviour have been key drivers of this change. Tech\nnology adoption is slower within the elderly cohort of the population and in general, rural areas can be considered more conservative.\n \n31. The implications of recent changes to the branch network in Northern Ireland and of any further projected changes \nis that new delivery channels tailored to the needs of the elderly may be required. However, substitutes to the branch network can be implemented.\no\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExtend the services currently provided through the Post Office\nIt is estimated that 95% of the total rural \npopulation across the UK are within three miles of their nearest outlet. More specifically, within Northern Ireland there are currently 331 post offices located in rural areas. The services currently offered are primarily traditional intermediation functio\nns such as deposition taking however, these are not available at all locations. These services if expanded offer a potential avenue that may assist in overcoming the access issues for the rural population that are currently being raised.\no\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncrease the serv\nices that Credit Unions are permitted to provide\nAs highlighted by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, an update of the legislation on credit unions in Northern Ireland to increase the services that they are permitted to provide, could pote\nntially act as a another countermeasure to the rural branch closures.\n \nAround 23.6% of the \np\nopulation in Northern Ireland \nis a member\n of a credit union compared to only 1.6% in Great Britain (\nMcKillop\n, Ward and Wilson 2010). An increase of powers to credit unions may increase competition within the sector and in the delivery of services to rural areas.\no\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUse banking Kiosks as an alternat\nive off site delivery channel\nAnother alternative as outlined by Jim Brown, the Chief Executive of the Ulster Bank Group, includes the use of kiosks for rural areas. These provide several locations for customers to access services without requiring the sam\ne level of investment that would be necessary to sustain a rural branch. This substitute does however; require the largest change in consumer \nbehaviour\n. There is therefore, the need to implement support mechanisms for this transition and to further educate\n consumers in this regard. \n32. Overall, while the decline of the branch network is challenging for rural areas, the main issues are age and education sensitive. \nO\nn one hand there is scope for the expansion of existing services or development of alternati\nves such as those outlined above. On the other hand, with the level of adoption of currently available online and mobile banking facilities increasing, the costs involved in implementing the alternatives must be carefully considered. \nConclusion33. The s\ntructure of the banking sector in Northern Ireland has both advantages and disadvantages associated with it. The Ulster Business School will be happy to discuss this issue further or to keep the Committee informed of findings of the project as it progresse\ns. \n&#xa0;\nApril 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
