default&#xa0;defaultChallenges in enhancing girlsdefault’default participation in PE and school sportdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn order for its impact to be maximised, t
defaulthe Youth Sport Trust believe it is imperative that schools are given support and direction on how best deploy this new investment, and should be actively encouraged to cooperate and share resources in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for their 
defaultp
defaultupils. We are currently working with 
defaulta range of government department and agencies 
defaultto ensure schools get the support and direction they need.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, as mentioned above, recent research that many primary-age girls are not undertaking sufficient amou
defaultnts of physical activity. The Youth Sport Trust therefore believes that primary schools should
default be encouraged to ensure their 
defaultPE and school sport provision engages girls effectively
default and, crucially, that girl’s participation in both is valued to the same extent as boys. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThe Youth Sport Trust therefore believes that it is imperative that schools are encouraged and supported to offer a diverse range of sporting activities that appeal to all groups of girls, and offer them desirable participation experiences. 
defaultThe manner in w
defaulthich PE is delivered
default also needs to be catered to girls
default’
default preferences. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe that the programme of study for PE contained within the National Curriculum should outline the need for schools to offer a wide range of sporting activities. We are
default therefore
default concerned that the recently published final draft of the revised National Curriculum contains reference to named sports (such as hockey, netball or football)
default. The Youth Sport Trust believes
default these references could encourage schools to offer only ‘tradition
defaultal’ sports and thus alienate many of their female pupils, and would welcome their removal from the National Curriculum. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThrough
default our research into girls’ attitudes, the Youth Sport Trust
default has found that many girls do not
default enjoy sport ‘for s
defaultport’s sake’.
default We believe that one of the key
defaults to making PE 
defaultand 
defaultsport a priority for those girls 
defaultis 
defaultto ensure that both are relevant to girls’ 
defaultinterests. For example, PE with a clearl
defaulty articulated purpose such as
default develop
defaulting confidence, enhancing body image, improving health or preparing
default for a set-piece performance
default or charity fundraising event
default, is much more likely to engage girls effectively. 
defaultIn t
defaulthis sense these outcomes should not be seen as by-products of PE and school sport, but as planned outcomes of both. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultCrucially, the Youth Sport Trust be
defaultlieves that, in order to 
defaulteffectively ‘market’
default PE and school sport to all girls, schools need to unders
defaulttand what motivates their female pupils to take part in PE, and to be physically active. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs mentioned above, t
defaulthrough our 
defaultGirls PE and Sport Innovation project
default, the Youth Sport Trust is working with 21 schools around the country to help them
default better engage 
default11-14 year old girls in PE and sport, and
default drive up participation rates. The project provides schools with training, res
defaultources and ongoing support to help them review their PE and sport culture and
default develop innovative
default practices to ensure they 
defaultare relevant and attractive to girls. A key part of this process is encouraging schools to establish Girls Leadership and Marketing groups (or 
defaultGLAMS), made up of a cross-section of female pupils, which establish girls’ motivations, and influence delivery w
defaultithin the school. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Fit for Girls programme, mentioned above a
defaultnd
default delivered in 
defaultpartnership with 
defaultsportdefaultscotland
default 
defaulthas
default been highly successful
default 
defaultin encouraging
default PE staff to carry out consultation 
defaultwith their female pupils, with 98.8% 
defaultof PE staff who have taken 
defaultpart
default in the programme reporting that they undertook such a consultation. 
defaultMeanwhile, 60% of PE staff reported that Fit for Girls had helped to increase girls' participation in PE, sport and physical activity. In particular, those who were involved in Fit fo
defaultr Girls noted that it helped to remove barriers to girls taking part in PE and sport and increase their confidence and enthusiasm for the subject.
default&#xa0;
defaultFit for Girls 
defaulthas start
defaulted to create a culture change in
default PE, physical activity and sport engagement for adole
defaultscent girls in schools. Building on this learning, Fit for Girls is now offering schools the opportunity to engage with a Fit for Girls trainer in a bespoke 1:1 
defaultapproach in order t
defaulto allow discussions and solutions to be individually tailored to meet school
default needs.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Youth Sport Trust 
defaultwould welcome direction from government for
default all secondary schools to consult with their 
defaultfemale 
defaultpupils in this way. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition the Youth Sport Trust believes that schools should be encouraged to develop their own female sporting role models. With a lack of positive role models in the media, older girls in school can serve as strong role models for younger girls, demons
defaulttrating the realistic possibilities of what they can achieve. 
defaultA crucial element of the Youth Sport Trust’s Girls PE and Innovation project, is that the ‘GLAMS’ mentioned above also act as role models to younger girls and help to ‘sell’ participation in PE 
defaultand school sport. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultResearch shows that boys are more likely than girls to prefer school sport or physical activity to be competitive
default.
default In order to engage all young people, including girls, in competition, it is imperative that sporting formats are fully inclusive, and the wider benefits of taking part are emphasised to young people and school sport practitioners. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, while som
defaulte girls find traditional, confrontational, models of competition off-putting, research shows they are more likely to engage in personal or group challenge activities
default. The Youth Sport Trust therefore believes that government and practitioners should employ
default a diverse approach which values different forms of competition equally.
