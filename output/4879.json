\nThe Terrorism Acts in 2012 \n(July 2013), chapter 10.\n \n              \nThe Terrorism Acts in 2011 \n(June 2012), chapter 4; \nThe Terrorism Acts in 2012 \n(July 2013), chapter 5.\n \n              \nControl Orders in 2011\n (March 2012), 6.13-6.14; \nTPIMs in 2012\n (March 2013), 11.30-11.32.\n \n              \nDescriptions of each current TPIM subject, taken from open sources, are given in \nTPIMs in 2012\n (March 2013), chapter 4.  Two of them are believed to have been involved in the 2006 airline liquid bomb plot, and have been under control orders or TPIMs since 2007 and 2008 respectively.  A number of others are believed to have links with terrorism in East Africa.\n \n              \nTPIMs in 2012 \n(March 2013), 11.33-11.38.\n \n              \nhttps://terrorismlegislationreviewer.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Justice_and_Security_oral_evidence_for_clickable_pdf.pdf\n, evidence of 16 October, QQ 72-82.\n \n              \nhttp://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/eu-sub-com-f/Protocol36OptOut/VolofevidenceP36asat110113.pdf\n, pp. 1-4.  That evidence was summarised and supplemented in \nThe Terrorism Acts in 2012\n (July 2013), 3.17-3.23.\n \n              \nTPIMs in 2012\n (March 2013), 11.3-11.10.  No former controlled person was ever successfully prosecuted for a terrorist offence: \nControl Orders in 2011\n, March 2012, 3.19-3.21, 3.51.\n \n              \nTPIMs in 2012 \n(March 2013), chapter 10.\n"
