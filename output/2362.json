"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted on behalf of English Heritage by Dave Batchelor, Head of Historic Environmental Intelligence (GSH0007)1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnglish Heritage is Government’s \nstatutory adviser on the historic environment and an Executive Non-Departmental Public Body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, with its funding agreement signed by the Department for Communities and Local Government, and the Departme\nnt for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.  It was established by the National Heritage Act 1983 and seeks to broaden public access to England’s cultural heritage, increase people’s understanding and appreciation of the past, and conserve and enhance the \nhistoric environment.\n&#xa0;\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the past English Heritage picked up intelligence and undertook limited horizon scanning and foresight exercises. This happened in an ad-hoc way and there were no mechanisms for collating the intelligence or considering and acting \nupon the foresight or horizon scanning. \n More recently we have sought to recognise and integrate this work into our future work.\n&#xa0;\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2011 English Heritage launched the National Heritage Protection Plan (NHPP) which \nis a major strategy that identifies those\n parts of England’s Heritage that matter to people most and are at greatest risk – and then concentrates efforts on saving them\n.\n The plan recognises that t\nhere are many public, commercial and voluntary organisations that ensure our heritage is cared for, \nappreciated and enjoyed.\n  \nAt the heart of the Plan is a clear set of priorities about what matters and what is in danger of being lost\n and where opportunities exist\n.\n \nThese were identified following a widespread public consultation which is repeated every y\near to ensure the Plan remains up-to-date and relevant to changing circumstances.\n&#xa0;\n4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe NHPP identifies eight measures, broad themes, which in turn are further subdivided into identifiable activities and cover all of our heritage protection activities these\n measures are – \n      \nMeasure 1 – Foresight\nMeasure 2 - Threat: Assessment and Response\nMeasure 3 - Understanding: Recognition/Identification of the Resource\nMeasure 4 - Understanding: Assessment of Character and Significance\nMeasure 5 -\n Responses: Protecting Significance\nMeasure 6 - \nManaging Change\nMeasure 7 - Responses: Protecting and Managing Major Historic Estates\nMeasure 8 - Responses: Help and Advice for Owners\n&#xa0;\n5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs part of this, English Heritage has set out the contribution we inten\nd to make in \nall of the measures in \nan Action Plan\n.  This explains what we are doing to protect the heritage, why, where and when.  It makes our programme of work transparent and more accountable to the public than ever before.\n The structure of the plan r\necognises the need for foresight to inform the subsequent actions within the \nmeasures and \nindividual \nactivities.\n \n&#xa0;\n6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition English Heritage established the Historic Environment Intelligence Team in 2011, they have been given a pivotal role in establishing the practice of horizon scanning and intelligence gathering within English Heritage and the wider sector. \nIn ad\ndition they are looking \noutwards \nto \ntry to \nensure that the historic environment aspects are considered when other bodies are undertaking horizon scanning and foresight exercises. \n&#xa0;\n7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn establishing the team and its working practices we have had to rely heav\nily upon those that have already developed practices and methods which are proven. In particular we have drawn upon the published outputs from BIS and the DEFRA/NE/EA family. Within the wider Government framework we have found that there is little to draw \nupon from the ‘cultural’ sector, with the exception of audience research or insight.\n&#xa0;\n8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne aspect of the teams work is to begin to move towards a more pro-active model of working. Currently English Heritage along with the majority of those in the sector, wh\nether in local government or the commercial sectors, operates within a highly reactive working environment. The need to prioritise and manage reducing resources, whist maintaining, or improving the protection for the historic environment, are very current \nreasons for adopting this approach.\n&#xa0;\n9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow do Government departments make use of horizon scanning - For reasons explained above English Heritage has very limited experience of interacting with Government departments or NDPBs. We therefore do not feel in the position to make any general statements about how the products of horizon scanning are being us\ned. That said those few times where we have engaged with other NDPBs in their horizon scanning exercises our contributions and views have been welcomed.\n&#xa0;\n10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow effective is horizon scanning in Government? Do Ministers and senior officials consider horizon scanning outputs appropriately? – For the same reasons as above we are not in a position to give answers to these questions. We have observed that \nthere are often what may be termed behavioural reasons why horizon scanning is treated with degrees of sceptici\nsm, which from our position are unwarranted. \n&#xa0;\n11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat changes could be made to improve existing horizon scanning activity? – From our limited experience we’ve noted the confusion that surrounds the different usages of the term horizon scanning, along with ot\nher allied terms such as foresight. In paragraph 5 of his report Jon Day highlights this issue and goes onto to define horizon scanning for the purposes of the report. We would like to see this broadened out such that there were common terms and definition\ns used across Government and the NDPBs.\n \n&#xa0;\n12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWill the recommendations made in Jon Day’s review of cross-government horizon scanning capability address current shortcomings? – Again from our limited experience it is likely that these recommendations will impro\nve the situation. The Day report recognises the need for both top down and bottom up approaches and we feel that the recommendations better cover the former and there is still work to be done to address the latter.\n&#xa0;13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat progress has been made implementing these? Not aware of any apart from the call for evidence.\n&#xa0;14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow effective is the Government at responding to policy or regulatory challenges presented by new technologies? – One issue with new technologies is the apparent late engagement by Government and \nits NDPBs which means that these technologies are often developed without any reference to wider implications. Additionally this late engagement means that any necessary policy or regulatory matters are not considered alongside the development of the techn\nology and therefore anything needed is often seen as an afterthought. Better horizon scanning should be able to pick up these developments and help avoid this scenario.\n&#xa0;15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have one observation to make on the 3D printing case study. The ability of laser sc\nanners to capture artefacts and objects and then to send the data to a remote 3D printer opens up many opportunities across the historic environment sector. One such opportunity is the potential for museums to make available 3D images of artefacts which co\nuld then be printed out remotely, in effect a development of the collections on line approach which currently uses still or moving images. The ability for people to actually handle the object brings an added dimension which cannot be under estimated.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.english-heritage.org.uk/professional/protection/national-heritage-protection-plan/all-about-NHPP/\n \nhttp://www.english-heritage.org.uk/professional/protection/national-heritage-protection-plan/plan/\n"
