[normal]Call for evidence: EU action to tackle youth unemployment 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Submission on behalf of the European Parliament’s Youth Intergroup by 
[normal]Rebecca Taylor MEP[bold], Vice President of the Intergroup.

[normal]Questions:
[normal]1. 
[normal]Do you think that the EU should be providing funding to Member States to tackle youth unemployment? Does EU action respect Member States’ powers in the area of social and employment affairs?[bold] 
[normal]The Youth Employment Initiative (YEI), together with provisions of the European Social Fund 
[normal]are
[normal] fully in line with the EU2020 strategy which considers youth unemployment to be one of the main challenges facing Europe. The aim of having at least 75% of the population aged 20-64 in work cannot be reached without strong action to increase young people's participation in the labour market.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The economic crisis has reduced capacity in many EU countries to respond to such a huge problem affecting young people, making the EU budget and in particular programmes such as the European Social Fund important tools in supporting regional authorities in their efforts to reduce youth unemployment and modernize educational and employment services. From a European perspective, investing in these areas makes sense only if there is better coordination of Member States' actions in the field of employment that promote the mobility of young workers as well as improve the overall conditions for young people into the labour market.

[normal]How do you think that the EU can best ‘add value’ to Member States’ efforts to tackle unemployment?[bold] Europe can act as a multiplier and supporter of domestic reforms that need to be followed by coherent and consistent action at all levels. EU action should therefore be aimed at exchanging best practice, and supporting and coordinating Member States’ reforms in fundamental fields such as: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] promoting a rights-based approach to youth and employment
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] involving youth stakeholders in policy making,
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] focusing on access to 
[normal]quality 
[normal]employment, education and training
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] assisting Member States in the reforms of their welfare systems
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] supporting action against early dropout from school or from training or apprenticeship schemes 
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] developing comprehensive strategies for young people who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs)

[normal] Is there sufficient disaggregation in EU measures to tackle youth unemployment between, for example, support for young people classified as being not in education, employment or training (‘NEETs’), support for newly qualified graduates looking for work, and general career guidance?[bold] 
[normal]Many Member States put forward policies that seek to improve young people's transition from education to employment: some measures seek to prevent early school leaving, while others aim to reintegrate early school leavers. Another important path is seeking to facilitate a smoother transition from education to work, while some interventions strive to increase the employability of young people. The problem today across Europe is the lack of coordination among different schemes and programmes and their links with the existing legislation and other important measures such as labour incentives and industrial policies plans. The EU youth guarantee is a scheme that tries for the first time to coordinate all those actions while also promoting a cultural shift in the way how we design active employment policies for young people. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal]Are the EU’s accounting, monitoring and evaluation procedures sufficient to be able to determine whether EU funded projects to tackle youth unemployment have been successful or not? Are there ways in which they could be improved? [bold]All EU funded programmes can encounter problems with monitoring and evaluation. In relation youth employment programmes, establishing consistent and comparable mechanisms for the monitoring and assessment of youth employment projects is one of the challenges for the future, which also has to deal with different evaluation processes in different Member States. However, the EUROFUND report “Effectiveness of policy measures to increase the participation of young people in employment” clearly shows how schemes can succeed in providing valuable assistance to young people including particular target groups.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5. 
[normal]How do you think the funds allocated through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and the European Social Fund (ESF) could best be spent?[bold] 
[normal]Current priorities should be threefold: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. 
[normal]Do you feel that young people (aged 15-24), youth groups and their representatives are involved and consulted to a satisfactory degree in the decisions being made around EU funding for youth unemployment projects, and how they are administered?[bold] 
[normal]According to the European Youth Forum: 
[normal]“the level of involvement of youth organisations at EU level in the creation of policies tackling youth employment has been satisfactory while the level of endorsement of their input has been only partial. In 
[normal]particular, calls for more funding for the youth guarantee, for a European quality framework on internships and calls for relevant investments in long term quality job creation have not been taken into insufficient consideration.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally, the management and the implementation of the YEI at national level has to be conducted with close consultation with youth organisations (as stated in the Council Recommendation establishing the Youth Guarantee) but the picture we have up to now is that of a limited, scarce or absent consultation.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. 
[normal]Should the EU and Member States take into account the positive and negative socio-economic impacts of youth migration due to unemployment when designing measures to tackle youth unemployment? How might any negative consequences be mitigated? [bold]Several Member States have already implemented measures to support the integration of young migrant workers into the labour market. Generally, young Europeans who move to another Member State to find work are highly motivated and may also be well educated and trained, but this should not exclude them from programmes aimed at getting young people into work. In particular, young migrant workers may not always know their employment rights in the country to which they have moved, and can thus be vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous employers, for example being paid less than the minimum wage or (unknowingly) doing undeclared work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition, it can be necessary to undertake targeted action for those young people from an immigrant background who suffer the problems of early exit from education and long term unemployment. Getting such young people back into education, training or employment is a valuable investment in societal integration. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8. 
[normal]How can the EU and Member States embrace new technologies and new methods of working to combat youth unemployment? [bold]The EU and Member States can use online resources and social media to promote initiatives aimed at both getting young people into work, or training, and equipping them with the skills needed to find high quality employment through on-line training programmes. One example of this could be for the UK to use online resources and social media to promote EU funded programmes such as ERASMUS, which enables students to spend a part of their course at a university in another European country, or LEONARDO, which offers graduates the possibility of doing a paid internship in another European country. Such programmes are able to provide young people with essential practical and intercultural skills, which are often more valuable than exam results to employers working in a globalised economy. Recent British Council research lamented that that “fewer than 2% of UK students are studying abroad, despite the opportunities it provides."
