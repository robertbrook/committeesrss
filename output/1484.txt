[[[Written evidence submitted by Public Health England (RaD0016)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We have been asked to submit written evidence to the Science and Technology committee and comment on the four points raised by the National Audit Office’s (NAO) review of Research and Development funding for science and technology in the UK, and the 2010 and 2013 Spending Reviews.&#xa0; Our responses are as follows:&#xa0;

[[[Office first point ]]]Between 1995 and 2011, overall annual spending on R&amp;D increased in real terms by 37% (from just under £20 billion to just under £27 billion) and most of this growth was driven by UK businesses. However, spending declined between 2007 and 2010.&#xa0;

[[[PHE Response]]]We do not have a response available for this point. &#xa0;

[[[National Audit Office ]]]

[[[second point]]]Between 1995 and 2011, the Government has progressively reduced the amount it spends on undertaking R&amp;D itself through public research institutions but, at the same time, has increased the funding it provides to UK businesses. &#xa0;

[[[PHE Response]]]We welcome the fact that government funding routed through industry has increased.&#xa0; In our experience TSB funding has provided an effective incentive for SMEs to undertake R&amp;D in areas of importance to public health, and to collaborate with PHE where access to specialist science or facilities is required.&#xa0;We have some concerns about the reduction in R&amp;D conducted by Public Sector Research Establishments.&#xa0; PSREs have a valuable role to play in addressing issues of societal importance through challenge-led R&amp;D.&#xa0; Such R&amp;D is typically unattractive to both academic bodies (as it tends to be focused on outcomes rather than publications) and to industry (as it may not offer sufficient commercial return) but government R&amp;D can be a valuable bridge between the two.&#xa0;The historical perception that the UK is “good at innovation, bad at exploitation” is no longer universally true, but care must be taken to ensure that incentives exist to translate innovation into practical outcomes and economic growth.&#xa0; The inclusion of impact assessment into academic R&amp;D funding allocation decisions has been beneficial, and could usefully be extended to bodies such as the NHS and PSREs which conduct R&amp;D for the benefit of the public but have limited capacity to exploit and disseminate the resulting innovations.&#xa0;

[[[third point]]]UK business R&amp;D spending is concentrated in a small number of very large firms, with the pharmaceuticals sector accounting for 28% of total UK business R&amp;D spend. This sector is a key driver of innovation but the UK’s reliance on the sector is also a risk.&#xa0;              

[[[PHE Response]]]A strong and innovative UK R&amp;D base is an important element in ensuring improved public health in the UK.&#xa0; This is true not only in the obvious areas of vaccines and pharmaceuticals, but also in ICT (applications, software and data analytical tools of relevance to public health), genomics, remote sensing, geographic information, nutrition, and social marketing.&#xa0; We would welcome further R&amp;D growth in these areas without neglecting the UK’s leading position in pharmaceutical sciences.&#xa0;

[[[Audit Office ]]]

[[[fourth point]]]The UK receives a significant amount of R&amp;D funding from the European Commission:  Framework Programme.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[PHE Response]]]The European Commission supports world-class collaborative research and is a major contributor of funding and future collaboration opportunities to PHE researchers.  PHE has an excellent international reputation and participates in an extensive network of multidisciplinary collaborative research projects with European public health institutes and other European organisations.  These collaborations have a number of positive aspects including formal and informal information exchange and pooling of resources, as well as opportunities to benefit from EU funded research outputs and support national research with pooled expertise. The European funding framework (Horizon 2020) will present excellent opportunities for PHE to compete for resources to improve national health protection.  &#xa0;&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;
