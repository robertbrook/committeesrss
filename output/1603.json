"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Tony Cornah – Written evidence&#xa0;a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI cycle regularly and I am a volunteer \nSustrans\n Ranger.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI walk regularly in the Peak District, and have often had my walk disturbed by all-terrain vehicles of various sorts; 4-wheel drive cars, trail bikes, \nquad\n bikes.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe worst aspect of all-terrain vehicles is the way they spoil the surface of the path badly making walking and cycling very difficult if not impossible in some parts of the Peak District.\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEven where there are barriers to prevent entry to paths by off-\nroading\n vehicles these can often be got round – trail bikes and quad bikes can quite easily go through the normal barriers for cyclists; on Sunday 25\nth\n August 2013 while carrying out our regular \nSustrans\n route litter-pick and general check, 2 quads and a trail bike roared through \nBeeley\n Woods between \nClaywheels\n Lane and \nOughtibridge\n in Sheffield so we reported this on 101 (incident number 511).\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI would therefore request that you consider: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
