[normal]Written evidence from 
[normal]Newcycling Newcastle Cycling Campaign
[normal] (LTD0020)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Newcycling (Newcastle's cycling campaign, 1,200 members, volunteer organisation, constituted, formed in 2010) would like to respond to your request about views on local transport expenditure. We will focus solely on cycling (and progress on council 
[normal]policy to increase cycle modal share) as this shows both the complexity of the process and the current disconnect in clear accountability and evidenced decision-making for public spending and policy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Submission is also available online 
[normal]http://newcycling.org/news/20131213/transport-committee-local-decision-making-transport-expenditure
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The wider context is that other countries spend up to £30 per head on cyclin
[normal]g to extend and maintain their networks [ref.1] and that 30% of journeys, or more, are done by bike. The UK spends about £1-2 per head and has a cycle modal share of 2-3%. It's clear that it is the bicycle that's so silently absent from the modal share, ex
[normal]penditure and economic planning in the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendation[bold]: Transport authorities to make expenditure clear and publish routinely for public scrutiny and debate. In the short-term and in light of current d
[normal]rip-fed national funding system, transport authorities to make plans in advance in line with sustainable transport policies and reactivate those plans when funding sources become available. In the medium term, a national cycling budget to be set aside 
[normal]ie
[normal] £
[normal]1-2bn year on year to provide funding certainty to local transport authorities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendation[bold]: National government to mainstream cycle-pr
[normal]oofing in major transport projects and compel local transport authorities to comply. Better national design standards may help to achieve this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendation[bold]: Stronger land-use planning and engineering design rules for sustain
[normal]able travel and avoiding negative on and off-site impacts of traditional designs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendation[bold]: Council(s) to o
[normal]vercome silo working and connect relevant departments to work together, make good use of spending and make each pound go further.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendation[bold]: Policy review on council level to strip policy back to basics and make it relevant for debating, authorising and approving budgets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendation[bold]: For per-capita funding applications Newcastle shoul
[normal]d use population figures including its surroundings, to mitigate for the traffic generation elsewhere and modal shift be funded at destination (
[normal]ie
[normal] car parking restraint policy, public realm improvements 
[normal]etc
[normal]). A decoupled / ring-fenced budget stream would b
[normal]e helpful.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendation[bold]: 
[normal]DfT
[normal] should ring-fence minimum levels of expenditure for sustainable transport including cycling &amp; walking and any funding allocation m
[normal]anaged through competition to include a prominent cycling and walking criteria. Government should 
[normal]require  Local
[normal] Transport Boards to include civil society representatives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In summary[bold] 
[normal]We appreciate and understand the rationale for the devolution of decisi
[normal]on, control and resources but we urge central government to have a national transport policy which promotes cycling and walking through a well-structured and sustained budget and to show leadership in recognising the importance of cycling infrastructure an
[normal]d best practice design to achieve higher cycling modal shares to unlock the health, social and environmental benefits. 
[normal]A restructuring of the budget is required to align with the desired outcomes. The current mechanism for cycle transport expenditure and 
[normal]budget (as part of the overall transport allocation) is too complex and interconnected, and therefore easily remains marginalised, as exactly has happened in the past. Due to the inconsistent and random nature, expenditure figures are rarely available. How
[normal]ever it is clear that Newcastle, apart from the funding boost over the next two years, may not sustain the same levels of investment if decisions are made through an economic partnership with a traditional motor vehicle focus which could even be less trans
[normal]parent and accountable than its predecessor. 
[normal]National assistance is required to bring about that understanding and focus, so that cycling will be duly reflected in national as well as local structure of budgets and design principles.
