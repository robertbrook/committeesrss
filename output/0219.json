"Written evidence submitted by Key Forensic Services Ltd (FSS028)1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are not aware of any cohesive central government strategy for the development of the UK forensic market. T\nhe combination of\n \nausterity reductions prompting police forces to be far more selective on what evidence and\n case types they submit to FSPs alongside \npolice plans to increase the\n amount of \nforensic \nwo\nrk insourced\n \nis dramat\nically reducing the market size\n for outsourced forensic services provided by the private sector. We estimate the market available to private providers has reduced from circ\na £180m of a few years ago to circa £80\nm today, with further downward pressure \nas forensic budgets are cut further.\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite the proven value of using forensic services in the \ndetection of \ncrime \nand the inherent cost efficiencies of using forensic analysis vs alternative policing measures\n,\n police and other law enforcement agencies continue to apply their own budget reductions to out-sourced services, including forensic services. \nPrivate forensic suppliers will have their ability to conduct R&amp;D severely curtailed as\n a\n direct result of reduced profitability and also a reduced opportunity to recover initial R&amp;D investment in a rapidly shrinking market\n, removing\n incentive to make initial R&amp;D investment. \n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany sources of government funding to support R&amp;D have been terminated, leaving no or very little grant aid for the support of R&amp;D\n, especially in the forensics sector due to its rapidly shrinking size\n.\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a consequence of \nthe rapidly falling market size\n \nFSP\n services are increasingly price\n sensitive, building pressure for\n further price reductions. \nThe combined impact of falling market volumes and falling prices will inevitably have an adverse impact on resource available for on-going R&amp;D or other improvements to service\ns\n developed by the private FSPs, whereas very little or no\n R&amp;D or similar improvements have been\n develo\nped by police in-house activity so far.\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a consequence of the points raised above it is our conclusion that there is no\n national strategy for forensic science\n and, therefore, it cannot possibly be sufficient to \nsupport either forensic science R&amp;D\n or the criminal justice system.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe implementation of the contracts to award previous FSS casework to KFS ran smoothly from our perspective. We have no knowledge of the budget to close the FSS and so have no opinion on this aspect.\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is our opinion, however, that whatever the costs of closing the FSS these will be recouped many times over by the more cost efficient delivery of the same services from private FSPs who are providing the same high quality service at \nconsiderably\n lower prices than the FSS were using.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1 \n              \nThe vast majority of outsourced police forensic services are procured via the Next Generation Forensic Framework Agreement. For private FSPs to secure approval to supply services via this procurement vehicle they must have secured the necessary accreditations for each forensic discipline they wish to provide. The accreditations are awarded and subsequently monitored by an independent accreditation service, UKAS, the same service that awarded and maintained similar accreditations to the FSS. \nTherefore, the private FSPs provide services to the same \nor higher \nstandard\ns\n as previously provided by the FSS, which are constantly reviewed and enhance\nd\n by UKAS, \nThe Forensic Science Regulator and other stakeholders such as the National DNA Database Delivery Unit and NDNAD Strategy Board. \n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe same is not true of \nsome small FSPs,\n individual forensic experts who continue to operate outside of ISO 17025 \nand some \nin-house police forensic services, where individual police forces are able to provide their own forensic services without accreditation, or \nat best with\n nominal accreditation but without the breadth of accreditation required for each forensic discipline, which is a mandatory requirement for private FSPs before they are eligible to tender for police forensic contracts.\n \n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo comply with accreditation requirements all operational staff must be thoroughly trained and \nassessed as competent in each aspect of their area of expertise. This is a requirement \nof \nthe Forensic Science Regulator Codes of Practice and \nConduct \na \ncornerstone to achieving ISO 17025 accreditation\n.\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKFS did not use the FSS for any of its training requirements. As a consequence, it is KFS’ opinion that none of its own staff have suffered any detriment to their own training needs.\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKFS offers training courses across the breadth of forensic disciplines \nto\n police and other interested parties, on a similar basis to that previously provided by the FSS. It is thus KFS’s opinion that the CJS has not materially \nsuffered from any loss of training service offered by the FSS, as the same service is available from KFS and we welcome the additional source of income any such service would generate.\n&#xa0;\n4.1 \n              \n              \nThe F\norensic \nScience R\negulator should set the standard for any particular service and then promulgate the minimum standard service provider\ns\n must achieve pr\nior to providing services. The R\negulator should thus \npromote forensic best practise and effectively set the standard for minimum service levels in the UK, thereby promoting the excellence of UK based forensic services to the world.\n4.2 \n              \nHaving\n established best practise the R\negulator should \nmonitor and ensure that the appropriate minimum standard for the provision of any forensic service is maintained. This requirement should be universally applied to all \nproviders of forensic services.\n4.3\n              \nThe Forensic R\negulator should act as the ultimate arbiter of disputes arising be\ntween FSPs and other CJS partners.\n4.4\n              \nThe R\negulator should promote the UK FSPs to international \ncriminal investigation services and their CJS.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1 \n              \nDuring the last few years austerity measures\n have \ngenerated\n pressure on police budgets\n causing \nforces\n to be more selective on what they will submit \nfor \nforensic analysis\n. Police forces\n have\n also increased \npre-submission \nscreening of evidence prior to submission for forensic analysis. Macro economic factors have thus had a substantial impact on market volumes. Over the same period pricing has become increasingly competitive as suppliers seek to grow or maintain their \ntotal \nsales \nincome \nagainst the backdrop of a \nvery rapidly \ndeclining market. The total market has thus reduced due to an overall reduction in volumes and also because of price reductions.\n5.2 \n              \nAs part of the FSS closure a significant proportion of police forensic activity previously outsourced was instead brought in-house, further substantially reducing the market size available to FSPs. The in-sourcing of previously outsourced service is the most destabilising factor for private FSPs, as the gradual decline in revenue from reducing volumes or falling prices is more manageable over time, whereas in-sourcing represents an immediate market reduction from which there is no recovery. \nContinued police in-sourcing\n activity also undermines investor interest in the sector, increasing the perceived “risk” that the market will reduce further or disappear in-house entirely.\n At the very least, police in-sourcing increases price competition to the point that margins are potentially squeezed beyond an FSPs ability to generate sufficiently attractive investor returns.\n5.3 \n              \nKFS estimates the current police outsourced forensic market at circa £80m and very likely to fall further as a result of additional budget reductions for police, being disproportionately f\nocused on forensic expenditure.\n5.4 \n              \nThe market cannot be considered s\nt\nable until the persistent \nreductions in police forensic spend and in-sourced activity have stab\ni\nlised.\n&#xa0;\n6. &#xa0;How are forensic science services procured by police forces and could procurement processes be improved?&#xa0;6.1 \n              \nThe vast majority of forensic services for the police are procured using the Next Generation Forensic Framework Agreement. The national procurement process is managed by the \nForensic Marketplace \nManagement Team attached to the Home Office\n (formally Poli\nce Science and Forensics Unit, \nNPIA)\n. The \nFMM T\neam assist regional police forces \nin the implementation of their own tenders under the umbrella framework agreement.\n&#xa0;\n6.2 \n              \nThe closure of the FSS delayed the previous schedule for regional mini tenders\n using the framework agreement\n, resulting in the current round of tenders being truncated\n to ensure that they are all renewed within legal time frames. It would be better for future t\nenders to be phased so that there was a\n reasonable period for scaling up and\n/or\n scaling down during implementation of \ncontract \nawards.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nSome police tenders remain outside the framework and are either made using a purchase order for low value purchases or a separate stand alone procurement process.\n We could not suggest how this process may be improved.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn leaving the FSS undoubtedly some of its scientists left the forensic science profession, by either retiring, taking up alternative careers or even leaving the country.\n7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, the market for outsourced forensics has more than halved since the decision to close the FSS was made.\n In such circumstances there would have inevitably been a loss of intellectual wealth even if the FSS had remained open. Many of the scientists previously working at the FSS have since taken up roles within the private FSPs or police \nforensic \nfacilities. There remains in the remaining FSPs and police \nforensic \nlaboratories sufficient intellectual property to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of forensic science, especially as the volume of activity has halved since the FSS’s closure.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8. Are current arrangements for the FSS’s archives satisfactory? How could arrangements for the retention of case files and forensic materials in the UK be improved?&#xa0;\n8.1 We are not privy to the detail of how the FSS’s archives are arranged. We are not best placed to suggest how such arrangements might be improved.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDeclaration of Interest by Key Forensic Services Ltd. Key Forensic Services Ltd is private UK owned company, offering a broad range of forensic services primarily to UK law enforcement agencies, and established as a direct competitor to the FSS. As such, Key Forensic Services is anticipating a more rapid uptake of FSS clients, which the company would otherwise have anticipated over a more protracted period via the scheduled Police procurement program.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
