[[[lliance (PEX 0007)]]]&#xa0;With nearly 60,000 members and 100 local groups in England and Wales and branches in Malta, Northern Ireland and Scotland, we are a powerful voice for pensioners.&#xa0;A number of concerns have been brought to our attention by our members over the current proposals for older people in the care system in England.  There does not seem to be a lot of clarification around these points in the public domain at present, but we have noticed there is a great deal of anger.  The following is a summary of what people are saying.  If people’s perceptions are accurate, and they act as stated, there is a potential impact on public expenditure for both care and health:&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; If somebody has a house to sell are they going to be able to use that to get extra choice and a better care home?  Does that mean people like me will be put in one of those homes that are cheaper for the local authority, but are really badly run?  I have heard about places like Orchard View and I am scared. 2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; If I am being cared for at home and can’t afford to pay, will I be left with minimum hours, or nothing at all, as nobody can make a profit from me? (They had heard of a case in which an 84 year old had been refused help from a private provider for being unprofitable).3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We feel that care homes are sometimes being set up by people with no background in care, and the press has shown that staff in some homes are badly trained and bullied by management. Older people, even if they are paying a great deal of money, can end up abused and neglected.  Not all homes are like this, but too many are, and there is not always a choice as the good homes are filled up. 4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; They seem to want us to give up everything we have worked for all our lives.  Well I am not paying a penny, I would rather die first. This reply, now becoming increasingly common, was often added as a further response to the other comments we have summarised.  (We feel that this runs the risk of leading to more A&amp;E and hospital visits and admissions, thus putting a greater strain on the NHS. If people refuse to pay, care services may be lost, too.)5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; They are talking about taking our houses and valuables.  When will they do this?  Even if they don’t throw my husband out of our house straight after I die, will they be coming for my personal possessions?  If I am the last survivor, will they be after even the rings I want to be buried in.  Will this override my will?  I want to give family stuff to my children…this is like something out of Dickens.6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Why should we pay all this money to live in cramped conditions, share a bathroom, and be fed overcooked bland food, followed by sitting in a circle around a TV?&#xa0;Our organization is concerned that current proposals have the potential to lead to a two tier system, where frail vulnerable older people, without the means to pay, will be increasingly denied funding on the grounds they are not eligible (even if they are very frail and vulnerable), by cash strapped Local Authorities. There is also the fear of being sent to “second class” care homes, since they are relying on a Local Authority that may not have the money available to pay extra for a better placement. &#xa0;People are also worried that, seeing a potential for profit from self funders, but lacking the appropriate background and ethos, entrepreneurs and businesses will look to set up care homes which only just pass as acceptable, but which their local authority and other agencies may tolerate due to a lack of suitable places, since really good care homes can be scarce, and very often full.  They fell that as a result those less good homes may be all that is available to them, even though they are paying a lot of money and using all their assets.&#xa0;We are also concerned that, if people refuse to pay for care, essential services could be lost, and the NHS would be stretched as a consequence.  If too many older people refuse to pay for care, will this have the potential to drive down their overall health, function and wellbeing - and perhaps average life spans?  This would possibly have a detrimental effect on the NHS ability to deal with the increasing numbers of older people, and drive up its costs.&#xa0;Younger relatives, particularly women, may be forced to give up work to look after elderly parents or relatives who refuse care, which would be a backward step for women in employment, and for the economic health of the country.  Other elderly frail and vulnerable people may not have relatives nearby, or their relatives may not be in a position to help with care.  If they refuse formal care it seems likely they would be at increasing risk, and end up costing the NHS and other services more. From the comments of our members it seems that older people may avoid all services, not just care, as they fear being brought to the attention of the social care service, being forced to accept care or a care home place by officials, and losing their homes and valuables.&#xa0;We would very much welcome a clarification around these points to submit to our members.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
