defaultSnelson
default, Director of Strategy, Milton Keynes Council and sponsor of the Milton Keynes Future City Programme.
defaultThe Future City Programme is an umbrella for a range of innovative programmes and projects including the Low Carbon Urban Transport Zone (LUTZ) programme that has an autonomous vehicles theme. 
defaultImplementation of these initiatives has benefited significantly from the involvement of the new Catapult centres.     
defaultIndividual Catapults have provided expert advice and additional capacity to develop projects. They have been able to assist in securing input from expert academic and industry partners and sharing intelligence on new and innovative developments in their respective fields. They have also acted as points of co-ordination for business and government input more widely. 
defaultOne of the most positive aspects of the Catapults is their interest in learning about practice and innovation in localities. Both bottom-up and top-down perspectives are essential to horizon scanning activity and the most effective arena for understanding the future is arguably at the level of the city, where technology and other developments can be scoped and understood within a locality context – including implementation opportunities and challenges.

defaultMilton Keynes benefits strongly from its excellent connectivity to national transport networks and the ease of mobility within its urban area. The council is addressing the transport challenges of the future at the same time as meeting demanding carbon reduction targets through a set of innovative transport projects. These
default 
defaultinclude the deployment of over 100 publicly-accessible charging points for electric vehicles, the imminent launch of a wirelessly charged electric bus service, and the launch of an electric-vehicle car club.  The recent arrival of the Transport Systems Catapult adds to the city’s credentials as a transport innovator.

defaultThe Low Carbon Urban Transport Zone (LUTZ) programme has been developed by the Intelligent Mobility Working Group (IMWG) of the UK Automotive Council.  It has a value of £65 million and is scheduled to run over 5 years from 2014. LUTZ is to be located in Milton Keynes and 
defaultis supported by Government (BIS and 
defaultDfT
default) and the Transport Systems Catapult (which is based in Milton Keynes). It will 
defaultexplore the potential for Intelligent Mobility 
default– including autonomous and on-demand services
default - to deliver early benefits within 5 years and substantial benefits to the UK transport system by 2030. It will d
defaultemonstrate
default the ability of the UK to perform at the leading edge of transport innovation; and d
defaulto something that is demonstrably ‘smarter’ 
default- than anything seen elsewhere in the world, including a real-time city mobility map.

defaultLUTZ is an 
defaultintegrated programme with three key themes that have a high degree of 
defaultinnovative content. Many of the practical details will only be defined through the carefully controlled implementation that is planned. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAdefault.
default Autonomous Vehicle Themedefault3.4
default              
defaultThis theme will deploy an on-demand autonomous transport system using lightweight 2-seater ‘pods’ operating within 
defaultpedestrianised
default spaces of the city-centre. The exact locations will be scoped and agreed with the council as part of the implementation planning, but are likely to include a route from the railway station to the city centre. It will provide a working system which enables an in-depth understanding of how the public might react to autonomous vehicles, what practical problems might be associated with running them in mixed pedestrian/vehicle spaces, and how a system owner might operate the service and make a profit. It will also work with Milton Keynes Council and the Department for Transport to explore how regulatory structures might be shaped to allow autonomous vehicles to operate freely and safely in mixed city-centre environments.
default3.5
default              
defaultThe pods will be capable of speeds of up to 12 mph and equipped with technology that enables them to operate safely alongside pedestrians  including visual, radar and other types of sensor, object recognition capabilities and safety critical systems. The pods run directly on road or paved surfaces and their electronic guidance systems mean that rails or tracks are not needed. 
defaultActivity 1 – Planning (2014)default3.6
default              
defaultThe first 12 months will be devoted to detailed planning and preparation, working closely with council services. Infrastructure adaptations will be made e.g. painting lines on paving to identify pod pathways; installing segregation barriers; installing the electric pod charging points; etc.
defaultActivity 2 – Systems Development (2015 to 2017)default3.7
default              
defaultStep 1:
default A limited number of pods (20) will run on designated routes with segregation of the vehicles from members of the public who are not riding on the system.  The vehicles will move under driver-control, and empty vehicles will be collected and re-positioned during the working day by operator ‘valets’.
default3.8
default              
defaultStep 2:
default The pod fleet will be expanded to 40 units. The pods will continue to operate on pathways where pods and pedestrians are strictly segregated, but the pods will be progressively turned over to fully autonomous control.
default3.9
default              
defaultStep 3:
default The pods will continue to operate in fully autonomous mode; the segregation of pods from pedestrians will be progressively removed until the pods are moving freely amongst pedestrians throughout the designated zone.
default3.10
default              
defaultThe later stages of the project will include the development of a road-going autonomous taxi. This activity will draw on learning gained early in the project. 
defaultB. Spontaneous Mobility Themedefault3.11
default              
defaultThis theme will examine how current and future transport options might be made available and co-ordinated through a city-wide system that is responsive to the needs of individual users. The study will not be limited to public and private transport systems; it will also examine transport for healthcare, retail delivery, and urban freight (
defaulteg
default. supermarket shop-and-drop). 
default3.12
default              
defaultThe 
defaulttransport on-demand projectdefault will examine the provision of on-demand public transport services using small to mid-sized vehicles. The service aims to be as flexible and convenient as using private hire cars, but priced at the level of a bus. 
default3.13
default              
defaultThe ‘
defaultCity Motion Map’default project will explore how city-wide mobility information from a range of sources can be aggregated and made available to the public, providing accurate real time information about for example, congestion and predicted journey times. It will address issues such as community benefit, security, and personal privacy. This project forms part of the 
defaultMK:Smart
default programme that is being led by the Open University with funding from the Higher Education Funding Council (see report to Cabinet on 24/07/13). 
defaultC.default              default Directed Research Theme default3.14
default              
defaultThis theme will comprise individual research projects (the details of which have yet to be defined)
defaultProgramme Benefits for Milton Keynes default3.15
default              
defaultThe benefits for Milton Keynes of a successful LUTZ programme include:
default&#xa0;default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith LUTZ and previous projects, we have encountered “road maps” produced by the auto industry for their shared ambitions, including the development and deployment of low/no emission and autonomous vehicles. These have been hugely important as resources to convince local stakeholders that seemingly futuristic initiatives have strong credibility and industry support. The project to introduce electric vehicle charging in Milton Keynes was given significant impetus through the alignment of the industry road map for emission free transport and government programmes that funded charging infrastructure (through the Office for Low Emission Vehicles). Such strategic alignment between industry and government is enormously powerful.                    
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough they are very new bodies, a number of the new Catapult Centres have already made significant contributions to the development of our Future City initiatives. Milton Keynes has project relationships with four of the Catapult Centres (Transport Systems, Future Cities, Connected Digital Economy and the Satellite Applications Catapults). A co-ordination arrangement has been made to ensure the inputs across the Catapults are aligned to best effect.  
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIndividual Catapults have provided expert advice and additional capacity to help develop our projects. For example, the Transport Systems Catapult designated a member of staff to work directly on LUTZ and the Future Cities Catapult has provided regular strategic advice on the development of our overall programme, notably governance challenges and the integration of multiple systems. The Future Cities Catapult has also sought to ensure our focus is complementary to initiatives elsewhere in the UK where this makes sense.  All of the Catapults have been able to assist in securing input from expert academic and industry partners and sharing intelligence on innovation in their respective fields. They have also acted as points of co-ordination for business and government input more widely, including from government departments and bodies such as the Technology Strategy Board.

default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs well as co-ordinating central inputs, one of the most positive aspects of the Catapults is their focus on learning about practice and innovation in localities. Both bottom-up and top-down perspectives are essential to horizon scanning activity and the most effective arena for this is arguably at the level of the city where technology and other future developments can be scoped and understood within the local context – including practical implementation opportunities and challenges.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe LUTZ programme is a good example of a future technology that is well advanced but where the major future challenge is its practical application in a real life environment and its interaction with people.
