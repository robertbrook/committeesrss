[[[It is my belief that an undesirable]]]

[[[ provider driven]]]

[[[ whiplash industry has developed in this country that defrauds the insurance industry and that the vast majority of such claims are exaggerated or contrived]]]

[[[, and that the current adversarial legal system is an inappropriate tool for assessing damages]]].&#xa0;I have had extensive experience in the management and treatment of spinal, including neck injury, both within and outwith the medico legal context. I have written many hundreds of medical reports for both claimant and defendant in personal injury litigation.&#xa0;I am well informed on the large body of medical evidence on the subject, and in passing would recommend any party interested in this subject to Malleson’s scholarly book “Whiplash and other useful Illnesses.” McGill Press.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The clinical problem]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Although a high speed rear end impact can cause severe, and occasionally fatal injury the vast majority of  whiplash claims are the result of lesser and frequently trivial impacts.&#xa0;On impact the occupant’s head is first jerked backwards and rebounds off the head restraint. Extreme hyperextension of the neck which prompted the first use (USA 1938) of the term “whiplash” does not now occur because of universal head restraints. &#xa0; It is very rare in whiplash cases for there to be any truly objective signs of injury. X rays are usually taken defensively if the patient attends hospital and rarely show any abnormality &#xa0;I shall use the term 

[[[PUWC (Prolonged Unconfirmable Whiplash Complaints)]]] in the following discussion into which category the vast majority of whiplash claimants fall.&#xa0;The injury is best regarded as a sprain of the neck which is expected to give rise to some pain and stiffness for a few weeks like sprains elsewhere in the body (eg sprained ankle) and then return to normal.&#xa0;The usual claimant however continues with complaints months or years after recovery is expected,  Such persistence of symptoms are often ratified and encouraged by persons whose income depends on offering treatment eg physiotherapists, osteopaths, and the transcription of symptoms into documents and case notes often gives a spurious ratification to symptoms.&#xa0;In the assessment of injury therefore no reliance should be placed on the observations of anyone with a pecuniary interest in the case.&#xa0;Early access to physiotherapy (the rehabilitation code) has compounded the problem appearing to ratify injury before the presence or absence of injury has been assessed. &#xa0;

[[[The]]]

[[[ Claim]]]

[[[ Problem]]]&#xa0;In recent years following similar process in the USA the number of whiplash cases seeking compensation has risen alarmingly for the following reasons. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Diagnosis]]]&#xa0;Genuine significant neck injury for example fracture or dislocation or both presents no difficulty in diagnosis. Without such damage the injury is a ligament or muscle strain and spontaneous recovery is expected within a matter of weeks.&#xa0;Finding a investigation (scan, x ray or blood test) to confirm whiplash in the hope of distinguishing the genuine from the fraudulent is a forlorn hope, certainly with current technology.&#xa0;The fraudulent is easily identified by the perceptive expert, but persons with a pecuniary interest in management or an expert with ambitions to expand their practice will not do so.&#xa0;Among the features which I have found consistent in the fraudulent claimant are&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Remarkable facts on PUWC =  (Protracted Unconfirmable Whiplash Complaints), which give grounds for suspicion of overstatement]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]After settlement the claimant often makes a surprising recovery which they attribute, not to the pay out, but to some unconventional treatment which was not available to them while litigation proceeded ("The doctors did nothing but two visits to the iridologists and it got better. Magic. I still get twinges now and again.")&#xa0;

[[[Solutions]]]&#xa0;Accident management organisations should be forbidden, they are the cause and not the solution to the problem.&#xa0;At  the  moment  far  too  many  claims  progress  on  complaints  alone.  The complaint of pain alone does not constitute evidence of injury&#xa0;As a rule, "injuries" which have no observable signs or in which the vehicle is capable of repair are trivial and self healing&#xa0;Impact engineers, funded by the insurance industry, need to devise a formula with the help of photographs of vehicle damage, which allows an assessment however approximate, of the likely change of velocity in the target vehicle, only change of velocity causes injury to the occupants.&#xa0;The elements of this formula would include the weights of the respective vehicles, the damage done to the bodywork, whether the wheels were locked ie brakes were applied, whether the car was in gear and whether the vehicle was facing uphill, in other words how free was the struck vehicle to move?.&#xa0;(In the extreme case if the vehicle were bolted to the ground the energy of the impact would be expended on vehicle damage, and on enhanced deceleration of the striking vehicle and the occupants of the target vehicle would not be injured, consequently the advice should be disseminated that when rear end impact seems inevitable, apply the brakes firmly.)&#xa0;If  medical  evidence  is to  be  relied  upon,  medical  reports  should  only  be accepted if written by doctors experienced in the management of neck injury both within and 

[[[outwith]]]

[[[ ]]]the medico legal arena, that is reports should only be accepted if the expert works in the field on which he is reporting.&#xa0;The  practice  of  insurance  companies  selling  the  identity  of  claimants  to accident management companies should be stopped (already done)&#xa0;In cases where there is no evidence of injury (that is the vast majority) but which proceed to a hearing the insurance companies with the help of robust impartial medical advice should defend many more case to the doors of the court and beyond.&#xa0;Claimant  expert  testimony  in my experience  is often  weak  for  the reasons given above, and  the claimant's expert often "unavailable"  when a hearing looms&#xa0;A clear distinction must be drawn between, on the one hand true identifiable evidence of injury for example bruise, wound, xray abnormality, deformity and, on the other, complaints 

[[[only]]]

[[[ ]]]which are often fabricated or exaggerated. eg "the pain shot through me", "they said I had whiplash "etc which are not evidence of injury and can be fabricated for gain.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;If the patient has observable abnormalities as described above their claim should proceed through the courts in the usual way. In my experience such claims are easily and rapidly settled. It is in those cases without signs, only complaints,that form the vast majority of protracted and expensive legal activity. The vast majority of whiplash claims fall into this category.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Specialist]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Panels]]]&#xa0;Panels of experts convened with the express purpose of dealing with narrowly targeted problems like "whiplash" claims will not work. Accident management firms, claimants lawyers etc will simply exclude the word "Whiplash" .from the claim and claim for  injuries of  a different kind-" Paravertebral sprain" for example, in order to evade the scrutiny of such panels.&#xa0;A better system would be a panel of experts consisting of the appropriate for the purpose of assessing 

[[[all]]]

[[[ ]]]those potential claims in which there was no objective evidence of injury (the great majority). The panel would include representative of the insurance industry, medical specialist (Trauma Surgeon or Orthopaedic surgeon) a crash engineer, lawyer etc etc. There would be facilities to examine photographs of the vehicle damage, and facilities to examine the patient there and then. No therapists of any kind.&#xa0;Under these circumstances a realistic assessment of the change of velocity of the struck vehicle and the likelihood of injuries would be possible. In my opinion the vast majority of applicants would be reassured that their injuries were trivial and self healing and appropriate and modest damages recommended.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
