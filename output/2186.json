"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Tina Hughes (SLC 020)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.                    Why and how I am involved&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI am Tina Hughes, mother of Olivia Bazlinton who was killed at Elsenham Station level crossing in December 2005 with her friend Charlie Thomson. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI have been working with Network Rail since Sept\nember\n 2006 to raise awareness of level crossing risk and in March 2011 \nSir \nDavid Higgins, then newly appointed \nChief Executive\n, asked me to become Level Crossing User Champion which gave me access to the newly formed National Level Crossing Team and through the\nm to a wide audience within Network Rail to help \nthat \nteam embed the changes being introduced\n. I do this by \ngiving a personal account of the failures \nthat \nled to \nOlivia\n's death, and the impact this has had\n;\n and \ntherefore, \nwhy N\network \nR\nail\n must change. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.        A brief background of what was exposed through the Elsenham case &#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nThe girls were coming back across the level crossing having bought their tickets.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nThey misunderstood the lights and audible warnings, believing they were for the train t\nh\ney had waited at the gate for - \nthe train they intended to catch. \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nThey stepped onto the crossing the \nvery \nsecond that their train would have cleared the warnings but were hit by a Stansted Express train on the other track.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nN\network \nR\nail’s immedia\nte public response\n \nwas \nthat the crossing was safe if used correctly.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nO\nn the accident form completed a few days after the accident \nN\network Rail \ndescribed the girls as \n“\ntres\npassers\n”\n \ndespite knowing that\n they had purchased tickets and hence were passenge\nrs. This illustrates a culture where blame is directed to users with little consideration of facts.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nA previous fatal accident in 1989, in almost identical circumstances at Elsenham, had resulted in HMRI instructions for a second train coming warning -\n this had never been installed. \n&#xa0;\n2.7\n              \nRisk assessments at the crossing had wrongly revealed very low scores but these had not been properly completed. Immediately after the accident a careful retrospective risk assessment showed a much higher score, but on\ne that still enabled N\network \nR\nail\n to continue to say that the crossing did not need to have been changed. \n&#xa0;\n2.8\n              \nEven that score was disputed as too low by HSE\n, who prepared a\n report prepared for the Inq\nu\nest into the girls\n’\n death\ns. They\n suggested that the r\nisk was much higher than even the second assessment and that risk management\n at level crossings\n in general in N\network \nR\nail\n wa\ns very poor. This report was su\npressed by N\network \nR\nail\n's legal team following a pre-\nI\nnquest meeting and \nsubsequently \nthe Coroner wo\nuld not allow any evidence \nthat expressed concern about \nrisk assessment\ns\n to be raised at the girls' Inquest. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n9\n              \nFollowing the Inquest, H\ner \nM\najesty’s \nR\nailway \nI\nnspectorate\n advised tha\nt they were too busy with other\n cases\n (mainly derailments) \nto prosecute \nN\network \nR\nail. T\nhe opportunity to use evidence of poor risk management \nto facilitate change \nwas missed.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n10\n              \nDuring the 18 months following the Inquest, I heard N\network Rail \nrepeat the phrase \"it's a perfectly safe crossing if used correctly\" many times wh\nen responding to \nquestions about \ndeaths on crossings. \n&#xa0;\n2.11\n              \nI knew that Elsenham had been far from a safe crossing when this phrase had been used (indeed N\network \nR\nail\n had installed a footbridge and magnetic signal-based locks on the gates within two years\n) \nso \nI decided I could not leave things unchallenged and \ndetermined\n to take a civil case against N\network \nR\nail\n to prove them negligent and try to raise awareness with someone (their regulator or perhaps N\network \nR\nail\n \nit\nsel\nf\n) that something needed to change.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n12\n              \nA risk expert reviewed our case and Counsel agreed to take the case to Court.  \n&#xa0;\n2.1\n3\n              \nFrustratingly, after almost two years and within a few months of my planned public exposure of the\nir negligence\n on the Court steps, N\network \nR\nail\n decided to settle o\nut of Court and therefore avoid any damaging publicity. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n14\n              \nA few weeks later, upon return of my papers from the solicitors, I discovered a risk assessment that has been disclosed\n to my solicitor\n by N\network \nR\nail\n during \nour case, \nbut \nthis had not been se\nen\n previously\n during the accident investigations or Inquest. This \nrisk \nassessment from 2003 advised that the gates \nat Elsenham \nshould be locked when trains were approaching. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n15\n              \nIn February 2011, The Times published an article about \nthe \nfailure of Netwo\nrk Rail to \ndi\ns\nclose this important document to the rail accident investigators \nand to \nthe Coroner\n.\n N\network \nR\nail \npublicly \nstated that this document had been \ndisclosed \nand disingenuously suggested the families were mistaken. However, the \nOffice of Rail \nRegulation (\nORR\n)\n and Transport Select Committee had picked up this information and started asking questions of \nSir \nDavid Higgins, the newly appointed C\nhief Executive\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n16\n              \nSir \nDavid Higgins advised the T\nransport \nS\nelect \nC\nommittee, in February 2011,\n that h\ne would make full disclosure to the families. However, when we met him a\n \nfew weeks later, the \n‘\nfull disclosure\n’\n file he handed over, prepared by N\network \nR\nail\n's legal team did not even include the recently discovered risk assessment! \n&#xa0;\n2.17\n              \nMuch to the dism\nay of Network Rail's Chairman, the ORR re\n-\nopened the investigation into Elsenham and \nwhen forensic examination was proposed \nseveral \nother\n \ndamni\nng documents came to light\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n18\n              \nIt \nbecame \nclear that some people in Network Rail were aware of the very real r\nisks at Elsenham - one \nof these \ndocument\ns\n, a memo written in\n 2001 described exactly how the accident at El\ns\nenham would happen.\n \nIt was \nheart breaking\n to read.\n&#xa0;\n2.19\n              \nWe have proof that one very damning memo was in the hands of Network Rail’s legal department\n even before the ‘full disclose’ file was created and long before it was handed over to Sir David Higgins.  They are withheld information from their Chief Executive. The non-disclosure of these documents to us in our civil case was contempt of Court.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n20\n              \nThe ORR investigation identified:\n&#xa0;\n2.\n2\n1\n              \nORR eventually prosecuted Network Rail in March 2012\n and they pleaded guilty\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n2\n2\n              \nI feel it is worth quoting a short paragraph from Justice T\nurner\n’s summing up of the case: \n&#xa0;\n“I have concluded here that there \nwas a clear history of inadequate risk assessment and a failure to heed and act upon available information and earlier specific warnings.  That prevailed over a worrying number of years.  \nThere was a consistent underplaying of the significance that this cr\nossing was being regularly misused.  There was a consequent failure to take timely remedial action.  What emerges from a consideration of the totality of the material available to me is a narrative of culpable corporate blindness and complacency going beyo\nnd the merely inefficient, sub optimal or even occasionally incompetent but entering the realm of criminal failure as the guilty pleas concede.  In short, warnings went unheeded.  Data was insufficiently appraised.  Critical questions went unasked and unan\nswered.  Remedial action was unsatisfactorily delayed.  Narrow thinking and a culpable failure to appreciate the actual high levels of abuse at Elsenham meant that a key indicator there was missed,\n \noverlooked and that serious failure was sustained.” \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n3\n              \nBut Network Rail seems to think it is above the law and paying fines for deaths caused by their negligence is a painless penalty – it is after all the return of funds back to the Treasury.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n4\n              \nIt was quite a relief to finally hear these words spoken in\n Court and to know that Network Rail had a criminal conviction and a \nR\negulator who had already started to ensure that changes would happen. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.              What has changed?&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nSir \nDavid \nHiggins arrived at Network Rail\n just as the \nmedia\n exposed the w\nithheld \ndocuments\n in February 2011\n. \nA few weeks later he \nmet with us\n, to hand over all the documents relevant to Elsenham\n (as promised to this Committee\n)\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.\n2\n              \nIn the following weeks\n \nhe realised the significant \nrisk \nthat level crossings posed \ncorporately \nand the improvements in safety that could be made. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nI expressed my desire to help and he asked me to become 'user champion' - a role that would demonstrate a change in attitude by Network Rail. \n&#xa0;\n3.\n4\n              \nHe facilitated a budget of £130m and gave the job o\nf setting up the team to deliver changes to level crossing risk management, safety enhancements and process improvements to Martin Gallagher\n, who had already been working on improvements in this field but with little support corporately. \n&#xa0;\n3.\n5\n              \nDespite pres\nsure from the C\nhief Executive\n, t\nhere has b\neen considerable resistance within \nsome areas at \nhigh-\nlevel management, particularly with\nin\n Operations, to this work\n; \nbut the team eventually settled into achieving significant progress. \n&#xa0;\n3.\n6\n              \nI\nn the two and a half\n years since they started work, I\n have been very impressed by the \nprogress made\n by the National Level Crossing Team and the changes that they have been able to make in this previously neglected area. \nI will not go into what has been delivered to date, as I\n am sure that this will be detailed in Network Rail's own submission. \n&#xa0;\n3.\n7\n              \nOne of the major changes that I believe is\n \nand will \ncontinue to \nmake the most significant difference is the introduction of Level Crossing Managers.\n \nThese people have a remit to \nbecome familiar with\n the level crossings assigned to them - they each have around 70 - and will be proactive in reducing the risks and following through actions so that issues will be dealt \nwith. \n&#xa0;\n3.\n8\n              \nL\nevel crossings are \ninherently \ndangerous and the inter\nface between the railway and road or footpath users will inevitably lead to accidents as humans do make errors of judgement - sometimes deliberately but often while distracted - but at least when they do \nso, Network Rail \ncan be open and honest about what t\nhey have done to reduce the risk or be able to defend why the crossing \nremains open\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.              But there is much to do...&#xa0;Route level deviations&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nDespite the \nNational Level Crossing Team’s \neffort to analyse the requirements for Level Crossing Managers\n, \nth\ne devolution of responsibility to the routes and the emphasis on cost cutting, \nhas resulted in \nnot all of the recommendations being implemented across the board. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nOne route, LNE, with little evidence of why, decided to \nunder resource \nthe\n number of L\nev\nel \nC\nrossing \nM\nanager\ns by 25%. This \nsignificant under resourcing leaves th\nat particular \nteam stret\nched – some with almost double the \naverage \nnumber of crossings to manage - and feeling that they can\nnot provide the level of care and attention this important w\nork deserves. I am due to \nchallenge this decision with \nthe \nLNE \nroute managing director\n in October. \n&#xa0;\nStill reactive to accidents and not pro-active&#xa0;\n4.\n3\n              \nNetwork Rail\n,\n and it\ns\n predecessors\n,\n have always bee\nn good at reacting to accidents -\n putting right something that is found to be a significant factor \nafter the event\n. For example, the subsequent replacing of the type of crossing that allowed a signaller to raise the barriers at Moreton-on-Lugg \nwhen \na train that had not yet been through \nthe crossing when the barrier was raised\n and a car passenger was killed\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.\n4\n              \nI was appalled that the \nLevel Crossing Keeper \nwas also prosecuted in this case. He had been dealing with \nsomeone\n on the phone who wanted to \nmove \na herd of sheep \nover \nanother cro\nssing and \nthe Crossing Keeper \nthought he had left the barriers down after the train had passed while he was \nmaking arrangements\n with this farmer. The system operated by Network Rail \nat Moreton-on-\nLugg \nshould never have allowed \nhim\n to raise the barriers whe\nn the train was already within the crossing zone - there was no 'are you sure?' or failsafe system to protect crossing users, or the \nCrossing Keeper\n, from making\n this fatal error. There is now and all crossings of this type are now being upgraded. \n \n&#xa0;\n4.\n5\n              \nI\n believe that as the L\nevel \nC\nrossing \nM\nanager\ns do their job through the \nfull \nrisk assessment cycle\n,\n these risks will be identified and methods devised to remove or reduce the risk in a proactive way. At the moment they are still in their first year \nof operat\nion \nand playing catch up. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;5.              And going forward...&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nPerhaps my biggest concern is recent changes that are being undertaken\n; \neven before \nSir \nDavid Higgins leaves the company. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nAlthough it not the Committee, nor my business to intervene in the wor\nking of Network Rail and how it manages it’s human resources functions, I feel I must advise of the risk posed by what seems to me some rather unwise decisions. \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nHaving established a highly successful team to deliver the significant changes that have \nbeen seen in the last two and a half years, the National Level Crossing Team have been subjected to some partially implemented and then apparently withdrawn changes. It was announced recently that this team would be split between Safety and Programmes with\nin Operations but th\nen\n seems to have been reversed following ORR intervention, h\nowever the team have been unnec\nessarily demoralised and the Head of that team, Martin Gallagher, (whose qualities ORR described in a recent review as \"needing to be bottled\") s\neems to me to be being pushed out of the organisation. Does professional jealousy win the day? Sadly, I believe \nthat to be the case\n.\n \nBut w\nhat a loss of \nhome-grown\n talent!\n \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nAs one might expect following such a shambolic re-organisation, where the team,\n nor the Head of the team, was consulted, there is now a significant risk of the skilled and experienced resource leaving the company. This is very short-sighted. \n&#xa0;\n5.\n5\n              \nWithout the collaborative working established by this team to improving processes, \ninnovation in technology to move away from signal-based (expens\nive\n and time consuming) methods, and culture changing - leading by example that has been established and proven by this team, the changes made \nare in danger of \nslip\nping\n back and level crossings\n will once again be neglected. \nI believe that the continuing cultural issues played out at senior management level are posing a serious \nthreat to this on\n-\ngoing work\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.\n6\n              \nI believe there \nis a 'we only kill about 10 a year which is better than most other networks' attitude in \nsome areas of \nN\network Rail\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.\n7\n              \nI have heard rumour\ns\n that a new professional role might be established in Asset Management. But Asset Management professional roles a\nre histo\nrically, obviously, engineering-\nbased and my fear is that a Head of Level Crossings in this area will have an emphasis on signalling which will therefore focus on the proportionately small number of signal-based crossings. These crossings are inevi\ntably better protected and therefore lower risk than the majority of crossings that will \nin all likelihood\n be neglected\n,\n as signal-based solutions are \ndisproportionately expensive for the calculated risk levels at these crossings. And cost benefit analysis\n i\ns essential to assist prioritis\nation of scarce resource.  \n&#xa0;\n5.\n8\n              \nBut all level crossings pose a risk - even a footpath crossing that is only occasionally used is a very high risk if the user happens to be there at the same time as a train. You may rec\nall \nthe four girls in the north\neast last year who ran across a \"perfectly safe crossing\" and one was hit and fortunately only lost\n her arm \n-\n not her life? \nThe crossing had a sign that says '\nYou must \ncall the signaller before crossing' but was otherwise unprote\ncted\n on the East Coast mainline where the train was travelling at 125mph. What 12 year old is going to call a signaller? As I suspect m\nost \nof us \nwould, the girls looked, \nthought it was safe and crossed - but they, and \nalong with \nmost of\n us, would \nnot \nhave \nthe ability to judge just how quickly a train travelling at 125mph would be upon \nthem\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.\n9\n              \nN\network Rail\n have £67m \nbudget allocated \nfor \nCP5, the next five year period, \nto continue to develop innovative means to protect crossings and these remote crossings\n might be easily and relatively inexpensively protected, for example, by vibration-linked signals. N\network \nR\nail\n needs more funding for this work - they had £130m for only the last \ntwo\n years of CP4. But even if they get additional funding, which they are asking for, without dedicated re\ns\nour\nc\ne to deliver the work they will not succeed. \n&#xa0;\n5.\n10\n              \nMy co\nncern about the user-\nblaming and back-side covering culture in N\network \nR\nail\n that I was expo\nsed to during my fight for the truth and to get changes made, is one I believe results from a legacy of lack of accountability. When ORR discovered evidence of withholding of evidence from the accident investigators (including the D\nepartment \nf\nor \nT\nransport’\ns R\nail \nA\nccident \nI\nnvestigation \nB\nranch\n) and \nthe \nCoroner\n,\n they decided that rather than expose those individuals that the \ncompany \nmight then use as a scapegoat, they would prosecute \nfor \nthe systemic failings.\n \nI believe that was the right decision. \n&#xa0;\n5.\n11\n              \nHowe\nver, even \nSir \nDavid Higgins did not have the appetite to deal with the withholding of documents from \nhim, when \nthe 'full disclosure' file he had promised this \nC\nommittee he would deliver to us, the families. \nWe have proof that Network Rail\n’s legal departmen\nt \nwithheld information from their \nown \nChief Executive. \n&#xa0;\n5.1\n2\n              \nThe non-disclosure of these documents to us in our civil case was a contempt of Court. Despite this now being exposed I am not confident that the culture has changed\n within the company\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n3\n              \nI \nbelieve the way that \nNetwork Rail\n treats people internally \n- \ncompromise agreemen\nts that gag it's outgoing staff\n, lack of information, for example, \nabout why they pleaded guilty \nin \nthe Elsenham case until a groundswell of protest from within required an \nexplanation,\n as well as externally by withholding information and, basically, lying \nis an on-going problem\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.\n1\n4\n              \nI h\nope to continue to work with Ne\ntwork Rail to support the changes they are introducing \nin level crossings safety and risk management \nand in\n a small way help to influence the \nchange in \nculture\n that I believe is essential\n, but \nas I also am \nfree to challenge them, I \nsuspect the opportunit\nies\n to do so will cease without the support \nI have enjoyed from Sir \nDavid Higgins. \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
