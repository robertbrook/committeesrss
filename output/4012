[normal]Written evidence submitted by Jonathan Isaacs [FBB0029][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My name is Jonathan Isaacs. I am a 54-year-old Cambridge-educated lawyer and journalist born and living in London.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I believe there is no future for the BBC and it should be wound up without delay, as Greece has successfully wound up its national 
[normal]broadcaster.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My reasons are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The continuing scandal of the 52-years of child rape and abuse on BBC premises by the late BBC DJ Sir Jimmy 
[normal]Savile
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the
[normal] continuing scandal of rape and child abuse by other living BBC employees.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]141 current unresolved legal cases of
[normal] bullying at the BBC
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the
[normal] scandal of widespread non-payment of the BBC Â£145.50 annual licence fee, accounting for one in ten UK court cases, reports The Daily Telegraph.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]e)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the
[normal] scandal of non-transparency for licence fee payers, whom the BBC Trust has not al
[normal]lowed to investigate records relating to these scandals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2) BBC continuing leftist bias, notably against the democratic state of Israel, which I believe no British television watcher should have to pay for on pain of imprisonment or tolerate. This bias is
[normal] amply evidenced in websites "Biased BBC" and "BBC Watch."
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I believe these scandals go to the heart of Britain, involving police officers, doctors and employees at 32 British hospitals, together with as-yet-unindicted BBC senior staff and former staff. Th
[normal]e BBC is a corrupt liability to Britain and I urge MPs to break it up as soon as possible and refuse to allow an extension to its Royal Charter.
