defaultMy name is Jonathan Isaacs. I am a 54-year-old Cambridge-educated lawyer and journalist born and living in London.
default&#xa0;
defaultI believe there is no future for the BBC and it should be wound up without delay, as Greece has successfully wound up its national 
defaultbroadcaster.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy reasons are:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe continuing scandal of the 52-years of child rape and abuse on BBC premises by the late BBC DJ Sir Jimmy 
defaultSavile
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe
default continuing scandal of rape and child abuse by other living BBC employees.
default&#xa0;
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default141 current unresolved legal cases of
default bullying at the BBC
default&#xa0;
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe
default scandal of widespread non-payment of the BBC Â£145.50 annual licence fee, accounting for one in ten UK court cases, reports The Daily Telegraph.
default&#xa0;
defaulte)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe
default scandal of non-transparency for licence fee payers, whom the BBC Trust has not al
defaultlowed to investigate records relating to these scandals.
default&#xa0;
default2) BBC continuing leftist bias, notably against the democratic state of Israel, which I believe no British television watcher should have to pay for on pain of imprisonment or tolerate. This bias is
default amply evidenced in websites "Biased BBC" and "BBC Watch."
default&#xa0;
defaultI believe these scandals go to the heart of Britain, involving police officers, doctors and employees at 32 British hospitals, together with as-yet-unindicted BBC senior staff and former staff. Th
defaulte BBC is a corrupt liability to Britain and I urge MPs to break it up as soon as possible and refuse to allow an extension to its Royal Charter.
