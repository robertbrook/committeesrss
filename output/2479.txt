[[[Underachievement in Education by White Working Class Children ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[I]]]

[[[ntroduction]]]This is a response to the Educations Select Committee’s Enquiry into Underachievement in Education by White Working Class Children, from Impetus – The Private Equity Foundation. Our response is wholly informed by interviews conducted for this response, with eleven of the organisations in our portfolio who are working with young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, who have poor educational attainment, or who are at risk of doing so. About Impetus – The Private Equity FoundationImpetus – The Private Equity Foundation (Impetus – PEF) accelerates the growth of innovative charities and social enterprises helping disadvantaged children and young people to get the start in life they deserve. We use a unique model of venture philanthropy, which includes management expertise, pro bono business skills and long-term funding, in order to capacity build and grow, ambitious organisations. Impetus-PEF was formed in June 2013 following the merger of Impetus Trust and the Private Equity Foundation. The new organisation has backed a total of 48 organisations, including 26 in its active portfolio. In 2011/12 the Impetus – PEF portfolio helped 566,000 disadvantaged people.We also research and campaign on the topics of educational attainment and work readiness, to influence public debate, and steer public resources to where they might have most impact in these areas. About our portfolioWithin our 26 strong active portfolio, 11 organisations work with young people at risk of educational failure, or with those who have already ‘failed’ in mainstream education. Between them, they work all over the UK, and with boys and girls from diverse backgrounds, including white working class young people. 11 have contributed their expertise and experience to this response. They are listed in the Appendix. Why did we want to ask them?We felt that the Select Committee’s Enquiry must be informed by the voices and views of those who are working at the frontline with white working class children and young people, as well as with their peers from ethnic minorities. All the organisations we support have a track record of working successfully to either support educational attainment of disadvantaged young people, or of working to re-engage them in education. They are well-placed to comment on any differences in challenges to educational attainment between white working class young people compared to those from ethnic minorities. More importantly, they are best placed to share their successful methods of engagement that convince some of the most excluded and disadvantaged young people to reconnect with education and employment. These methods should be studied, and reflected upon by every head teacher in the country. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The Responses ]]]Specific Challenges All 11 organisations work with white working class children and young people, and most also work with significant numbers of black and minority ethnic beneficiaries too. The portfolio was split, with half responding that they did not feel white working class young people faced specific challenges that might hold back their educational achievement, and half responding that they did. However, all were knowledgeable about the challenges to academic achievement facing young people across economically disadvantaged groups. Of those who perceived specific challenges, many commented that the home lives of their white beneficiaries seemed more chaotic, and that their parents were less likely to push them to attend, and achieve at, school, than their BME peers:“There is a split between ‘school culture’ and ‘family culture’ – some boys don’t know how to cope with the switch between the two. What the school teaches is not always reinforced at home. We actually have to provide the kids with an ‘attachment’ to the school, if parents don’t provide this.’ - – 

[[[Senior Manager, charity prov]]]

[[[iding counselling services in schools]]]“Our white working class kids find it hard to cope. School is too much of a contrast from their life outside school and this has an effect on their ability to find employment. They haven’t learnt the basic skills of compliance and cooperation. The ‘skills’ they have are seen by them and their community as acceptable and necessary for life on the estates in which they live.” - 

[[[Senior Manager at a charity providing youth centres in the North West]]]“We see Ghanaian and Bangladeshi parents who have worked hard, and they push their children to do well. Whereas our children from white working class chaotic backgrounds get the opposite from home.” - 

[[[Manager, charity providing interventions to keep at-risk teenagers engaged in ed]]]

[[[ucation]]]The notion that white working class parents might not be strongly inclined to support their children’s education came up several times:“Our data shows that our white beneficiaries have had significantly less positive family input into their education than have our BME beneficiaries, and that they are much more positive about work-based learning. 56% of our white intake had some positive attitudes about school learning compared to 86% amongst our BME boys. Our white intake also had significantly lower literacy scores than their BME peers.” – 

[[[CEO of a charity working with young offenders]]]“We find parents in our white working class areas are less likely to self-refer their children to our services than in middle-class areas. They may be afraid of seeking, or receiving help, partly because of the stigma of this, but also possibly because they feel intimidated by a system they don’t understand, or feel part of. They may become passive in the face of it.’ – 

[[[Senior Manager, charity providing counselling ser]]]

[[[vices in schools]]]“We are finding, as we’ve opened a centre in a predominantly white working class area, that we’re having to do a lot more work with the parents than we did at our centres in more mixed areas. Our young people who come from immigrant families, their parents are not anti-education, but need extra support, and don’t know how to navigate the system. Whereas some of our white working class families have negative views of education, and no aspiration in that direction” – 

[[[Manager at a charity offe]]]

[[[ring homework ]]]

[[[clubs and academic support]]]This respondent added that she felt “having a parent who failed at school is a bigger barrier to educational achievement than having English as an additional language”. Another repeated theme was a lack of identity, and a sense of belonging, which many respondents felt affected white working class boys in particular: “Thirty years ago, white working class communities round here were strong, now the opposite is true. The demise of the Unions and Churches in these communities has created a support gap. Too many boys rarely see their father go out to work. The lack of labour, and of community, has led to a lack of a sense of place or purpose. There is a lack of certainly for kids about where they will work as the labour market has changed dramatically” - 

[[[Senior Manager at a charity providing youth centres in the North West]]]“Our white working class boys seem to have a less strong religious or cultural heritage to give them an expectation of staying on the straight and narrow. If their parents’ relationship breaks down, there’s no safety net to catch them. They drift, and the schools don’t seem likely to step in. Looking across the young people we see, it does seem that any religious influence is grounding. Our white working class boys just seem more lost than other groups” – 

[[[Head of Coaching for a charity working with NEET]]]

[[[s]]]This respondent also reported that, working in a very ethnically mixed area of London, she felt that more of her white beneficiaries were problem drug users (mainly cannabis) than their BME peers. Recreational use was widespread across the NEET young people her organisation works with, but she felt the white young people were more likely to spiral into habitual, debilitating use. Those respondents who did not feel they could identify challenges specific to the white working class asserted that poverty was the chief challenge to educational attainment, and the factor most likely to detrimentally impact both attainment and opportunity. One charity CEO made the point that poor educational attainment amongst working class boys has been the norm for decades, but this has only recently been exposed by the better performance of girls, and certain ethnic minority groups. He pointed out that the gender gap in educational attainment reverses in the workplace, and dismisses talk of ‘a crisis of masculinity’ as a modern apologetic for poor educational outcomes which have been present for many years. Some respondents also pointed out the higher school exclusion rate amongst young black boys, and commented that teachers were more likely to exclude black children for behaviour that would not result in exclusions for white children. Some of our respondents pointed out that the challenges they identified were more keenly seen amongst white working class beneficiaries, but were not limited to them:“Young people from Asian backgrounds typically have much less chaotic home lives and their families encourage them to succeed in education. This is beginning to change though, and we’re seeing 3rd generation English-Asian kids start to behave much more like their White working class counterparts” - 

[[[Senior Manager at a charity providing youth centres in the North West]]]“We do see a lot of ‘fatherlessness’ amongst our white intake, but then we do amongst our Black British young people too. I feel the big divide is between ‘black and white’ and ‘Asian’, due to the strong family background many of or Asian kids have.” – 

[[[Head of Coaching for a charity working with NEETs]]]The role of Special Educational Needs and Mental HealthThe majority of respondents agreed that mental health problems were common amongst all their beneficiaries, with depression and anxiety the most so. Special educational needs (SEN) were also a recurrent theme – the charity working with young offenders recorded twice (34%) the incidence of statemented SEN amongst its white intake as amongst its BME intake. A practitioner at another organisation said that he felt there was a higher incidence of SEN amongst his white male clients, and that they experienced poorer diagnosis and poorer treatment than other groups. One senior manager working with NEETS commented that our school system prioritises attainment over engagement, which severely disadvantages and dis-incentivises children and young people with SEN. 

[[[How to Engage Young People ]]]There were many similarities amongst the successful methods our charities use to engage disadvantaged children and young people, either in mainstream education, or in ‘second chance’ activities designed to move them into education, training, or employment. Persistence was common to nearly all, but it is worth going into more detail here, as we feel the lessons are essential for those working with young people in schools, health services, and employment services. “[The key is] quiet tenacity. We approach parents with a focus on their children’s ‘emotional wellbeing’ and not ‘mental health’. We expect a ‘does not attend’ rate of about four, with children and/or parents finally attending on the fifth appointment. This is different from CAMHS which has a ‘no follow up’ policy if a young person doesn’t attend.  Our staff are well-supported to maintain their persistence and resilience. Staff need to be expert, nuanced, supportive, and not ‘clinical’.” – 

[[[Senior Manager, charity providing counselling services in schools]]]“We use an arts-based programme, because you can’t ‘fail’ the arts”. Our intake have a history of educational failure and any success is a huge motivator. Our curriculum builds literacy and numeracy by stealth, as well as confidence. Clients are called ‘students’, and when they graduate the course, this is celebrated with a ceremony attended by parents and local dignitaries. We’re also happy to spend money on cabs to get latecomers in in the morning – the cabbies we use are happy to hammer on the door to get them out of bed, because getting them into a routine is crucial. It’s a good use of money because nothing is a bigger waste of money than an empty seat on a course.” – 

[[[CEO of a ]]]

[[[charity working with young offenders]]]‘’We go to where young people are – and we make them an initial offer that’s engaging: ‘just come and play football’. We fit in with the people who are already making a difference in a community – we don’t compete with them. We assess the young people to make sure an intervention is right for them – we don’t want to set them up to fail, because that’s happened to them before.” – 

[[[COO of a charity using street football as a hook to reengage NEETs in learning ]]]“The key is to engage young people in a coaching relationship. Many organisations say they do coaching but all our staff are actually fully trained coaches. The adult to adult relationship between a coach and a young person is crucial – teachers simply aren’t able to have this kind of relationship with pupils. Our staff need to be charismatic, and good listeners – but not afraid to challenge apathy or hopelessness. We meet young people in Job Centres and try to get a phone number. Then we call them repeatedly and expect lots of rejection – typically, it will take three or four chances to get them to enrol.” – 

[[[Head of Coaching for a charity working with NEETs]]]“The first few years at our Centres might just be about having fun, learning a few skills, and making new friends from outside the immediate neighbourhood. After a few years, maybe at 14, staff are trusted and can ask questions about how things are going at school. The White working class kids we see are not used to being asked these questions, or if they are, they’re not responding positively. Our staff open their eyes to different responses and options. It may sound like slow progress, but we’ve got 20% of kids coming from workless homes with very chaotic home lives” 

[[[– Senior Manager at a charity providing youth cen]]]

[[[tres in the North West]]]“The quality of our staff is key to successful engagement – selection is stringent and training takes three months. Staff build up a very personal relationship with young people and demonstrate a strong commitment to them. We say ‘if you join us at 7 we still want to be seeing you every week when you’re 14’. Where else can a child get this individual commitment?” – 

[[[Manager at a charity offering homework ]]]

[[[clubs and academic support]]]“We often hear that teachers treat the young people we see very negatively, and use a ‘shaming’ approach. They don’t treat them as equals. We have positive conversations with them about school and their aspirations for the future. One girl said that having a mentor – someone who cared – was really important to her. And without positive role models, kids may find negative ones – such as drug dealers.” – 

[[[Manager, charity providing interventions to keep at-risk teenagers engaged in education]]]“One thing we offer is community. We give these young people a unique moment of being in a group which goes through intense experiences where they are taken out of their comfort zone. They get new experiences, encouragement, inspiration, and they do it with their peers.’ – 

[[[Head of Coaching for a charity working with NEETs]]]It is easy to spot the recurring themes in these quotes. Again and again we see the importance of -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Persistence and resilience on the part of staff working with young people at risk of educational failure, or who need reengagement with education. This is contrasted with the tendency of statutory services to withdraw support if it is turned down once. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A one to one relationship (often described as ‘mentoring’ or ‘coaching’) between a young person and an adult who is prepared to commit to them. Again, respondents commented that schools, and other statutory services, are not set up to provide this kind of relationship, but that its essential for young people who are not getting this type of support at home. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Investing time in young people. No intervention can work overnight, or stop young people from having to go back to a chaotic home. Staff must be able to work with children and young people over an extended time, and not be forced to ‘move them on’ too soon. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Finding ‘hooks’ that draw young people in, and then let them succeed when they are used to failing. These lessons deserve to be reflected on by schools, as well as by services such as CAMHS. CAMHS was described by one respondent, with extensive experience as ‘an intimidating service’ for young people. 

[[[What Needs To Change ]]]Many of our portfolio felt that the education system was simply not set up to support achievement for all young people, and that disadvantaged young people, in particular, bore the brunt of this. A common theme was that the link between educational attainment and future career success was not seen to exist by (in particular) white working class pupils. “White working class boys don’t always see a link between exams and the kind of employment they’re looking for – and not all schools equip white working class boys with the skills they need to get, and keep, a job.” – 

[[[Senior Manager, charity providing counselling services in schools]]]“The education system doesn’t cater for the career aspirations of many kids” – 

[[[CEO, mentoring charity ]]]“The white working class kids do not see education as the way out of their current situation.” - 

[[[Senior Manager at a charity providing youth centres in the North West]]]“Alumni networks are really underused – every school should have an alumni network, so that children and young people can see, and access, people from backgrounds like theirs who have succeeded.”

[[[ ]]]

[[[- ]]]

[[[Manager at a charity offering homework ]]]

[[[clubs and academic support]]]“Role models from the local community – people who’ve succeeded in employment - should be working alongside teachers, and expanding young people’s exposure to wider opportunities.” - 

[[[CEO, mentoring charity ]]]Charities also felt that conventional methods of teaching were unlikely to work for the children and young people they worked with:“The trouble is, the school curriculum assumes engagement and a desire to learn – what happens to children who aren’t engaged for whatever reason? Coaching would be a more effective method of teaching that guarantees engagement – it’s suitable for all abilities, and can make any subject relevant.” – 

[[[Head of Coaching of a charity w]]]

[[[orking with NEETs.]]]“There are many different barriers, and so not just one model of learning will suit everyone. How can teachers get to know what inspires and motivates individual pupils, and then teach with that in mind? That’s what we do.”  – 

[[[Manager at]]]

[[[ a charity offering homework ]]]

[[[clubs and academic support]]]“Effort needs to be recognised. When young people do good they feel good, they feel better about themselves, and they are more likely to achieve. If they are not strong at maths, but they have learnt to feel positive about how much effort they have put in, they will likely continue to put in effort, learn more, and achieve more.” - 

[[[Manager, charity providing interventions to keep at-risk teenagers engaged in education]]]Many commented that schools often weren’t alert to, or able to respond to, the problems in a child’s life outside of school, which could stop them achieving in school:‘What young people do outside of school is as important as what they do in school. Seven nights’ a week, weekends and holidays, kids are not in school – what’s on offer to them then is critical to their achievements in school. They need to be challenged, they need to find ways of being successful, to mix with people from outside their immediate neighbourhood, form relationships with good adult role models. We need to invest in opportunities for young people to get stability, order, and fun into their leisure time.” - 

[[[Senior Manager at a charity providing youth centres in the North West]]]“Children can hide in large schools” - 

[[[Ma]]]

[[[nager, charity providing interventions to keep at-risk teenagers engaged in education]]]“We see massive truancy in our intake – one boy came to us at 16 who had been to secondary school on just two occasions.’ – 

[[[CEO of a charity working with young offenders]]]“Policymakers and teachers need a better understanding of the different barriers different groups face. When we train our volunteers we ask them to imagine themselves as a white working class boy, a Black British boy, and a Muslim teenage girl. It helps them understand the different stereotypes those groups face, and how they get in the way of learning.” – 

[[[Manager at a charity offering homework ]]]

[[[clubs and academic support]]]“The school system is not attuned to the realities of white working class lives, particularly the most disadvantaged. Qualifications are not the whole story – we must pay attention to what is happening at the fringes of young people’s lives.”

[[[ ]]]

[[[- COO of a charity using street football as a hook to reengage NEETs in learning ]]]“Teachers assumptions and expectations about what a child is capable of are often based on their background, and are still far too influential on a child’s achievements at school.” – 

[[[CEO of a charity working with young offenders]]]Many respondents expressed a strong desire for a system which genuinely had academic aspirations for all children, as well as high-quality vocational pathways and options. But most were wary that a resurgence in talk of ‘improved vocational options’ would actually result in low-quality, second-choice options that served as somewhere to ‘dump’ white working class students who were not expected to achieve. Several commented on the lack of careers guidance on offer in schools now, as well as the loss of the Connexions service. One comment reflected that schools don’t necessarily recognise, or value, the work experience that white working class boys might get outside of school:“It’s really common that white working class boys help their dads out with work in the summer – and sometimes in term time too. This type of work experience can be a really good thing – but do schools recognise it, and count it alongside ‘going to work in an office’?”

[[[- COO of a charity using street football as a hook to reengage NEETs in learning ]]]

[[[The Importance of Data ]]]A crucial part of what we work with our portfolio organisations to achieve is called ‘impact management’. That is to say, the practice of measuring key indicators in real-time during your work, and using the results to influence your practice, and resourcing, on a daily, weekly, and annual basis. There is substantial evidence to show that not only does this drive improved performance at an organisation level but it also improves outcomes for individual beneficiaries. We asked our organisations to tell us how they used impact management, and real-time monitoring, in their practice, and to ensure they were doing a good job for children and young people. The methods varied, but there were similarities. “Attendance of a young person is logged every week, and they are phoned if they don’t attend.” – 

[[[Manager at a charity offering homework ]]]

[[[clubs and academic support]]]“Continuous monitoring – adult to adult reflection and review – is part of the coaching process/culture. We know how every young person is doing at every stage of their time with us” - – 

[[[Head of Coaching for a charity working with NEETs]]]“Staff receive their clinical supervision on the same day they see their clients [children and young people]. This means they’re reporting on a child’s progress the same day they see them, and making plans for next steps”

[[[ ]]]

[[[- ]]]

[[[Senior Manager, charity providing counselling services in schools]]]“Real-time monitoring of staff performance is routine – if any of the teams are submitting sub- standard results, they have to submit an improvement plan which is independently audited, and a site visit is carried out” – 

[[[CEO of a charity working with young]]]

[[[ offenders]]]“Our use of data is formative and summative. Students have routine 1:1s with a Progression Coordinator, and their performance on the course is monitored. They, and we, need to know if there are any areas where they might be likely to fail, so it can be addressed.” - 

[[[COO of a charity using street football as a hook to reengage NEETs in learning ]]]There is evidence that impact-led use of data is key in improving educational attainment in schools, including those with disadvantaged intakes. Our organisations – some of the best-performing in the UK – are using data to ensure they know whether the children and young people they work with are improving and benefitting. They use this feedback to put in place remedial plans if they are not. It is crucial for all schools to identify and track the right data. From the day a child enters school, staff should be able to see whether they are making academic progress, and be empowered to act quickly if they are not. Good GCSE results for the majority in a school are not acceptable, if a rump of pupils are allowed to underachieve, disrupt lessons, or simply not attend. As one of our respondents said, children can ‘hide’ in large schools. They cannot if a school is committed to tracking the progress of every child, and focussing attention, and resource, on those who need it. Tackling a child’s problems – whether academic, or in his wider life -  at 12 is more effective on every level than waiting until they are 16, and months away from failing to secure a single good GSCE. 

[[[Conclusions]]]We would be delighted to talk with the Education Select Committee about this response, the eleven interviews conducted and the ongoing work of Impetus – The Private Equity Foundation.  We welcome the committee’s desire to better understand the challenges faced by white working class boys in the UK education system.  We hope that hearing from an engaged philanthropic funder and the voices of many expert practitioners working in and outside of school, is a useful contribution to the committees understanding of how collaboratively we can work towards an education system where every pupil, regardless of background is supported to succeed and transition successfully into the adult world of work and become an active and engaged member of society.September 2013
