&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from Aviva (CMI0013)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Foreword by Rob Townend
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]I am pleased to attach 
[normal]Aviva
[normal]’s 
[normal]further thoughts to the Transport Select Committee 
[normal]enquiry 
[normal]on whiplash. These should be read in conjunction with our response to the Ministry of Justice consultation in March 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary[bold]Aviva is committed to providing compensation 
[normal]quickly 
[normal]to people who suffer injury in Road Traffic Accidents. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]Transport Select Committee
[normal] has 
[normal]however 
[normal]clearly grasped what a significant issue whiplash has become and what cost it is adding to the hard pre
[normal]ssed motorist’s insurance premium. This is in spite of Britain’s roads being safer places to drive and advances in vehicle technology mak
[normal]ing injury 
[normal]less likely. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Insurers are delivering on the
[normal]ir promise made to Government. C
[normal]ar insurance premiums are 
[normal]now f
[normal]alling 
[normal]for the average motorist. 
[normal] 
[normal]Aviva 
[normal]maintains
[normal] that 
[normal]continued 
[normal]action is needed 
[normal]if 
[normal]this trend is to be sustainable
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We believe the key reforms that are required are: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These points are covered in more detail 
[normal]below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope these thoughts provide some assistance to the
[normal] Transport Select Committee and am happy to provide further assistance if more detail or information is required.

[normal] The agreement allows for two rates of payment: Rate B is the standard rate; and Rate A is a discounted rate that factors in early payment (within 90 days). It is estimated by Medical Reporting Organisations (MROs) that around 75% of all 
[normal]medical reports 
[normal]prepared in R
[normal]oad
[normal] Traffic Accident 
[normal]cases valued at up to £15,000 are obtained via MROs who are signatories to the Agreement.
