[[[G]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;The United Kingdom Onshore Operators Group is the representative body for the onshore oil and gas industry in the UK. Our objectives are to:               enhance the profile of the whole onshore industry (both conventional and unconventional);               promote better and more open dialogue with key stakeholders;               deliver industry wide initiatives and programmes;               ensure the highest possible standards in safety, environment management and operations.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[y]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;The UK Onshore oil and gas industry has been producing oil and gas onshore, safely, environmentally sensitively and in collaboration with communities for decades. The UK is the international gold standard in safe and highly regulated exploration and production.&#xa0;&#xa0;There is immense potential for commercial gas production in Wales. The various geological formations of different ages from the coal measures through the Namurian, Lower Limestone shales, Silurian and Ordovician offer potential. A report by RPS, Dallas office, indicates Gas in place of 49.8 tcf (trillions of cubic feet) for just one part of the shales in one part of South Wales. This compares to an annual consumption of gas in the UK of some 3.055 tcf in 2011.&#xa0;&#xa0;At present the industry does not have sufficient data to answer conclusively all of the economic questions regarding shale. The key to answering these questions and unlocking the economic benefits for the UK is the rapid and successful development of early shale gas sites.&#xa0;&#xa0;Everyone; industry, politicians, regulators and officials have a role to play to build public acceptance for these early projects because unless we have the opportunity to explore or drill we are never going to compile the data necessary to know the UK potential for shale.&#xa0;&#xa0;UKOOG has recently made the following recommendations to the House of Lord Economic Affairs with respect to their own investigation into Shale.&#xa0;&#xa0;We strongly recommend that the Wales Office and the Welsh Government contribute to the realisation of these recommendations:&#xa0;&#xa0;1.   Industry and the Office for Unconventional Gas and Oil (OUGO) should spearhead work in the early shale sites to create better public understanding where acceptance will be more cautious. Regulators and experts need to go out into the relevant communities in order to build the scientific case, because scientific evidence holds the key to assuring the local community about the safety of shale exploration. This includes specific enquiries and focuses on key concerns for people, such as water.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.   More work is required to map the supply chain opportunities and the jobs that could be created alongside a better understanding and strategy for the skills required. These too need to be communicated to local communities.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3.   Planning regulations need to be robust but must reflect that much of the activity takes place well below the surface and well away from aquifers and other areas of public interest. Recent guidance has helped but more could be done to facilitate the industry without removing any of the safeguards in place.&#xa0;&#xa0;4.   The need for a supportive tax regime has already been highlighted by the recent Treasury consultation and the industry supports the approach and awaits further announcements.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[on]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;The onshore oil and gas industry in the UK has been in existence for well over 100 hundred years, drilling some 2000 wells of which 10% have been hydraulically fractured to date.1Today there are c.120 sites with c.300 operational wells producing in excess of 20,000 of barrels of oil equivalent per day or about 1% of UK’s consumption, safely and with adherence to the most stringent environmental regulation in the world.&#xa0;&#xa0;The scope for shale gas and oil is significant. Recent numbers produced by the British Geological Survey (BGS) has indicated that there could be 1300 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas in the Bowland and Hodder shale. This compares to an average UK annual demand of 3tcf. Not all the gas in place will be economically or technically extractable. Recovery rate assessments depending on the US experience vary between 10% to 40%.&#xa0;&#xa0;The industry is beginning the exploration phase for new sources, which UKOOG currently estimates will include the drilling of 20 to 40 exploration wells within the next 2 to 3 years. These wells will differ in nature depending on the operator, some will be designed to core and log data and some will test gas flow rates and the impact of hydraulic fracturing. But all will give the industry vital information about the extent of the hydrocarbons and the potential in a commercial environment.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[%]]]One of the major influencers on the UK energy market over the next 20 years will be the increasing dependency on gas imports as the production of domestic sources from the North Sea continues to decline. Many forecasts including the Government’s central estimateproject an import dependency of c.70% or greater by 20252 as compared with 14% in 2000.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1 Shale gas extraction in the UK: a review of hydraulic fracturing, The Royal Society/Royal Academy of Engineering, June 2012.2 Energy Security Strategy, DECC, November 2012&#xa0;&#xa0;Increasing reliance on imports generates both physical and political energy security issues. In addition as imports are increasingly filled by LNG, the UK will also become a price taker and subject to risk of price spikes caused by a physical disaster elsewhere in the world such as recently experienced during the problems at Fukushima. The disaster highlights what could happen, Japanese LNG imports went up by 25%3 and the prices rocketed 50%4. Recent reports estimate that electricity costs have gone up by 30%.5&#xa0;&#xa0;The cost of shale oil and gas in the UK is yet to be determined and will only be answered after a prolonged period of exploration and testing. However it should be noted that thecost of transport either by pipeline or by tanker adds substantially to the cost (between 10% and 50%6 of the total delivered wholesale gas price depending on distance and method) and the environment (liquefaction and regasification consumes up to 13%7 of gas being transported as LNG).&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[2]]]Electricity supplied from gas decreased from 40% to 28% between 2011 and 2012, as gas prices increased, particularly in relation to coal. Electricity supplied from coal rose from 30% to 39% primarily as a result of global prices falling due to US shale gas displacing US coal to other parts of the world.8 With coal stations emitting more carbon dioxide per unit of power generated, this has resulted in a significant increase in emissions.&#xa0;&#xa0;If we are serious about reducing the impacts of climate change we need to radically look at the way we use coal. Many coal fired generators are actually in the process of closing as a result of the EU’s large combustion plant directive and many more are considering moving to biomass as a feedstock.&#xa0;&#xa0;Shale has the ability to firstly displace coal and then imported gas. However this depends largely on whether shale can be cost competitive against the other forms mentioned and whether any credit is given for its environmental benefits.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[e UK]]]35% of all energy consumed in 2012 came from Gas9. We are likely to need significant investment in new gas generation plant. Modeling by DECC suggests that up to 26 GW10 of new gas plant could be required by 2030 (in part to replace older coal, gas and nuclear plant as it retires from the system). It also indicates that, in 2030, we may need more overall gas capacity than we have today, although operating at lower load factors.&#xa0;Gas is also important for balancing out the increasing levels of intermittent and inflexible low-carbon energy on the system. Unabated gas generation will continue to play a crucial&#xa0;&#xa0;3 Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan4 US Energy Information Administration5 http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/26/us-japan-survey-power-idUSBRE98P18P201309266 Unconventional gas, the potential impact on UK Gas Prices, Navigant, 20137 Unconventional gas, the potential impact on UK Gas Prices, Navigant, 20138 Digest of United Kingdom Energy Statistics, DECC, 20139 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/energy-consumption-in-the-uk10 Gas Generation Strategy, DECC, December 2012&#xa0;&#xa0;role in our generation mix for many years to come, and the amount of gas capacity we will need to call on at times of peak demand will remain high.&#xa0;&#xa0;Oil and natural gas provide the energy source or raw material to make a wide range of products. In fact, it is nearly impossible to get through a day without using multiple products that contain oil or gas.  Natural gas is the raw material for plastics; a material found everywhere and is also a key component in the manufacture of fertilisers. The Haber-Bosch process uses natural gas to provide hydrogen, which is combined with nitrogen in air as part of the process to create ammonia. Ammonia is used as a feedstock for other nitrogen based fertilisers, and with up to 70%11 of the costs of the fertiliser coming from natural gas, acheap supply is essential for its production.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[y]]]Around 80%12 of all the heat used in the UK – in homes, in commercial buildings and in industrial processes– comes from gas. According to DECC, natural gas will supply the majority of our heat demand for many years to come.&#xa0;&#xa0;The Government has put in place a strategy of reducing reliance on natural gas in heating but this will take many years to develop as it involves not only new technologies but also modification in infrastructure and behavior. Gas and therefore shale gas has a major part to play in bridging the gap between now and then.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[s]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;The use of natural gas extracted from shale reservoirs has significant scope to reduce the UK’s overall carbon emissions, as natural gas from shale will probably displace coal and imported gas in the energy mix.&#xa0;&#xa0;The burning of natural gas to produce energy releases around half the carbon emissions of coal.A study by AEA Technology in 2012 for the European Commission concluded that the lifecycle CO₂ emissions for shale gas could be 2-10% lower than emissions from electricity generated from conventional pipeline gas located outside of Europe and 7-10% lower than that of electricity generated from LNG imported into Europe.&#xa0;&#xa0;The Committee on Climate Change concluded in April 2013 that shale gas “could have lower emissions than imported LNG if regulatory arrangements are in place to manage methane released during its production.”&#xa0;&#xa0;Gas  demand  projections  made  by  the  Department  of  Energy  and  Climate  Change  (DECC)  areconsistent with forecasts made regarding the UK’s net carbon account, which is expected to fall by45% by 2025 (from a 1990 baseline)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;11 Agricultural industries confederation12 https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48574/4805-future-heating-strategic-framework.pdf&#xa0;&#xa0;However, plenty of scope still remains to reduce the UK’s reliance on coal. DECC figures show that in2012, coal power overtook gas to become the biggest single source of UK electricity generation.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[te]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;The UK has well established arrangements in a wide variety of industries for responsibly managing environmental and other risks.&#xa0;&#xa0;Much has been made of some of the issues that the US has had with water contamination and air quality, with many studies contradicting each other. However we need to be clear that taking issues from one country and transposing them onto another country with a very different regulatory regime is not a correct comparison.&#xa0;&#xa0;The UK regulatory regime is different and significantly more stringent and incorporates a quadruple layer of regulation from local mineral authorities, Department of Energy and Climate Change, the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Regulators across the devolved regions (EA, SEPA and NSW).&#xa0;&#xa0;Many of these issues are myths. There have been over 2 million hydraulic fracture operations carried out in the last 40 years with no incidence of hydraulic fracturing fluid having entered the watersupply and limited examples of methane leakage.&#xa0;&#xa0;Some of the issues around methane leakage are likely to be due to poor well design or control. The regulations in the UK are some of the most stringent in the world with respect to well integrity with an emphasis of reducing risk to as low as reasonably possible.&#xa0;&#xa0;However the situation with respect to repudiating some of these myths has been more difficult by the lack of baseline monitoring in the US, making it difficult to prove that the industry has not been at fault. This situation will be rectified in the UK by baseline and continuous monitoring.&#xa0;&#xa0;The promulgation of these myths has made local people cautious about the plans operators have in their areas and there is a real need to create better public understanding. Much can and will be done by the operators themselves in line with the UKOOG community engagement charter whichstipulates early engagement. However regulators and experts need to go out into the relevantcommunities in order to build the scientific case, because scientific evidence holds the key to assuring the local community about the safety of shale exploration. This includes specific enquiries and focuses on key concerns for people, such as water.&#xa0;&#xa0;In February this year UKOOG set out Guidelines for the exploration and appraisal phase of shale gas development. This also provides guidelines on seismic monitoring.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[s]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;The benefits of the shale industry will be felt across the UK in lower imports, higher revenues to theExchequer, job creation, supply chain development and energy security.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Aside from the obvious impacts of reducing reliance on imports and the environmental benefits as stated above, the industry has the potential to create significant new employment both directly and indirectly, the potential to create a new supply chain industry and also for communities to benefit directly through community benefits. There is no reason why these benefits will not accrue in Wales.&#xa0;&#xa0;According to the Institute of Director’s report ‘Getting Shale Gas Working’, in the production phase for the first 100 sites (each being about 2 hectares, about the size of a rugby pitch), 74,000 jobs could be created.&#xa0;&#xa0;The industry is currently working closely with the Department of Business, Innovation &amp; Skills with respect to identifying the potential for growing a UK supply chain; this will not only reduce the cost of doing business but also create UK jobs. This work is at an early stage but should be encouraged.&#xa0;&#xa0;The industry has made it clear from the outset that local communities that host our sites should be rewarded. As a result in June 2013 UKOOG announced its first industry-wide community benefits scheme. At the exploration phase for sites that involve hydraulic fracturing the local community will benefit to the sum of £100,000. During production communities will receive in total 1% of all gross revenues before costs are deducted. The industry estimates that this could amount to over £1.1bn in a 25 year period or £5m to £10m per site.&#xa0;&#xa0;Alongside the direct and indirect benefits, developers will also be paying increased business rates as a result of their operations, 50% of which will go directly back to local councils, again benefiting local communities.&#xa0;&#xa0;In the US, exploitation of shale gas has led to a dramatic reduction in gas prices, from highs of around $12/MMBtu in 2008 to a low of $1.80/MMBtu in March 2012, since when they have recovered to around $3.40/MMBtu. This has been reflected in the price to the consumer.&#xa0;&#xa0;Commentators are divided about the impact of shale on household bills in the UK.&#xa0;&#xa0;In November 2012, Poyry estimated that gas and electricity prices could go down by as much as 4% assuming shale provided 50% of the UK’s underlying indigenous gas production. This would seem to be an inconsequential amount but could be significantly bigger if the amount of shale produced goes beyond this conservative estimate. Even at 4% the annual saving to the UK economy is £800m.&#xa0;&#xa0;Navigant in June 2013, estimated in their optimistic scenario that prices could go down to50p/therm compared to the current 70p/therm based on an international shift to shale.&#xa0;&#xa0;However Bloomberg New Energy Finance is less optimistic as it believes the price of gas will be set by imports and the amount of shale will not offset the decline in the North Sea and will be significantly more expensive to produce.&#xa0;&#xa0;UKOOG notes that many of the current forecasts show a significant increase in European gas prices without the introduction of shale and that shale gas production in the longer term should result in lower prices when compared to a future with no shale gas production.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[s]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;As any hydrocarbon production can only take place where the hydrocarbons are located, the production of a shale gas pad will be developed by the operator in conjunction with local communities in areas that offer the best in terms of geology, market and community interaction. The Wales Office and the Welsh Government in conjunction with Natural Resources Wales needs to work with the operators to promote the shale gas industry to provide a safe and environmentally acceptable resource that can help make the nation self-sufficient.&#xa0;&#xa0;The Wales Office and Welsh Government should provide consistent framework policies across environmental regulation and planning as those in the rest of the UK and should provide support to the initiatives with respect to the supply chain.&#xa0;&#xa0;In terms of planning, the recent guidance produced by the Department of Communities and Local Government has been welcomed by the industry. However more clarity is required with respect to the planning regime and underground workings; a fairer regime is required along the lines of similar industries so as not to increase the regulatory burden for underground workings which are already governed by a significant amount of environmental regulation. A clear demarcation within both the planning and legal regimes is required between surface and subsurface activities.&#xa0;&#xa0;The increased cost burden in the UK particularly in the early stages of development result in shale projects being marginal for development and therefore the industry has welcomed the proposals for a specific tax regime along the lines given to marginal offshore fields.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
