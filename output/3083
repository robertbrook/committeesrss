defaultWritten evidence submitted by BBC Media Action and BBC World Servicedefault&#xa0;defaultHow Media Can Support Democracy and Development in Burmadefault&#xa0;defaultExecutive summarydefaultThis inquiry submission examines the role that media and communication can play in strengthening governance in Burma, also known as Myanmar. It is based on the BBC’s experience in the country over many years, both via BBC Media Action, its international development charity, and through its Burmese language service. 
defaultTo date, a major focus of international governance support in Burma has been at a macro level, such as financial regulation and legislative reforms. However, strong democracies also require citizens and communities that are empowered to play a role in dialogue and decision-making that affects their lives. The evidence available in Burma at present suggests that individuals and communities lack the confidence or ability to make their voices heard and to participate in political processes. There is a need for increased discussion and engagement on social and political issues, more bottom-up communication between communities and their leaders and greater inclusion of religious and ethnic minorities, women, and the rural poor. Media has the potential to influence these barriers by enhancing knowledge and engagement and creating platforms for citizen voice and participation during Burma’s transition to democracy.  The BBC has a vital role to play on both counts.

defaultBBC Media Action set up an office in Burma in January, 2012, although it has worked with Burmese audiences – remotely – since 2006. Most project work has focused on building the capacity of local journalists and producing a youth radio programme broadcast on BBC Burmese Service that seeks to improve access of young people to accurate, impartial and relevant information

defaultThe most visible elements of this transition to democratic governance have been the revision of labour laws, greater press freedoms, release of political prisoners and the return of a viable political opposition.
