default&#xa0;
defaultDear Sir/Madam
default&#xa0;
defaultWidening the debatedefault&#xa0;defaultI discovered by chance the invitation to comment on the Draft Deregulation Bill while looking at the Red Tape Challenge website. I was concerned to read that it was proposed that there may be a duty to promote economic growth – on a planet of finite resources – perhaps not the best idea. Of course there are no easy answers, 
defaultbut accepting the limits to growth would certainly help to appraise alternatives
default.  There are many different viewpoints and I would hope the debate was wider so that other viewpoints could be considered and “flaws” ironed out. The time scale for the debate should not be fixed so to speak at 3 months. It should be ongoing.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany people, economists
default8
default and organisations with something important to say will be unaware of the consultation, 
defaultsuch as CASSE
default9
default (the Centre for the Advancement of a Steady State Economy)
default. The deadline should be extended and the debate ongoing.
default I would like to make some general comments.
default&#xa0;
defaultI believe there are fundamental flaws in the concept of the red tape challenge, for example the embarrassing list of members interests on the ACRE
default13
default web site. 
defaultWill the introduction of a duty to have 
defaultregard
default to “promoting economic growth” compromise the independence of regulators? What additional safeguards are required to ensure that the introduction of such a duty will not compromise the independence of a 
defaultregulator.
default  
defaultI feel there is
default no truedefault or limited “independence” with regard to food safety regulators for example and many food sovereignty and humanitarian organisations, members of the public and NGOs are aware of this. FSA, FDA, EFSA.... revolving doors ......
default  all have come under harsh criticism despite some good work in some areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultI disagree that there should be legislation with regard to a “
defaultduty 
defaultto promote economic growth”.  I would not acknowledge such legislation neither would many others.
defaultThe various view points of the individuals and organisations listed below should be taken into 
defaultaccount
default.
default&#xa0;defaultLeave no stone unturneddefaultThere are many other organisations and individuals that I have not listed which would be able to provide feedback and alternative view points to those proposed. Lord Heseltine and Milton Friedman are not of course the only people to have ever held an opinion, leave no stone unturned!
default&#xa0;

default, I would add to Polly’s view point that we are all responsible in one sense.

defaultIn this Briefing, we look at how the US’s agricultural reconstruction work in Afghanistan and Iraq not only gives easy entry to US agribusiness and pushes neoliberal policies, something that has always been a primary function of US development assistance, but is also an intrinsic part of the US military campaign in these countries and the surrounding regions. Seen together with the growing clout that the US and its corporate allies exercise over donor agencies and global bodies – such as the World Bank, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) centres, which influence the food and farm policies adopted by the recipient countries – this is an alarming development. These are not unique cases born from unusual circumstances, but constitute a likely template for US activities overseas, as it continues to expand its “war on terror” and pursue US corporate interests.

defaultThe need for real transparencydefaultWhile more and more MEPs and citizens groups demand that the looming EU-US negotiations be conducted in an open way, our disillusioning attempts to gain some basic information about who’s behind the launch of these negotiations show that the Commission doesn’t care about openness. It seems determined to bar the public from any kind of meaningful information about the world’s biggest trade deal ever to be negotiated. If MEPs are serious about their calls for more transparency and their duty to hold the Commission accountable, they are up against a serious smokescreen.

defaultOpen source, community-wide cooperation built humanity's food system and is the key to restoring its sustainability. Through this approach, we can build on the millennia of open-sourced "research &amp; development" that farmers have already completed, recreating a self-regenerative food system that will not only feed us all abundantly and sustainably, but will bring us within reach of solving the apex problems of our times.

defaultSGR has long been concerned about the military influence on science and technology. In 2003, we began project work in this area, carrying out research, education and advocacy activities. Our main outputs are listed 
defaultbelow.In
default short, SGR believes that the military exerts far too much influence over science, engineering and technology in the UK and elsewhere - and this leads to an over-emphasis on weapons and technology based approaches to tackling conflict. We believe there needs to be a major shift in both resources and emphasis away from military science and technology towards areas such as cleaner technology, research on non-violent conflict resolution, and science and technology for poverty alleviation. The concept of 'Security' also needs to be considered much more broadly to include many of the pressing issues that face the world today - issues which can be addressed by drawing upon the expertise that resides in science and technology.
defaultSGR gives lectures on this issue - see our 
defaultForthcoming Events
default page for the latest information.
default A major new report will be published in the next few months.

defaultThe ETC Group releases a new Communiqué today (08.07.2004)
default&#xa0;
defaultthat provides an update on policy discussions related to nanotech health and safety issues and the glaring lack of regulatory oversight. According to the ETC Group, governments on both sides of the Atlantic are reluctantly and belatedly conceding that current safety and health regulations may not be adequate to address the special exigencies of 
defaultnano
default-scale materials. In sharp contrast to the political climate one year ago, the potential health and environmental risks of some 
defaultnano
default-scale technologies are being openly discussed in Europe and North America. Since mid-2002, ETC Group has called for a moratorium on the use of synthetic 
defaultnanoparticles
default in the lab and in any new commercial products until governments adopt "best practices" for research.
default"Ironically, governments are talking about the need to be proactive, failing to admit that they're at least one decade late: nanotech products are already commercially available and laboratory workers and consumers are already being exposed to 
defaultnanoparticles
default that could pose serious risks to people and the environment," says Pat Mooney, Executive Director of ETC Group in Ottawa. The US government estimates that one million new workers will be employed in nanotech-related industries within the next decade. And the global nanotech market is expected to tip $1 trillion in just seven years, according to Mike 
defaultRoco
default of the US National Science Foundation.
default&#xa0;
default"Only a handful of toxicological studies exist on engineered 
defaultnanoparticles
default, but not-so-tiny red flags are popping up everywhere," points out Jim Thomas, ETC Group Programme Officer based in Oxford, England. 
defaultIn May, the world's second largest re-insurance company, Swiss Re, warned that the unknown and unpredictable risks associated with defaultnanotoxicitydefault or defaultnanopollutiondefault could make nanotechnology un-insurable.default"Will governments that are spending billions of dollars of taxpayer money to promote nanotech research adopt rigorous regulatory oversight or will they simply tinker with existing regulations and propose voluntary guidelines? When will they address seriously the wider concerns related to social and economic impacts of technologies converging at the 
defaultnano
default-scale?" asks Kathy Jo Wetter, ETC Group researcher in Carrboro, North Carolina, USA.

defaultHigh street banks are using our money to fund companies that sell arms used against civilians in wars across the world, including the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are financing an industry that sells arms to countries committing human rights abuses such as Israel, Colombia and Saudi Arabia. Money from our savings and current accounts is being used to fund companies that produce pernicious weapons like depleted uranium and cluster bombs.
defaultAs a result of the financial crisis there are now unprecedented calls for regulation of the banking sector. War on Want is calling on the government to ensure that all banks are made to publish the full details of their loans, holdings and other banking services to the arms trade. The government must also introduce regulation which prevents high street banks from supporting the arms trade.

default“More than any recent U.S. president, Ronald Reagan has been lavished with honours, including his name attached to Washington’s National Airport. But the conviction of Reagan’s old ally, ex-Guatemalan dictator Rios

default, for genocide means “Ronnie” must face history’s judgment as an accessory to the crime.”
default“It was not until 1999, a decade after Ronald Reagan left office, that the shocking scope of the atrocities in Guatemala was comprehensively detailed by a truth commission that drew heavily on
default 
defaultU.S. government documents declassified by President Bill Clinton. On Feb. 25, 1999, the Historical Clarification Commission estimated that the 34-year civil war had claimed the lives of some 200,000 people with the most savage bloodletting occurring in the 1980s. The panel estimated that the army was
