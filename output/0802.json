"Written evidence from Macmillan Cancer Support (LTC 52)Executive Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMacmillan welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Health Select Committee’s inquiry on the management of long-term conditions.\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCancer is a debilitating disease and the effects of cancer can be felt a long time after treatment has ended. The National Cancer Survivorship Initiative (NCSI) is a partnership between the Department of Health and Macmillan Cancer Support, supported by NHS Improvement, which originated from the Cancer Reform Strategy (2007). As a result of work of the \nNCSI,\n the long-term consequences of cancer and its treatment are now better understood. In addition, new approaches to meeting the needs of cancer survivors have been tested. \n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe NCSI’s work provides a strong evidence base for cancer to be considered as a long-term condition. As such, we were surprised that cancer was not included in the definition of long-term conditions set out by the Inquiry (although we note that the Committee cites a Department of Health \n(DH) \ndefinition). \n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur response to the Inquiry therefore begins with our rationale as to why cancer should be treated as a long-term condition. The rest of our response focuses on the importance of supporting people with long-term conditions \nduring and \nafter treatment has ended, and the importance of supporting people back into work.\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCancer is a long-term condition for those who are dealing with long-term physical and emotional effects from cancer and its treatment. We strongly encourage the Committee to consider cancer in its review of the definition of long-term conditions.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAround 1.8 million people in England are currently living with cancer. This number is increasing by \nover 3% a year and the total figure will rise to over 3 million by 2030\n. \nOne reason\n this figure is rising is that \nmany more people with cancer are surviving, thanks to improved screening, earlier diagnosis and new treatments. Whilst it is extremely positive that more people with cancer are surviving, for many, the end of treatment is the start of poor physical or emotional health that can continue for years.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is \nestimate\nd\n that around 20–\n25\n% of people treated for cancer \nare currently experiencing a consequence of cancer \nand its treatment \nwhich has an adverse impact on the quality of their life.\n \nT\nhe physical problems people with cancer develop as a consequence of cancer treatment vary according to whether they have received radiotherapy, chemotherapy or have undergone surgery. Some are worst in the first few months or years after treatment and may improve over time. However, other problems will not appear for years. In addition to these physical problems, emotional problems such as depression are common. \n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany\n cancer survivors live with other long-term conditions, either as independent co-morbidities, or caused by their cancer or treatment.\n For example, in the long term, people who have had chemotherapy may develop serious conditions such as osteopo\nrosis, heart disease and even\n sec\nond malignancies, such as \nleukaemia\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe growing number of cancer survivors brings additional challenges in terms of understanding needs and how \nNHS and social care services\n can best support them.\n \n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn England, \nthe\n NCSI was launched in 2007, at a time when most of the focus in terms of improving cancer services was on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In contrast, one of the main aims of the NCSI was to develop services to support and enable cancer survivors to live as healthy and as good a quality of life for as long as possible.\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBefore the NCSI, there had been very little research on cancer survivors. However, we now know more about the needs of cancer survivors than ever before. In particular, we now have cancer survivorship figures at a population level, at a patient level and at a health service level. \nData at the population level is vital to help with planning the levels of services needed at any point in the cancer care pathway.\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvidence shows that many of these cancer survivors have unmet needs, particularly at the end of treatment, whilst others are struggling with consequences of treatment that could be either avoided or managed. \nImproving outcomes for cancer survivors3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHigh quality cancer survivorship can improve outcomes in all domains of the NHS Outcomes Framework. However, it can also contribute to improved outcomes within the Public Health Outcomes Framework – for example, reducing people’s risk factors for developing other conditions – and the Social Care Outcomes Framework – for example, through promoting independence.\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe NCSI recently \npublished \nLiving with and beyond cancer: taking actions to improve outcomes\n. This set\n out a framework for survivorship \noutlining the action needed at five key stages of the pathway\n:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInformation and support from the point of diagnosis\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPromoting recovery\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSustaining recovery\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nManaging the consequences of treatment\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSupporting people with active and advanced disease\n3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe document\n sets out what has been learnt on survivorship, including interventions to meet needs that have been tested and ready to spread across England. \n3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nU\nnderpinning the recommendations in the report is the need to \nincrease understanding and \npromote a cul\ntural shift in professionals to\nwards shared decision making and supporting patient self management.\n3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMacmillan encourages NHS England to take forward the \nrecommendations outlined \nin this report – aimed at commissioners and providers - to ensure that outcomes are improved for cancer survivors. \nIt is vital that the new commissioning arrangements drive forward the redesign of aftercare to support survivorship.\nInformation and support from the point of diagnosis3.10\n \nAll patients and their \ncarers\n with a long-term condition, regardless of its complexity, should be offered the opportunity and relevant information to help them develop a personalised self\n-\nmanagement plan with a trained professional or peer, which is integrated into the formal care planning process.\n3.11\n \nEarly cancer rehabilitation is also important: it can prevent avoidable ill health and is more effective when provided early to avoid conditions becoming more complex and costly to treat later on.\n3.12\n \nPeople with long-term conditions, including cancer, should also be offered support in considering work and education options at an early stage. This is discussed further in Section 4.\nPromoting recovery3.13\n \nPeople’s \nhealth, \nwellbeing \nand overall quality of life \nwill be greater if they get the personalised support that they need. \n3.14\n \nThe case for the “Recovery Package” is \nset out \nin \ndetail in the NCSI report. The R\necovery Package promotes: effecti\nve assessment and care planning\n, good communication through a “Treatment Summary” and offers education and support events (Health and Wellbeing Clinics) which inform patients about how to take care of themselves, what to look out for and who to contact if needed\n.\n \nThese components are similar across long\n-\nterm conditions.\n3.15\n \nProviding support and education to facilitate effective self-management where \ndesired can have a number of benefits for the individual and the system. Individuals undergoing structured self-management programmes report improved health literacy and health behaviours, increased confidence in their ability to navigate the health system, better physical functioning and a greater understanding of the appropriate services available.\nManaging the consequences of treatment3.16\n \nTreatment for cancer, although vastly improving \nand expertly administered, \ncan\n still \nhave consequences that impact hugely on the ability of pe\nople to live meaningful lives. \nThe recent 2\n012 \nDH\n \nPatient Reported Outcomes Measures (\nPROMs\n)\n \nsurvey highlighted some of these issues\n. For example, \n38% of prostate cancer survivors reported urinary leakage and 58% reported impotence\n, and o\nne in five colorectal survivors reported difficulty in bowel control\n.\n3.17\n \nFailure to manage the consequences of treatment can have a significant impact on patients and the system. Access to support for common health related problems caused by treatment should be routinely available and information\n should be\n given to people. Some services for intermediate or rare types of consequences may need to be \ncommissioned through specialised commissioning. In all cases, some \nkey principles should be followed: preventing or minimising consequences through healthier lifestyle choices and better treatment, informing patients of potential consequences, identifying patients at potential risk, assessing people through holistic needs assessments and supporting people through local care pathways. \nSustaining recovery3.18\n \nPhysical activity has been proven to\n be impactful on the management \nof long\n- \nterm conditions associated with cancer and \nits \ntreatment\n, as well as reducing the possibility of recurrence of some cancers.\n \nWe recommend that the DH ‘Let’s get Moving\n’ \npathway is routinely incorporated within cancer care pathways, and that ‘exercise on referral’ schemes criteria explicitly include cancer.\nRehabilitation3.19\n \nThe importance of rehabilitation \nto the recovery of\n people with long-term conditions is increasingly well understood and supports the\n NCSI’s work.\n \n3.20\n \nAs more and more people survive and now live with cancer, early intervention and continuing access to rehabilitation can minimise the often predictable effects of lengthy treatment and the level of disability resulting from the disease itself. Closer integration between health and social care is also required to deliver excellent care and rehabilitation to people living with complex health needs. \n3.21\n \nWithout effective rehabilitation, at all stages of the care pathway, the benefit of treatment will be limited and the health outcomes will be diminished. \n3.22\n \nR\nehabilitation programmes are applicable across long-term conditions\n, and i\nt is important that \nthey\n include vocational rehabilitation support (which is covered in more detail in section 4).\n \nThe National Cancer Action Team recently published recommendations \non rehabilitation, including work, \nfor commissioners and providers.\n \n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCancer, like other long-term conditions, can affect many aspects of a person’s life, such as their ability to work.\n \nIn the Mandate to NHS England, the Government made it clear that it expects progress in supporting people with long-term conditions, including cancer survivors, and in particular for them to remain in, or find work.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are 600,000 people of working age living with cancer in England\n. \nAround 100,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed in people of working age each year in England\n. This means that, on average, there will be around 550 patients per provider per year\n for whom returning to work will be a consideration.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWork is an important part of helping people get back to normality after a cancer diagnosis and treatment. It has many other benefits, such as improving confidence and self-esteem, and it contributes to financial independence and material comfort. There is strong evidence to suggest that for people who experience ill health or disability, remaining in or returning to work can actually help promote recovery and rehabilitation, and lead to better \nquality of life and \nhealth outcomes.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSupporting people with cancer, and other long-term conditions, is also good for the economy. In 2008, Policy Exchange estimated that £5.3 billion in productivity was lost that year as a result of cancer survivors not returning\n \nto work\n. As the number of people living with cancer is set to double over the next 20 years, this loss to th\ne economy is\n likely to increase.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nR\nesearch show\ns\n that the majority of people who are working when they are diagnosed with cancer want to return to work when they are ready and able to, or they need to for financial \nreasons\n.\n \nHowever, \nthis can\n be difficult because people struggle with the consequences of cancer, such as fatigue and depression. \nResearch also shows that people who have had a cancer diagnosis are 1.4 times more likely to be unemployed than those who have not.\n&#xa0;\n4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe main barriers that prevent people living with cancer remaining \nin or returning to work are threefold: a lack of support from health professionals\n on working during cancer treatment or returning to work after treatment\n;\n a\n lack of support from employers; \nand a lack of specialist vocational rehabilitation support.\n&#xa0;\nIncentivising the NHS to promote work as a positive health outcome&#xa0;4.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM\nany people with cancer who are considering remaining at work, returning to their job or leaving it are given little or no information and advice from health professionals about the impact cancer can have on their working lives. \nStatistically, o\nver half of people with cancer (\n60%\n) who were in work at the point of diagnosis were not informed by a health professional about the impact their cancer diagnosis might have on their working lives\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is essential that health professionals understand that work \ncan\n help improve \nan individual’s\n health and well-being, and that they have an important role \nin helping people with long-term conditions, including cancer, make informed decisions about their working lives. Macmillan recommends that\n health professionals start routinely talking to patients about the impact of cancer treatment on their ability to work\n – in \nparticular, \nraising the issue of work early in the patient’s journey and signposting to further support where appropriate.\n \nThe NCSI \nhas\n produced guidance for health professionals on achieving positive health outcomes\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMacmillan \nwants the\n \nDH\n and NHS England \nto pay\n greater attention to the role the NHS could \nplay\n in helping more people get back to work.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.10\n \nIt is also important that the health and social care systems work more effectively together. W\ne would \nlike health and well\nbeing boards and joint strategic needs assessment\ns\n to \nhighlight and take action to address work support needs.\n&#xa0;\nSpecialist vocational rehabilitation support&#xa0;4.11\n \nAnother key barrier is the lack of specialist vocational rehabilitation services for people with complex problems who should be referred to a vocational rehabilitation service for specialist support. \n&#xa0;\n4.12\n \nHowever, t\nhere is \na sever\ne\n lack of appropriate vocational rehabilitation services in the UK\n for people with long-term conditions, including cancer\n. \nMacmillan recently \npublished a report \nMaking the shift: providing specialist work support to people with cancer \non the need to fill this gap in provision\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.13\n \nA large government-funded review of vocational rehabilitation in the UK found that structured vocational rehabilitation interventions can be both beneficial to individuals and cost effective\n. However, since this review there has been little progress at a national level. In particular there is still a lack of capacity to deliver effective vocational rehabilitation for people with long-term conditions.\n&#xa0;\n4.14\n \nCurrently, \nNHS rehabilitation services, such as occupational therapists, tend to focus on hospital discharge only and \nlack\n the capacity to prov\nide vocational rehabilitation.\n&#xa0;\nGovernment back-to-work programmes are more focused on supporting people on long-term benefits than people on sickness absence looking to return to work. Finally, occupational health (OH) service and private healthcare providers usually only provide vocational rehabilitation services to people working in large organisations and not all OH professionals are trained to provide advice on cancer.\n&#xa0;\n4.15\n \nTo address the lack of specialis\nt\n vocational rehabilitation services in the UK, Macmillan, as part o\nf\n the NCSI, piloted a new model of vocational rehabilitation services for people with cancer. T\nhe evaluation of the pilots demonstrates that timely vocational rehabilitation interventions result in better work and health outcomes for people with cancer, and that they can be cost effective.\n Our work in this area also demonstrates that effective vocational rehabilitation for people with long-term conditions, including cancer, requires a combination of healthcare and workplace interventions.\n&#xa0;\n4.16\n \nOur report makes a number of recommendations to \nG\novernments across the UK. In\n particular, we have called on G\novernment\ns to \ntake responsibility for improving access to \nand the availability of \nvocational rehabilitation, and coordinating health and workplace support. \nWe would like \nthe\n \nGovernment and NHS England\n \nto \nprovide more encouragement to NHS commissioners to invest in vocational rehabilitation support for p\neople with long\n-\nterm conditions, including \ncancer.\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n \nLiving with and beyond cancer: taking action to improve outcomes\n (2013)\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/living-with-and-beyond-cancer-taking-action-to-improve-outcomes\n \nNational Cancer Survivorship vision\n (2010) http://www.ncsi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/NCSI-Vision-Document.pdf\n Supra note 1.\n Department of Health. \nQuality of Life of Cancer Survivors in England: report on a pilot survey using Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS)\n. 2012\n http://ncat.nhs.uk/sites/default/files/work-docs/Cancer_rehab-making_excellent_cancer_care_possible.2013.pdf\n \nMaddams\n J et al.
