default              
defaultIn September 2013 
defaultRail North 
defaultsubmitted a full p

defaultand business case to the Department for Transport setting out plans for the devolution of 
defaultdecision-making for the railways in the North
default.  Th

defaultP
defaultartnerships, business groups and others.  
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultIn late November 
defaultthe Secretary of State confirmed his support for the principle of devolution with DfT taking a role with
defaultin an initial partnership structure.  The Partnership will cover the re-franchised Northern and TransPennine services.  
defaultThe parties intend to agree detailed arrangements to ensure that

default              
defaultA Joint Rail North/ DfT Officials Group will develop the detail of the Partnership proposals for presentation to the Secretary of State and the Rail North local authorities early in the new year.  
defaultWe would expect to have made progress in this respect by th

defaultA map covering setting out the scope of the 
defaultRail North 
defaultproposals is included 
defaultat the end of 
defaultthis submission.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default* What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level 
defaultdecision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultThe rationale for our proposals is that a 
defaultdevolved 
defaultand locally accountable 
defaultrailway will focus 
defaultmore on the places
default of the 
defaultNorth, their prosperity and passengers
default, than one where accountability is remote.  
default&#xa0;
default2.
default2
default              
defaultOur proposals for devolution of rail responsibilities stem from 
defaultthe
default DfT consultation in February 2012 around how rail decision-making might be decentralised in 
defaultline with similar policy changes 
defaultin
default local decision-making.  
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultT
defaulthe North has taken the lead in many of 
defaultareas of recent change in relation to devolved decision-making.  
defaultOver half of the first wave of the government’s “city deals” have been with Northern conurbations – the momentum of this programme is now being replicated in another five areas in the North.  The bigger cities of the North are reforming their own governanc
defaulte through the creation of 
defaultc
defaultombined 
defaulta
defaultuthorities.  The cohesion that combined authorities, local transport boards and Local Enterprise Partnerships have created forms a firm foundation for our proposals
default relating to rail
default.  
defaultThe advantages of 
defaultrail devolution in
default 
defaultMerseyside, Scotland, Wales and London demonstrate
defaultd 
defaultthe success that 
defaulthas been gained by greater local involvemen
defaultt
default and investment in rail service outputs.  
defaultAll of these examples 
defaulthave at their heart 
defaultbetter alignment of local and regional spend across progra
defaultmmes relating to economic development, transport and regeneration and lead to stronger local economic outcomes.  
default&#xa0;
default2.
default4
default              
defaultA devolved railway is able to bring the 
defaultadvantage of actively considering the 
default“place” dimension to rail planning in a way that national s
defaultpecification cannot. 
default 
defaultViewed from London the North is seen often as half a dozen major conurbations.  But the railway for the North needs to look beyond this to the smaller cities and towns that make up the conurbations, and to the diverse and widespread h
defaultinterland that includes both local centres and more isolated communities.  Both in the conurbations and in the hinterland there are areas that are prospering and areas that seek regeneration.  Transport and rail plays a key role in meeting the needs of bot
defaulth.  The devolved railway will focus on the places of the North, their prosperity and passengers.  The North is connected by common economic objectives.  Places across the North are becoming ever more interdependent.  Connections between places must become 
defaultstronger.  There must be a higher degree of integration between planning for rail and the planning of both other forms of transport and economic development.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default* Do local bodies (including local authorities, 
defaultlocal enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?
default&#xa0;
default* How 
defaultclear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?
default&#xa0;
default* What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultThe Rail North proposals hav
defaulte had to develop a structure 
defaultfor accountability.  It has done this through working with every authority in the North, and their collective agreement to the proposed structures is a major landmark.  
defaultIt is proposed that direction is set by a North of England
default Leaders’ Committee, and implemented through by a special purpose vehicle (SPV) with the working title 
defaultRail North Limited.  
defaultThe plans, which may be modified in the light of the recent agreement with the Secretary of State
default (para 1.3)
default, 
defaultare for 
defaulta governance 
defaultstructure that will work across all the authorit
defaulti
defaultes in the north of England.  
defaultThe plans 
defaultset out how the authorities of the North will 
defaultwork across boundaries, and 
defaultmake decisions together in a manner that balances democratic accountability, inclusivity, and 
defaultfocussed executive decision-making.  
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThe plans will also align accountability with those who bear risk, whilst as set out above, also provide protections for all north of England interests.  
defaultThe overall decision-making structures will be capable of t
defaultaking financial responsibilities and have a substantial capacity to manage and bear risk.  Within the proposed structure larger authorities, or groupings of smaller authorities, have the choice of taking on franchise-wide risks
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultMany of the authoriti
defaultes in the North have significant expertise in developing 
defaultand delivering 
defaultsignificant and complex transport schemes, for example in procuring and developing tram systems, operating local heavy rail systems, in developing transport interchanges, and in managi
defaultng commercial arrangements with transport operators.  These skills 
defaultwill 
defaultbe brought to bear in support of the Rail North proposition.   
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultThe foundation for prioritising investment and service development will be based on the Long Term Rail Strategy for
default the north of England.  
defaultThis strategy covers both passenger and freight – and focussed on the next 20 years.  
defaultThis strategy was published for public consultation in July 2013, following earlier discussion with LEPs, business groups, local authorities, pass
defaultenger groups, and the rail industry.  
defaultThe public consultation on this Strategy concluded in October and we intend to publish a
default final strategy 
defaultin the early part of 
default2014
default.  This will 
defaultcreate a framework for 
defaultprioritising options in rail franchising, and in the 
defaultdevelopment of future rail capital programmes in the North
default (e.g. around further electrification)
default.  
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultIt is important 
defaultalso 
defaultthat 
defaultrail 
defaultfranchise
defaults in the North are
default developed to take on board initiatives, both from the franchisee and local stakeholders, to improve railway outputs at a local 
defaultand grass roots 
defaultlevel.  The North is one of the strongest parts of the country for community rail and station adoption groups.  
defaultThe new franchise
defaults
default must build on these concepts and facilitate new ways in which local communities can make an increasing input to their local railways, often in conjunction with other local initiatives, such as relating to town centre redevelopment, trans
defaultport integration, community transport, or local social enterprises.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default* How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultSince the Rail North proposition was put to government in the early autumn the Secretary of State 
defaulthas 
defaultconfirmed his support for the principle of 
defaultdevolution
default,
default with DfT taking a role within an initial partnership structure to help manage the risks associated 
defaultwith a project of this scale.  The approach will be based on the proposals that have been developed by Rail North over the past year
default,
default and which include 
defaultthe L
defaultong 
defaultT
defaulterm 
defaultR
defaultail 
defaultS
defaulttrategy for the North of England
default (para 3.4)
default, a wide ranging business case, and a 
defaultstructure for decision-making in the North
default (para 3.1)
default.  
defaultGovernment and Rail North must now rise to the challenge and bring this in-principle support to practical and substantive effect in 
defaultplanning for 
defaultthe design and management of 
defaultnew 
defaultfranchises 
defaultfor
default the Nor
defaultth.  
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultA shared set of principles has been agreed to underpin this Partnership
default with DfT
default.  These acknowledge the importance of growing the railway to maximise the benefits of infrastructure investment and linking this to railway efficiencies
default,
default and having
default a platform for determining investment priorities within the Partnership.  The Secretary of State has welcomed the principle of risk and reward sharing between members of the Partnership.  Further work 
defaultbetween Government and Rail North 
defaultis
default needed 
defaultto develop
default 
defaulta Partnership
default 
defaultthat is 
defaultstructured to 
defaultdefine 
defaultthe balance of risk
default,
default and set out how it 
defaultwill
default 
defaultchange over time.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultA very good recent example of the North of England working well 
defaulttogether
default come
defaults
default from the joint work between Northern authorities to promote a c
defaultommon approach to making the case for the Northern Hub Network Rail infrastructure programme.  
defaultThis work was led by the pan-Northern role 
defaulttaken by the 
default“
defaultNorthern Way”
default – a collaboration between the Regional Development Agencies
default.  
defaultThe value that Northern Way 
defaultbrought, and which Rail North bring
defaults
default, is being able to take a greater than local perspective, and one that 
defaulti
defaults supported by 
defaultstrong 
defaultevidence
default. 
default 
defaultTh
defaulte
default work 
defaulton 
defaultthe 
defaultNorthern Hub 
defaultwas founded
default on (a) a common set of priorities that were developed across the North foc
defaultussed on wider economic objectives, and (b) a united approach between local authorities, businesses, MPs and others from across the North.  The proposals for devolved decision-making in rail build on this successful precedent.  
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultFinally national agenc
defaulties and government often find it difficult to sustain a relationship with the North because of the 
defaultperceived
default, and often practical
default,
default complexity of dealing with a large number of parties.  Rail North 
defaultis 
defaultable to 
defaultact as an interlocutor between the North and nat
defaultional bodies.  This can help those national bodies be more effective and more responsive to the 
defaultobjectives and outcomes the North seeks from its trans
defaultport systems.  
defaultThis especially true in rail, where typical passenger journeys, and most freight movements, cross large areas of the North, and where significant collaboration is required with and between a large number of authorities, LEPs and other stakeholders.   
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default* Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?
default&#xa0;
default* What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local
default Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?
default&#xa0;
default* How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure?  What scope is there for the us
defaulte of alternative funding streams?
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultAt the heart of our case are 
defaultthree 
defaultarguments around the better use of resou
defaultrces
default, and potential new sources of funding,
default that devolution will bring.  
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultFirst, we expect that in a 
defaultP
defaultartnership 
defaultwith DfT 
defaultthat evolves 
defaulttowards a devolved railway that responsibility for resource allocation and funding will transfer over time to the North.  B
defaultecause of the challenge created 
defaultby 
defaultdeveloping a
default growing 
defaultrailway that
default 
defaultsupports 
defaultdeliver
defaulty
default of regional 
defaulteconomic outcomes, 
defaultthe North 
defaultwill 
defaultbe very strongly incentivised to find ways of making the railway more efficient 
defaultin 
defaultdelivering 
defaultthese
default outcomes. 
default 
defaultThis includes a greater management focus on performance, through a better understanding of what matters to passengers (and businesses) locally.  
defaultOver the past 15 years nationally-run franchising has delivered very little impact on industry efficiency in the North.  In part this is because nationally-inspired efficiencies were often developed in isolation from the local benefits that might be brough
defaultt about through them.  
defaultThe partnership work between DfT and the North must 
defaultact to drive such efficiencies and recycle their benefits into a railway that promotes the economy of the North and provides a better railway.  
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultSecond, 
defaulta stronger role for northern authorities in the railway 
defaultwill deliver better integration of 
default(a) 
defaultdecision making
default,
default and 
default(b) transport planning and 
defaultnetworks
default.  
defaultNationally-led franchising has tended to favour development of those services that have least impact o
defaultn the direct transport budget.  Whilst this is a financially pragmatic short-term approach it means that some services which have a high economic impact can be neglected.  By integrating rail into wider transport networks and ‘places’ 
defaultthe North 
defaultcan make th
defaulte railway 
defaulta more coherent part of wider transport systems, and 
defaultbetter
default for passengers
default.  
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default              
defaultThird, a railway 
defaultwith strong “local ownership” 
defaultis more likely to be able to secure funds for further development.  The Rail North work on a Long Term Rail Strategy
default has already catalysed work on sub-regional priorities; this has been complementary to work by LEPs and L
defaultocal Transport Boards
default in prioritising recently devolved funds 
defaultat a sub-regional level 
default(e.g. transport funds, city deals, local transport block funds an
defaultd local growth funds). Together this work will ensure that 
defaultbusiness 
defaultcases for greater investment in transport are better founded, and hence it is more likely that local funds will (a) be spent on better value transport interventions, and (b) be more confid
defaultently applied by local agencies.  Furthermore where such priorities coincide with the wider aims of the Long Term Rail Strategy there will be a stronger case to apply any surpluses Rail North Ltd may gain from any profit or revenue share arrangements it ha
defaults in place with the train operator, thus multiplying the impact of scarce locally-derived funds.
