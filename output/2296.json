Immigration detainees should be funded to challenge the lawfulness of their detention regardless of their ties to the \nUK\n. In our immigration \nremoval centre\n (IRC)\n inspections we \nrepeatedly\n \nfind detainees held for years at a time.\n S\neveral have successfully challenged the lawfulness of their \ndetention\n using\n legal aid. Removing the right to legal aid for such individuals \nmay \nincrease the likelihood\n that\n these cases will remain unresolved\n. \n&#xa0;\n2\n5\n.\n              \nThe 2011 Independent Monitoring Board annual report of \nHarmondsworth\n \nraised significant concerns relating to the treatment of detainees suffering from mental health issues. Since 2011\n,\n the High Court has fou\nnd in favour of four individuals who have brought cases against the \nUK Border Agency\n. The court found \ninter alia\n that the defendants had been falsely imprisoned and subject to inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of their Article 3 rights under the\n European Convention on Human Rights. The introduction of a residency test makes it le\nss likely that this type of ill-\ntreatment will come to the attention of the courts. \n&#xa0;\n2\n6\n.\n              \nTaking all this evidence into consideration, we \nconsider\n that the residence test\n should not be introduced in civil legal aid cases\n to individuals who are detained\n. While the test would apply to \nUK\n residents, its impact would disproportionately affect foreign nationals and therefore be discriminatory. \nIn \nthis way, the proposals undermi\nne the principle of equity in \naccess to legal aid, \nwhich requires special measures to be taken to \nensure meaningful access to legal aid for “\nstateless persons, asylum seekers, foreign citizens, migrants and migrant workers, refugees and internally displace\nd persons\n”\n.\n We are concerned at the proposed changes which \nwill: restrict access to justice for vulnerable immigration detainees; \nremove funds for \nmentally ill detainees to challenge the lawfulness of their detention; and \nnot assist \nfailed asylum seekers \nwith further representations\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n              The Government’s response              &#xa0;\n27. \n              \nIn its reply to our response the government argued\n that:\n&#xa0;\n              \n‘HMIP’s annual report contains a comparison of survey scores of prisoners who consider themselves to have a disability and those who do not; these data include prisoners with a physical disability as well as those with mental health issues and/or learning \ndisabilities. HMIP’s 2011-12 Annual Report (latest available) indicates the following: \n&#xa0;\nQ. Is it easy to get a complaints form? Disabled – 82% Yes \nNon-disabled – 83% Yes \nQ. Have you made a complaint? Disabled – 55% Yes \nNon-disabled – 46% Yes \nQ. Is there a member of staff in this prison that you can turn to for help if you have a problem? Disabled – 76% Yes \nNon-disabled – 75% Yes \n&#xa0;\n              \nWe acknowledge that HMIP’s response to the consultation contained data indicating that prisoners with mental health is\nsues and/or learning disabilities (as well as prisoners generally) did not have confidence in the complaints system and that outcomes were poor. However, the information from the 2011-12 Annual Report referred to above suggests a different picture in terms\n of accessibility, willingness to use the system and the potential for reasonable adjustments to be made when comparing disabled and non-disabled prisoners. Although respondents had concerns around potential impacts on these prisoners we consider the proce\nsses set out in PSI 02/2012 (Prisoner complaints), PSI 32/2011 (Ensuring equality) and 75/2011 (Residential services) are sufficient to \nensure they are able to make effective use of the complaints system and access the other alternative means of redress.’\n&#xa0;\n28. \nThe figures quoted by the \nGovernment\n are \nincorrect\n.  The actual \nfigures\n used in the \n2011/12 \nannual report can be found below:\n              \nQ. Is it easy to get a complaints form? Disabled – \n79\n% Yes \nNon-disabled – 81\n% Yes \nQ. Have you made a complaint? Disabled – 54\n% Yes \nNon-disabled – 46% Yes \nQ. Is there a member of staff in this prison that you can turn to for help if you have a problem? Disabled – 71\n% Yes \nNon-disabled – 7\n2\n% Yes \n&#xa0;\n29. \nIn the first and second questions \nthose who \nconsider \nthemselves \nas disabled found it significantly\n \nmore difficult to get a complaints form and make a complaint, than\n prisoners who do not consider themselves disabled. \nThe third \nquestion shows\n \nthat there is \nno significant\n d\nifference\n between those that consider themselve\ns to have a disability and those that do not.\n&#xa0;\n30.\n              \nO\nur inspection \nevidence \ncontinually indicates\n that these groups of \nprisoners (as well as prisoners more generally)\n do not have \nconfidence\n in the complaints system. Data in our 13/14 annual report, which is\n unpublished, found that\n responses from prisoners that considered themselves to have a disability were significantly worse than responses from their non-disabled counterparts. . \n \n&#xa0;\n.\n Q. For those who have made a complaint, do you feel complaints are dealt with fairly?Disabled – \n32\n% Yes \nNon-disabled – 40\n% Yes \nQ. For those who have made a complaint, do you feel complaints are dealt with promptly?  Disabled – 38\n% Yes \nNon-disab\nled – 42\n% Yes \nQ. Have you ever been prevented from making a complaint when you wanted to? Disabled – 21\n% Yes \nNon-disabled – 15\n% Yes \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n31. \nThe\n government’s reply also raised the possibility of this inspectorate conducting a thematic inspection of the prison complaints system.  We would be open to discussing whether and how this sho\nuld be progressed.\n              \n&#xa0;\n23\n \nSeptember\n 2013\n&#xa0; \nExpectations.
