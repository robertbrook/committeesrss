[[[&#xa0;]]]Partnership Assurance Group plc (Partnership) is the largest provider of Long Term Care annuities in the UK. We are a specialist provider of financial solutions for people with health and lifestyle conditions, as well as those suffering from a serious medical impairment. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1              Partnership welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Health Select Committee’s inquiry into public expenditure on health and social care and would welcome the opportunity to provide oral evidence if called upon. &#xa0;2.2              Partnership’s financial services expertise, along with the engagement of its not-for-profit sister company, PayingForCare, with 64 local authorities means that it is extremely well  placed to respond to the point on “The impact on the provision of adult social care in the 2010 spending review settlement and the ability of the local authorities to make the necessary efficiency savings.”&#xa0;2.3              This response is focused specifically on the role of local authorities in delivering adult social care, and in particular the 57% of people who self fund all or some of their social care costs. &#xa0;2.4              For the past three years, Partnership has campaigned for self-funders for care to receive regulated financial advice so that they can make informed decisions about how best to pay for their care needs. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1              Self-funders in the current adult social care system are those who have assets (including property) of more than £23,250.&#xa0;3.2              A substantial number of people in the care system fund all of their care (43%). A further 14% make top up payments (payment of additional costs via a third party). &#xa0;3.3              In some areas of the country, the majority of people pay for all their care costs - 55% in the South East have to pay all their care costs, 53% in the South West and 50% in the East. &#xa0;3.4              Unfortunately there is a lack of awareness and access to appropriate regulated financial advice and no obvious place for many self-funders to get information and advice on long term care. &#xa0;3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To put this in perspective, of the 53,000 self funders who entered residential care in 2009, only 7,000 received appropriately qualified financial advice. The Local Government Information Unit (LGiU) has estimated that 24% of self funders deplete their assets and fall back on state funding costing councils an estimated £425 million each year in England alone.  &#xa0;3.6              This cost ultimately falls to individual local authorities, who themselves are facing significant cuts to their overall budgets. However, significant costs might be saved if self-funders are actively encouraged to get regulated financial advice. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1              Some local authorities are already putting in place models of referral for self-funders to regulated financial advice. &#xa0;4.2              Partnership and its not-for-profit subsidiary company, PayingForCare, are currently engaged with 64 local authorities to help them limit the risk of self-funders falling back on state funding by providing an ‘air gap’ service for the local authority, which takes the self-funding citizen through the care process and explains all the available options, including referral to a regulated financial adviser where necessary. &#xa0;4.3              In addition to this, www.payingforcare.org, a clear and accessible information and advice website provides information for those in need of guidance.  This website also enables consumers to find a regulated financial adviser who can advise on their care funding needs in their area, if they so wish. &#xa0;4.4              As a consequence of referring self-funders to financial information, not only is the citizen enabled to make better informed decisions about how to fund their care needs, but it also helps local authorities prevent self-funders from depleting their capital prematurely and falling back on state funding. In addition to this, citizens will also be better placed to know the potential next steps in the care pathway when they are admitted to hospital and will therefore help lessen the burden of bed blocking in hospitals. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1              Partnership believes that the Care Bill should be welcomed as it aims to bring together “threads from over a dozen different Acts into a single, modern framework for care and support”. The Bill also makes provisions for self-funders to be given information and advice on how to access independent financial advice. While this is a step in the right direction, as recommended by the Joint Committee on the Draft Care and Support Bill, local authority services should recommend financial advisers only if they are regulated by the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority). &#xa0;5.2              As outlined in point 3.5, the LGiU has estimated that the cost of self funders depleting their capital and falling back on state funding costs local authorities £425 million each year in England alone. It would be worth local authorities seeking to find ways to reduce this amount, particularly given the cuts in local authority funding and the potential cost to local authorities of implementing the Care Bill. &#xa0;5.3              Although the Spending Round announcement (June 2013) made provisions for £335 million to be made available to local authorities in 2015-16 so that they can prepare for reforms to the system of social care funding, there are some doubts to whether this is enough. &#xa0;5.4              The proposals outlined in the Care Bill are set to be implemented between 2015 and 2016, and will result in local authorities taking on a number of significant duties. Such proposed new roles include the running of a Deferred Payment Scheme, which will be an interest bearing loan. Local authorities will also have to manage and calculate each individual’s care account meter which will run until they reach the cap. &#xa0;5.5              Alongside this, there will be an increase in the number of both eligibility and financial assessments that will need to be carried out. It has also been estimated that 500,000 more people will make contact with their local authority in order to start their care account meter. &#xa0;5.6              This will inevitably mean that local authorities will have to put in place new IT systems, re-train staff and increase workforce capacity. All of which will mean an increase in spending. We therefore believe that local authorities should adopt and would benefit from efficient and low cost ways of making significant savings, including those outlined in this response.
