defaultWritten evidence from the 
defaultSouth East Local Transport Board
default (SRN 024)
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe South East Local Transport Board (SELTB) 
defaultwelcomes
default this opportunity to provide input to the Select Committee’s Inquiry into the Strategic Road Network
default 
default(SRN)
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe SELTB is working closely with the South East Local Enterprise Partnership (SELEP), local authorities and businesses in the preparation of SELEP
default’s Strategic Economic Plan. The LEP-wide growth priorities emerging from this work 
defaultclearly require
default a 
defaulthigh quality SRN to provide real and direct economic benefits. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe SELTB shares the concerns of its Local Transport Authorities in relation to Highways Agency procedures in relation to the delivery of schemes and attracting private sector funding. In its separate submission to the Committee, Kent County Council has 
defaultpr
defaultovided
default 
defaultexamples of how private sector funding may be secured and where 
defaultLocal Transport Authorities
default could provide schemes on the SRN more efficiently and cost effectively
default than the Highways Agency
default. The SELTB is of the opinion that 
defaultsimilar examples could be p
defaultrovided across the 
defaultUK
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the context of the set questions the SELTB offers the following responses.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHighways Agency sche
defaultmes generally have been motor vehicle-centric with little regard to other users apart from the need to safely accommodate them. Any policies that will result in greater emphasis given on encouraging sustainable transport would be welcome. However, at a ver
defaulty recent stakeholders meeting with the Highways Agency and their consultants relating to the proposed improvements at the M25/A13 Junction 30
default,
default consideration for non-motorised modes 
defaulton the A13 
defaultappear to have been minimal in developing the scheme.  Whilst 
defaultnew policies to “maximise green gains”, “decarbonising roads” and providing a “netwo
defaultrk for walkers and cycles” are
default welcomed
default,
default 
defaultthe SELTB has reservations about the extent to which these will be delivered.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe answer to the previous question also relates to this question. In addition the SELTB welcomes the current engagement on the Route Based Strategies and anticipates that this may be a means to provide useful 
defaultinput to enable the link between roads policy and planning for other transport modes.
default It is good to see the traditional stand of seeking to over-protect the trunk road network moderated by the need to stimulate 
defaulteconomic development. This is to be encourage
defaultd and applauded.
default However, further work is required, for example policies such as Circular 02/2013 need relaxing to encourage the delivery of schemes that would stimulate development, economic growth and job creation; thus allowing the SRN to play its full 
defaultpart in supporting regeneration and economic prosperity. 
defaultThe standard practice of automatically issuing holding notifications on schemes gives uncertainty to developers who immediately conclude there 
defaultare 
defaultproblems 
defaultin delivering their schemes
default. In relation to
default the threshold for intervention being related to when there may be “severe” impacts, without any definition of what “severe” means, adds further uncertainty at this time when the viability of schemes is a concern. Currently there are concerns about the unr
defaulteasonably high level of contributions initially sought 
defaultby the Highways Agency 
defaultfor S106/S278 agreements. An example of this is a new warehouse development at Tilbury for which the Highways Agency initially sought a contribution of £1m. Following discussions with Thurrock Council this was reduced to a more reasonable amount of £100k. 
defaultThe initial figure sought clearly could have 
defaultunnecessarily made the scheme unviable and stoppe
defaultd this job-creating development had Thurrock Council not intervened.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe SELTB recognises that we live in a changing economic world resulting in uncertainties in forecasting traffic growth. 
defaultThe SELTB would advise
default the Government to remain transparent in its
default processes and the assumptio
defaultns it has made in its modelling
default,
default and undertake regular reality checks on its forecasts. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government has made 
defaultsteps forward in embracing technology such as the introduction of Managed Motorways and the provision of traffic information to drivers. The SELTB supports the Government’s proposals to 
defaultfurther 
defaultdevelop such technology to reduce cong
defaultestion, improve safety and 
defaultto 
defaultincrease

default reliability
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default        The introduction of funding certainty over a longer period would attract new investors
default t
defaultogether with more flexibility on the development and delivery of schemes. The SELTB’s Local Transport Authorities can provide examples 
defaultof 
defaultwhere they could be de
defaultlivering Highways Agency schemes 
defaultmore e
defaultfficiently and cost-effectively and how private sector funding may be secured. Kent County Council’s separate submission to the Committee provides examples of these.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default        
defaultThe SELTB recommends that 
defaultthe Government listens to the stakeholders’ concerns and 
defaultaction is taken to allow local delivery of major road schemes, provide greater flexibility in policies governing Highways Agency procedures, and take a more proactive approach to attract
defaulting
default private s
defaultector funding to deliver schemes and improve the SRN.
default&#xa0;
defaultThurrock Council’s Director of Planning and
default 
defaultTransportation, David Bull, would 
defaultbe pleased to 
defaultrepresent the SELTB and 
defaultprovide oral evidence at a Select Committee hearing on this matter.
