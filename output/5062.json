"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Plantlife&#xa0;&#xa0;\nPlantlife is the organisation that is speaking up for our wild flowers, plants and fungi. From the open spaces of our nature reserves to the corridors of government, we’re here to raise their profile, to celebrate their beauty, and to protect their future. Wild flowers and plants play a fundamental role for wildlife, and their colour and character light up our landscapes. But without our help, this priceless natural heri\ntage is in danger of being lost, with non-native \ninvasive species \nposing a major threat\n.  \n&#xa0;\nPlantlife welcome\ns\n the opportunity to send a written response to the \nEnvironmental Audit Committee's inquiry on Invasive Species\n.\n&#xa0;\nPlantlife has produced a publication of \n'non-native invasive species to avoid'\n which includes species not currently on \nSchedule 9 of\n \nthe Wildlife and Countryside\n \nAct\n that we believe should be. This was based on the \nHorizon-scanning for invasive non\n-native plants in Great Britain\n \nrepor\nt\n, whether species are currently available on the market, and the nature of how a species spreads in the wild. This publication gives an indication of the plant species Plantlife believes are of most concern and where listing on Schedule 9, or another mechanism, is an appropriate action to take.\n&#xa0;\nPlantlife support the\n UK’s position on \nremoving\n the cap on the number of species to be included on the EU list,\n as Plantlife strongly believes the list should represent and address the scale of the environmental issue. Capping the list of IAS at 50 when there are at least 1200 across Europe will not make a strong enough impact on this growing problem and one that is causing significant harm to biodiversity. Plantlife \nsupport the\n Wildlife and Countryside Link position\n \nof producing\n one regularly reviewed species list, composed of two components, which is directly incorporated within the Regulation, albeit ‘empty’ in the first instance. Part \nO\nne should be composed of species which are alien to the EU\n as a whole\n, and for which measures apply to all Member States with no opt out on basic legislative measures (e.g. bans). Part \nT\nwo should be populated by species which are native \nwithin\n parts of the EU but invasive \nin\n other parts. For th\ne\nse \nlatter \nspecies, the list should contain an indication of the Member States/regions where the species is non-native, and the Regulation should apply in those areas only. Member States where the species is native can legitimately decide to trade or otherwise use the species, but may need to adopt measures to prevent the species from being transported by human agency elsewhere. \n&#xa0;\nPlantlife\n \nalso \nsupport the\n Wildlife and Countryside Link position\n that a regional approach \nw\nould be better achieved through enhanced cooperation between \naffected \nMember States through Risk Assessments and a spatially literate action plan.\n&#xa0;\nPlantlife's primary concern is to prioritise action on those non-native invasive species having a detrimental impacts on wild plants in \nImportant Plant Areas\n and so our criteria of highest weighting is biodiversity. \nTable\ns\n 1 and 2 \nin the \nHorizon-scanning for invasive non\n-native plants in Great Britain\n \nrepor\nt\n include the criteria and weighting used in the risk assessment process.\n A summary version, \nHere today, here tomorrow?\n,\n can\n be found on the Plantlife website. B\niodiversity, human health and economic considerations\n are all important criteria however, the weighting of their importance will mainly depend on the nature of a species and the nature of its impacts.\n&#xa0;\nPlantlife fully support the precautionary principle approach and submit that it \nmust be enshrined within \nboth national and international\n legislation. Those who intentionally or recklessly allow known \nnon-native invasive species of concern\n to become established or invade should contribute to the action \nnecessary to remedy the problem\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe balance between the different strands (\ndetection, prevention, containment/adaptation or eradication\n) \nwill need a case by case response and will need to be proportionate to the problem. Different species with different traits need different approaches. In addition, whether a species is already present in the country, if it is widespread or in a few locations, or whether it has the potential to arrive will determine which of these strands is the priority for that species. For example, it may be that total eradication should be prioritised for sites of particular conservation / wildlife value such as Important Plant Areas, SSSIs, SAC, SPA, National Parks etc. However, eradication on the national or even regional scale may not be an option. While early detection and prevention into the country is the ideal, both from an environmental and economic perspective, and should be the priority for potentially invasive non native species; it may also be necessary to prioritise the prevention and spread of some species that are already present within the country from getting into another catchment, or into sites of conservation importance. Similarly, some species may only be in a few locations so a national eradication plan can be the priority.\n&#xa0;\nPlantlife support the approach of listing the harmful species to tackle as on an EU scale listing safe species would be too complicated when there are many different biogeography regions to consider\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn place of trying to identify areas of conflict Plantlife suggest identifying the environmental obligations that would be complimented and achieved through tackling invasive non native species such as the Water Framework Directive, Target 9 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Target 10 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, and  biodiversity duty under the \nNatural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act\n and the \nNature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004\n.\nPlantlife fully supports Member States being able to \nadopt more stringent measures as and when they see fit,\n and thus support the UK position on that. The EU IAS Regulation should not (and seemingly does not) prohibit Member States from taking further action. \nWithin the UK, the devolved administrations have different legislative approaches to non nati\nve invasive species and the GB \nInvasive Strategy and EU IAS Regulation must continue to allow for flexibility in approach.\n&#xa0;\nThe introduction and spread of non-native invasive species is directly comparable to that of some plant disease pathways, and those associated with trade are \nagreed to be \nbest tackled through legislation and regulation.  Trade partners often express the need for a statutory framework against which \nthey can\n make clear business decisions and \nwhich can\n drive forward the development of new markets.\n&#xa0;\nPlantl\nife believe \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEngland and Wales \ncould learn from the Scottish experience\n with respect to\n:\n \n8.1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIssuing an order to require specified individuals (whether by type of person or individual identity) to notify the competent authority of the presence of specified invasive non-native species. \n&#xa0;\n8.1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIssuing \nspecies control orders on the same model as under the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011 should be adopted by a new legal regime. The introduction of statutory backing, such as Species Control Orders, for specific bodies should enable them to take reasonable action to control, contain or eradicate invasive species outside of their native range, including on privately owned land where landowners are not taking adequate action to prevent their spread.\n8.1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsuring the precautionary \napproach to the release of non-native species \nis adhered to\n: it is currently illegal only to plant/cause to grow in the wild those invasive non-native plants which are listed on Schedule 9 Part\n II.\n&#xa0;\n13 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.plantlife.org.uk/uploads/documents/PL_Invasive_recommendations_%282%29.pdf\n \nhttp://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/40015?category=47020\n \nhttp://www.plantlife.org.uk/wild_plants/important_plant_areas/\n \nhttp://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/40015?category=47020\n \nhttp://www.plantlife.org.uk/publications/here_today_here_tomorrow\n \nhttp://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/40015?category=47020\n"
