"CST0001\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from David E M Gilbert\nson\n QPM, BSc (Econ)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nINTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nBetween 1966 and 2001, I served at all ranks up to and including Deputy Assistant Commissioner in the Metropolitan Police Service, the City of London Police, and within Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) as one of two Assistant Inspectors of Constabulary dealing with the inspection and performance review of all police forces in England and Wales. During my service I held a number of senior command and strategic posts in the UK and overseas, and in particular had detailed involvement in ‘crime recording’ and ‘crime investigation’ at divisional, borough and force level.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nSince my retirement in April 2001 I have maintained a professional interest in public policy insofar as it relates to policing, and have researched areas of interest or concern. I have written widely on the subject and been published in the print and on-line media. I have been asked to appear on a number of television and radio programmes to give expert opinion or commentary. I have given evidence at the High Court as an ‘expert witness’ in proceedings relating to the operational deployment of police in public order situations.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.\n3\n              \nIn late 2009, having become increasingly concerned about \nwhat I saw as \nthe \nworrying \ndirection of policing in the UK, the \nindifferent\n leadership provided by ACPO,  and the generally poor quality of service \nafforded to the public, I began research for a book which I hoped would inform the debate. My book, \n‘The Strange Death of Constable George Dixon – Why the Police have stopped Policing’ \nwas published in 2011. I commented upon strategic issues that are highly relevant to the d\neliberations of the Committee. M\ny research was conducted over three years ago\n, and \nI caution\n that more recent data, of which I am unaware, might direct the \ncommittee to\n conclusions different to those \nthat \nI arrived\n at in 2010 and 2011 \nwhen writing the book, however\n I believe that the broad issues of fact remain largely unchanged.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nSUMMARY&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3\n              \nRESEARCH FINDINGS&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nI\nn July 2009, the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Igor Judge made a plea to the government to pass less legislation. He pointed out that \nbetween 1999 and 2009\n parliament had \nintroduced no less than \n27 criminal justice bills and \ncreated \nover 3,600 new criminal \noffences. Of these \n1,036\n \nwe\nre punishable with imprisonment, equivalent\n to a new \ncustodial\n offence being \nadded to the statute books\n every four days.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nT\nhe average man in the street,\n if asked, “\nWho\n enforces the law and inve\nstigates crime?” will \nalmost ce\nrtainly ascribe the sole responsibility to\n the police. To a certain\n extent \n \nthat is correct,\n but it is not the whole picture. Large areas of the criminal law are not touched by police forces, often because they claim to have ‘insufficient resources’ but more often because other prosecuting authorities have a prior claim. Fraud is a case in point. Until the City of London Police was given national ‘lead force’ responsibility for the investigation of fraud in 2007, vast amounts of financial crime went unreported and was seldom investigated. Even today it is a mixed picture with the police deferring to the Benefits Agency and local authorities in relation to the investigation and prosecution of benefit fraud, (more than 56,000 cases in Engl\nand and Wales in 2007/2008), but\n the investigati\non of ‘insider dealing’, which wa\ns the responsibility of the \nthen \nFinancial Services Authority\n (now the Financial Conduct Authority), \nlaunched\n just two\n successful\n cases in the twelve years after\n t\nhe FSA was established in 1997\n. Police forces seldom, if ever, deal with environmental c\nrime, public sector corruption, \nunless specifically invited to\n do so\n, or specialist offences relating to cruelty to animals, trading standards, adulteration of pharmaceutical products, health and safety etc, all of which are dealt by specialists with their own powers of prosecution.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nThus, the definition of crime is wide and does not lend itself to easy definition in ten-second sound bytes. However, the level of crime is of crucial importance to us all, and is of enduring \nimportance to politicians because their very survival in office may depend \nup\non whether the trend line on a graph is angled up or down. To have even a cursory understanding of the issues involved it is necessary to ask some fairly basic questions; unfortunately the answers often lead to even greater confusion.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nTo answer that simple question it is\n \nnecessary, first of all, to remember that Scotland is a foreign country, has a different legal system, and therefore counts her crime separately. Northern Ireland also maintains a separate register of criminal offences, so when the media talks about crime levels in this country, they are almost certainly not referring to the UK as a whole but only to England and Wales. Because such data are so contentious and inherently political, crime figures have been ‘massaged’ over many years, much in the way that unemployment figures were counted in different ways throughout the 1980’s to conceal the true number of people without jobs. A whole raft of tactics has been employed to ensure that police forces look good, many of which teeter on the edge of downright malpractice. \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nFor example, m\ny research post 2009, confirmed by my \nearlier \nprofessional experience, is that police forces \nfor\n regularly record instances of criminal damage as accidental damage,\n and therefore not a crime; or\n record burglaries in multi-occupancy dwellings in which a number of self-contained flats are entered, as a single crime on the spurious grounds that the offender has broken into a single building and merely entered a few rooms. By 2002 the system had lost all credibility and ACPO were forced to introduce the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) which all forces in England and Wales were obliged to adhere to. One of its key elements was that the police were no longer able to claim ‘professional judgement’ as an excuse for failing to record an offence. If a victim alleged that his wallet had been stolen from his pocket in a restaurant, the allegation had to be recorded as a crime, no ‘ifs’ or ‘buts’. Whereas formerly the police officer, to keep crime figures down, might have been tempted to disregard the victim and record the matter as lost property, he could no longer do so and the NCRS had the immediate effect of inflating crime figures in the years immediately after its introduction, but in the years since there is compelling evidence to show that ‘old habits die hard’ and the NCRS is seldom enforced with rigour.  \n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nAs the Committee will be aware, in 2001, the year prior to the introduction of the NCRS, the Home Office had taken a radical step to compare and contrast recorded crime data with the experience of people living in communities across the land by presenting recorded crime statistics alongside data from the British Crime Survey (BCS). \nThe British Crime Survey was first carried out in 1982 and further surveys were carried out in 1984, \nand then bi-annually until 2000. \nSince April 2001, BCS interviews have been carried out on a continuous basis and detailed results from that point are now reported by financial years. Initially the survey covered Engl\nand, Wales and Scotland but \nthe survey is \nnow \nrestricted to England and Wales.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nThe value of the BCS is that it can provide a better reflection of the true level of crime than police statistics since it includes crimes that have not been reported to, or \neven \nrecorded by, the police. \nThe BCS estimates that only around half of all crime it measures is captured as police-recorded crime\n, largely due to the fact that\n people do not bother to report crimes because they think the crime was too trivial or the police couldn't do much about it. The BCS also provides a better measure of trends over time since it has adopted a consistent methodology and is unaffected by changes in reporting or recording practices.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n              \nThe difference between police recorded crime statistics and BCS data is stark. The figures for 2008/2009\n demonstrate the difference between the experience of victims, as exposed by the survey results and the ‘official’ figures which the police rely upon to inform policy decisions about objectives and policing strategy.\n Overall, cr\nime as measured by the BCS indicated\n no change compared with the 2007/08 \nsurvey results\n in most crime types. Crimes recorded by the police\n however \nshow\ned \na five per cent \ndecrease\n compared with 2007/08, with decreases in most crime types.\n When the data was published ACPO issued a press release welcoming these ‘encouraging’ figures, only briefly referring to the disparity with the BCS. The difference is profound as the figures below show. Total recorded crime in 2008/2009 was 4.7 million crimes, however BCS survey results would indicate crime levels to be at more than double that figure, around 10.7 million. The data disparity for certain crime types is also puzzling. For example police- recorded ‘thefts from the person’ (pick-pocketing, snatches, etc) show a 12% reduction, yet BCS survey data would suggest a 25% increase!\n&#xa0;\nBCS CRIME                                                                                     POLICE RECORDED CRIME&#xa0;→ \nAll BCS crime stable  \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n↓ \nAll police recorded crime down\n     \n              \n(10.7 million crimes in 2008/09) \n              \n              \n              \n    \n              \n 5% to 4.7 million crimes\n&#xa0;\n→ Violent crime – stable\n              \n↓ \nViolence against the person down 6%\n&#xa0;\n→ With\n injury – stable\n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n↓ \nwith injury down 7%\n&#xa0;\n→ \nDomestic burglary – stable\n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n↑ \nDomestic burglary up 1%\n&#xa0;\n→ \nVehicle-related theft – stable\n              \n↓ \nOffences against vehicles down 10%\n&#xa0;\n↑ \nTheft from the person up 25%\n              \n              \n              \n              \n↓ \nTheft from the person down 12%\n&#xa0;\n→ \nVandalism – stable\n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n↓ \nCriminal damage down 10%\n&#xa0;\n↑ Risk of being a victim of crime\n              \n              \n              \n              \n↓ Robbery down 5%\n    \n              \n up from 22% to 23%\n&#xa0;\n↑ \nDrugs offences up 6% \n&#xa0;\n3.9\n              \nPerusal of the data also indicates a great deal about crime as a whole, fear of crime, and the way that police seek to enforce the law, often very selectively. Thus, whilst a total of 4.7 million crimes in a single year may seem to be an inordinately large amount and immensely worrying to the average person, it must not be forgotten that aggregated crime data conceals the fact that not all offences are equal in terms of impact on the victim. For example, the theft of a bottle of milk from someone’s doorstep counts as \none\n crime for the purposes of statistics, but so does the theft of a diamond ring from an open display in a Bond Street jewellers shop. \n&#xa0;\n3.10\n              \nFurther examination of the data is enlightening:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn the grand scheme of things, whilst always a tragedy for those directly involved, really serious crime is nowhere near as prevalent in a country of 6o million people as the media, and a few senior police officers, would have us believe. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.11\n              \nIn 2008/2009 there were just 648 murders in England and Wales, the majority ‘domestic murders’ where the victim and the offender were known to each other. During the same period there were 16,204 murders in the United States, over 9000 by the use of firearms\n. Serious assaults, such as attempted murder, grievous bodily harm, actual bodily harm, robbery etc, and violent crimes such as rape and indecent assault amount to a total of just over half a million crimes, (11.5%), far too many but there is no reason to believe that BCS data would be significantly different because these are exactly the sorts of crimes that would almost always come to the notice of police and therefore appear in the official statistics.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.12\n              \nHowever, it is at this point that ‘attrition’ starts to affect the way in which crime is recorded and dealt with. In the real world of twenty-first century policing vast amounts of recorded crime are not investigated at all. A large and growing proportion of reported crime is ‘screened out’ as soon as it is entered on the computer record system, with many allegations defined as ‘No Crime’ before any sort of investigation has taken place. Research by HM Inspectorate in 2009, and commented upon by independent researchers\n,  demonstrated that across England and Wales \na\nroun\nd a third of all cases were classifi\ned \nas incapable of being solved within\n hours\n of an allegation being made\n.\n&#xa0;\nUnder the \nscreening \nsystem, crimes are logged in official figures but no serious effort is made to investigate and victims are \nmerely \nissued with reference numbers for insurance purposes.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.13\n              \nT\nhe Metropol\nitan Police screens\n out almost half of \nall \nth\ne crimes reported in London. Of the 844,938 allegations of crime recorded by the Met in 2008/2009, \n404,609\n (48% of the total) were screened out and not investigated. Amongst eighteen\n English and\n Welsh forces whic\nh operate official screening\n policies, 697,\n000 offences were deemed unsuitable for investigation\n during \nthe same period \nout of 2.2\n \nmillio\nn reported crimes\n&#xa0;\n(32% of the total). When the data is aggregated across the country it indicates that at least\n 1.7\n \nmillion \nreported crimes per year remain on the books but are not subjected to any form of investigation. In defence of the system, senior officers cite the old excuse, ‘we don’t have enough resources’ \nand\n argue that\n 'screening out' allows them to \nconcentrate their effort upon the most\n serious and\n the most \nsolvable crimes\n, which are not necessarily the same thing. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.14\n              \nMurder, wounding and rape are always investigated, \nas one would expect and demand. C\nases \nare also ‘screened in’\n where there is a named suspect or forensic evidence. \nHowever, there is absolutely no consistency amongst forces in the way that they approach the issue, For example, Cambridgeshire has one of the highest ‘screening out’ rates in the country at 43%, yet shares a common boundary with Essex where the rate is 3%. \nIn parts of the co\nuntry, an average of 75%\n o\nf theft and handling offences a\nre screened out. That fi\ngure is as high as 70% \nfor\n criminal damage and 55%\n for burglary.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.15\n              \nThus the original 4.7 million recorded crimes were rapidly converted into around 2.5 million ‘viable allegation\ns’ after the screening process wa\ns applied. These are the offences that receive\nd\n some sort of investigation by the police, but it should not be assumed that \nthe level of expertise applied wa\ns very high in the case of the majority of crimes. This is particularly the case in London and the big cities, where as a result, junior officers who have not had any detective training are drafted onto teams dealing with serious crime that is often way beyond their abilities. In terms of run-of-the-mill volume crime such as thefts from motor vehicles and domestic burglary, the investigators are hardly ever trained and qualified detectives; they are more likely to be uniform constables posted to plain clothes duties for a few months ‘to help out’. Hardly what the long suffering public expects or deserves.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.16\n              \nMost crime is never solved. Detection rates vary from force to force and between different offences but overall no more than about 25% of crime is ever solved, and even that low average is pushed up by ‘easy to solve offences’ such as drug possession which have an almost 100% detection rate for reasons we have already seen. The clear-up rate for volume crime is often scandalously low. In London and Nottingham which are property crime ‘hotspots’, the clear-up rate for domestic  burglary is between 12% and 13% . All of this means that our initial total of 4.7 million recorded crimes, which became 2.5 million after screening, falls yet further to around 1.3 million \ndetected\n offences in the average year. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.17\n              \nNot unreasonably it is generally believed that once a crime is solved and the criminal identified, the offender will be charged and placed before a court. The public quite properly assume that the definition of what is or is not a detected crime should be relatively straightforward. However because of the statistical ‘Counting Rules’ imposed by the Home Office, the precise definition of a detected offence is something that is of byzantine complexity. There are currently two forms of detection; the first, a ‘sanction’ detection, is logical, the second, a ‘non-sanction’ detection is less so. \nA detected crime is one where an offender has \nbeen identified and dealt with\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.18\n              \nThus, \nfrom \nthe\n overall total of\n 4.7 million recorded offences in 2008/2009 only 1.3 million\n (27.6 %) \nwere recorded as \ndetected \noffences\n after the process of attrition.  Yet \nev\nen this reduced total did\n not lead to every offender appearing before a court as most victims hope and expect. \nJudicial or other disposal was as follows:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.19\n              \nPolice or \n‘Simple’ Cautions were introduced in the 1980’a to deal with minor offences — such as shoplifting — with the aim of reducing legal expenses and leaving courts free to deal with the most serious crimes. From the police point of view, part of the attraction of cautioning is that it saves a tremendous amount of ‘back office’ administrative work in terms of file preparation and collation of evidence etc. This, it is claimed, frees officers to ‘get back on the beat’, although precisely what beats they are returning to is somewhat debatable since the abandonment of preventive patrolling in the 1990’s. \nThe reasoning behind administering a caution is that it is a ‘last chance’. The offender admits his guilt and has the opportunity to mend his ways. Repeated cautions are therefore illogical (because you only get one ‘last chance’)and it was always the stated intention of the scheme that having once been cautioned, a repeat offender would automatically be charged and appear before a court on the very next occasion that he came to notice. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.20\n              \nCrown \nProsecutors have had powers since 20\n05 to impose\n \n‘Conditional C\nautions\n’, which are extra-judicial and have some of the same effect of a suspended sentence in that they can include the imposition of\n hours of community service.\n In the four years since they were introduced (to 2009) nearly 20,000 were applied against offenders without either party going anywhere near a court. In the period 2008 to 2009 the rate increased dramatically with\n betw\neen 600 and 700 a month (\n8,000 a year\n) being ordered. \nThe police\n have been able to impose\n cautions \nfor over 25 years and now do so at an increasing rate. \nIndeed the majority of all arrested offenders are cautioned at police stations or served with fixed penalty notices, usually £80 fines,\n which\n New Labour\n \ngovernment ministers we\nre keen to extend to an even wider list of offences than at present.\n Any pretence of standing by the \noriginal philosophy that a caution represents a ‘last chance’ was abandoned long ago in the interests of expediency. There are legion examples of offenders being cautioned twice, three or four times in succession before they were charged. Simple and Conditional Cautions were imposed on more than 2.2 million people in the last decade. \n&#xa0;\n3.21\n              \nRepeat cautioning is rife. The figures for 2000 to 2008 are as follows.\n&#xa0;\n               i.      \n550,000 offenders had received two or more cautions\n, which included\n,\n&#xa0;\nii.      \n51,000 offenders who had been cautioned on four or more occasions. \n&#xa0;\nThe range of offences for which offenders are cautioned is no longer restricted to minor offences\n. \nFigures produced by the Magistrates Association in 2009\n, \nshowed\n,\n&#xa0;\niii.     Between \n30,000 and 40,000 serious assaults were dealt with by way of caution \nin a single year,\n including around 700 that were so serious that the offender should properly have been cha\nrged with grievous bodily harm for committal to the Crown Court.\n&#xa0;\niv.    \nThere are numerous examples of gross malpractice linked to cautioning, such as an offender with a lengthy and active criminal record being cautioned by police for possessing drugs with intent to supply, and a 15 year old youth who was cautioned for the rape by penetration of a younger boy.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.22\n              \nAt the Poli\nce Federation Conference in 2009\n it was claimed \nthat \nw\nhilst police numbers have increased over time they have not matched rapidly rising crime\n rates\n; that the \npolice \nin 2009 \nface around 40 crimes per officer, four times the number in the 1960s and\n \ntwenty times the number in the 1920s. In addition, \nit wa\ns argued, \nthe sheer volume of antisocial behaviour\n \npresented\n a significant\n new\n challenge.\n On the basis of crime figures alone each officer in 1969 did theoretically have a smaller workload than his successors forty years later, but statistics can and do lie. An appreciable number of offences, recorded in the 2008/9 statistics simply did not exist as recordable crimes in 1969 and therefore did not appear in the totals. \n&#xa0;\n3.23\n              \nThe best example is ‘Common Assault’ which accounted for around 1.5 million of the ‘Assaults without Injury’ th\nat were recorded in 2008/9. Not one\n of these allegations would have gone anywhere near a 1969 crime book, but they still took place – it was just that they were dealt with by officers as ‘civil disputes’ or ‘neighbour arguments’ and made the subject of nothing more than a few lines in an officers pocket book. So it is with ‘anti-social behaviour offences’ which did not exist before 1997 and their invention by New Labour. They cover a multitude of sins, from insulting behaviour, through disputes between tenants on social housing estates, and on to criminal damage, graffiti and assaults. Although all are studiously recorded as crimes in 2009 and feature in national statistics, none save the most serious assaults or damage would have be\nen recorded as crimes in 1969 - b\nut they still took place; they were just called something else. Once again they were the day-to-day experience of the beat PC, requiring intervention, resolution with a few well chosen words and perhaps a threat about what might happen if the incident occurred again\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.24\n              \nIn the context of activity, comparing raw crime data in \n2013 with recorded data from decades before \nis largely meaningless; what is important is how officers fill their time. Busy, committed and active police officers in 1969 were as busy, perhaps busier, than those that followed them in 2009. The same would apply in respect of those who were lazy, disinterested or disengaged in 1969; they could avoid work just as easily as twenty-first century \npolice officers. Indeed the 2013\n generation can probably \nopt out\n more easily because there are more of them and supervision by Sergeants and Inspectors is virtually non-existent. This should be coupled with the fact that the almost universal permission that is given to modern day officers to patrol in pairs, (on wholly spurious and exaggerated ‘officer safety’ grounds), means that the ground covered by patrolling officers is effectively halved.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n                                                                      &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n&#xa0;\n \nHome Office\n Statistical Bulletin July 2009\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n\"Crime in the United States by Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 1989–2009\"\n.\n&#xa0;\nCrime in the United States 2009\n.
