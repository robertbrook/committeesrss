[normal]The LASER model shows that 
[normal]the 
[normal]impact on morning peak travel of loosening the
[normal] 
[normal]land use policy guidance would be a rise in car passenger-km by 4% by 2016 in the
[normal] 
[normal]South East and East of England, over and above the lev
[normal]el under Current Policy. 
[normal]… This suggests that the rise in the car passenger-km would be between 3-4% over the Current Policy Scenario, which is equivalent to 15-20% of the total forecast growth in car passenger-km for the period 1997/98 to 2016.” (page 56,
