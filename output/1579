[normal]I wish  to support the formal submissions made by The Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), by the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), by the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA), and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA) with regard to their proposal that 'All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is absolutely vital to the future of the countryside in general and our National Parks in particular, that BOATS and UCRs are given the fullest possible protection and that this protection is made permanent.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As a resident in the Yorkshire Dales National Park of some 14 years standing and as a lifetime walker through th
[normal]e length and breadth of Britain,
[normal] I have had considerable experience of the damage done by 4 x 4 vehicles and off-the-road bikes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To give as an example: the Cam High Road in Upper 
[normal]Ribblesdale
[normal], an ancient Roman road, had been rendered impassable even to recreational vehicles by their own activities. Ruts had been gouged to such a depth and width that even these vehicles were forced to make wide detours into the surrounding area and for walkers it was largely a no-go area. Now, thanks to the banning of such vehicles and much hard work the Cam High Road has been restored to its former beauty and value. Another footpath familiar to me leads over 
[normal]from  Settle
[normal] via Stockdale, 
[normal]Nappa
[normal] Cross and 
[normal]Langcliffe
[normal]. This too had been badly damaged by off-road drivers and riders so that it had become impassable in places; again, banning orders and restorative work has given us beautiful and tranquil green lanes once again.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In order for this to happen I wish also to support the formal submissions made by The Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), by the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), by the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA), and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA) with regard to their proposal that 'When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate.'
