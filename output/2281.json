"EIS 17\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Tearfund Tearfund is a Christian relief and development agency working in partnership with organisations in around fifty countries, often working alongside or \nthrough networks of local churches, as well as responding directly in response to significant disasters.\n&#xa0;\nTearfund welcomes the opportunity to input into this inquiry. \n&#xa0;\nAs an active member of the Publish What You Pay Coalition, we endorse their submission \nbut wish to build on this with some specific points. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nImpact of the UK signing up to EITI&#xa0;\n1. The UK formally launched the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) over ten years ago. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWorldwide, the EITI is seen to have several benefits, \nincluding; strengthening accountability and good governance; tackling corruption and enabling missing funds to be recovered; \n&#xa0;\na more efficient system of revenue collection; \n&#xa0;\na systematic framework for collaboration between companies, civil society, governm\nent and other stakeholders; reducing corporate risk to extractive companies by clearly showing what a company is paying to a government;\n demonstrating the contribution that the extractive sector makes to a country; and providing information that \n&#xa0;\nenables \ncitizens and civil society to hold governments accountable for their use.\n2. Cases such as the 2009 Nigerian EITI audit, which \nidentified an $800 million USD discrepancy in what oil companies said they paid in taxes, royalties and signature bonuses and wha\nt the government claimed to have received, highlights the potential for greater transparency which the EITI process can bring. \n&#xa0;\nThe Nigerian EITI has made efforts to collect this money, as well as further unpaid taxes identified in previous and subsequent \naudits, and has thus far succeeded in collecting over $400 million USD in unpaid taxes.\n3. \nIn May 2013, the UK committed to become an EITI implementing country. \n&#xa0;\nThis was a welcome statement, with the UK demonstrating global leadership on this issue ahead\n of the G8 Summit. \n&#xa0;\nWith the UK calling for a ‘global standard’ for extractive industry transparency, the UK EITI commitment signals that the UK is ‘practicing what it preaches’. \n&#xa0;\n4. However, the real benefit and impact of the UK joining the EITI will be \ndetermined once the UK makes strides to become EITI compliant, and whether the UK models and implements the highest degrees of transparency and the optional recommendations in the revised EITI standard.\n \n&#xa0;\n5. \n&#xa0;\nTearfund’s research in Peru has demonstrated t\nhat for the EITI to be useful to communities and to result in the desired accountability, the revised EITI standards need to be implemented in full - both here in the UK and in other EITI countries.\n \n&#xa0;\nIn particular:\n- There needs to be contract transparenc\ny in order that communities know the terms and conditions of contracts. \n&#xa0;\nIn Peru there were concerns that many of the contracts were not negotiated in the interests of the country but were the result of underhand political deals - greater contract transpar\nency would help address this.\n \n&#xa0;\n- \n&#xa0;\nThe EITI reports need to include context, in order to convey the bigger picture. \n&#xa0;\nIn Peru, the lack of contextual analysis and the lack of links with other initiatives severely undermines the potential impact of the EITI \nreports. \n&#xa0;\nThe requirement in the revised standard to publish the context, including production figures; disclosure of the license holders; the revenue allocations to state, local and other accounts; and a description of the fiscal regime, is welcome but in\n time must go further so that EITI reports also link to other kinds of information (e.g. on local government budgets and environmental laws).\n6. The UK has the opportunity to model best practice with its EITI compliance - to implement the optional recommen\ndations in the revised EITI standard, to link the EITI report to other relevant information and to present the EITI data in an accessible, comprehensible and usable format - in line with the UK’s commitment under the Open Data Charter. \n&#xa0;\nThis will enable UK\n citizens to more readily understand the data and ensure that the UK continues to act as a world leader on this issue, living up to its ambition to be the most open and transparent government in the world.\n \n&#xa0;\nBest practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs7. Tearfund’s\n joint research in Peru has highlighted some of the challenges of NGOs engaging in the EITI process, particularly in terms of the discernible impact on promoting transparency, public debate and accountability for the revenues obtained by the extractive ind\nustries. The research found that in Peru, the EITI reports were published at public meetings in the capital Lima (where specialists, state officials, NGOs and representatives of extractive firms attended), but in the regional meetings the attendance was mu\nch poorer and the meetings not well publicised. \n&#xa0;\nThis led to less accountability and sometimes greater mistrust.\n8. The UK can learn from this experience and consider how to ensure that citizens and local groups based outside of London, particularly where \nbased relatively near to extractive industry pr\nojects such as accessing unconventional\n gas, can be supported and engaged in the process. \n&#xa0;\nAgain, the way the UK publishes the EITI report and data will be an important determinant as to how NGOs and local com\nmunities engage in the process.\nGoing forward - the UK as a global leader on extractive industry transparency9. The UK is to be commended for taking forward this agenda - most notably for supporting the passage of the EU Accounting and Transparency Dire\nctives and for making progress on extractive industries transparency at the G8 in June. \n&#xa0;\n10. To prevent the momentum from stalling, the UK should continue to work to transpose the EU Directives quickly, as it committed to do at the G8, completing transpos\nition by the end of 2014. \n&#xa0;\nThe UK must ensure that the data resulting from the implementation of the EU Directives is accessible and usable in accordance with the principles outlined in the G8’s Open Data \nCharter, in order that communities worldwide can ea\nsily view and interpret the payments made by UK extractives firms.\n11. In addition, the UK has the opportunity to build on the ongoing international progress and call for a global mandatory reporting standard, equivalent to the EU Directives. \n&#xa0;\nA global agr\neement is needed to ensure that all extractive companies, no matter where they are listed, are required to publish what they pay to foreign governments, on a country-by-country and project-by-project basis. \n&#xa0;\nAs countries with the largest global share of ex\ntractive companies, the G20 has a key role to play - particularly Australia, South Africa and Brazil. \n&#xa0;\nWith Australia soon to assume the G20 Presidency, the UK Government should work with other G20 members to ensure that there is an agreement on, and a com\nmitment to, mandatory legislation at next year's G20 Summit in Brisbane.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nImplementing \nthe Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative - applying early lessons from the field, World Bank (2007)\n \nhttp://eiti.org/files/Case%20Study%20-%20EITI%20in%20Nigeria.pdf\n p2\nhttp://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/neiti-recovers-n69bn-unremitted-oil-revenue/133876/\n \nSee here for the revised EITI standard as adopted in Ma\ny 2013: \nhttp://eiti.org/document/standard\n \nTearfund’s joint research in Peru can be found here: \nhttp://tilz.tearfund.org/en/resources/policy_and_research/governance_and_corruption/eiti_extractive_industries_transparency_initiative_report_feb_2013/\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/francis-maude-speech-to-mark-the-launch-of-new-government-transparency-commitments\n"
