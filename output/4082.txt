[[[London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (BRC 67)]]]&#xa0;1.              The London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) run the London Fire Brigade (LFB) and is a functional body of the Greater London Authority.  London’s fire and rescue service is the busiest in the country and one of the largest firefighting and rescue organisations in the world. We provide services across the whole of the Greater London area, serving London’s 8.2 million residents as well as those who work in or visit the city.&#xa0;2.              Around 6,500 staff work for the Brigade. This includes over 5,500 operational firefighters, 100 Brigade Control staff dealing with 999 emergency calls and a range of non-operational staff working behind the scenes to deliver support services such as getting fire safety messages across.&#xa0;3.              The LFB has reviewed its data relating to domestic fires resulting from electrical causes (not including white goods/portable appliances) and does not have substantive evidence of an increased risk of fire or danger to the public, due to the operation of the electrical competent persons scheme.&#xa0;4.              However, the LFB does has significant concern regarding a closely related issue, which is that of on-going electrical safety inspections in rented domestic accommodation. Unlike the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998, where landlords have a duty (annually) to make sure gas appliances, fittings and flues provided for tenants are safe, there is currently no statutory requirement to have annual safety checks carried out on the electrical installation or electrical equipment.&#xa0;5.              Through the work of the Brigade’s fire investigation team, significant qualitative data has been accumulated which shows that serious fires have occurred due to dangerous and untested electrical installations in rented properties. Cases involving extensive property damage and even fatalities have been recorded. &#xa0;The LFB would be happy to provide detailed evidence to support the need for change and ask DCLG to consider making annual landlords electrical safety checks (and ideally portable appliance testing) mandatory, to either match the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998, or else to take place at reasonable intervals e.g. 1-3 years.&#xa0;6.              In support of this submission, please see a report - entitled ‘Thematic Report on Electrical Fires (FEP 1953)’ - which can be found on the London Fire website and which was agreed at the LFEPA’s Strategy Committee.  The report looks at the occurrence of accidental dwelling fires where the source of ignition is powered by electricity.  The report also highlights the prevention work undertaken both to change human behaviours and work to improve electrical supply and appliance design. &#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
