defaultWith the 
defaultrecent 
defaultapparent reform agenda in Myanmar has come the release of prisoners, the return of activists to communities
default and,
default more generally
default,
default increased civic space
default,
default including significant and progressive labour activism. Civil Society Organisations 
default(
defaultCSOs
default)
default are also mushrooming
default,
default and increased levels of donor funding potentially provid
defaulte
default significant opportunities for these CSOs to engage actively in trying to influence and shape the governance reform agenda. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFor Cord, as a 
defaultpeacebuilding
default organisation, such developments are to be warmly welcomed, but are not without significant risks and challenges 
default(see
default below
default)
default. These include
default,
default 
defaultinter alia
default, the challenges of CSO legal and representative legitimacy, the pressure of 
default(
defaultsometimes competing
default)
default external funding and expectations versus the imperative for an endogenous Myanmar ‘roadmap’ and development trajectory, CSO capacities to manage 
defaultpeacebuilding
default and governance reform programmes
default,
default and government and political parties’ capacities to engage in multi-stakeholder dialogue processes around the key issues associated with such reform. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the same time, access 
defaultto 
defaultand control over resources are at the heart of any analysis of Myanmar’s progress in recent years
default. T
defaulthe extent to which government and the private sector can accommodate citizens and CSOs in engaging around resource transparency, access and control will be a
default key
default indicator of
default,
default and contributor to
default,
default democratic economic development. However
default,
default a society divided along ethnic 
defaultand sometimes religious 
defaultlines, where access to and control of resources is often mediated via 
defaultaffiliation to
default a
default particular
default ethnic 
default(
defaultor other
default)
default group
default,
default and where identity politics shape political positioning
default,
default is not readily amenable
default to
default the kind of multi-stakeholder, consensual processes 
defaultthat
default may be required to ensure that My
defaulta
defaultnmar is not reduced to a set of interest groups, 
defaulteach 
defaultfighting the
default other from the
defaultir own corner in a zero-sum game.
default&#xa0;
defaultA
defaultddress
defaulting
default these challenges
default requires
default a coherent strategy 
defaultthat
default mainstreams 
defaultpeacebuilding
default and multi-stakeholder governance reform processes
default.
default&#xa0;defaultCord is an international 
defaultnon-governmental organisation (
defaultNGO
default)
default, with administrative headquarters in the UK where it is registered with the Charit
defaulty
default Commission (No. 1070684). Cord envisions a 
defaultworld where peace is fully realised
default. It
default 
defaultworks in societies affected by violent conflict and poverty, developing the capacity of 
defaultlocal 
defaultpartners to build a sustainable peace
default. It has operations in Africa and in Asia. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCord has had a presence in South East Asia since 1975
default;
default has a regional office in Phnom Penh
default,
default Cambodia
default;
default and has been active in supporting civil society in Myanmar for a number of years. It finally opened an office in Myanmar in late 2012
default,
default after a series of consultations with local actors 
defaultthat
default highlighted the relevance of Cord’s 
defaultpeacebuilding
default approach and emphasis on institutional and capacity development. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn early 2013, w
defaultith the support of the Netherlands Embassy in Bangkok, Cord Myanmar conducted a baseline study with civil society on gender mainstreaming, disseminat
defaulting
default the findings to civil society. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn June 2013, Cord Myanmar began implementing a 26
default-
defaultmonth project
default,
default 
default‘Partnership for Positive Change in Myanmar’ (PPCM)
default, which is
default 
defaultpart-financed by the European Commission. PPCM seeks to contribute to 
defaultthe establishment of a strong and effective civil society 
defaultthat
default will lead to the implementation of more sustainable and locally owned development initiatives.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultCord’s work is designed to meet the emerging needs of Myanmar’s civil society and local authorities to engage with each other to achieve common development aims.  It contains an explicit focus on 
defaultpeacebuilding
default, conflict resolution and human rights, and seeks to consolidate democratic gains and strengthen moves towards governance reform 
defaultthat
default will support a just and lasting peace. This focus on 
defaultpeacebuilding
default is fundamental given Myanmar’s current context
default,
default as outlined below. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCord’s overall objectives in Myanmar are:
default&#xa0;defaultMyanmar has experienced decades of civil war
default,
default 
defaultas well as
default massive infringements on human rights by the military dictatorship 
defaultthat
default took power in 1962. During the majority of this time, civil society was banned or controlled, some 
defaultorganisations 
defaultbeing 
defaulttransformed
default into state-sponsored organisations acting as agents of control over certain sections of society. 
default&#xa0;
defaultToday, Myanmar is in a state of positive flux. A move towards internal democratisation by 
defaultthe
default government has led to international optimism that 
defaultit
default will relax its hold on 
defaultthe country’s 
defaultpolitical and civil space. A number of fragile peace agreements have been signed. Pledges of investment in civil society by international donors are increasing significantly. As of 2013
default,
default existing 
defaultCSOs
default are finding themselves inundated with opportunities
default,
default and the number of 
defaultCSOs
default is likely to grow in numbers as a response. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, there continues to be excessive centralisation of authority, a lack of trust 
defaultamong citizens 
defaultin the government, and claims by many ethnic minority groups that they are being excluded from economic, political and cultural development. The risk of inequitable and unsustainable development remains a threat. Government is perceived by these groups as being complicit in the more exploitative aspects of recent foreign direct investment such as land-grabbing and resource extraction schemes, and transparency safeguards are lacking. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMyanmar has a rich and eclectic history of civic 
defaultengagment
default and social action, evidenced by the organisation for ethnic rights, the resistance to colonial rule, 
defaultprotests in
default 1988 and 
defaultdemonstrations in
default 2007. With the recent rel
defaultease
default of 
defaulta number of 
defaultprisoners, many of whom were activists, and the general opening up of civic space, there continues to be 
defaulta significant mushrooming of civil society
default. While some may view this as 
defaultan opportunity to respond to the concerns outlined above
default, 
defaultthere are a number of considerations and risks associated with this which need to be taken into account:
default&#xa0;
default3.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default&#xa0;defaultNotwithstanding the passing of a Law on the Right to Peaceful Assemblies and Processions
default in late 2011 that enables the forming of association
default,
default m
defaultany CSOs
default that were
default previously only allowed to operate under the 
default1988 Organization of Association Law
default are uncertain as to their technical legality to operate.
default This opaq
defaultu
defaulteness with regard to legal status and state-recognised legitimacy was tolerated by both 
defaultthe 
defaultgovernm
defaulte
defaultnt and CSOs in the aftermath of Cyclone 
defaultNargis
default in 2008, given the need for a massive delivery of humanitarian aid. With the emerging reform agenda 
defaultled 
defaultby 
defaultthe 
defaultgovernment, 
defaultand
default as CSOs focus on issues 
defaultthat
default challenge existing power relations in a much more profound way, 
defaultthere is a risk 
defaultthat this legal uncertainty around CSO status will undermine efforts at governance reform;
default3.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default&#xa0;defaultThere is a very real danger that the focus and strateg
defaulty
default of CSOs will be determined by donor priorities alone, rather than 
defaultdeveloping 
defaultorganically from needs identified at the local/community level. This threatens a sense of local 
defaultidentity, local ownership
default and
default representation
default,
default and therefore the legitimacy of the mandate of local and national associations. 
defaultIn order for 
defaultcivil society in Myanmar
default 
defaultto have an impact on governance reform for equitable, sustainable development
default, it is essential that it
default 
defaulthas
default 
defaultadequate
default skills in 
defaultfostering and enabling 
defaultpublic participation in local planning, transparency, accountability and conflict sensitivity, which are necessary preconditions for a just and lasting peace;
default3.3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default&#xa0;defaultThere is a risk t
defaulthat organizational capacity 
defaultof
default CSOs to manage humanitarian interventions will be conflated by both donors and CSOs themselves with capacity to manage interventions with a broader 
defaultpeacebuilding
default and governance reform agenda
default; yet these various interventions
default 
defaulteach
default require a very different set of skills, structures
default and
default processes and 
defaultstyle of 
defaultoperational management. Significant capacity development is still required in this area;
default3.4.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default&#xa0;defaultThere are progressives within the new 
defaultg
defaultovernment in Myanmar and in society at large who support a path towards governance reform and even democratic governance. At present however, the government continues to face a number of daunting challenges, not least 
defaultthe need
default to function effectively and efficiently to respond to citizens
default’
default needs and expectations following the recent ‘opening up’. This is particularly challenging given that in many cases, aside from political will, the necessary budgets, structures, staffing and capacities are not yet in place to allow many ministries to function optimally
default. I
defaultt is now a key priority to ensure that the capacity exists to respond to citizens
default’
default expectations. 
defaultIt is worth noting that
default a number of potential initiatives are slowly emerging which could support this. Civil 
defaults
defaultociety already 
defaulthas 
defaultsignificant capacity to engage with local officials and 
defaultis
default considered 
defaulta 
defaultkey resource in helping to mediate and broker increased governance accountability at local level. However, the 
defaultcentralised
default nature of government control, limited governance capacity
default,
default and the absence of structured mechanisms for interaction and dialogue between government and civil society, mean that
default,
default 
defaultfor
default the moment
default,
default such responsive and perhaps even more democratic, local and national governance remains an aspiration; 
default3.5.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default&#xa0;defaultIn tandem with government capacity challenges, while 
defaultCSOs
default are now able to engage at local level, significant capacity development
default is
default required if such engagement is to move beyond the token and opportunistic into having any impact on more participatory governance and even governance reform. Civic knowledge generally
default,
default and understanding of civil society and the role of government specifically, is still limited
default,
default and agencies 
defaultthat
default wish to support civic engagement 
defaultwill need to adopt 
defaulta reflexive, patient and careful approach
default to developing 
defaultCSO capacities. At local level, particularly among the rural poor, there is also a degree of passivity and acceptance bred by many years of autocratic governance. However, civic knowledge and aspirations are 
defaultgenerally 
defaulta mixed picture as
default,
default coupled with this passivity 
default(
defaultand
default,
default some would say
default,
default relief that the old local governance model has been dismantled
default)
default is the demand and 
defaultexpectation among more educated or economically empowered citizens for the freedoms and rights that come with a reformed political system
default;
default for peace, stability and security
default,
default and also for 
defaultlocal 
defaultservices which would improve their everyday lives. Citizen activism has been at the heart 
defaultof 
defaultpolitical life in Myanmar despite the previous restrictive environment
default,
default and many citizens who are politically engaged have somewhat idealistic expectations of a rapid transformation of the country
default. They
default expect marked and immediate improvements in political and economic development
default:
default they want to see significant reform soon
default,
default and to see such reform deliver, and in addition to the redevelopment of a new national constitution, to see evidence of that delivery in ways 
defaultthat
default impact their family and their communities. Many of these citizens and CSOs have been on the front
default 
defaultline in protests against the government and 
defaultassociated
default 
defaultcases of detention
default and are 
defaulttherefore 
defaultexperienced advocates and campaigners
default;
default it will be essential that they are not excluded in the development of a new Myanmar governance model and transition process. 
defaultM
defaultarginalization at this stage in the process could lead to some 
defaultindividuals and bodies 
defaultopting out
default,
default 
defaultthereby
default threaten
defaulting
default the legitimacy and progress achieved to date. This is particularly vital given the 
defaultrisk of frustration and disillusionment among
default some citizens
default who perceive
default that the ‘opening up’ has not brought about substantial changes in their experience of government effectiveness and service delivery
default;
default 
defaultsuch feelings
default could quickly undermine the transition process. Furthermore, the 
defaultNational League for Democracy (
defaultNLD
default)’s
default success in the 2012 by-elections, gaining 43 of the 44 seats, while not representatively significant at national level, means that 
defaultboth 
defaultthe NLD 
defaultand
default the government will now be under scrutiny and more 
defaultvulnerable
default to criticism for any perceived lack of delivery at both national and local level. Across the country
default,
default the formerly ruling 
defaultState Peace and Development Council (
defaultSPDC
default)
default mechanisms at township and village level are no longer in place, and the role of local military commander
defaults
default has been 
defaultsomewhat 
defaultreduced. These 
defaultare being
default replaced
default, at least to begin with,
default 
defaultby
default 
defaultthe 
defaultState Government Assembly 
default(
defaultwith limited funds
default)
default and 
defaultby
default what 
defaultare
default expected 
defaultto
default be local
default-
defaultlevel councils in municipalities. But with all local revenue returned to central government and very limited fiscal transfers, there are questions as to 
defaultthe extent to which
default these structures will actually be able to exercise effective local governance. There are proposals to provide central grants to these newly elected local bodies
default,
default although 
defaultit
default is 
defaultnot currently clear
default what kind of funding would be made available to the State Assemblies
default.

default&#xa0;defaultIn such scenarios, various groups, with their potential and capacity for a ‘quick fix’ at local level, present credible alternatives to elected bodies and 
defaultto 
defaultmore deliberative governance processes, 
defaultwhich can be slow and unwieldy.
default 
defaultThis will
default,
default at 
defaultleast,
default require a consensual 
default(
defaultif no
defaultt
default participat
defaultory)
default approach and outcome, between citizens and government but also among the various interest groups which make up the Union of Myanmar. Such consensus cannot be assumed in a society that is divided by ethnic 
defaultand religious 
defaultdivisions, and where access to and 
defaultcontrol of resources is often mediated via 
defaultaffiliation to
default an ethnic 
default(
defaultor other
default)
default group and where identity politics shape political positioning. This 
defaultsituation was
default exacerbated 
defaultunder
default the political scenario 
defaultthat existed
default 
defaultuntil recently,
default 
defaultin which
default the general perception and operating principle 
defaultwas
default that such groups must fight their own corner in a zero-sum game.
default3.7.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default&#xa0;defaultFinally, against this background, for many citizens and CSOs there is the 
defaultspectre
default 
defaultthat
default individuals and groups 
defaultthat
default 
defaultwere
default engaged in activities or dialogue with 
defaultthe 
defaultgovernment up until 2012
default may now be perceived as
default ‘tainted’ or too 
defaultclosely 
defaultaligned with government figures. Such groups and individuals would argue
default,
default of course
default,
default that they have helped pave the way for the current ‘openness’ by engag
defaulting
default government and others in those first tentative steps. However it
default i
defaults also clear that international agencies will have to tread very carefully when selecting ‘partners’ on the ground, for fear of selecting either groups 
defaultthat
default are marginalized and unacceptable to government, 
defaultor
default those 
defaultthat
default have lost legitimacy with citizens and CSOs 
defaulton account of their perceived ‘alignment’
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultEffective local governance and reform of the public administration system 
default(
defaultPAR
default)
default in Myanmar is considered essential 
defaultin
default responding to citizen engagement, promoting social justice, maintaining momentum in the transition 
defaultand 
defaultpromoting a just and lasting peace. 
default&#xa0;
defaultStrategic interventions around PAR and support to the set-up and reform of local government structures and process should therefore be considered a priority by 
defaultDfID
default. Given the highly centralised Ministry
default-
defaultdriven local governance model, there is a need to at least align, if not integrate
default,
default this decentralisation and PAR reform support.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis support should be coupled with the exten
defaultsion
default of 
defaultDfID’s
default support through the 
defaultPyoe
default Pin programme
default,
default and an approach 
defaultthat
default works through 
defaultsupport to a
default selection of specific issues 
default(
defaulthealth, rural livelihoods
default,
default etc
default.)
default in order to help focus civic engagement and CSO development and locate efforts to support public administration and decentralisation reform. In this regard it will be important to consider funding a wide range of CS partners
default, incorporating
default both capacity development and project implementation funds
default,
default under a single programme.
default&#xa0;
defaultCord is proposing 
defaulta
default tripartite 
default(
defaultlocal 
defaultg
defaultovernance/PAR/
defaultc
defaultivic 
defaulte
defaultngagement
default)
default strategic 
defaults
defaultocial 
defaulta
defaultccountability approach based on its commitment to 
defaultpeacebuilding
default,
default as well as its experience in Myanmar and learning from a number of other contexts in the region. For example, in a number of governance reform 
defaultprogrammes
default in the region, development partner support has typically been focused either on technical reform of the state bureaucracy
default,
default which was viewed as ‘supply-side
default’
default governance, or on the 
defaultempowerment of civil society and civil society 
defaultorganisations
default to ‘demand’ increased democracy and/or improved governance. Generally speaking, the ‘supply
default-
defaultside’ approach has involved the strengthening of accountability through the development of institutions of government such as the electoral system, parliament and its politicians, the executive and public administration
default,
default and the strengthening of sub-national governance and national governance institutions which support and enable it. The ‘demand’ side
default,
default on the other hand, has tended to focus on the involvement of a wide range of civil society groups, associations, citizens and 
defaultorganisations
default in pressurizing government to improve its performance and allow citizens a greater role in policy development, for example.  
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, a range of practitioners and academics have in recent years offered a critique of such disaggregated models and have instead suggested developing a more integrated range of approaches 
defaultaimed at
default addressing both the ‘demand’ and ‘supply’ side
defaults
default of governance. This critique of ‘one-sided’ or ‘unbalanced’ approaches by practitioners and policy makers has led to the development of a range of Social Accountability 
default(
defaultS.Ac
default)
default models, tools and approaches
default,
default many of which have been tested at local level across the 
defaultSouth East
default Asia
defaultn
default region
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the local governance and civic engagement challenges described above, such an understanding should underpin the development of 
defaultDfID
default’
defaults
default strategy in Myanmar
default,
default 
defaultaimed at achieving
default effective democratic governance
default,
default coupled with accountability
default,
default through citizen engagement in multi-stakeholder dialogue with government at local level and national level. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis can be achieved through the development of innovative 
defaults
defaultocial 
defaulta
defaultccountability and dialogue methodologies focused on 
defaulttackling both 
defaultthe challenges for communities at local and district level in Myanmar
default and
default the real structural and capacity challenges faced by local government and national level ministries. It is 
defaultrecommended
default that 
defaultthe 
defaultUK
defaultAid
default support initiatives 
defaultthat
default pilot an approach which 
defaulta) 
defaultbrings diverse stakeholders together at local level
default;
default and, 
defaultb) 
defaultthrough a carefully structured and facilitated capacity development and dialogue process, assist
defaults
default them to collectively deliberate, build consensus and take action to address these challenges in practical and realistic ways. 
defaultThese initiatives should
default also seek to link such participation and dialogue mechanisms with institutional and capacity development in local government in order to respond to such engagement
default,
default and with national 
defaultm
defaultinistry-level reform. 
defaultThey
default will need to include both extensive institutional development support at national level
default,
default and capacity development on structuring dialogue and accountability mechanisms and processes between government 
default(
defaultat the central and local levels
default)
default and civil society. Such dialogue will necessarily require investment in a joint knowledge base among government and civil society over critical issues in Myanmar.
