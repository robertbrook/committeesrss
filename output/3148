[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Cord[bold]Myanmar[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]With the 
[normal]recent 
[normal]apparent reform agenda in Myanmar has come the release of prisoners, the return of activists to communities
[normal] and,
[normal] more generally
[normal],
[normal] increased civic space
[normal],
[normal] including significant and progressive labour activism. Civil Society Organisations 
[normal](
[normal]CSOs
[normal])
[normal] are also mushrooming
[normal],
[normal] and increased levels of donor funding potentially provid
[normal]e
[normal] significant opportunities for these CSOs to engage actively in trying to influence and shape the governance reform agenda. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For Cord, as a 
[normal]peacebuilding
[normal] organisation, such developments are to be warmly welcomed, but are not without significant risks and challenges 
[normal](see
[normal] below
[normal])
[normal]. These include
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]inter alia
[normal], the challenges of CSO legal and representative legitimacy, the pressure of 
[normal](
[normal]sometimes competing
[normal])
[normal] external funding and expectations versus the imperative for an endogenous Myanmar ‘roadmap’ and development trajectory, CSO capacities to manage 
[normal]peacebuilding
[normal] and governance reform programmes
[normal],
[normal] and government and political parties’ capacities to engage in multi-stakeholder dialogue processes around the key issues associated with such reform. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At the same time, access 
[normal]to 
[normal]and control over resources are at the heart of any analysis of Myanmar’s progress in recent years
[normal]. T
[normal]he extent to which government and the private sector can accommodate citizens and CSOs in engaging around resource transparency, access and control will be a
[normal] key
[normal] indicator of
[normal],
[normal] and contributor to
[normal],
[normal] democratic economic development. However
[normal],
[normal] a society divided along ethnic 
[normal]and sometimes religious 
[normal]lines, where access to and control of resources is often mediated via 
[normal]affiliation to
[normal] a
[normal] particular
[normal] ethnic 
[normal](
[normal]or other
[normal])
[normal] group
[normal],
[normal] and where identity politics shape political positioning
[normal],
[normal] is not readily amenable
[normal] to
[normal] the kind of multi-stakeholder, consensual processes 
[normal]that
[normal] may be required to ensure that My
[normal]a
[normal]nmar is not reduced to a set of interest groups, 
[normal]each 
[normal]fighting the
[normal] other from the
[normal]ir own corner in a zero-sum game.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A
[normal]ddress
[normal]ing
[normal] these challenges
[normal] requires
[normal] a coherent strategy 
[normal]that
[normal] mainstreams 
[normal]peacebuilding
[normal] and multi-stakeholder governance reform processes
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Cord is an international 
[normal]non-governmental organisation (
[normal]NGO
[normal])
[normal], with administrative headquarters in the UK where it is registered with the Charit
[normal]y
[normal] Commission (No. 1070684). Cord envisions a 
[normal]world where peace is fully realised
[normal]. It
[normal] 
[normal]works in societies affected by violent conflict and poverty, developing the capacity of 
[normal]local 
[normal]partners to build a sustainable peace
[normal]. It has operations in Africa and in Asia. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cord has had a presence in South East Asia since 1975
[normal];
[normal] has a regional office in Phnom Penh
[normal],
[normal] Cambodia
[normal];
[normal] and has been active in supporting civil society in Myanmar for a number of years. It finally opened an office in Myanmar in late 2012
[normal],
[normal] after a series of consultations with local actors 
[normal]that
[normal] highlighted the relevance of Cord’s 
[normal]peacebuilding
[normal] approach and emphasis on institutional and capacity development. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In early 2013, w
[normal]ith the support of the Netherlands Embassy in Bangkok, Cord Myanmar conducted a baseline study with civil society on gender mainstreaming, disseminat
[normal]ing
[normal] the findings to civil society. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In June 2013, Cord Myanmar began implementing a 26
[normal]-
[normal]month project
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]‘Partnership for Positive Change in Myanmar’ (PPCM)
[normal], which is
[normal] 
[normal]part-financed by the European Commission. PPCM seeks to contribute to 
[normal]the establishment of a strong and effective civil society 
[normal]that
[normal] will lead to the implementation of more sustainable and locally owned development initiatives.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cord’s work is designed to meet the emerging needs of Myanmar’s civil society and local authorities to engage with each other to achieve common development aims.  It contains an explicit focus on 
[normal]peacebuilding
[normal], conflict resolution and human rights, and seeks to consolidate democratic gains and strengthen moves towards governance reform 
[normal]that
[normal] will support a just and lasting peace. This focus on 
[normal]peacebuilding
[normal] is fundamental given Myanmar’s current context
[normal],
[normal] as outlined below. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cord’s overall objectives in Myanmar are:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Myanmar has experienced decades of civil war
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]as well as
[normal] massive infringements on human rights by the military dictatorship 
[normal]that
[normal] took power in 1962. During the majority of this time, civil society was banned or controlled, some 
[normal]organisations 
[normal]being 
[normal]transformed
[normal] into state-sponsored organisations acting as agents of control over certain sections of society. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Today, Myanmar is in a state of positive flux. A move towards internal democratisation by 
[normal]the
[normal] government has led to international optimism that 
[normal]it
[normal] will relax its hold on 
[normal]the country’s 
[normal]political and civil space. A number of fragile peace agreements have been signed. Pledges of investment in civil society by international donors are increasing significantly. As of 2013
[normal],
[normal] existing 
[normal]CSOs
[normal] are finding themselves inundated with opportunities
[normal],
[normal] and the number of 
[normal]CSOs
[normal] is likely to grow in numbers as a response. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, there continues to be excessive centralisation of authority, a lack of trust 
[normal]among citizens 
[normal]in the government, and claims by many ethnic minority groups that they are being excluded from economic, political and cultural development. The risk of inequitable and unsustainable development remains a threat. Government is perceived by these groups as being complicit in the more exploitative aspects of recent foreign direct investment such as land-grabbing and resource extraction schemes, and transparency safeguards are lacking. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Myanmar has a rich and eclectic history of civic 
[normal]engagment
[normal] and social action, evidenced by the organisation for ethnic rights, the resistance to colonial rule, 
[normal]protests in
[normal] 1988 and 
[normal]demonstrations in
[normal] 2007. With the recent rel
[normal]ease
[normal] of 
[normal]a number of 
[normal]prisoners, many of whom were activists, and the general opening up of civic space, there continues to be 
[normal]a significant mushrooming of civil society
[normal]. While some may view this as 
[normal]an opportunity to respond to the concerns outlined above
[normal], 
[normal]there are a number of considerations and risks associated with this which need to be taken into account:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Notwithstanding the passing of a Law on the Right to Peaceful Assemblies and Processions
[normal] in late 2011 that enables the forming of association
[normal],
[normal] m
[normal]any CSOs
[normal] that were
[normal] previously only allowed to operate under the 
[normal]1988 Organization of Association Law
[normal] are uncertain as to their technical legality to operate.
[normal] This opaq
[normal]u
[normal]eness with regard to legal status and state-recognised legitimacy was tolerated by both 
[normal]the 
[normal]governm
[normal]e
[normal]nt and CSOs in the aftermath of Cyclone 
[normal]Nargis
[normal] in 2008, given the need for a massive delivery of humanitarian aid. With the emerging reform agenda 
[normal]led 
[normal]by 
[normal]the 
[normal]government, 
[normal]and
[normal] as CSOs focus on issues 
[normal]that
[normal] challenge existing power relations in a much more profound way, 
[normal]there is a risk 
[normal]that this legal uncertainty around CSO status will undermine efforts at governance reform;
[normal]3.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]There is a very real danger that the focus and strateg
[normal]y
[normal] of CSOs will be determined by donor priorities alone, rather than 
[normal]developing 
[normal]organically from needs identified at the local/community level. This threatens a sense of local 
[normal]identity, local ownership
[normal] and
[normal] representation
[normal],
[normal] and therefore the legitimacy of the mandate of local and national associations. 
[normal]In order for 
[normal]civil society in Myanmar
[normal] 
[normal]to have an impact on governance reform for equitable, sustainable development
[normal], it is essential that it
[normal] 
[normal]has
[normal] 
[normal]adequate
[normal] skills in 
[normal]fostering and enabling 
[normal]public participation in local planning, transparency, accountability and conflict sensitivity, which are necessary preconditions for a just and lasting peace;
[normal]3.3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]There is a risk t
[normal]hat organizational capacity 
[normal]of
[normal] CSOs to manage humanitarian interventions will be conflated by both donors and CSOs themselves with capacity to manage interventions with a broader 
[normal]peacebuilding
[normal] and governance reform agenda
[normal]; yet these various interventions
[normal] 
[normal]each
[normal] require a very different set of skills, structures
[normal] and
[normal] processes and 
[normal]style of 
[normal]operational management. Significant capacity development is still required in this area;
[normal]3.4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]There are progressives within the new 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment in Myanmar and in society at large who support a path towards governance reform and even democratic governance. At present however, the government continues to face a number of daunting challenges, not least 
[normal]the need
[normal] to function effectively and efficiently to respond to citizens
[normal]’
[normal] needs and expectations following the recent ‘opening up’. This is particularly challenging given that in many cases, aside from political will, the necessary budgets, structures, staffing and capacities are not yet in place to allow many ministries to function optimally
[normal]. I
[normal]t is now a key priority to ensure that the capacity exists to respond to citizens
[normal]’
[normal] expectations. 
[normal]It is worth noting that
[normal] a number of potential initiatives are slowly emerging which could support this. Civil 
[normal]s
[normal]ociety already 
[normal]has 
[normal]significant capacity to engage with local officials and 
[normal]is
[normal] considered 
[normal]a 
[normal]key resource in helping to mediate and broker increased governance accountability at local level. However, the 
[normal]centralised
[normal] nature of government control, limited governance capacity
[normal],
[normal] and the absence of structured mechanisms for interaction and dialogue between government and civil society, mean that
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] the moment
[normal],
[normal] such responsive and perhaps even more democratic, local and national governance remains an aspiration; 
[normal]3.5.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]In tandem with government capacity challenges, while 
[normal]CSOs
[normal] are now able to engage at local level, significant capacity development
[normal] is
[normal] required if such engagement is to move beyond the token and opportunistic into having any impact on more participatory governance and even governance reform. Civic knowledge generally
[normal],
[normal] and understanding of civil society and the role of government specifically, is still limited
[normal],
[normal] and agencies 
[normal]that
[normal] wish to support civic engagement 
[normal]will need to adopt 
[normal]a reflexive, patient and careful approach
[normal] to developing 
[normal]CSO capacities. At local level, particularly among the rural poor, there is also a degree of passivity and acceptance bred by many years of autocratic governance. However, civic knowledge and aspirations are 
[normal]generally 
[normal]a mixed picture as
[normal],
[normal] coupled with this passivity 
[normal](
[normal]and
[normal],
[normal] some would say
[normal],
[normal] relief that the old local governance model has been dismantled
[normal])
[normal] is the demand and 
[normal]expectation among more educated or economically empowered citizens for the freedoms and rights that come with a reformed political system
[normal];
[normal] for peace, stability and security
[normal],
[normal] and also for 
[normal]local 
[normal]services which would improve their everyday lives. Citizen activism has been at the heart 
[normal]of 
[normal]political life in Myanmar despite the previous restrictive environment
[normal],
[normal] and many citizens who are politically engaged have somewhat idealistic expectations of a rapid transformation of the country
[normal]. They
[normal] expect marked and immediate improvements in political and economic development
[normal]:
[normal] they want to see significant reform soon
[normal],
[normal] and to see such reform deliver, and in addition to the redevelopment of a new national constitution, to see evidence of that delivery in ways 
[normal]that
[normal] impact their family and their communities. Many of these citizens and CSOs have been on the front
[normal] 
[normal]line in protests against the government and 
[normal]associated
[normal] 
[normal]cases of detention
[normal] and are 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]experienced advocates and campaigners
[normal];
[normal] it will be essential that they are not excluded in the development of a new Myanmar governance model and transition process. 
[normal]M
[normal]arginalization at this stage in the process could lead to some 
[normal]individuals and bodies 
[normal]opting out
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]thereby
[normal] threaten
[normal]ing
[normal] the legitimacy and progress achieved to date. This is particularly vital given the 
[normal]risk of frustration and disillusionment among
[normal] some citizens
[normal] who perceive
[normal] that the ‘opening up’ has not brought about substantial changes in their experience of government effectiveness and service delivery
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]such feelings
[normal] could quickly undermine the transition process. Furthermore, the 
[normal]National League for Democracy (
[normal]NLD
[normal])’s
[normal] success in the 2012 by-elections, gaining 43 of the 44 seats, while not representatively significant at national level, means that 
[normal]both 
[normal]the NLD 
[normal]and
[normal] the government will now be under scrutiny and more 
[normal]vulnerable
[normal] to criticism for any perceived lack of delivery at both national and local level. Across the country
[normal],
[normal] the formerly ruling 
[normal]State Peace and Development Council (
[normal]SPDC
[normal])
[normal] mechanisms at township and village level are no longer in place, and the role of local military commander
[normal]s
[normal] has been 
[normal]somewhat 
[normal]reduced. These 
[normal]are being
[normal] replaced
[normal], at least to begin with,
[normal] 
[normal]by
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]State Government Assembly 
[normal](
[normal]with limited funds
[normal])
[normal] and 
[normal]by
[normal] what 
[normal]are
[normal] expected 
[normal]to
[normal] be local
[normal]-
[normal]level councils in municipalities. But with all local revenue returned to central government and very limited fiscal transfers, there are questions as to 
[normal]the extent to which
[normal] these structures will actually be able to exercise effective local governance. There are proposals to provide central grants to these newly elected local bodies
[normal],
[normal] although 
[normal]it
[normal] is 
[normal]not currently clear
[normal] what kind of funding would be made available to the State Assemblies
[normal].
[normal]3.6.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]In such scenarios, various groups, with their potential and capacity for a ‘quick fix’ at local level, present credible alternatives to elected bodies and 
[normal]to 
[normal]more deliberative governance processes, 
[normal]which can be slow and unwieldy.
[normal] 
[normal]This will
[normal],
[normal] at 
[normal]least,
[normal] require a consensual 
[normal](
[normal]if no
[normal]t
[normal] participat
[normal]ory)
[normal] approach and outcome, between citizens and government but also among the various interest groups which make up the Union of Myanmar. Such consensus cannot be assumed in a society that is divided by ethnic 
[normal]and religious 
[normal]divisions, and where access to and 
[normal]control of resources is often mediated via 
[normal]affiliation to
[normal] an ethnic 
[normal](
[normal]or other
[normal])
[normal] group and where identity politics shape political positioning. This 
[normal]situation was
[normal] exacerbated 
[normal]under
[normal] the political scenario 
[normal]that existed
[normal] 
[normal]until recently,
[normal] 
[normal]in which
[normal] the general perception and operating principle 
[normal]was
[normal] that such groups must fight their own corner in a zero-sum game.
[normal]3.7.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Finally, against this background, for many citizens and CSOs there is the 
[normal]spectre
[normal] 
[normal]that
[normal] individuals and groups 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]were
[normal] engaged in activities or dialogue with 
[normal]the 
[normal]government up until 2012
[normal] may now be perceived as
[normal] ‘tainted’ or too 
[normal]closely 
[normal]aligned with government figures. Such groups and individuals would argue
[normal],
[normal] of course
[normal],
[normal] that they have helped pave the way for the current ‘openness’ by engag
[normal]ing
[normal] government and others in those first tentative steps. However it
[normal] i
[normal]s also clear that international agencies will have to tread very carefully when selecting ‘partners’ on the ground, for fear of selecting either groups 
[normal]that
[normal] are marginalized and unacceptable to government, 
[normal]or
[normal] those 
[normal]that
[normal] have lost legitimacy with citizens and CSOs 
[normal]on account of their perceived ‘alignment’
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Effective local governance and reform of the public administration system 
[normal](
[normal]PAR
[normal])
[normal] in Myanmar is considered essential 
[normal]in
[normal] responding to citizen engagement, promoting social justice, maintaining momentum in the transition 
[normal]and 
[normal]promoting a just and lasting peace. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Strategic interventions around PAR and support to the set-up and reform of local government structures and process should therefore be considered a priority by 
[normal]DfID
[normal]. Given the highly centralised Ministry
[normal]-
[normal]driven local governance model, there is a need to at least align, if not integrate
[normal],
[normal] this decentralisation and PAR reform support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This support should be coupled with the exten
[normal]sion
[normal] of 
[normal]DfID’s
[normal] support through the 
[normal]Pyoe
[normal] Pin programme
[normal],
[normal] and an approach 
[normal]that
[normal] works through 
[normal]support to a
[normal] selection of specific issues 
[normal](
[normal]health, rural livelihoods
[normal],
[normal] etc
[normal].)
[normal] in order to help focus civic engagement and CSO development and locate efforts to support public administration and decentralisation reform. In this regard it will be important to consider funding a wide range of CS partners
[normal], incorporating
[normal] both capacity development and project implementation funds
[normal],
[normal] under a single programme.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cord is proposing 
[normal]a
[normal] tripartite 
[normal](
[normal]local 
[normal]g
[normal]overnance/PAR/
[normal]c
[normal]ivic 
[normal]e
[normal]ngagement
[normal])
[normal] strategic 
[normal]s
[normal]ocial 
[normal]a
[normal]ccountability approach based on its commitment to 
[normal]peacebuilding
[normal],
[normal] as well as its experience in Myanmar and learning from a number of other contexts in the region. For example, in a number of governance reform 
[normal]programmes
[normal] in the region, development partner support has typically been focused either on technical reform of the state bureaucracy
[normal],
[normal] which was viewed as ‘supply-side
[normal]’
[normal] governance, or on the 
[normal]empowerment of civil society and civil society 
[normal]organisations
[normal] to ‘demand’ increased democracy and/or improved governance. Generally speaking, the ‘supply
[normal]-
[normal]side’ approach has involved the strengthening of accountability through the development of institutions of government such as the electoral system, parliament and its politicians, the executive and public administration
[normal],
[normal] and the strengthening of sub-national governance and national governance institutions which support and enable it. The ‘demand’ side
[normal],
[normal] on the other hand, has tended to focus on the involvement of a wide range of civil society groups, associations, citizens and 
[normal]organisations
[normal] in pressurizing government to improve its performance and allow citizens a greater role in policy development, for example.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, a range of practitioners and academics have in recent years offered a critique of such disaggregated models and have instead suggested developing a more integrated range of approaches 
[normal]aimed at
[normal] addressing both the ‘demand’ and ‘supply’ side
[normal]s
[normal] of governance. This critique of ‘one-sided’ or ‘unbalanced’ approaches by practitioners and policy makers has led to the development of a range of Social Accountability 
[normal](
[normal]S.Ac
[normal])
[normal] models, tools and approaches
[normal],
[normal] many of which have been tested at local level across the 
[normal]South East
[normal] Asia
[normal]n
[normal] region
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given the local governance and civic engagement challenges described above, such an understanding should underpin the development of 
[normal]DfID
[normal]’
[normal]s
[normal] strategy in Myanmar
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]aimed at achieving
[normal] effective democratic governance
[normal],
[normal] coupled with accountability
[normal],
[normal] through citizen engagement in multi-stakeholder dialogue with government at local level and national level. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This can be achieved through the development of innovative 
[normal]s
[normal]ocial 
[normal]a
[normal]ccountability and dialogue methodologies focused on 
[normal]tackling both 
[normal]the challenges for communities at local and district level in Myanmar
[normal] and
[normal] the real structural and capacity challenges faced by local government and national level ministries. It is 
[normal]recommended
[normal] that 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK
[normal]Aid
[normal] support initiatives 
[normal]that
[normal] pilot an approach which 
[normal]a) 
[normal]brings diverse stakeholders together at local level
[normal];
[normal] and, 
[normal]b) 
[normal]through a carefully structured and facilitated capacity development and dialogue process, assist
[normal]s
[normal] them to collectively deliberate, build consensus and take action to address these challenges in practical and realistic ways. 
[normal]These initiatives should
[normal] also seek to link such participation and dialogue mechanisms with institutional and capacity development in local government in order to respond to such engagement
[normal],
[normal] and with national 
[normal]m
[normal]inistry-level reform. 
[normal]They
[normal] will need to include both extensive institutional development support at national level
[normal],
[normal] and capacity development on structuring dialogue and accountability mechanisms and processes between government 
[normal](
[normal]at the central and local levels
[normal])
[normal] and civil society. Such dialogue will necessarily require investment in a joint knowledge base among government and civil society over critical issues in Myanmar.
