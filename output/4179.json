"&#xa0;\nAFS0014Evidence Submitted by Mrs. A. Underwood.&#xa0;\nThis is to alert the Committee to the way that the Department of Education appears to be \nmis\n-using Clause C of the new Growth and Infrastructure Law to impose the Free Schools where they are not needed on Greenbelt land which is deemed unsuitable for purpose by the District Planning Committee.   In particular, this is evident with reference to Pioneer House in Stoke \nPoges\n, South Bucks.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
