"&#xa0;\nHealth and Safety Executive â€“ written evidence&#xa0;\nThe policy objective behind this proposal is to deliver Professor Lofstedt's recommendation by exempting those self-employed who pose no potential risk of harm to others.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIf the proposal is accepted, Section 3(2) of Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (1974 Act)\n&#xa0;\nwill\n&#xa0;\nread:\n&#xa0;\n(2) It shall be the duty of every self-employed person who conducts a relevant undertaking to conduct the undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that he and other persons (not being his employees) who may be affected thereby are not thereby exposed to risks to their health and safety.\n(2A) For the purposes of subsection (2), an undertaking is a relevant undertaking if -\n(a) it is of a prescribed description, or\n(b) persons who may be affected by the way it is conducted, other than the person conducting it (or his employees), could thereby be exposed to risks to their health and safety.\n&#xa0;\nThe\n&#xa0;\nconsultation received responses from the following self-employed persons who classed themselves as businesses:\n&#xa0;\nFarmer\nLighting cameraman\nNurseryman\nTree Surgeon\nDirector of an explosive company\n&#xa0;\nAll the above have the potential to cause harm to others so, even if they are not undertakings of a prescribed description, they would not be exempt from the law because of the provision in&#xa0;&#xa0;s3(2A)(b) above. In other&#xa0;&#xa0;words the duty can still apply if not on the prescribed list. For clarity purposes the Government\n&#xa0;\nis\n&#xa0;\n seeking a delegated power for the Secretary of State to maintain existing safeguards and protections\n&#xa0;\nfor those self-employed who conduct their work in high hazard or high risk activities eg construction.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis will be achieved through Regulations.\n&#xa0;\n The Government intend to consult further on the prescribed list but\n&#xa0;\nagriculture and explosives are currently proposed\n&#xa0;\nand consequently\n&#xa0;\nself-employed persons working in those sectors would not be exempt .\n&#xa0;\nFor those occupations who don't fall into the prescribed list and\n&#xa0;\nshould\n&#xa0;\nnot be\n&#xa0;\nexempt we will provide guidance. (eg the lighting cameraman's work could affect others by trailing cables creating trip hazards or unsecured lights falling on others).\n&#xa0;\nIt is recognised that workers in some occupations pose a risk of harm to others only at certain times.\n&#xa0;\n On practical grounds\n&#xa0;\nit was decided that only those self-employed persons whose work activities would not be expected to put others at risk at any point in the normal course of their work would be exempt, except, if they work in prescribed high hazard\n&#xa0;\nor\n&#xa0;\nhigh risk activities where all workers irrespective of their activity will not be exempt.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSarah Wadham\nHM Inspector of Health and Safety\nOperational Strategy, Enforcement and Accountability Unit\nHealth and Safety Executive \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
