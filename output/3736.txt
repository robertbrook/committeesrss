[[[David Peck – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I am particularly concerned about some clauses in the bill regarding rights of way.&#xa0;As a regular walker in the Peak District I am distressed at the damage, erosion, noise and general annoyance caused by ‘off roaders’ ie motor cycles and 4 wd vehicles using the ancient tracks and byways.  This is a very serious problem.&#xa0;Off roaders claim that they are permitted to use UUCR’s (green lanes) and BOAT’s (by-ways open to all traffic) without any regard to the effect this has on the countryside or the enjoyment of the majority of people using the countryside.&#xa0;These ancient tracks and byways may historically have been used for wheeled vehicles – and their continued use for agricultural vehicles is reasonable – but they were not built or ever intended to be used by mechanical vehicles and the state of many of them is now deplorable.&#xa0;I strongly support any measure that would&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Yours sincerely&#xa0;David Peck&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;27 August 2013&#xa0;
