[normal]Government
[normal] Spending Reviews
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]RECOMMENDATION 1: Committee inquiry on science spending[bold]Government should produce a plan o
[normal]utlining how it will support
[normal] science in the long-term. Th
[normal]is
[normal] should incorporate spending decisions on all elements of publicly funded research including infrastructure
[normal]. This will help provide certainty for future funding decisions by both commercial and non
[normal]-commercial funders. Medical research in particular is a long-term endeavour that requires sustained and stable funding in order for basic research to be translated into technologies that benefit patients. It can take decades for medical research to develo
[normal]p into treatments, much longer than the 4-5 year spending review periods that Government currently adopts. The Committee should investigate the merits of such a plan and advise on 
[normal]possible content and 
[normal]a suitable length.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]RECOMMENDATION 2: Committee [bold]inquiry into the distribution of the current science budget[bold]The academic and charitable sector welcomed the Government’s announcements of a flat cash settlement in the 2013 spending review. How money is allocated within the science ring fence will be of pa
[normal]rticular interest to the sector
[normal],
[normal] including how the outcome of the research councils’ triennial review affects the settlement. 
[normal] Investigating
[normal] how to effectively allocate the science budget could be a potentially useful inquiry for the science and technology
[normal] committee.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Comments on the NAO report
[normal]The following section contrasts the findings of the NAO report with Cancer Research UK’s ex
[normal]perience of funding UK research.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Diversity of funding
[normal]“
[normal]Wholly independent and self-sufficient medical research initiatives are rare. Arguably all research activity depends, to a greater 
[normal]or lesser extent, on other parts of the total medical research “ecology” in the UK, and in many cases, internationally. 
[normal]For example, universities conducting charity-funded projects also receive infrastructure support from the public sector through QR and t
[normal]he CRSF.”

[normal]RECOMMENDATION 3[bold] Committee inquiry on diversity of funding[bold]The NAO report highlights the importance of the Not
[normal]-f
[normal]or
[normal]-
[normal]Profit sector in the UK research environment. 
[normal]We know that the diversity of funding is a unique element to the UK and brings about signifi
[normal]cant advantages.
[normal] 
[normal]The Committee may wish to consider an inquiry into the relationship between Government, industry and Not
[normal]-f
[normal]or
[normal]-
[normal]Profits for the R&amp;D in the UK and whether there are any additional measures that Government could be taking to ensure that 
[normal]collaboration takes place and that Not
[normal]–f
[normal]or
[normal]-
[normal]Profits can invest their money most effectively.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]RECOMMENDATION 4: Committee inquiry on higher education R&amp;D spending[bold]The NAO report outlines the real term
[normal]s
[normal] decrease in public sector spending in research in Hi
[normal]gher Education Institutes. The committee could consider reviewing the impact of 
[normal]Government
[normal] investment in higher education R&amp;D and look at the possible outcomes for increasing or decreasing investment in these areas
[normal], especially the knock on effects for inve
[normal]stment by commercial and non-commercial entities
[normal].
