default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION 1: Committee inquiry on science spendingdefaultGovernment should produce a plan o
defaultutlining how it will support
default science in the long-term. Th
defaultis
default should incorporate spending decisions on all elements of publicly funded research including infrastructure
default. This will help provide certainty for future funding decisions by both commercial and non
default-commercial funders. Medical research in particular is a long-term endeavour that requires sustained and stable funding in order for basic research to be translated into technologies that benefit patients. It can take decades for medical research to develo
defaultp into treatments, much longer than the 4-5 year spending review periods that Government currently adopts. The Committee should investigate the merits of such a plan and advise on 
defaultpossible content and 
defaulta suitable length.
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION 2: Committee defaultinquiry into the distribution of the current science budgetdefaultThe academic and charitable sector welcomed the Government’s announcements of a flat cash settlement in the 2013 spending review. How money is allocated within the science ring fence will be of pa
defaultrticular interest to the sector
default,
default including how the outcome of the research councils’ triennial review affects the settlement. 
default Investigating
default how to effectively allocate the science budget could be a potentially useful inquiry for the science and technology
default committee.
default&#xa0;defaultComments on the NAO report
defaultThe following section contrasts the findings of the NAO report with Cancer Research UK’s ex
defaultperience of funding UK research.
default&#xa0;defaultDiversity of funding
default“
defaultWholly independent and self-sufficient medical research initiatives are rare. Arguably all research activity depends, to a greater 
defaultor lesser extent, on other parts of the total medical research “ecology” in the UK, and in many cases, internationally. 
defaultFor example, universities conducting charity-funded projects also receive infrastructure support from the public sector through QR and t
defaulthe CRSF.”

defaultRECOMMENDATION 3default Committee inquiry on diversity of fundingdefaultThe NAO report highlights the importance of the Not
default-f
defaultor
default-
defaultProfit sector in the UK research environment. 
defaultWe know that the diversity of funding is a unique element to the UK and brings about signifi
defaultcant advantages.
default 
defaultThe Committee may wish to consider an inquiry into the relationship between Government, industry and Not
default-f
defaultor
default-
defaultProfits for the R&amp;D in the UK and whether there are any additional measures that Government could be taking to ensure that 
defaultcollaboration takes place and that Not
default–f
defaultor
default-
defaultProfits can invest their money most effectively.  
default&#xa0;
defaultRECOMMENDATION 4: Committee inquiry on higher education R&amp;D spendingdefaultThe NAO report outlines the real term
defaults
default decrease in public sector spending in research in Hi
defaultgher Education Institutes. The committee could consider reviewing the impact of 
defaultGovernment
default investment in higher education R&amp;D and look at the possible outcomes for increasing or decreasing investment in these areas
default, especially the knock on effects for inve
defaultstment by commercial and non-commercial entities
default.
