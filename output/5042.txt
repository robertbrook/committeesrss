&#xa0;Written evidence from the West Yorkshire Police and Crime Panel [PCC Progress 32]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The West Yorkshire Police and Crime Panel covers the five West Yorkshire Districts of:  the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council; the Metropolitan Borough Council of Calderdale; the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees; Leeds City Council and the City of Wakefield Metropolitan District Council. 1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Committee’s inquiry.   We feel well-placed to comment on the lines of inquiry identified by the Committee as a result of the unique combination of police and crime challenges facing West Yorkshire and in light of the Panel’s achievements over the last 15 months:1.2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The first Panel to meet formally following a period of intensive preparation;1.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One of the most active Panels in the country, having met 11 times in its first year and undertaken further development activities;  1.2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Developed a structured way of working with the CSPs and Scrutiny Committees which has been drawn-upon in other areas; 1.2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The first Panel to have devised a scrutiny and support framework for directing its work and using ‘rapporteur’ roles to help Panel Members gain deeper, specialist knowledge; 1.2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The first Panel to meet with HMIC to learn more about respective roles and triangulation of information, in light of findings that the West Yorkshire Force was one of only two large forces that were poorly positioned to respond to continued austerity measures; 1.2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Addressed a series of high-profile police and crime issues of public interest alongside the the Police and Crime Commissioner including: the implications of the Savile abuse scandal; questions of trust from the Hillsborough tragedy and the safe hosting of the Grand Départ Yorkshire; and,   1.2.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The first Panel to produce an Annual Report to account for its work to the constituent authorities and local residents.  1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Panel would be pleased to further support the Committee’s work by providing oral evidence if required. &#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Before explaining how the Panel has held the Commissioner to account, we should reflect our interpretation of the role of the PCC.  It is, by design and like many public roles, two-dimensional: to be the electorate’s representative in the local policing service and to be the public face of policing in local communities.  The Panel’s role is thus to scrutinise and support the PCC in how he or she balances these roles effectively.   We are absolutely clear that it is not our job to decide if the PCC is doing a good job; the electorate will have its say.  The Panel’s role is to look into the decisions taken by the PCC and ensure that the public has access to information to make its choice. &#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The legislative role of Police and Crime Panels includes very specific requirements. For each example, we have tried to provide brief comment about the value that we or others feel has been added.  During the past 12 months, the Panel has:&#xa0;

[[[Convened two Sub-Panels to consider complaints matters]]]&#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, the legislation also provides scope for panels to “review or scrutinise decisions made, or other action taken, by the relevant Police and Crime Commissioner in connection with the discharge of the Commissioner’s functions”.  We feel this is important for three reasons as it provides for the opportunity for Panels to add greatest value to the governance of policing and crime reduction:&#xa0;2.3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In provides for Panels to play important roles in ensuring that the 

[[[strategic direction of all partners relates to common goals]]] expressed in the Police and Crime Plan.  This rests on the Panel’s work on local policing priorities and its links to Community Safety Partnerships and local Scrutiny Committees, as explained in more detail in section 3 below.  In addition, however, the Panel has also been greatly encouraged by how the PCC and other partners, including from local criminal justice agencies, have shown a commitment to work together to deliver the Police and Crime Plan. 2.3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Panel is able to 

[[[support the PCC make the strategic links]]] with local authorities.  In practice, the Panel Chair briefs Council Leaders on significant issues in order that they are aware of contextual information, and any concerns or views the Panel has, so that Leaders’ work with the PCC is as constructive and informed as possible. 2.3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire has a total budget of approaching £2bn during a full term of office.  Where major policy positions are decided upon, the 

[[[Panel can ask the PCC to explain why ]]]

[[[a decision was taken]]] and what the expected implications might be.  Although currently the Panel has been disappointed that the online record of the PCC’s decisions has been regularly out-of-date, we look forward to this being rectified in future in the interests of public accountability. 2.3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A good example of this discretionary work in action was the PCC’s response to a critical report by HMIC in July 2013.  The Panel took the initiative to meet with HMIC Inspectors to fully understand the context and future implications of the work.  In responding to the report,  the Police and Crime Commissioner has assured the Panel that, in his reviews with the Chief Constable, he will seek improvement plans in respect of not only burglary but rape, serious sexual assaults and other areas where West Yorkshire is at the low end nationally amongst its group of similar forces.2.4              Well-informed scrutiny and support is crucial.  Therefore, the Panel has been very pleased at the Police and Crime Commissioner’s strong and proactive stance in raising with the Home Secretary and Office for National Statistics, concerns about the restrictions on publishing timely information on crime trends and comparative performance.  Currently, the Panel and PCC are only able to use comparative data that is between three and six months old.  The Panel feels frustrated that it is not able to give the public of West Yorkshire the up-to-date position and we would urge the Committee to support the collective work of the Panel and PCC for West Yorkshire to broker a better approach nationally. &#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Panel has excellent links with local Community Safety Partnerships and Crime and Disorder Scrutiny Committees.  These relationship are underpinned by Principles of Engagement and, in a practical sense, local partners provide a quarterly ‘Local Perspective’.  This highlights areas where the PCC is working well with local partners and has provided real evidence that they and the PCC have regard to each other’s priorities. &#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  In a very practical sense, the Panel has raised important issues on the PCC’s approach to commissioning and supported his pass-porting of funding for community safety and crime prevention work until October 2014. On behalf of partners, the Panel has urged the PCC to share, and consult on his emerging commissioning framework for activity beyond October 2014, at the earliest possible opportunity.   &#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is through the ‘Local Perspectives’ process that the Panel has noted and supported the PCC on the significant commitment he has shown to get out and engage with community groups, partners and residents across West Yorkshire.  The Panel feels this is crucial for him to be able to understand and promote local policing priorities. &#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Panel has also supported the PCC in his commitment to refresh the Police and Crime Plan for West Yorkshire, underpinned by a major ‘Listening to You’ consultation exercise. &#xa0;3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An annual meeting of the Panel with CSP and Scrutiny Committee chairs also allows partners to identify where learning can be shared and joint or coordinated work undertaken.  Following the meeting in July 2013, CSPs have shared information and approaches on common issues including a pilot Restorative Justice project in Bradford and approaches to tackling domestic violence in Leeds.  Similarly, the Scrutiny Committees agreed to undertake a coordinated exercise about the roles of, and local authority contributions to, PCSOs in West Yorkshire.  All of these measures have helped provide decision-makers at the appropriate level with better information about how they can help deliver the outcomes in the Police and Crime Plan. &#xa0;4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Police and Crime Commissioner has over £400m per year to spend on making people in West Yorkshire safer and feeling safer.  The majority of this is delegated to West Yorkshire Police and under the control of the Chief Constable, with the remainder spent on community safety projects that help prevent crime, support victims and achieve the other priorities within the Police and Crime Plan.&#xa0;4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Panel’s role is to scrutinise and support the Police and Crime Commissioner’s decisions about the use of resources in West Yorkshire.  Over the last 12 months, we have:&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It’s good news that crime in West Yorkshire is falling and the Panel recognises the vital role played by those who work in our local communities to make them safer.  The Panel feels it would be helpful for residents to have clearer milestones and contextual information to allow them to reach their own judgements about the Police and Crime Commissioner’s progress.&#xa0;5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The PCC holds fortnightly Community Outcome meetings with the Chief Constable, which is the principal route by which he is held to account.  The Panel understands its role to be to ask the PCC to explain how he has ensured that the Chief Constable is ensuring the outcomes in the Police and Crime Plan are achieved.  This includes priorities the PCC has identified alongside the Chief Constable to focus on; the evidence that has been used to identify those priorities and what tangible improvements the PCC and Chief Constable expect to see. &#xa0;5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Panel also seeks to understand how the PCC and Chief Constable respond to financial information about the Force’s Programme of Change and its overarching budgetary position. Again, the Panel looks to triangulate information from meetings with evidence from the OPCC or external partners like HMIC.  &#xa0;6.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As Forces across Yorkshire and the Humber move to a new model of regional collaboration through a ‘lead force’ model rather than a collective resource, the Panel will look for evidence that the PCC is holding the Chief Constable to account for those areas where West Yorkshire leads, and to make sure that local residents are being well-served on issues that are led by colleagues elsewhere. &#xa0;6.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Police and Crime Panel has made contact with other Panels across Yorkshire and the Humber to explore the appetite for sharing lessons and information about the collaborative activities.&#xa0;6.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Collaborative arrangements with other local partners such as local authorities have been discussed in other sections.&#xa0;7.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Panel has taken interest in the division of functions and staff through the Stage 2 transfer.  Keen to undertake as much of its work as possible in public, the Panel was keen to look into the agreed Stage 2 process at its meeting on 13th December.  However, to our knowledge the Home Office’s response to the local proposal was not received within the indicated timeframe of the end of November. &#xa0;7.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Panel remains keen to look into the agreed position in a public setting at the earliest opportunity.  &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]8.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Panel has a Memorandum of Understanding with the PCC on the sharing of information and respective roles on detailed processes like complaints.   After one year of operation, this is under review based on the experience of the last 12 months and will also take the opportunity to clarify the nature, quantity and format of information required by the Panel to enable it to exercise its role effectively. &#xa0;8.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Broadly, the Panel is pleased with the PCC’s commitment to place information onto his website that is not classified as Restricted.  Whilst further work is needed for this to always be up-to-date, we are confident that learning and better working practices after the Stage 2 transfer will help.  The Panel feels that by the PCC publishing a clear forward plan and more up-to-date information, the Panel’s scrutiny and support role might become even more effective.   &#xa0;8.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Panel would also reiterate to the Committee the transparency and reporting issues it raised in point 2.4 about the inability to use comparative iQuanta information in a timely manner. &#xa0;
