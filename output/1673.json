All three components use proven technologies that have been demonstrated independently in different industries. The three have not yet been implemented together in an end-to-end system in the power sector.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n              \nIn\n this submission, we have concentrated on CCS in the context of power generation because that is the scope set out by the ECC Committee in its call for evidence.  Once proven, CCS will be applicable to industries other than power generation, thus allowing \ncuts in CO\n2\n emissions that could not readily be achieved otherwise.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nAll of the CCS technologies currently available will impose an efficiency penalty, effectively requiring approximately 10-15% more fuel to be burned in gas-fired power plants and 20-25\n% in coal-fired power plants to produce the same amount of electricity.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n              \nThe key barrier for CCS technology is that, to date, there have been insufficient economic reasons for companies to develop and implement it or even to undertake the demonstrations\n necessary to bring the technology to maturity.\nWhat types of CCS technology are currently being developed and how do they differ from one another? &#xa0;\n7.\n              \nThe three main components of CCS are capture, transport and storage. \n \nAll three use proven technologi\nes that have been demonstrated independently in different industries. \n \nThe three have not yet been implemented together in an end-to-end \nsystem\n \nin the power sector.\n&#xa0;\nCarbon Capture Technologies\n&#xa0;\n8.\n              \nThere are three principal methods of carbon capture\n:\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPre-combustion: carbon is removed from the fuel prior to combustion so that the exhaust is essentially carbon-free;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPost-combustion: carbon dioxide is removed from the plant exhaust after combustion;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOxy-fuel: the fuel is burnt in pure oxygen resulting in \na high concentration of carbon dioxide in the exhaust so it can be removed more easily. (If the fuel is burnt normally in air, the exhaust contains a large amount of nitrogen from the air, meaning that there is a greater volume of gas to treat, making remo\nval more difficult.)\n&#xa0;\n9.\n              \nPre-combustion processes are suitable for new construction, which fits the situation for coal generation in the UK, where new plants would replace existing coal plants that are all quite old and relatively inefficient by modern sta\nndards.  Post-combustion (and potentially oxy-fuel) is suitable for retrofit to existing coal and gas plants as well as new build.  There are numerous available reports that provide additional details on these three technologies, providing a comparison of \ncosts, efficiencies and trade-offs.\n  \n&#xa0;\n10.\n              \nIt is important to note that all of the technologies currently available will impose an efficiency penalty, effectively requiring approximately 20-25% more coal or 10-15% more natural gas to be burned to produce \nthe same amount of electricity.  The reason for this is the high energy consumption of the carbon capture stage of the process at the power station site.  Approximately twice as much CO\n2\n \nis produced and therefore \nhas to be captured per unit of electricity \ngenerated when using coal compared with using gas.\n&#xa0;\n11.\n              \nEach technology has a number of potential variations and there are a number of promising refinements. \n \nFor example, alternative absorption materials for post-combustion capture may offer significant f\nuture reductions in the inherent efficiency penalty associated with \nCO\n2\n capture.\n&#xa0;\n12.\n              \nWe would suggest that narrowing the UK focus to one particular technology (either pre- or post-combustion, or oxy-fuel) would not be beneficial, as different generation \nplants will benefit from different capture technologies: new construction is likely to be most relevant for coal in the UK, while natural gas plants, if built in quantity to meet a shortfall in generation, could have more potential for retrofit.\n&#xa0;\nTransport\n and Storage Technologies\n&#xa0;\n13.\n              \nCarbon dioxide transport is a mature technology following decades of operation for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications in the US and more recently for offshore storage in the North Sea.  Onshore \nCO\n2\n transport has been pr\nincipally for EOR away from centres of \npopulation.  There are potential concerns over safety should a pipeline rupture occur close to a population centre and these need to be addressed and managed (See Question 5 for further discussion of safety)\n.\n&#xa0;\n14.\n              \nLon\ng-term storage is less well developed with only a small number of reference sites. For example, Norway has been injecting approximately 1mt of \nCO\n2\n a year into the North Sea at Sleipner since 1996. \n \nWe would suggest that exploration and proving trials for \noffshore UK storage sites are accelerated to ensure that this part of the chain is fully developed.\n&#xa0;What contribution could CCS make towards the UK’s decarbonisation targets? Are the UK Government’s expectations reasonable in this regard?&#xa0;\n15.\n              \nProviding a\nll the decarbonised electricity required to meet the carbon reduction targets for the electricity sector using a combination of renewables and nuclear power alone would be logistically demanding and costly, even with significant demand reduction through en\nergy efficiency and the active management of peak demand.  All these technologies carry development and deployment risk, as well as economic risk, which makes a wider portfolio of options highly desirable.\n&#xa0;\n16.\n              \nIn all global scenarios and modelling through\n to 2050 that we have seen, fossil fuel generation sources will be essential to meet overall energy demands.  In order to meet EU and UK carbon reduction targets and global needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we believe fossil fuel generation will ne\ned to decarbonise through the application of CCS.\n&#xa0;\n17.\n              \nThe 2010 Royal Academy of Engineering report \nGenerating the Future\n \no\nutlined four energy scenarios that could meet the 2050 emission reduction target. \n \nIn all scenarios there is contribution from CCS i\nn order to meet the UK’s 80% reduction target.\n \n Only the \n“\nhigh demand reduction\n”\n scenario shows a limited deployment of CCS and the report did not recommend implementing a policy based on this scenario. \n \nThe report highlighted the urgent need to progress a\n full suite of low carbon technologies if we are to meet the targets. \n&#xa0;\n18.\n              \nThe government’s expectations to achieve a largely decarbonised electricity sector by 2050 are reasonable as a largely decarbonised electricity sector, consisting of nuclear, \nrenewables and CCS, combined with energy storage and demand response, is technically achievable.  It is difficult to estimate the cost of achieving this and we may find over the timeframe we are reviewing, one or two new technologies appear and/or existing\n technologies achieve a step change in cost/performance.  In addition, technologies currently favoured may hit barriers in development or deployment and become less significant than currently predicted.\n&#xa0;\n19.\n              \nThe DECC July 2013 levelised cost forecasts for \ngeneration technology projects commissioning around 2025\n show coal and gas generation equipped with CCS and renewables to be at a similar cost (within margins of error to be expected over this planning horizon). \n \nThere are some indications that the cost o\nf renewables will fall below the estimates of coal and gas with CCS towards the end of the 2020s but this is difficult to predict and depends on fuel price expectations and anticipated advances in the efficiency of renewables delivery.\n \n We believe that CCS\n could potentially become economically viable over this period alongside other low carbon technologies, assuming demonstration proves successful and decarbonisation targets are not relaxed.\n&#xa0;\n20.\n              \nThere are further potential CCS applications in industry (suc\nh as refining, cement, iron and steel production) that could materially contribute to the UK meeting decarbonisation targets.\n&#xa0;\n21.\n              \nIn the longer term, once CCS has been developed and proven, it has the potential to create “negative” carbon emissions by bei\nng applied to power stations fuelled by biomass from sustainable sources.  This is potentially an important capability because it could theoretically be used to offset the carbon emissions from applications where it is hard to imagine replacing unabated fo\nssil fuels, such as aviation.  A number of respected analysts including the Energy Technologies Institute see this as an important part of decarbonising by 2050.\n&#xa0;Are there any potential benefits (e.g. the ability to export CCS technology abroad) of successfully developing CCS to the UK economy and, if so, what are they?&#xa0;\nCommercial benefits:\n&#xa0;\n22.\n              \nThe main benefit of CCS is that it offers a means of decarbonising fossil fuels, which are a stable, reliable and proven generation source.  On a global basis\n,\n fossil fuel generation will continue to be a major part of the energy mix. \n \nRecent trends show the developing economies of the world largely powering their economies through coal and gas fired electricity generation, and fossil fuels for transportation.\n&#xa0;\n23.\n              \nThere exists the opportunity for the UK to design, develop and implement \nworld\n-\nleading CCS projects.\n \n Research is underway at UK universities that may lead to valuable IP which could be exploited on a global scale.  However, much of the work to be don\ne is industrial, moving from pilot scale, through to demonstration in large-scale projects. \n \nThis could provide commercial opportunity for a number of UK companies involved, some of which are conducting world-leading large pilot demonstrations, such as Doo\nsan Babcock at Renfrew, Glasgow.  We would expect to see economic value throughout the supply chain and the creation of jobs that would have value, but this would depend on the UK’s success in this activity versus global competitors.\n&#xa0;\n24.\n              \nSuccessful demons\ntration of CCS in the UK could kick start the technology elsewhere and create first mover advantage.  We would however caution that a number of countries have also invested in CCS research, development and deployment, particularly Canada, the USA, Norway a\nnd China, and first mover advantage will need effort to be gained and sustained.  One area where the UK may be more likely to gain competitive advantage could be the application of CCS on \ngas\n-\nfired plant, which seems likely to be a major part of the UK’s r\nequirements.  Most other countries are focusing on CCS on \ncoal\n-\nfired plant.\n&#xa0;\n25.\n              \nThe potential benefits of exporting know-how does, however, depend on a continuing and increasing global response to addressing climate change, which is not certain at this st\nage.\n&#xa0;\nDiversity and flexibility:\n&#xa0;\n26.\n              \nCCS power generation offers advantages as part of a diverse energy mix in that it could be deployed at scale with an established fuel supply chain. \n \nCCS can be combined with flexible generation plant (such as combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT)), which is needed for grid balancing.  Once proven, it is likely that CCS-equipped power stations would evolve to be specified for flexible operation to obtain th\ne greatest benefit from the technology.  Most analysts believe that such power stations would be cost-competitive with nuclear and \nrenewables once deployed at scale, subject to demonstration and continued commitment to carbon targets and supporting price/r\negulatory mechanisms.\n&#xa0;\nDisadvantages:\n&#xa0;\n27.\n              \nThe disadvantages are the continued dependence on fossil fuel (and therefore world fuel prices), concerns over security of supply, and integrity of the permanent storage.  In the shorter term, a further disadvanta\nge is the large adverse impact on power station thermal efficiency which, in today’s world of low carbon prices, makes CCS appear only to add cost and degrade performance.  However, this situation should not last if the world becomes serious about abating \nclimate change.\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome? &#xa0;\nEconomic\n&#xa0;\n28.\n              \nThe key barrier for CCS is \nthat a mechanism is required to create an economic driver as CCS adds costs without any direct economic benefit.  In the UK, we have legislated for our 2050 GHG targets and as a consequence have developed economic incentives to ensure that these are achiev\ned.  These comprise the carbon price floor which penalises plant that emits carbon and therefore will give CCS technology a cost advantage.  However, the main mechanism is a long term Contract for Difference (CfD) which would need to be negotiated with gov\nernment. We support the recommendations from the CCS Cost Reduction Task Force Report\n that we need make progress here to ensure that funding mechanisms are ﬁt-for-purpose and that the contracts are bankable. \n&#xa0;\n29.\n              \nIt is difficult to comment internationall\ny other than the same principles would need to apply, i.e. GHG targets supplemented by incentives to ensure they are achieved.\n&#xa0;\n30.\n              \nPlease see also the response to Question 1.\n&#xa0;\nPolitical\n&#xa0;\n31.\n              \nGovernment action to fund the first project as soon as possible would strengthen the UK’s pathway to decarbonising its fossil fuel generation (and assist with decarbonisation of other heavy industry outside of power generation) in order that CCS can be pro\nven and applied to the rest of the fossil fuel generation mix (and other industrial sources). \n \nWithout it, it is difficult to see how the UK will decarbonise its electricity system and industrial sectors to meet the targets.\n \n The danger in not having demon\nstration projects operational that prove the technology is that commitment to achieving the country’s carbon reduction targets may begin to erode.\n&#xa0;\nRegulatory\n&#xa0;\n32.\n              \nThere are safety risks in the construction and operation of CCS, as there are with any \nlarge-scale enterprise, which will require analysis, mitigation and the development of appropriate regulation.  These are discussed further in our response to Q5.\n&#xa0;\n33.\n              \nThe UK has not yet addressed the legal framework around \nCO\n2\n disposal and sequestration offshore but it is a significant issue.  A key issue will be to put in place an effective commercial and regulatory structure. \n \nThese (and more) questions need to be answered before investors would start to invest:\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWill a monop\noly \nCO\n2\n network be a regulated industry, like National Grid? \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWill the reservoirs be owned by a monopoly state organisation or will there be a competitive market in which reservoir owners bid to \npower stations to take their \nCO\n2\n?\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWho will regulate this mark\net?\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat is the role of The Crown Estate? Who will issue licences to sequester carbon?\n&#xa0;\nScientific\n&#xa0;\n34.\n              \nThe storage component has some geological integrity risks to be addressed.  We are not able to comment on the permanent integrity of geological sequestr\nation for saline aquifers or depleted oilfields, but would suggest opinion is best sought from the British Geological Survey and academic researchers in that area.\n&#xa0;\nTechnology\n&#xa0;\n35.\n              \nThe greatest technology challenges are around improving the efficiency of the capture process, which typically requires 10-15% (for gas) and 20-25% (for coal) more fuel to be burned for the same electrical output.  The cost associated with this is the larg\nest contributor to the overall cost of CCS. \n \nThe process will typically sequestrate 85% of the \nCO\n2\n typically produced, rising to 90% predicted by 2020. \n \nThere is opportunity for technology development to improve that level, which if coupled with a high car\nbon price, could also improve the economics.  There are technologies in the research stage that show promise in these areas.\n&#xa0;\n36.\n              \nThe other key challenges are pulling together several technologies, all of which may have been demonstrated in different appli\ncations but which have yet to be integrated with a large power station (either new or being retrofitted), a network of new \nCO\n2\n pipelines and various storage reservoirs – probably mainly offshore. \n \nThe systems engineering and project engineering of all this\n and its control systems, while essentially routine, is distinctly “non-trivial” and is something that is likely to be developed over the first half-dozen projects.\n&#xa0;\nSocial\n&#xa0;\n37.\n              \nThere is further work to do on public outreach to ensure the safety and storage integrity components are fully understood by key stakeholders. \n \nConsiderable public resistance to CCS has been seen in Europe, but there the permanent underground \nCO\n2\n storage w\nas planned to be onshore.\n \n The UK’s intention to store \nCO\n2\n in saline aquifers offshore should ease the public concern. \n \nWe suggest thorough public engagement on the benefits and risks of CCS.\n&#xa0;\n38.\n              \nAs with other new low-carbon technologies, costs will be hi\ngher than for current systems and public acceptance of this will be crucial.\n&#xa0;\nAre there any safety issues associated with capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide? How could they be overcome? Who should have responsibility for ensuring these activities are safe? &#xa0;\nCapture\n&#xa0;\n39.\n              \nCapture plant is standard i\nndustrial process technology.  \nThere are significant safety management issues but they should be wholly within the capabilities of a competent operator and would be regulated by the HSE in the normal way.\n&#xa0;\nTransport\n&#xa0;\n40.\n              \nCO\n2\n is inert but heavier than air, \nand in the event of an escape it will tend to settle at ground level and potentially expose people and animals in the area to risk of suffocation.  There are thus safety risks associated with accidental or malicious pipeline ruptures that will need to be a\nddressed and managed.  The Energy Institute has produced technical guidance\n \non how to manage the transport of \nCO\n2\n safely where there is increased population density.\n&#xa0;\n41.\n              \nSafety will be the prime responsibility of the asset owner, regulated by the HSE. \nRisks associated with a properly maintained and regulated CO2 pipeline transmission network should be seen in the context of other potentially hazardous operations such as transporting natural gas and ethylene, which are routinely carried out in the UK.\n&#xa0;\nS\ntorage\n&#xa0;\n42.\n              \nStorage facilities for the UK will be offshore, and will carry risks of offshore working as for offshore oil, but these should be manageable by a competent operator.  Studies of reservoir integrity will be an important part of the development o\nf sequestration sites, and we would not expect either seepage or sudden release of \nCO\n2\n from properly designed storage reservoirs.  Safety will be regulated by the HSE as for other offshore activities.\n&#xa0;\nHow have other countries incentivised CCS development? How successful have they been? How do they compare to the UK’s efforts? &#xa0;\n43.\n              \nThe Global CCS Institute (GCCSI) maintains a list of global projects and their status.\n In power generation applications there are demonstration projects in the ‘execute’ stage in USA and Canada.  Those at the ‘Define and Evaluate’ stage include Europe (10), US (5) and Canada (1).  In the US and Canada projects, the \nCO\n2\n will be used for enha\nnced oil recovery (EOR) rather than permanent storage. There are indications that China now has a major programme at the ‘identify and evaluate’ stage.  See Figure 1 for more details.\nFigure 1: Status of CCS Projects for Power Generation&#xa0;\nOperate\nExecute\nDefine\nEvaluate\nIdentify\nUK\n0\n0\n3 (Geo)\n1 (EOR)\n1 (Geo)\n1 (EOR)\nEurope (other than UK)\n0\n0\n4 (Geo)\n1 (Geo)\n0\nUSA\n0\n1 (EOR)\n1 (Geo)\n3 (EOR)\n1 (EOR)\n0\nCanada\n0\n1 (EOR)\n1 (EOR)\n0\n0\nChina\n0\n0\n0\n2 (EOR)\n1 (Geo)\n3 (EOR)\nKorea\n0\n0\n0\n1 (Geo)\n1 (Geo)\nAustralia\n0\n0\n0\n2 (Geo)\n0\nMiddle East\n0\n0\n1 (EOR)\n0\n0\n&#xa0;\nSource: Derived from large-scale integrated CCS projects identified by the Global CCS Institute. \nhttp://www.globalccsinstitute.com/projects/browse\n \nWebsite viewed on 21 August 2013 \n&#xa0;\nKey:\nGeo = Permanent Geological Storage\nEOR = Enhanced Oil recovery\n&#xa0;\n44.\n              \nWe believe projects that are for end-to-end power generation application will be directly funded by governments, and potentially smaller projects linking in industrial sources of \nCO\n2\n to the existing networks will be too. \n \nThose projects capturing \nCO\n2\n from \na power plant and using the \nCO\n2\n for EOR have some government funding to support the commercial value of the \nCO\n2\n.\n&#xa0;\n45.\n              \nWe do not believe that other countries have developed or implemented incentives or mechanisms that specifically encourage private sector development and deployment of CCS. \n \nThis represents an opportunity to take a leadership position by progressing models \nto ensure the first commercial full scale CCS project takes place in the UK.\n&#xa0;\nIs the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?&#xa0;\n46.\n              \nThe roadmap is a welcome demonstration of the government’s i\nntention to see CCS become a commercial reality, especially including the cost reduction activity which is underway to identify and promote cost reduction efforts.\n&#xa0;\n47.\n              \nSince the report was published in April 2012, key milestones appear to be slipping. \n \nWe\n believe a decision on granting the £1bn funding and additional EMR support to the first project will now not be made until mid-2015, whereas the plan indicated that would be \nmid-2014\n.\n \n We believe it would be possible to take this decision as early as late\n 2013 for some projects given the voluminous work and FEED studies that have already been undertaken. \n \nThese slips emphasise the industry’s concern as to whether CCS will become a commercial reality.\n&#xa0;\n48.\n              \nThe key is to have the first project operational as\n soon as possible in parallel with clear development of the regulatory framework and commercial model. \n&#xa0;\n49.\n              \nProgress towards a demonstrator is currently constrained more by the terms and requirements of public competitions than by the capability to develo\np and construct the plant.\n&#xa0;\nCould the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in this? &#xa0;50.\n              \nAn affordable and reliable decarbonised electricity sector, broadening in time to encom\npass heavy industry, would demonstrate the UK’s ability to deliver leading edge energy projects. \n \nShould economies around the world similarly aspire to achieve a decarbonised energy sector, then the UK would be in an ideal place to seize on those opportunities. \n \nAt least as important as the technologies will be the economic and regulatory environment t\nhat creates the platform for investment.\n&#xa0;\n51.\n              \nCCS offers one of those areas where UK expertise could be exported as we expect that the majority of the world to have a fossil fuel-based electricity sector for the foreseeable future.\n \n Additionally, the carbo\nn intensity of other major industrial processes (such as cement production) can be improved through the application of CCS on their processes. \n&#xa0;\n52.\n              \nMitigating fossil fuel emissions has potential for significant large scale impact on a global scale, provid\ning a pathway for developing countries to meet \nCO\n2\n reduction targets whilst utilising readily available fuel resources.\n&#xa0;\n53.\n              \nWe would add, however, that for CCS to make real impact there needs to be a stronger global consensus on carbon emissions reduction\n, with rich countries (including the UK) being prepared to bear the costs of carbon emissions abatement on a large scale, and a way found to bear the costs in developing countries.  This seems challenging in the present economic climate, and given reduced \npublic interest in climate change globally, but this needs to be viewed in the context of developments taking place over several decades.\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the consequences of failing to develop CCS and what alternatives are available for decarbonisation if CCS fails?&#xa0;\n54.\n              \nIf CCS is not taken forward at sufficient scale, additional measures and/or technologies would need to be implemented if we are to meet the carbon reduction target. \n&#xa0;\n55.\n              \nThe primary alternative technology is probably new nuclear.  Without CCS, \nthere would be a need for a much larger UK nuclear build programme than currently envisaged\n. \n This is deliverable from an engineering perspective, but would require large amounts of capital and the substantial expansion of UK and global supply chains.  Fro\nm a risk perspective it leaves a significant exposure to the costs of nuclear, especially in a market with relatively few approved vendors and fuel sources.\n&#xa0;\n56.\n              \nAlternatively, or additionally, a greater capacity of reliable renewable generation would need\n to be developed. \n \nIn the case of offshore wind, expansion on a scale to replace the potential role of thermal power stations equipped with CCS would probably be unfeasible given the need to manage generation intermittency on such a large scale.\n \n To suppor\nt this, we would need very large scale and potentially long term energy storage and/or interconnection across Europe and potentially beyond.  Such scenarios have been explored in models, but carry substantial development and deployment risks, which again e\nmphasise the value in the optionality of CCS.\n&#xa0;\n57.\n              \nTime of use tariffs and demand response techniques could be developed to reduce and adjust the timing of energy usage.\n \n However, given the scale of the deployment of these techniques that would be needed t\no meet the targets, in the absence of CCS and/or nuclear at the right scale, the impact on the electricity and energy system would be profound, and would probably challenge the limits of public acceptance.\n&#xa0;\n58.\n              \nAt the moment it is difficult to foresee a po\nwer generation sector that does not include fossil fuel generation being available in time to meet climate reduction targets.\n \n Failing to progress CCS in time could therefore create political pressure to reduce those targets to avoid the risk of supply sho\nrtage.\n&#xa0;\n59.\n              \nFinally, there are a number of industrial sources of \nCO\n2\n such as cement and iron and steel manufacture, where \nCO\n2\n is intrinsically produced as part of the process, and there are no currently feasible substitutes for the product.  Failure to develop CCS will have significant knock-on effects for decarbonisation of these sectors too. \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n See, for
