defaultWith a membership of more than 410,000 registered nurses, midwives, health visitors, nursing students, health care assistants and nurse cadets, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is the voice of nursing across the UK and the largest professional union of nursing staff in the world.
default 
defaultRCN members work in a variety of hospital and community settings in the NHS and the independent sector. The RCN promotes patient and nursing interests on a wide range of issues by working closely with the UK Governments, the UK Parliaments and other national and European political institutions, trade unions, professional bodies and voluntary organisations.

default              
defaultThe RCN believes that regulation of the health care system must have appropriate checks and balances to prevent harm and support high quality, compassionate care for patients. The RCN has consistently called for a regulator with teeth; a regulator that takes speedy action when there are real concerns about quality and safety of service provision.

default3.2
default              
defaultThe NHS in England has been undergoing major reform and as such there are significant pressures on the system. The CQC is one of the few organisations to remain following the reforms, but it has been required to implement major changes to its approach to system regulation. The CQC is changing as lessons are learned from examples of poor care such as at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust and Winterbourne View care home and reports into quality and safety of the care delivered by the NHS.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultThe RCN supports many of the changes being made by the CQC, including the move away from a generic inspector and inspection model. This involves the move to larger inspection teams with a stronger role for nurses and clinicians and also includes patients and members of the public. We are also pleased that the CQC has incorporated listening events into their new acute hospital inspection model, which enables anyone who has received care from the trust being inspected to attend and share their feedback. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultWe are less convinced of the merits of the CQC’s proposals for rating all acute hospitals, however. The application of a single rating for an acute hospital, for example, which provides a number of different services, may not provide an accurate reflection of the quality of care across those different services or even on different wards. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultUncertainties also remain in some of the core elements of the CQC’s overall approach to monitoring standards of care. The most notable is the precise fundamental standards that the CQC will focus on, which will be consulted on later this autumn. The fundamental standards will need to ensure that 
defaultthey address what we know can lead to organisational failure, for example, staffing levels and skill mix, organisational culture and management structures.
default defaultThe CQC will need to translate these into tangible, transparent standards that can be inspected against.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultAs was stated in our written submission to the Health Select Committee last year, the CQC also needs to ensure that it continues to meaningfully engage with providers so that they are able to use the results of inspections to make improvements in the care they provide. Professor Don Berwick, in his report on NHS patient safety, made a number of recommendations around transparency and adopting a “culture of learning” within the NHS. The CQC could help to facilitate a culture of openness and candour in those it regulates by ensuring their inspection reports are drafted in such a way that they encourage a 
default‘learning
default organisation’ to respond appropriately and the lessons learned to be applied across the NHS.
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultThe RCN has approximately 200 members employed in frontline and national roles across the CQC, representing around 10 per cent of the total workforce. We are one of the recognised trade unions within the CQC and RCN representatives continue to meet regularly with CQC management to discuss and negotiate on issues which affect the workforce. 
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default              
defaultWe remain concerned about the lack of a robust approach to workforce planning within the CQC; how the CQC will transition away from a generic inspector model; and the pressing need to improve learning and development opportunities and support for staff. We have been concerned by the worrying culture of bullying at the CQC which was detailed in the CQC’s July 2013 independent report into bullying and harassment within the organisation. Whilst welcoming the current administration’s acknowledgement of such unsavoury issues, we would now like to see evidence that they are taking action to implement the lessons learned. While we are pleased to see a small improvement in morale in the CQC’s recent staff survey, we are aware that much more needs to be done to enable the CQC to be seen as a role model for the behaviours that it is looking for in those it regulates.
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default              
defaultThe RCN is pleased that the CQC approached the RCN to ask us for our insight and local intelligence to support their pilot of new style inspections. We are also working on a Memorandum of Understanding between our organisations to provide a framework for more joint work for the future.
