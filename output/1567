defaultThe councillors would like to wholeheartedly support the thoughtful letter supplied below and hope that notice is taken of the need to consider rural services as a network not just as isolated services.  
default&#xa0;
defaultRunning a defaultrural transport network in such a sparsely populated area as Northumberland is completely different to an urban one. Rural needs are more basic and exceptionally community related.  default&#xa0;default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default2)  defaultA personal view of public transport policy anddefault implementation from a regularly and long-used bus seatdefault2.1default              defaultBeing a regular bus user on both urban and rural routes over 40 years, starting with schooldays travelling from 
defaultWindyhaugh
default in the upper Coquet valley to 
defaultMorpeth
default, Northumberland, and then working i
defaultn various places from East London to mid Wales, Worcestershire to Middlesbrough, returning to Northumberland regularly using public transport, I have had plenty of opportunity for comparison.  
default2.2default              defaultFor the last 9 years I have been in Northumberland, using 
defaultthe 
defaultThropton
default to 
defaultNewcastle
default route for at least 5 return journeys per week between 
defaultLongframlington
default and 
defaultMorpeth
default, mostly for work or to connect to other destinations, so I have been able to observe all of the changes on this route since 1971.
default2.3 default              defaultI am submitti
defaultng this evidence because I have full awareness of how 
defaultimportant defaultthe bus service is for we passengers 
defaultin all aspects of life, and not just to access shops and basic services.  defaultAnyone not a regular rural bus user has no conception of this, as is reflected by
default policies and implementation for rural bus services .
default2.4default              defaultAlso I think that the best hope for rural public transport is to enable a proper 
defaultnetworkdefault to be 
defaultrun profitablydefault, in recent years 
defaulthindered by deteriorating communication with existing passengers and ladefaultck of contact withdefault defaultpotentialdefault passengersdefault, largely because of  the constraints of funding structures.
default2.5default              defaultProfitable and appropriate running of public transport in rural areas is hindered by looking at the funding of each route in isolation, instead of examining it as part of an effective and usable public transport defaultnetworkdefault.default2.6default              defaultSources:

defaultHow do government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities?default3.1default              defaultThough there were surveys in previous decades, in the last nine years, despite making 
defaultminimu
default, five ret
defaulturn journeys per week between 
defaultLongframlington
default and 
defaultMorpeth
default,  I have only seen one County Council survey, in spring 2011, and one done by a national organization, though I have heard that another was done this spring driver about a specific proposed change t
defaulto our timetable.
default3.2default              defaultOur parish council has asked for people to notify them of their public transport needs via our parish newsletter, as has 
defaultRothbury
default, 
defaultThropton
default,  and upper 
defaultCoquetdale
default, but until very recently, 
defaultLonghorsley
default, the other main village on our bus
default route did not have such a publication.
default3.3default              defaultOur weekly, “Northumberland Gazette” covers public transport, publishing a paragraph or two during a  consultation, but usually at the very end of the consultation period.  Is this due to tardy dissemination of i
defaultnformation by the County Council, or to editorial policy.? 
default3.4default              defaultConsultation documents are quite complex, and so only really useable online.  An unusually high proportion of bus passengers probably don’t have access to computers, particularly in rural area
defaults lacking in broadband and decent mobile phone signals, leaving paper documents available at libraries. If people rely on public transport, they might only get to the nearest place with a library one day a week for an hour or two to do essential tasks, so 
defaultwould not have time to peruse and respond to a consultation.
default3.5default              defaultAt a public meeting in Felton, I think in October 2011, about cutting bus services to Newton-on-the -Moor and 
defaultSwarland
default, attended by  councillors, council officers, and Arriva representatives 
default, it was stated that one of the main ways for determining passenger demand was counting the ticket numbers on services. 
defaultLocal users replied that this could only be done on services which existed, and it did nothing for people needing a bus service which cudefaultrrently didn’t exist, especially if they had to get a lift to the nearest bus route, often a great distance awaydefault 
defaultThough  common practice in urban public transport surveys is  to ask people how far and how they travel to and from the service being defaultsurveyed, this is not done in Northumberland.defaultMost regular passengers using weekly passes suspect that they are waved onto the bus without being counted.
default              
default3.6default              defaultOn regular drivers who know the route and passengers well.  Their employers probably don’t make 
defaultenough use of their local knowledge, and could run a better service if they did. It is only because of these drivers’ personal dedication that this service operates effectively.
default              
default3.7.idefault              defaultI arrived back in Northumberland in time to see the five year Local Tra
defaultnsport Plan 2006-2011 apparently voted in by the County Council before the consultation period ended. In autumn 2010, having discovered the name of the Commercial Manager at Arriva, I prepared for the 
defaultforthcoming 2011 Local Transport Plan by giving out add
defaultress cards with the Arriva manager’s name and head office address in Sunderland to anyone who I heard making a comment about the state of the bus service, hoping that it might encourage the decision-makers to pay more attention to our needs and experiences
default.  I was much surprised by the number of people who later told me that they had written letters, even those who had said “they won’t listen to us anyway”.  Apparently the Arriva management also got a surprise.  
defaultii  default              defaultLater, questionnaires were distributed 
defaultto passengers on the 
defaultRothbury
default and A1 routes in Northumberland, and collated in the 
defaultEVIDENCE BASE FOR THE NORTHUMBERLAND LOCAL TRANSPORT  2011-2026, giving the impression of a howl of anguish from passengers.  There was no publicity about this questionnairedefault on any of the busesdefault, 
defaultand it was mostly distributed by passengers who got further copies of it themselves
default, and distributed it to everyone they could either on the buses or door-to-door.  Even so, I later heard from many passengers who had still had no idea
default that a consultation was taking place.
defaultiii  default              defaultPresusmablydefault  this was because, as a subsidised service, Arriva ran it under contract for the County Council, and it  did not cover operating consultations or publicity.default              defaultIt is probably not in Arriva’s interests defaultto facilitate a profitable and effective service if they can get money by contracting to run a service for  the County Council without investing  in market research or promotion.  Few County Council resources available to do this.defaultOn “THE BOTTOM LINE” ON B

defaultCONSULTATION,  TRANSPORT SECTION,  QUEST
defaultION 43:  
defaultTo base a planning strategy on a vision where the majority of the county is rural, but “where the use of public transport for the journey to work and to school is considered socially necessary but is not commercially viable, the local authority

defaultay
default provide revenue support for services”[Northumberland Economic Strategy p.23] is LUDICROUS.
defaultIn the Local Transport Plan 2011-2026 Strategy Document there are 17 principle elements of the new bus strategy, but 
defaultnone of them mention working with or involvindefaultg the LOCAL BUSINESSES WHOSE EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS ARE USERS OF THE BUS SERVICE, and who might wish for more bus use in order to free up the oversubscribed car parking spaces for a larger number of customers, and a better network of buses to attract moredefault touristsdefault(e.g. Dutch tourists, 7% of whom expect to use public transport, our nearest neighbours on the ferry)
default4)  defaultTo what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to defaultisolated communities?default&#xa0;default              default4.1default              defaultMany special interest groups such as the elderly, frail and vulnerable, and to some extent, young people, are probably very much on the County Council’s radar, and quite a large proportion of available resources are put into sup
defaultporting the introduction and operation of 
defaultcommunity buses, but these are often only usable for people who are in a position to book in advance in quite small time-slots. 
defaultThese, defaultand the excellent car-share schemes implemented by the County Council, 
defaultare notdefault suitable for the growing number of people who are struggling to afford a car to get to work, or look for work, and who are increasingly expected to work unusual shifts or at short notice, or both default(zero hours contracts etc.), or who simply want to reduce g
defaultlobal warming by using public transport 
default&#xa0;default4.2default              defaultTeenagers seem to be the least informed about changes to bus timetables etc., though public transport has been one of the main campaigning issues of the National Youth Parliament for 2 years running, and youngsters are readily in touch via social media.  
defaultProbably an effective route for communicating with them has not been established.
default4.3default              defaultApparently no recognition that rural communities have a strong tradition and basis in cultural and family links, which needs to be supported by public transport default(especial
defaultly in the absence of accessible computer services and tuition).
default&#xa0;defaultIt isn’t just about taking people into town centres to access increasingly centralised services which have been withdrawn from rural areas.defaultIt is about allowing people to be able to continue defaultseeing and supporting relatives and friends in neighbouring communities, get to family graves to tend them, recognising that sick people don’t just need medical services, but visitors as well default(e.g. no Sunday services)
default, allowing access to local meetings so defaultthat they are not excluded from democracy, and local cultural events and activities to maintain the cohesion of the community defaultFor some people living on their own, or whose partners are in hospital, their fellow passengers and the bus-drivers can be their 
defaultmost important source of company and support.  
defaultBuses are a good and rare meeting place for different sections of the community who might not otherwise meet 
defaulte.g. young and old, native and newcomer, people with and without children,

default5) defaultWhat are the maidefaultn challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities?  How can these challenges be overcome?default&#xa0;
default5.1default              defaultCommunicatingdefault with passengers and
default potentialdefault passengers (see section 3)
defaultand, for 
defaultday-to-day service defaultchangesdefault, recognition from e.g. Arriva, who say that we can use 
defaultFacebook
default or Twitter, that an unusually high proportion of their passengers don’t have access to or knowledge of these, and many of the most essential journeys are outside of office hours. Arriv
defaulta’s number for enquiries is only open during office hours, with no numbers for “local” depots. Their 
defaultFacebook
default page is only updated during office hours.
defaultThere are no information offices on the 
defaultThropton
default route outside of Newcastle.
default5.2default              defaultAccurately establishing
default the need.  
defaultPeople have had to give up going to places, make unreliable or inefficient ad hoc arrangements, or get a car when finances or environmental principles make it preferable that they did not.
defaultIf a new service is put in place, especially if it is 
defaultnot publicised, or has not been properly researched to make sure that it best fits peoples’ needs, it takes some time for people to find out about and transfer back to trusting and relying on public transport.  If , as usual it has been a trial period of o
defaultnly a year, there is not time to build up a base of new and previous customers, and the service is then irrevocably cut due to “lack of demand”.  (Many passengers have concluded that this is probably one of the main objectives when designing “trial periods
default”).
defaulte.g. the recent history of the Newton-on-the-Moor and 
defaultSwarland
default bus service, which was no use for workers, and only catered for a small section of the community before it was cut altogether.
default              
default5.3default              defaultRough roads and reliability in winter – better 
defaultintegration with highways 
defaultdepts
default – ensuring better gritting times, passing places, and parking /dumping spaces for snow so that cars aren’t parked on roads and buses can get through safely.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6)  defaultHow effectively do Community Transport services address the defaultneeds of passengers in isolated communities?  How could Community Transport be improved?default&#xa0;defaultSee section 4.1
default&#xa0;default7) defaultTo what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxi and other demand-responsive transport services?defaultThis discrimi
defaultnates against some of the groups who actually rely on the buses, who have not got enough money to run a car, so couldn’t afford a taxi either.
defaultMaybe more could be done to look into taxi-share schemes
default&#xa0;default8)  defaultThe main challenges associated with funding transpodefaultrt services in isolated communities?  How can these services be made more affordable?default8.1default              defaultJudging from a public meeting about the 
defaultWooler
default  to Newcastle bus service in March 2013, the County Council is obliged to pay for the free journeys made by pensioners,
default but is given no funds for it, presumably meaning that available funds are drawn to the most used, but possibly less socially essential routes, so that people on busy urban bus routes get much more value for money and use of their pensioners’ passes than p
defaulteople in rural areas can., but free bus travel for 
defaultalldefault pensioners, whether rural or urban is essential – see section 4.
default8.2default              defaultDo everything to make rural bus services more profitable, by effective market research and promotion, see section 3. 
default8.3default              defaultFunding an
default area’s rural transport as a whole network, rather than looking at individual routes separately. This only results in constant cuts, rendering the network useless for increasing numbers of dedicated passengers, and necessitating larger subsidies for the re
defaultmaining few.
default8.4default              defaultWe are all being exhorted to reduce emissions, but rural bus services are always being cut, despite more and more essential services and facilities being withdrawn from rural areas and centralised, so needing people to make more and longer
default journeys –
defaultinclude funding for rural public transport as part of any centralization project or cost-benefit analysis?default&#xa0;defaultRecommendationsdefault&#xa0;
