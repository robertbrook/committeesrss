"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Irwin Mitchell Solicitors\n (CMI0020)\n&#xa0;Executive Summary \n&#xa0;Within the foreword to the MoJ response\n paper published in October 2013\n, the \nSecretary of State for Justice, Mr Grayling outlines many of the changes which have been introduced to seek to affect the level of motor insurance premiums being paid in England and Wales.  We agree with\n him that these changes\n, once they have worked their way through the system should have a meaningful effect on the cost of insurance, but only as long as the\n significant\n savings they bring about are actually passed onto consumers.\n&#xa0;\nWe also note the determination on the part of the Government that more should be done to further reduce premiums by seeking to make fraud data available \nwhich again is something we\n strongly support.  Similarly, in relation to medical evidence, we welcome any changes to the system which will\n further\n improve\n the standard of medical reporting. \n&#xa0;\nThere are practices which damage the industry, which \nwe believe should be addressed\n robustly.\n  Pre-medical offers are a clear example, as are arrangements where instructing parties have a direct financial stake in the company arranging the medical evidence.  We cannot support the new practice of medico-legal\n examinations taking place over the telephone or lawyers/insurer\ns \ngenerating \nincome through presumptive \nPsychological therapy treatment in al\nl cases. \n&#xa0;\nAt their worst these practices can drive inappropriate behaviour but even at their best they can create a negative perception which potentially damages \nthe system designed to deliver j\nustice to genuine accident victim\ns.\n&#xa0;\nMuch has been done that needs to be allowed to work through the system before further analysis is appropriate of the streamlined portal process.  For the same reason, this is also why it was appropriate for the \nMinister\n to have left the \nsmall claims track level\n alone\n to allow the full affects of the reform\ns to be fully understood. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nComments on the Government’s Command Paper:\nReducing the number and costs of whiplash claims\n&#xa0;\nPart 1 – Better Medical Evidence\n&#xa0;\nIt is our firm belief that all of the medical evidence we commission and indeed the majority of medical evidence prepared within the industry in respect of those soft tissue injuries sustained in so many road traffic accidents is appropriate and properly prepared.  So called ‘whiplash injuries’ are very real but by their nature they are difficult to tangibly diagnose and evidence, however most medical practitioners do so to the very best of their ability.\n&#xa0;\nWith this in mind, we believe that care is required to distinguish between joint instructions of experts and joint medical evidence.  As long as there is no delay or increased cost, and the input from Defendants is meaningful and specific to the accident in question, we agree that the reporting expert should have details about the impact leading to the injuries they are considering.  We could not however accept that disclosure of evidence should be to both parties at the same time.  This would go against the fundamental principal of legal privilege which dates back over four centuries.  Claimant’s should be allowed to see what is being said about them by a medical pro\nfessional before giving consent\n \n(o\nr not\n)\n to that information being disclosed elsewhere. Great care should be taken not to erode the fundamental principle of legal privilege by the legislative function of Government without full and proper consultation and debate. \n&#xa0;\nUnfortunately, as with so many\n things in life, the majority are\n let down by the minority and it is that minority of claimants and their representatives who grab the headlines and cast a bad light on all of the ‘genuinely injured’ claimant\ns the j\nustice system should serve.\n&#xa0;\nIt is therefore important to take further appropriate steps to address any negative \nperceptions around whiplash, it\ns diagnosis, treatment and compensation, which is why in our response to the Ministry of Justice consultation around whiplash claims, we argued for the following\n: \n&#xa0;\n-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe accreditation of reporting doctors and medical agencies-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe creation of a framework to ensure the independence of reporting doctors-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe requirement for a medical report before compensation is paid to remove opportunistic claims-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFull assessment of the current RTA Portal and the reforms being introduced in April 2013 with an ongoing working party of industry stakeholders to make further recommendations for change as the impact of current reforms become clear-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn obligation on insurers to engage in data sharing around fraud.  The consultation supports this but is silent as to how this is to be advanced-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAction to improve engagement in the RTA Portal by insurers so that a higher proportion of legitimate actions can be dealt with in the current low cost system&#xa0;\nThere has been good early work between the Motor Accident Solicitors Society (MAS\nS), the Associ\nation of British Insurers (ABI\n),\n the Association of Medical Reporting Organisations (AMRO) &amp; the Forum of Insurance Lawyer\ns\n (FOIL) to outline an agreed approach to commissioning medical evidence\n. \n We understand that the MOJ is already working with these groups to deliver a robust workable solution in 2014.\n&#xa0;\nWe are also aware\n that the MoJ met with the ABI\n and MASS separately, and can c\nonfirm the clear intent from these\n stakeholders to deliver \na solution which can work for the long term. \n&#xa0;\nHow we envisage this\n s\nolution\n should work\n:\n&#xa0;\nWe believe that there should be a body set up to govern how medico-legal evidence is prepared for whiplash type injuries.  For ease of explanation, we will call this body \nMedCo. \n&#xa0;\nMedCo would be responsible for the accreditation, training and monitoring of those experts who prepare medical reports on soft tissue whiplash type injuries arising from road traffic accidents.  There should be joint representation from insurer, claimant and medical communities on the board of MedCo \nto avoid any bias either real or perceived.\n  We also believe that MedCo should have the power to suspend or remove accreditation either through audit or in response to comments raised with a committee similar to the behaviour committee which has overseen the workings of the MoJ portal process.\n&#xa0;\nAs far as funding of this proposition is concerned, we note the Government’s intention that the costs of the new independent medical panel should not fall on the public purse and accordingly, we believe it should be funded by accredited doctors\n, possibly in\n accordance with the number of reports they prepare per-annum.  We do not believe that either insurers or claimant representatives should be responsible for funding as again, we are seeking to ensure there can be no suggestion (real or perceived) of bias that would undermine the system. \n&#xa0;In terms of timing, whilst it is of course desirable that a solution is in place as soon \nas possible, it would be preferable\n \nthat a\n solution which is appropriate and will work in the longer term is put in place rather than any ‘quick fix’ which \nma\ny fail to deal with perceptions and deliver justice at proportionate \ncost.  We would envisage that it would take 12 months to set up the type of MedCo governing body we have described.  \nHowever to achieve this we would expect an agreed framework to be completed in the first two months of 2014 with operational delivery in the following 10 months.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPart 2 – Further Action to Challenge Fraudulent/Exaggerated Claims\n&#xa0;\nThe Government’s command paper indicates that it believes\n it is vital that\n all involved in the industry co-operate to ensure that, not only do the genuinely injured receive the help and support they deserve, but that those making unnecessary, exaggerated or fraudulent claims are effectively deterred or prevented from doing so.  To achiev\ne this we believ\ne that accurate and agreed data\n should be\n collated so that all parties have a clear picture of reality.\n \n Currently there is no credible objective data.\n \n Figures from the Compensation Recovery Unit (CRU) are frequently quoted by all parties but because there is no uniform method of classifying data\n,\n conclusions drawn from the\n \nfigures are often unreliable. \n The MedCo\n style body r\nesponsible for accreditation\n should also collate\n specific and limited anonymous data on those examined to establish the true number\n of claims\n and nature of the injuries sustained.\n \n&#xa0;\nIn addition to the banning of pre-medical offers\n and whilst it should not need stating, we believe it is also an important requirement that the medical report prepared is actually the result of a face to face physical examination.  It would seem that some medico-legal reports have been prepared recently following a telephone consultation.  \nSuch an approach means that the reports have little value and they can only serve to undermine public confidence in the system. \n&#xa0;\nSolicitors have no interest in acting for fraudsters.  Aside from costing lawyers time, effort, money and potentially damaging reputation, it flies in the face of why so many lawyers became involved in personal injury work in the first place... to help people in a difficult situation.  Solicitors would prefer to have early information to enable them not to act for fraudsters.  If the available data was shared then any firms that were still interested in acting for such individuals would stand out and could become the considered focus of insurer’s significant resources.\n&#xa0;\nWe are aware that MASS has made considerable effort to engage with the ABI around data sharing and the ABI has been slow to engage. \n As you are aware the ABI\n expressed a view in a letter to the Committee that Solicitors will abuse data despite there being no evidence (or frankly logic) to support such an allegation.  However, since sending that letter to your committee we understand that the ABI have adopted a considerably more constructive \napproach and we further understand that constructive proposals around data sharing may be forthcoming in the very near future.  This is to be congratulated and welcomed.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Part 3 – Small Claims Track\n&#xa0;\nBy way of comment on part 3 of the Government’s command paper, we would simply wish to express our agreement with the reasons given for not increasing the small claims track limit at this time.  We are pleased that the Government recognises the potential detrimental effects to genuine claimant’s ability to access justice if the limit was to be increased.  We also welcome the acknowledgment that if the limit were increased, there are those who might seek to take advantage of claimants but who would not put their best interest first. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;Part 4 – The Whiplash Issue and Data Sharing \n&#xa0;We welcome the Government’s call on insurers to collate and publish information around case volumes, case injury types, initial claim values and final case settlements\n.  Such information would need to be uniform across the industry, accurate and complete.  Whilst we note that the Government does not intend to adopt a formal regulatory or legal information gathering power in this regard, unless very clear guidance is given to insurers the information will at best be incomplete and inconsis\ntent and at worst, meaningless or misleading. \n&#xa0;\nSimilarly, any information collected by insurers around suspected exaggerated and fraudulent claims or on claims which are withdrawn would again need to be very carefully directed.  Just because a claim is withdrawn does not mean that it was fraudulent or exaggerated in the first place.  People change their mind about pursuing claims for a variety of legitimate reasons.  Indeed a legitimate Claimant can be put off claiming simply because a suggestion of fraud is raised.  There needs to be care that any reforms do not encourage inappropriate allegations of fraud.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAssessment of the Costs and Benefits of Reforms\n&#xa0;\nThe MoJ’s command paper goes onto refer to ‘medical panels’ in the plural, which may or may not be intentional, however we do believe that a single ‘MedCo’ type organisation of the nature described above would be appropriate to ensure consistency across the industry.\n&#xa0;\nWe note the cost/benefit analysis outlined by the MoJ and the potential impact of a medical panel on the cost of medical reports.  We believe that the cost of accredited medical reports should not be fixed in the protocols or CPR until such time as the architecture of any solution is finalised.  It would make little sense to determine the cost of an accredited medical report until the work required to complete that accredited report is finalised.  Once MedCo has been in place for some time, only then would it be possible to accurately fix the cost of reports, subject to a mandatory annual inflationary increase.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTransport Committee Letter to the MoJ dated 29th October 2013\n&#xa0;We are grateful for the TSC choosing to publish their letter to the MoJ dated 29\nth\n October 2013 and trust that the following comments (not already covered above) may be of some assistance to the committee members.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n The list given in bold italics is from the Executive Summary to Irwin Mitchell’s response
