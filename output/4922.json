"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;WRITTEN EVIDENCE FROM DAVID ANDERSON Q.C.&#xa0;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nINTRODUCTION&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLEGAL STATUS OF THE CHARTER&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;THE POLAND-UK PROTOCOL&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“It will be clear the UK Protocol does not in any way constitute an ‘opt-out’ in the sense of trying to disapply certain rights to UK citizens.  That would be neither necessary nor desirable given that the UK fully accepts the rights reaffirmed in the Charter.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“Although the Protocol is in terms that are specific to the United Kingdom and Poland, it does no more than set out some of the implications of the way in which EU law gives effect to the Charter.  So every proposition in the Charter, although it only refers to the United Kingdom and Poland, is equally true for every other Member State.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAs such, the Protocol may be not only of comfort but of practical use to any party seeking to avoid an expansive interpretation of the Charter. \n&#xa0;\nCOMPETENCE CREEP?&#xa0;\n        \nApplication to national rules&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“the rubric, ‘implementing Union law’, is to be interpreted broadly and, in effect, means whenever a member state is acting ‘within the material scope of EU law’”.\n&#xa0;\nIt is well es\ntablished that a State acts\n within the scope of EU law, in particular, when availing itself of one of the permitted derogations\n from \nfreedoms\n such as the free movement of goods and the freedom to provide services.  There have been pre-Charter cases in which the general principle of fundamental rights \nwas \ngiven a remark\nably wide application under that\n doctrine.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter must .. be complied with where national legislation falls within the scope of European Union law”,\n&#xa0;\nnoting at para 23 that the provisions of the Charter “\nare not to extend in any way the competences of the European Union as defined in the Treaties\n” and that the Charter “\ndoes not extend the field of application of European Union law beyond the powers of the European Union or establish any new power or task for the European Union, or modify powers and tasks as defined in the Treaties\n”. \n The United Kingdom did not intervene in the case, as it could have done had it wished to join \nthe Commission and \nfive other Member States\n in contesting th\ne\n application of the Charter\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Title IV rights&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“In particular and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Title IV of the Charter creates justiciable rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom except in so far as Poland or the United Kingdom has provided for such rights in its national law.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Human rights culture&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCONCLUSION&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n              \n              \n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n              \nThe Charter of Fundamental Rights: History and Prospects in post-Lisbon Europe \nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1953619\n \n \n              \n[2012] 1 WLR 3333, paras 26-28.\n \n              \nUKEAT/0401/12/GE, 4 October 2013.\n \n              \nCase 63/83, [1984] ECR 2689.\n \n              \nThe duty of national courts to set aside even national primary legislation that contravenes EU Treaty law or the general principles of law has been clear for longer still: see, e.g., Case 106/77 \nSimmenthal \n[1978] ECR 629, which inspired the \nFactortame \n(Spanish Fishermen) litigation in the late 1980s.\n \n              \n“Mr. Blair’s final appearance on the European stage produced a clear negotiating success as Britain won a legally-binding opt-out from the controversial charter”: Daily Mail, 23 June 2007;
