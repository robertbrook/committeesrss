defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultWOMENSTEC Belfast (WSC031)defaultIntroduction - WOMENSTEC
default1.
default              
defaultThe WOMEN'STEC is an innovative organisation in Northern Ireland which aims to provide facilities to 
defaultadvance women's involvement in sectors of training and employment in areas dominated by men, such as construction and IT, and specifically women who are socially and economically disadvantaged.
default2.
default              
defaultThe WOMEN'STEC was born of a recognised need for non tradit
defaultional training for women in Northern Ireland. "Non Traditional Training" refers to training for jobs in industry sectors with historically low female representation.
default3.
default              
defaultTraditionally women have not opted for or been trained in construction and IT jobs, and
default even today they represent a minuscule percentage of trainee places across the North and South of Ireland as a whole.
default4.
default              
defaultThe WOMEN'STEC is unique in that we support women to address the barriers that prevent them from embarking on a career in industry. Whe
defaultther this is lack of childcare, problems with travel, financial implications or lack of confidence to go into a male dominated industry, we will support them in overcoming these issues.
defaultBackground to the Underrepresentation of Women in STEM Careers
default5.
default              
defaultIn t
defaulthe experience of WOMENSTEC, women face multiple barriers to entry into occupations traditionally regarded as male, such as STEM careers and manual trades, as follows:
defaulta.
default              
defaultSocietal expectations and attitudes about what constitutes ‘women’s’ and ‘men’s’ 
defaultjobs
defaultb.
default              
defaultUpbringing that assumes ‘male’ and ‘female’ stereotypes, such as what toys male and 
defaultfemale children are given, parental and family role models, household tasks, etc.
defaultc.

defaultStreaming towards ‘male’ and ‘female’ subjects in education

defaultThese social and physical barriers can be summarised in the following table

default&#xa0;
default7.
default              
defaultThese issues have been traced in the past by variou
defaults reports, such as that of the Women and Work Commission report of 2006
default, and these influences are still being noted today.  Past research has shown that men in majority female occupations do not suffer the same disadvantage, indeed are more likely to pros
defaultper than in other occupations
default.
defaultInitiatives to Encourage Women into STEM Careers
default8.
default              
defaultBearing in mind the barriers, WOMENSTEC has developed practices to encourage 
defaultwomen in entering non-traditional occupations
default.  These include the following:
defaulta.
default              
defaultAwareness 
defaultraising
default – Stereotypical attitudes are challenged through public advertising, participation in events and outreach in community organisations.
defaultb.
default              
defaultNon-traditional training
default – Initial training in all-women environments provide opportunities for women to acquir
defaulte non-traditional skills in areas such as joinery, plumbing, horticulture, ICT, electrics and decorating in a supportive environment with a view to transition to more advanced training in male-dominated environments.
defaultc.
default              
defaultCapacity building
default – Alongside non-tr
defaultaditional training, women receive support in areas such as personal development and discrimination awareness to build confidence to enter environments that can be exclusive or even hostile to women.
defaultd.
default              
defaultSupport and mentoring
default – During and after non-tradition
defaultal training, women receive personal support and follow-up to provide help in addressing barriers to participation.
defaulte.
default              
defaultRole models
default – Female tutors in non-traditional skills provide training and demonstrate that stereotypes can be broken.
defaultf.
default              
defaultPractical experi
defaultence
default – A social economy business
default brings together women with non-traditional skills providing services to the public and to organisations, particularly those where male providers may present an issue, for example, in women’s refuges, etc.
defaultg.
default              
defaultAdvice and 
defaultguidance
default – Non-stereotypical assistance and signposting is provided for women and for other organisations and establishments to demonstrate options for career development beyond sex stereotypes.
defaulth.
default              
defaultBusiness start-up
default – Many non-traditional skills, such as m
defaultanual trades, are relevant to self-employment, where again, women are under-represented.  In this case, women are supported to undertake a trade dominated by men in a sector dominated by men.
default9.
default              
defaultA model to promote non-traditional occupations for women, sup
defaultported by EU funding, was the Women into Non-Traditional Sectors (WINS) project, led by Belfast City Council in partnership with other employers (Translink, Northern Ireland Housing Executive and the Construction Industry Training Board) and other organisa
defaulttions (WOMENSTEC, Training for Women Network, Belfast GEMS, Helm Corporation, Queen’s University Belfast and the Irish Congress of Trades Unions).  The resulting model is represented in the diagram below.
default10.
default              
defaultThe model worked through the following phases
default:
defaulta.
default              
defaultAwareness raising and recruitment
default – Through advertising, road shows and direct connection with key organisations, women were encouraged to participate in the project, as well as promoting the idea of non-traditional employment.
defaultb.
default              
defaultAssessment
default – The nee
defaultds and aspirations of participants were discussed in one to one consultations, where those for whom participation in the project were recruited and others referred to other employment opportunities or offered alternative non-traditional training.
defaultc.
default              
defaultSoft s
defaultkills training
default – Participants were engaged in personal development, discrimination awareness and non-traditional taster courses to build confidence and foster the development of non-traditional skills.
defaultd.
default              
defaultEmployment-specific training
default – Courses more directe
defaultd towards the chosen areas of employment were undertaken, including the acquisition of accredited qualifications.
defaulte.
default              
defaultWork placement
default – Where applicable, participants undertook work experience in one of the areas of employment on offer from the employers inv
defaultolved in the project.  Where this experience proved not to be a match with participant aspirations and interests, further referral to other employment opportunities was offered.
defaultf.
default              
defaultEmployment training
default – Where applicable, more formal skills training with a 
defaultview to recruitment was undertaken.
defaultg.
default              
defaultOnward progression
default – Where matched with a recruitment process, participants applied for work in non-traditional areas with the project employers, progressed to further training, or were referred to other opportunities
default.
defaulth.
default              
defaultMentoring and support
default – A key element to the project was ongoing mentoring of participants to provide advice and guidance and to identify and address problems.  Practical support, such as childcare and transport, where appropriate, were provided as in
defaultterim measures, in view of the needs of the participants and multiple barriers they faced.
default11.
default              
defaultThe WINS model was tested as a comprehensive approach to encouraging and assisting more women into non-traditional sectors of employment.  It should be seen as a
default set of ingredients that have the potential to address some of the barriers to women entering male-dominated areas of the economy.  Adapting to circumstances, elements of the model can be taken and used in a variety of contexts to tackle the same or simila
defaultr barriers to participation many women face.  Ultimately, however, the model prepares women for environments shaped for men.  Ideally, environments should be shaped for participation by both women and men
default.
default12.
default              
defaultIn the interim, an important part of developi
defaultng the capacity to assist women in entering traditionally male fields is the provision of an environment for the development of skills and confidence in a more supportive environment.  This is where women-only spaces are important as incubation or nurturin
defaultg environments, so that women can develop non-traditional skills, at least initially, without the pressure or sometimes the hostility that learning spaces oriented towards men can present.  WOMENSTEC is one model where specialised  provisions of training a
defaultnd support for women considering non-traditional employment can take place, but other women-only spaces, such as in women’s centres or through women-only classes at training establishments, can provide similar or elements of such provision.
