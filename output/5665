defaultThe Chairman:default Good afternoon, M
defaults
default 
defaultBerès
default.
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default Good afternoon and welcome to the European Parliament. Thank you for inviting us to have an exchange of views ahead of what will be a very important European parliamentary week. I have known about the capacity of the House of Lords to scrutinise issues deeply ever since I started as a civil servant in the National Assembly way back in 1981. I have always admired the way the House of Lords challenges EU policies, and I can see that that 
defaultgoes on
default. I also 
defaultknow the kind of 
defaultreports that 
defaultyou 
defaultare 
defaultable to produce
default on 
defaultthese kinds of 
defaulttopics, and 
defaulthow these exchanges, either by writing procedure or by meetings, are useful for you as a fallback in your reports and as a testimony.
default So 
defaultI am well aware of the context in 
defaultwhich I will deal
default with 
defaultthis meeting. 
defaultI have invited some colleagues to this meeting
default. I am happy to 
defaulthave Ms Anthea McIntyre MEP with us, but I will not give her the floor 
defaultexcept when 
defaultthere is a real need 
defaultfor it
default. You will have a
default full 
defaultopportunity to discuss with her any questions you may have, but the 
defaultquestions 
defaultyou 
defaultraise
default should be addressed by
default the co-ordinator at 
defaultS&amp;D
default who assists 
defaultat 
defaultthe level that you had required, so she is more than welcome, and I am happy that she is on my side 
defaultjust to make sure that
default I do not make any mistakes when speaking English
default and all the other stuff
default. 
defaultPerhaps I may briefly introduce myself and then we can go straight into the questions you have prepared. That will allow us to attend the plenary session in good time. I am sure that you have my CV. I have been a Member of this Parliament for quite a long time. I was first an ordinary Member for two years. I then chaired the French Socialist Delegation in the Socialist group. After that I chaired the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee
default.
default I now chair the Employment Committee and I have been a member of the European 
defaultc
defaultonvention. Before that I was a civil servant in the National Assembly looking after European affairs, and in particular I read the reports published in the red books from the House of Lords, but I think that the colour has now changed. Perhaps you will introduce yourselves, and then we can move on to the in-depth questions. 
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much for your welcome. It is kind of you to give up your time to meet us this afternoon. We are treating this as a formal evidence session for our report. It is probably best if I go quickly around the table to explain who we are and wh
defaultat we have done.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Good afternoon. I am Clive Brooke, and I am a Labour Peer in the House of Lords, and have been for 16 years. 
defaultLord Freeman:default I have been in Parliament for 30 years, half of which as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons and half in the House of Lords. I am a Conservative Peer. 
defaultQ145 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default I am Detta O’Cathain. I have been in the House of Lords for 22 years. I do not have a political background and I am a Conservative Peer. With me are Nicole Mason, the Clerk to the 
defaultC
defaultommittee, and our specialist adviser to the inquiry, John Bell. We have one more Peer in our group who we lost on our way to the Parliament, but I am sure that he will join us shortly. 
defaultFor some six months now we have been looking at youth unemployment in the European Union. Every Monday afternoon we take evidence from people who we think will be able to help us to understand the general consensus that youth unemployment across 
defaultEurope
default is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis. The 
defaultCommittee
default has a duty to scrutinise all the relevant legislation and directives that come from EU. I do not think that the 
defaultCommittee
default members here today have any relevant interests. You will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct, and this will be put on the public record in both printed form and on the parliamentary website. Perhaps we may now move straight on to the questions we have prepared. 
defaultAs I have said, there is a general consensus that youth unemployment across 
defaultEurope
default is a serious aspect of the current economic crisis. Can you summarise your own view of the exact nature of the current problems and the issues that you are most concerned about? I ask this because people have a different view on which issues occupy the central stage. 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default There is no official assessment of the situation, but at this point I will speak from my own expertise as the chair for more than four and a half years of the 
defaultCommittee
default looking at these topics. This crisis has generally hit the weakest section in every area. In the labour force, you will usually observe the last in and first out practice, which may well apply to young people. However, that is not a sufficient explanation, so we have to look at the situation in more detail. In truth, the figures we are looking at are challenging because you have to consider them in terms of their absolute values and their relative values. Let me explain the position. In most countries, you will observe that young people suffer twice the average level of unemployment. It could be said that that is a normal situation because young people are moving into work. At certain points they are not at work because they are in the process of entering the world of work. The fact that the figures are twice as high is not an issue as such, but what is an issue is the threshold 
defaultthat 
defaultcan be achieved because unemplo
defaultyment is increasing everywhere.
defaultAnother element is the increasing rate of unemployment. I mention this in connection with the situation in 
defaultSweden
default because average unemployment is not as high as it is in, for example, 
defaultGreece
default or 
defaultSpain
default,
default and the rate at which it has increased is lower. Therefore, to talk about youth unemployment as a whole is not enough because you have to look at the detail.
defaultThe main question at the root of the problem is about qualifications. There is a real problem around NEETs; we all know about this concept. For us this may be the greatest challenge because not only do these young people have to get into work, someone has to make sure that they are able to upgrade their qualifications. At the other end of labour market we see very well qualified young people not being able to find jobs after gaining their degree, which is a
defaultlso quite a worrying situation.
defaultIn a situation of labour market constraint it is clear that the appetite of entrepreneurs for providing new labour opportunities for young people is not large. Is there a trade-off between those who remain longer in their jobs because of the increasing retirement age and the lack of young people coming into the labour market? We have a lot of literature which shows that there is no trade-off between the two. Nevertheless, there is some tension in this area of the labour market and it has to be taken into account. At this point I would not suggest that it is a major element. 
defaultQ146 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default What are the issues affecting the different types of young people, such as those between graduates and disadvantaged young people without qualifications? 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default As I mentioned a moment ago, these are two different situations. That is why the Parliament, which has been going over the regulations—mainly the EU Youth Guarantee
default,
default which we will discuss later—has been very insistent that public policy should look carefully at the position of disadvantaged young people. As I mentioned earlier, you can observe the unemployment risk for the two categories. Nevertheless, as the EU strategy reflects, we believe that there is a bigger risk to society to have large numbers of the population without qualifications. When someone has gained qualifications, while there might be a mismatch or a lack of job creation in certain companies, the principal aim is for the EU to challenge innovation and competition with emerging markets, and that requires our labour force 
defaultto 
defaultbe well qualified. 
defaultQ147 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default A final question from me. Is it appropriate for the European Union to have a role in youth unemployment, and if so, why? Perhaps I may make a suggestion at this point. In our own country, we are not supposed to look at any trends that may be reflected in our statistics for three months. However, at the moment we are seeing a fall in youth unemployment in the 
defaultUK
default. I do not suggest that we should not continue to worry about the issue because the drop is very gradual, but we have to be aware that there are pressures 
defaultthat
default have had some effect on the labour market and that things are beginning to look a bit better. Even so, your point about the competitiveness of the European Union as a whole against the emerging markets is well made. It is why we need to upskill people. Again, do you think it is appropriate for EU to have a role in the rate of youth unemployment in each country? 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default This question allows me to make a more general comment. I can imagine a further umbrella question: should the EU have anything to do with labour markets and other such social matters? Of course, my answer would be that there is definitely a role for the EU because this is a strong element of the functioning of the internal market. If you want this cornerstone of the EU to be accepted by EU citizens—I do not think that any member state wants to challenge the internal market—the level of acceptance of the internal market and its consequences for the functioning of the labour market is important. How policies are defined is within the competences of the member states, but the functioning of the internal market and the eurozone, including the free movement of workers, has consequences 
defaultfor levels
default of unemployment—and not only of young people. I am not saying that the EU is or should be the major policymaker because there is room for national policies as well. However, all EU member states are being challenged by same situation, which could be called a demographic challenge. It is being experienced at different scales
default. N
defaultevertheless it is a demographic situation that is specific to the EU regarding emerging markets or even states in other states of equilibrium. That is in part because we have a high level of mobility within the EU and we have the internal market. For these reasons, it is important that the EU look
defaults
default at this matter carefully. 
defaultMy last remark is that there is a slight contradiction here. I can appreciate that in some member states there will be a feeling that the EU should not do anything about the situation, but if the EU does not say or do anything, that could really endanger its whole purpose.
defaultYou mentioned that things are perhaps looking better in the 
defaultUK
default at this stage. Of course this has to be publicly discussed because there is a debate going on about the nature of the relationship with and the contract that we are offering our young people. More and more of our citizens are looking for minimum social standards, and the price is being paid by young people even to get a job. Many NGOs are now promoting a living wage, and that is also in the public debate even if it is not an EU competence. 
defaultQ148 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Freeman:default Madame 
defaultBerès
default, perhaps I may reassure you at the outset that although I am a Conservative Peer, I am strongly in favour of the European Union and I shall be campaigning in due course not only for an improvement to but remaining in the EU. My question relates to co-ordination between member states and the sharing of best practice. That is because we have different layers of responsibility. Obviously we have the Commission, we have national Governments, we have trade unions and we have companies. The evidence that we have received in part over the past few months has shown that the sharing of information and best practice in different countries is not as good as it should be. 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default As you know, I am a Socialist—a French socialist—but I can agree with you on this point. This is proving to be a challenge to the whole idea that best practice leads to good governance. It can be seen that best practice might not be enough to ensure that it is spread all over the EU. That is why I think that what we have been doing with regard to the EU Youth Guarantee is the application of a good golden rule. The Youth Guarantee has been implemented in some of the member states 
defaultthat 
defaulthave the best results in youth employment and it is the inspiration of those experiences 
defaultthat 
defaulthas encouraged others to promote the idea that perhaps they should build on the best practice of such member states. What will help to spread good practice is the creation of EU tools around it. Of course, those member states 
defaultthat 
defaulthave good practice around the Youth Guarantee is not an element that can be separated out from things like good social dialogue, the involvement of entrepreneurs who are willing to offer apprenticeships to young people and so on. Even so, I think that the Youth Guarantee has been the inspiration behind such proposals, and that is more than welcome.
defaultWhen it comes to the role of the trade unions, if we want a well-functioning labour market, we had better ensure that the trade unions are really involved in it. That will ensure a good social dialogue at both the national and the EU level. This is an area where there is room for improvement in some member states. 
defaultThe Chairman:default Perhaps I may add a question to the one put by Lord Freeman. Do you think that there is a role for education authorities and schools in this? Part of the problem is that there have been changes in strategy in education policies 
defaultthat 
defaulthave resulted in the suggestion that 50% of the population should go to university, implying the value, more or less, of academic learning rather than techn
defaultical training. However, we seem
default to have lost a lot of our technical colleges in the 
defaultUK
default, and a lot of our technical skills. I do not know if it is the case in other member states, but at this stage there is a huge need to encourage people who feel like taking on academic subjects in a university setting to get skills. There is always the case of the Polish plumbers who have come to the 
defaultUK
default. In 
defaultLondon
default, practically all the plumbing is done by Polish nationals because they have excellent technical skills in this area. Moreover, it is a way to go further and develop general engineering skills and then, if necessary, to become late entrants to universities and acquire degrees in engineering. Is that something which is happening in other EU member states? 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default The question of education is of the essence. We could have a whole hearing on this issue because there is so much to say about it. Also, it lies at the heart of the 
defaultLisbon
default strategy. 
defaultT
defaulthere is a huge gap 
defaultin 
defaultthe application of the strategy. When you look at the figures, it is interesting to see that half the member states, as a number, decreased their public spending budgets for education during the implementation of the 
defaultLisbon
default strategy. I am not saying that successful involvement in any strategy means dedicating a higher budget to it, but if you decrease 
defaultthe 
defaultbudget for one policy it may mean that it does not have a high priority in that member state. We have been discussing this issue with Commissioner Vassiliou
default,
default who is in charge of education issues, and we can see it reflected in the policies 
defaultthat have been implemented by
default some member states. 
defaultWhen aiming to correct a budget deficit, reducing the education budget is a challenge if you believe that 
defaultthe 
defaultfuture of the EU lies in a better skilled population. The essence of EU social policy for tomorrow is 
defaultbased on 
defaultthe new concept that Commissioner Andor is promoting. It is very forward-looking around social investment. In 
defaultFrance
default we say that we do not have petrol but we do have ideas, but I do not think that that can be extended to the 
defaultUK
default—even though your petrol will disappear one day as well. We could say that for the whole of 
defaultEurope
default, the idea of good qualifications is very important.
default 
defaultThere are two other aspects in this area that should be considered. The first is that the bridge between education and the business environment is not the same in all member states. With the crisis, some ideas had been held very much in common before but now need to be revisited. The first of those is the role and the place of industrial policies. Until now in the EU, industrial policy was considered only in terms of competition
default, 
defaultthe avoidance of 
defaulttrading imbalances, 
defaultestablishing 
defaulta level playing field, reaching competitive agreements and so on. 
defaultT
defaulthere is another dimension, and that is the 
defaultindustrial 
defaultstrategy for the 
defaultUnion
default, which is now very much under discussion
default. The same applies to the image 
defaultof 
defaultcertain jobs, and this is directly related to your question. 
defaultOne of the success stories from 
defaultGermany
default is the place that apprenticeships enjoy. I think that many countries are 
defaultr
defaultevisiting this aspect of their policies as a result. That is not to say that anyone should build their whole education policy 
defaulton 
defaultavoid
defaulting
default the Polish plumber
default,
default because that would go completely against the free movement of workers, and that really is not what we want to see. However, it can be said that the appetite of young people for such jobs has suffered somewhat from the instability that has been surrounding them.
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default I should say here that we are all delighted with and very much indebted to our Polish plumbers. 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault: defaultYour Prime Minister has made comments in the past.
defaultThe Chairman:default Excuse me, but we are not dealing with politics here. 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default I agree.
defaultThe Chairman:default We are here genuinely to try to explore the ways and means of dealing with what is a very serious problem across the whole of Europe; it is not an issue just for the 
defaultUK
default. Perhaps I may say a word more about our Polish plumbers. Not only are they doing a great job, but they have started up local maintenance service companies and have encouraged a lot of young British people to get involved in plumbing. That is why it is such a success story. We 
defaultunderstand
default perfectly well the issues around the movement of workers, but we have benefited more from immigrant workers than they have cost us. 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default I can see from the time that my responses are taking too long. Perhaps we should move on. 
defaultQ149 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Perhaps we can look at
default the
default specific elements 
defaultof the projects 
defaultwhich are being run by the European Union. We have 
defaultthe 
defaultyouth employment programme, the Youth Employment Initiative and the EU Youth Guarantee, about which you have just spoken and which has more money going into it. We also have the new programme for the European Social Fund with money running through to 2020. Would you care to comment briefly on 
defaultthe effectiveness of 
defaulteach of those programmes? Do you think that they could perform better than they do at the moment, and what would you suggest should be changed? Lastly, we have heard in the evidence we have been taking many complaints about the level of confusion generated by the multiplicity of different opportunities for people who are unemployed or in training. Many people feel that they ought to be simplified. Do you think that we need three separate programmes or is there a case to be made for some rationalisation in this area? 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default Let me be sure that we understand each other. When you refer to the youth employment programme, do you mean the 
defaultYouth Employment Package
default? They all form part of the same brickwork. The 
defaultYouth Employment Package 
defaultis a broad communication tool for a whole strategy, and within that strategy 
defaultthere are 
defaultdifferent tools 
defaultthat 
defaultcan be used. The first of those is, of course, the new European Social Fund. The Parliament has strongly insisted that there should be room for financing the Youth Guarantee. There are hard bricks and there are soft bricks in the brickwork. The 
defaultYouth Employment Package 
defaultand the 
defaultYouth Employment Initiative
default are mad
defaulte of what I would call soft bricks, while the European Social Fund and 
defaultthe
default Youth Guarantee are 
defaulthard
default bricks. I think that they are all very consistent. As we go down the line, the one that is the most prescriptive and the most precise is the Youth Guarantee, 
defaultand
default I hope 
defaultthat it 
defaultwill produce the best results. It is
default,
default at the 
defaultvery 
defaultleast
default,
default the first time that the 
defaultUnion
default has gone so deeply into defining what could be called a social policy. 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default If I may, perhaps I can go back to 
defaultthe 
defaultlast issue. You referred to the role of industrial policy and how in the past it had been focused primarily on ensuring that there was open competition with no hindrance to it. You said that you thought that 
defaultwas
default changing. Can you develop briefly what changes you envisage and how they would link into employment—and youth employment in particular? 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default This question falls outside of th
defaulte
default hearing as it was foreseen. What the crisis has demonstrated is that the creation of added value moves very much around industrial policies. Further, on competition, there is a firm idea that the EU needs to be ahead in innovation and research. That is directly linked to industrial policies. In former years, it was thought that we could keep our research and innovation while all our polluting and hard industrial work would be done outside the landscape of the 
defaultUnion
default:
default that is, we would just have the services. But that does not work, and the current crisis has demonstrated
default that
default. You can see a renewal of industrial policy that will help to encourage innovation in industrial policies. Let me take just one example in a sector where your country is performing quite well: the textile industry. You can see that jobs, research and innovation are going along hand in hand. I could also mention other sectors. If you want to create jobs, you have to keep 
defaultyour 
defaulthand in
default,
default in terms of your industrial policies and you have to take a modern view. It is not only about refining steel in better ways. 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default It is about taking a view on demand as well as supply. 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault: defaultYes.
defaultThe Chairman:default We of course agree with you totally about innovation and research. I am sure that you have read our recent report on these issues. 
defaultQ150 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Perhaps I may follow up on 
defaultwhat 
defaultLord Brooke was asking about. Can you help us to get some sort of feel for how well you think that the various member states of the European Union have responded to the initiatives put forward by the Commission? 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default Which initiatives do you mean? Are you referring to the Youth Guarantee?
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Yes, but you said that the
defaulty all form part of 
defaulta package. I am in effect referring to all these initiatives as a package. 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default It may be too early to assess fully what member states have been doing 
defaultto engage 
defaultin the implementation of 
defaultthe 
defaultnew European Social Fund and the Youth Guarantee. Even so, you can see that there is 
defaultgreat
default political awareness at the highest European level when you consider the 
defaultBerlin
default summit and the summit that was held in 
defaultParis
default. Both those summits were attended at the head of state and government level—just on the issue of youth unemployment. That is a link to my first answer. We can demonstrate that it is a critical question not only for each member state but for the EU as a whole.
defaultAs 
defaultwas 
defaultsaid at the 
defaultParis
default summit
default,
default it 
defaulti
defaults important to ensure that member states should put on the table their plans for the Youth Guarantee as soon as possible. Looking at the number of member states 
defaultthat 
defaulthave done so up to now, I can see that some are still missing, among which is your country. I can understand that, but it is a pity because the money has been in place since 1 January 2014. The longer member states
default take
default to put forward their plans, the longer it will take them to get the money. I think that the Commission will follow up these plans very carefully and, as you know, there 
defaultwill
default be a big conference in April. Moreover, there is to be a follow-up conference under the Italian presidency, although it is not yet clear whether it will be held at the end of this semester or at the beginning of the next presidency. There is a willingness at the EU level to look closely at ensuring that 
defaultthe tools accompanying the
default initiatives 
defaultthat 
defaulthave been set up are used properly because the political challenge of youth unemployment is so great. That, of course, is why you are producing your report.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Have you seen the responses 
defaultthat 
defaulthave been made by member states 
defaultthat 
defaulthave put forward their plans? 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default If you come to our ICM on Wednesday morning—
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Sadly, we are returning to the 
defaultUK
default tomorrow evening. 
defaultThe Chairman:default You shall be returning to the 
defaultUK
default, but I shall be going to the meeting. 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default We will have concrete proposals on the table with member states explaining to us exactly what they have been doing and what they hope to be doing. Last year
default,
default ahead of the 
defaultsetting of the
default Youth Guarantee, we had a very interesting session with colleagues from 
defaultFinland
default and 
defaultAustria
default. They were 100% convincing on how to tackle this issue and why it needs to be dealt with. There was talk of a bottom-up and a top-down approach, which is the kind of thing that the European Parliament and national 
defaultp
defaultarliaments should be doing.
defaultQ151 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Thank you very much for that. I am sorry that we will not be able to come to your meeting, but I am glad to note that our Chairman will be there. 
defaultPerhaps I may put one last point to you, although it may be a slightly unfair question. How have you rated the response of the various member states? Also, how do you rate the general response of the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default to these initiatives—not just on the Youth Guarantee? 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default I am not empowered to rate the member states and I will not venture to make such a response. The EU has its own rating agencies, but I will not settle this one. 
defaultThe Chairman:default Perhaps I may suggest that Ms McIntyre would like to make a comment. 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault: defaultOn the 
defaultUK
default response? This will not be a commitment. 
defaultThe Chairman: defaultShe is an
default defaultMEP and she is concerned about youth unemployment. 
defaultAnthea McIntyre:default I am here as the 
defaultdeputy co-ordinator for 
defaultthe ECR Group. Sadly, we do not have the co-ordinators from the EPP, the S&amp;D or ALDE. That is probably a function of holding a meeting on a Monday afternoon. People have long distances to travel and I can understand why they are not always here. 
defaultI have only a few comments to make on the many questions that have been asked. Youth unemployment is of particular concern to all the countries represented in the Parliament, and it is clear that 
defaultyouth unemployment
default rates are highest in those countries in the most difficult economic situation. My feeling is that we face a real problem with 
defaultthe 
defaultskills mismatch. There are something like 4 million vacancies across 
defaultEurope
default,
default which are due to the mismatch in skills. By around 2020, we expect that around 90% of jobs are going to require medium to high-level skills. In ICT, the short
defaultfall
default is expected to rise from 384,000 to somewhere around 700,000 because we do not have the skills. That has to be a huge focus 
defaultof
default our attention. My feeling is that we need to retain 
defaultf
defaultlexibility for member states so that they can address their own particular bottlenecks and I am therefore not in favour of a one-size-fits-all solution. 
defaultTurning to the 
defaultUK
default, we have had the 
defaultYouth Contract 
defaultwith a commitment of around £1 billion to it, and we have seen, as has been said, that youth unemployment is coming down. It is really important that we should share best practice across the whole of 
defaultEurope
default. 
defaultOne of the interesting schemes 
defaultthat 
defaulthas not yet been mentioned is Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs. Right across 
defaultEurope
default we have seen a decline in people wanting to become self-employed. It is not a route that is often thought about for young people, but I think that we could do a great deal by providing young people with the business skills that will enable them to set up their own businesses, develop their ideas and be encouraged 
defaultto create 
defaulttheir own enterprises. That is certainly something I think we should pursue. 
defaultGermany
default has been mentioned.
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default It is four o’clock. 
defaultAnthea McIntyre: defaultDo we have a couple of minutes? 
defaultThe Chairman:default I can see that the consensus is that there is no more time. There is a solution. Would you please write to us because that would be very useful to the 
defaultCommittee
default? I should mention that the real problem is that young people are not actually being prepared for the labour market, which raises a question mark about their employability. This issue relates particularly to the points 
defaultthat 
defaulthave been 
defaultmade 
defaultabout the huge number of vacancies and why there is such a high level of mismatch. 
defaultWould anyone like to use our remaining few minutes to add to the comments that have been made during this session? 
defaultPervenche defaultBerèsdefault:default First, I must thank you all for this exchange of views. I understand that this session will form an official part of your report, so I have to make sure that we look at the whole process in that light. Nevertheless, it is important to make a point as the chair of this 
defaultCommittee
default, of which Ms McIntyre is one of the members. In the end we have expressed our personal view
defaults
default, not the view of the 
defaultCommittee
default. As Ms McIntyre has just said, the policy view of the 
defaultUK
default would not be shared by the majority of its members. It is important to take that on board. If any members of the 
defaultCommittee
default are willing to contribute in writing, that is fair enough, but we need to be sure about what you will be reporting. Following the visit made by your parliamentary delegation last year, which unfortunately I was not able to attend, I am happy to see that you are back in 
defaultBrussels
default so that we can continue with th
defaultese
default exchange
defaults
