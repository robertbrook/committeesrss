[normal]Q144 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Good afternoon, M
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]Berès
[normal].
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] Good afternoon and welcome to the European Parliament. Thank you for inviting us to have an exchange of views ahead of what will be a very important European parliamentary week. I have known about the capacity of the House of Lords to scrutinise issues deeply ever since I started as a civil servant in the National Assembly way back in 1981. I have always admired the way the House of Lords challenges EU policies, and I can see that that 
[normal]goes on
[normal]. I also 
[normal]know the kind of 
[normal]reports that 
[normal]you 
[normal]are 
[normal]able to produce
[normal] on 
[normal]these kinds of 
[normal]topics, and 
[normal]how these exchanges, either by writing procedure or by meetings, are useful for you as a fallback in your reports and as a testimony.
[normal] So 
[normal]I am well aware of the context in 
[normal]which I will deal
[normal] with 
[normal]this meeting. 
[normal]I have invited some colleagues to this meeting
[normal]. I am happy to 
[normal]have Ms Anthea McIntyre MEP with us, but I will not give her the floor 
[normal]except when 
[normal]there is a real need 
[normal]for it
[normal]. You will have a
[normal] full 
[normal]opportunity to discuss with her any questions you may have, but the 
[normal]questions 
[normal]you 
[normal]raise
[normal] should be addressed by
[normal] the co-ordinator at 
[normal]S&amp;D
[normal] who assists 
[normal]at 
[normal]the level that you had required, so she is more than welcome, and I am happy that she is on my side 
[normal]just to make sure that
[normal] I do not make any mistakes when speaking English
[normal] and all the other stuff
[normal]. 
[normal]Perhaps I may briefly introduce myself and then we can go straight into the questions you have prepared. That will allow us to attend the plenary session in good time. I am sure that you have my CV. I have been a Member of this Parliament for quite a long time. I was first an ordinary Member for two years. I then chaired the French Socialist Delegation in the Socialist group. After that I chaired the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee
[normal].
[normal] I now chair the Employment Committee and I have been a member of the European 
[normal]c
[normal]onvention. Before that I was a civil servant in the National Assembly looking after European affairs, and in particular I read the reports published in the red books from the House of Lords, but I think that the colour has now changed. Perhaps you will introduce yourselves, and then we can move on to the in-depth questions. 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Thank you very much for your welcome. It is kind of you to give up your time to meet us this afternoon. We are treating this as a formal evidence session for our report. It is probably best if I go quickly around the table to explain who we are and wh
[normal]at we have done.
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] Good afternoon. I am Clive Brooke, and I am a Labour Peer in the House of Lords, and have been for 16 years. 
[normal]Lord Freeman:[bold] I have been in Parliament for 30 years, half of which as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons and half in the House of Lords. I am a Conservative Peer. 
[normal]Q145 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] I am Detta O’Cathain. I have been in the House of Lords for 22 years. I do not have a political background and I am a Conservative Peer. With me are Nicole Mason, the Clerk to the 
[normal]C
[normal]ommittee, and our specialist adviser to the inquiry, John Bell. We have one more Peer in our group who we lost on our way to the Parliament, but I am sure that he will join us shortly. 
[normal]For some six months now we have been looking at youth unemployment in the European Union. Every Monday afternoon we take evidence from people who we think will be able to help us to understand the general consensus that youth unemployment across 
[normal]Europe
[normal] is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis. The 
[normal]Committee
[normal] has a duty to scrutinise all the relevant legislation and directives that come from EU. I do not think that the 
[normal]Committee
[normal] members here today have any relevant interests. You will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct, and this will be put on the public record in both printed form and on the parliamentary website. Perhaps we may now move straight on to the questions we have prepared. 
[normal]As I have said, there is a general consensus that youth unemployment across 
[normal]Europe
[normal] is a serious aspect of the current economic crisis. Can you summarise your own view of the exact nature of the current problems and the issues that you are most concerned about? I ask this because people have a different view on which issues occupy the central stage. 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] There is no official assessment of the situation, but at this point I will speak from my own expertise as the chair for more than four and a half years of the 
[normal]Committee
[normal] looking at these topics. This crisis has generally hit the weakest section in every area. In the labour force, you will usually observe the last in and first out practice, which may well apply to young people. However, that is not a sufficient explanation, so we have to look at the situation in more detail. In truth, the figures we are looking at are challenging because you have to consider them in terms of their absolute values and their relative values. Let me explain the position. In most countries, you will observe that young people suffer twice the average level of unemployment. It could be said that that is a normal situation because young people are moving into work. At certain points they are not at work because they are in the process of entering the world of work. The fact that the figures are twice as high is not an issue as such, but what is an issue is the threshold 
[normal]that 
[normal]can be achieved because unemplo
[normal]yment is increasing everywhere.
[normal]Another element is the increasing rate of unemployment. I mention this in connection with the situation in 
[normal]Sweden
[normal] because average unemployment is not as high as it is in, for example, 
[normal]Greece
[normal] or 
[normal]Spain
[normal],
[normal] and the rate at which it has increased is lower. Therefore, to talk about youth unemployment as a whole is not enough because you have to look at the detail.
[normal]The main question at the root of the problem is about qualifications. There is a real problem around NEETs; we all know about this concept. For us this may be the greatest challenge because not only do these young people have to get into work, someone has to make sure that they are able to upgrade their qualifications. At the other end of labour market we see very well qualified young people not being able to find jobs after gaining their degree, which is a
[normal]lso quite a worrying situation.
[normal]In a situation of labour market constraint it is clear that the appetite of entrepreneurs for providing new labour opportunities for young people is not large. Is there a trade-off between those who remain longer in their jobs because of the increasing retirement age and the lack of young people coming into the labour market? We have a lot of literature which shows that there is no trade-off between the two. Nevertheless, there is some tension in this area of the labour market and it has to be taken into account. At this point I would not suggest that it is a major element. 
[normal]Q146 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] What are the issues affecting the different types of young people, such as those between graduates and disadvantaged young people without qualifications? 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] As I mentioned a moment ago, these are two different situations. That is why the Parliament, which has been going over the regulations—mainly the EU Youth Guarantee
[normal],
[normal] which we will discuss later—has been very insistent that public policy should look carefully at the position of disadvantaged young people. As I mentioned earlier, you can observe the unemployment risk for the two categories. Nevertheless, as the EU strategy reflects, we believe that there is a bigger risk to society to have large numbers of the population without qualifications. When someone has gained qualifications, while there might be a mismatch or a lack of job creation in certain companies, the principal aim is for the EU to challenge innovation and competition with emerging markets, and that requires our labour force 
[normal]to 
[normal]be well qualified. 
[normal]Q147 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] A final question from me. Is it appropriate for the European Union to have a role in youth unemployment, and if so, why? Perhaps I may make a suggestion at this point. In our own country, we are not supposed to look at any trends that may be reflected in our statistics for three months. However, at the moment we are seeing a fall in youth unemployment in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. I do not suggest that we should not continue to worry about the issue because the drop is very gradual, but we have to be aware that there are pressures 
[normal]that
[normal] have had some effect on the labour market and that things are beginning to look a bit better. Even so, your point about the competitiveness of the European Union as a whole against the emerging markets is well made. It is why we need to upskill people. Again, do you think it is appropriate for EU to have a role in the rate of youth unemployment in each country? 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] This question allows me to make a more general comment. I can imagine a further umbrella question: should the EU have anything to do with labour markets and other such social matters? Of course, my answer would be that there is definitely a role for the EU because this is a strong element of the functioning of the internal market. If you want this cornerstone of the EU to be accepted by EU citizens—I do not think that any member state wants to challenge the internal market—the level of acceptance of the internal market and its consequences for the functioning of the labour market is important. How policies are defined is within the competences of the member states, but the functioning of the internal market and the eurozone, including the free movement of workers, has consequences 
[normal]for levels
[normal] of unemployment—and not only of young people. I am not saying that the EU is or should be the major policymaker because there is room for national policies as well. However, all EU member states are being challenged by same situation, which could be called a demographic challenge. It is being experienced at different scales
[normal]. N
[normal]evertheless it is a demographic situation that is specific to the EU regarding emerging markets or even states in other states of equilibrium. That is in part because we have a high level of mobility within the EU and we have the internal market. For these reasons, it is important that the EU look
[normal]s
[normal] at this matter carefully. 
[normal]My last remark is that there is a slight contradiction here. I can appreciate that in some member states there will be a feeling that the EU should not do anything about the situation, but if the EU does not say or do anything, that could really endanger its whole purpose.
[normal]You mentioned that things are perhaps looking better in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] at this stage. Of course this has to be publicly discussed because there is a debate going on about the nature of the relationship with and the contract that we are offering our young people. More and more of our citizens are looking for minimum social standards, and the price is being paid by young people even to get a job. Many NGOs are now promoting a living wage, and that is also in the public debate even if it is not an EU competence. 
[normal]Q148 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Freeman:[bold] Madame 
[normal]Berès
[normal], perhaps I may reassure you at the outset that although I am a Conservative Peer, I am strongly in favour of the European Union and I shall be campaigning in due course not only for an improvement to but remaining in the EU. My question relates to co-ordination between member states and the sharing of best practice. That is because we have different layers of responsibility. Obviously we have the Commission, we have national Governments, we have trade unions and we have companies. The evidence that we have received in part over the past few months has shown that the sharing of information and best practice in different countries is not as good as it should be. 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] As you know, I am a Socialist—a French socialist—but I can agree with you on this point. This is proving to be a challenge to the whole idea that best practice leads to good governance. It can be seen that best practice might not be enough to ensure that it is spread all over the EU. That is why I think that what we have been doing with regard to the EU Youth Guarantee is the application of a good golden rule. The Youth Guarantee has been implemented in some of the member states 
[normal]that 
[normal]have the best results in youth employment and it is the inspiration of those experiences 
[normal]that 
[normal]has encouraged others to promote the idea that perhaps they should build on the best practice of such member states. What will help to spread good practice is the creation of EU tools around it. Of course, those member states 
[normal]that 
[normal]have good practice around the Youth Guarantee is not an element that can be separated out from things like good social dialogue, the involvement of entrepreneurs who are willing to offer apprenticeships to young people and so on. Even so, I think that the Youth Guarantee has been the inspiration behind such proposals, and that is more than welcome.
[normal]When it comes to the role of the trade unions, if we want a well-functioning labour market, we had better ensure that the trade unions are really involved in it. That will ensure a good social dialogue at both the national and the EU level. This is an area where there is room for improvement in some member states. 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Perhaps I may add a question to the one put by Lord Freeman. Do you think that there is a role for education authorities and schools in this? Part of the problem is that there have been changes in strategy in education policies 
[normal]that 
[normal]have resulted in the suggestion that 50% of the population should go to university, implying the value, more or less, of academic learning rather than techn
[normal]ical training. However, we seem
[normal] to have lost a lot of our technical colleges in the 
[normal]UK
[normal], and a lot of our technical skills. I do not know if it is the case in other member states, but at this stage there is a huge need to encourage people who feel like taking on academic subjects in a university setting to get skills. There is always the case of the Polish plumbers who have come to the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. In 
[normal]London
[normal], practically all the plumbing is done by Polish nationals because they have excellent technical skills in this area. Moreover, it is a way to go further and develop general engineering skills and then, if necessary, to become late entrants to universities and acquire degrees in engineering. Is that something which is happening in other EU member states? 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] The question of education is of the essence. We could have a whole hearing on this issue because there is so much to say about it. Also, it lies at the heart of the 
[normal]Lisbon
[normal] strategy. 
[normal]T
[normal]here is a huge gap 
[normal]in 
[normal]the application of the strategy. When you look at the figures, it is interesting to see that half the member states, as a number, decreased their public spending budgets for education during the implementation of the 
[normal]Lisbon
[normal] strategy. I am not saying that successful involvement in any strategy means dedicating a higher budget to it, but if you decrease 
[normal]the 
[normal]budget for one policy it may mean that it does not have a high priority in that member state. We have been discussing this issue with Commissioner Vassiliou
[normal],
[normal] who is in charge of education issues, and we can see it reflected in the policies 
[normal]that have been implemented by
[normal] some member states. 
[normal]When aiming to correct a budget deficit, reducing the education budget is a challenge if you believe that 
[normal]the 
[normal]future of the EU lies in a better skilled population. The essence of EU social policy for tomorrow is 
[normal]based on 
[normal]the new concept that Commissioner Andor is promoting. It is very forward-looking around social investment. In 
[normal]France
[normal] we say that we do not have petrol but we do have ideas, but I do not think that that can be extended to the 
[normal]UK
[normal]—even though your petrol will disappear one day as well. We could say that for the whole of 
[normal]Europe
[normal], the idea of good qualifications is very important.
[normal] 
[normal]There are two other aspects in this area that should be considered. The first is that the bridge between education and the business environment is not the same in all member states. With the crisis, some ideas had been held very much in common before but now need to be revisited. The first of those is the role and the place of industrial policies. Until now in the EU, industrial policy was considered only in terms of competition
[normal], 
[normal]the avoidance of 
[normal]trading imbalances, 
[normal]establishing 
[normal]a level playing field, reaching competitive agreements and so on. 
[normal]T
[normal]here is another dimension, and that is the 
[normal]industrial 
[normal]strategy for the 
[normal]Union
[normal], which is now very much under discussion
[normal]. The same applies to the image 
[normal]of 
[normal]certain jobs, and this is directly related to your question. 
[normal]One of the success stories from 
[normal]Germany
[normal] is the place that apprenticeships enjoy. I think that many countries are 
[normal]r
[normal]evisiting this aspect of their policies as a result. That is not to say that anyone should build their whole education policy 
[normal]on 
[normal]avoid
[normal]ing
[normal] the Polish plumber
[normal],
[normal] because that would go completely against the free movement of workers, and that really is not what we want to see. However, it can be said that the appetite of young people for such jobs has suffered somewhat from the instability that has been surrounding them.
[normal] 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] I should say here that we are all delighted with and very much indebted to our Polish plumbers. 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]: [bold]Your Prime Minister has made comments in the past.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Excuse me, but we are not dealing with politics here. 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] I agree.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] We are here genuinely to try to explore the ways and means of dealing with what is a very serious problem across the whole of Europe; it is not an issue just for the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. Perhaps I may say a word more about our Polish plumbers. Not only are they doing a great job, but they have started up local maintenance service companies and have encouraged a lot of young British people to get involved in plumbing. That is why it is such a success story. We 
[normal]understand
[normal] perfectly well the issues around the movement of workers, but we have benefited more from immigrant workers than they have cost us. 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] I can see from the time that my responses are taking too long. Perhaps we should move on. 
[normal]Q149 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] Perhaps we can look at
[normal] the
[normal] specific elements 
[normal]of the projects 
[normal]which are being run by the European Union. We have 
[normal]the 
[normal]youth employment programme, the Youth Employment Initiative and the EU Youth Guarantee, about which you have just spoken and which has more money going into it. We also have the new programme for the European Social Fund with money running through to 2020. Would you care to comment briefly on 
[normal]the effectiveness of 
[normal]each of those programmes? Do you think that they could perform better than they do at the moment, and what would you suggest should be changed? Lastly, we have heard in the evidence we have been taking many complaints about the level of confusion generated by the multiplicity of different opportunities for people who are unemployed or in training. Many people feel that they ought to be simplified. Do you think that we need three separate programmes or is there a case to be made for some rationalisation in this area? 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] Let me be sure that we understand each other. When you refer to the youth employment programme, do you mean the 
[normal]Youth Employment Package
[normal]? They all form part of the same brickwork. The 
[normal]Youth Employment Package 
[normal]is a broad communication tool for a whole strategy, and within that strategy 
[normal]there are 
[normal]different tools 
[normal]that 
[normal]can be used. The first of those is, of course, the new European Social Fund. The Parliament has strongly insisted that there should be room for financing the Youth Guarantee. There are hard bricks and there are soft bricks in the brickwork. The 
[normal]Youth Employment Package 
[normal]and the 
[normal]Youth Employment Initiative
[normal] are mad
[normal]e of what I would call soft bricks, while the European Social Fund and 
[normal]the
[normal] Youth Guarantee are 
[normal]hard
[normal] bricks. I think that they are all very consistent. As we go down the line, the one that is the most prescriptive and the most precise is the Youth Guarantee, 
[normal]and
[normal] I hope 
[normal]that it 
[normal]will produce the best results. It is
[normal],
[normal] at the 
[normal]very 
[normal]least
[normal],
[normal] the first time that the 
[normal]Union
[normal] has gone so deeply into defining what could be called a social policy. 
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] If I may, perhaps I can go back to 
[normal]the 
[normal]last issue. You referred to the role of industrial policy and how in the past it had been focused primarily on ensuring that there was open competition with no hindrance to it. You said that you thought that 
[normal]was
[normal] changing. Can you develop briefly what changes you envisage and how they would link into employment—and youth employment in particular? 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] This question falls outside of th
[normal]e
[normal] hearing as it was foreseen. What the crisis has demonstrated is that the creation of added value moves very much around industrial policies. Further, on competition, there is a firm idea that the EU needs to be ahead in innovation and research. That is directly linked to industrial policies. In former years, it was thought that we could keep our research and innovation while all our polluting and hard industrial work would be done outside the landscape of the 
[normal]Union
[normal]:
[normal] that is, we would just have the services. But that does not work, and the current crisis has demonstrated
[normal] that
[normal]. You can see a renewal of industrial policy that will help to encourage innovation in industrial policies. Let me take just one example in a sector where your country is performing quite well: the textile industry. You can see that jobs, research and innovation are going along hand in hand. I could also mention other sectors. If you want to create jobs, you have to keep 
[normal]your 
[normal]hand in
[normal],
[normal] in terms of your industrial policies and you have to take a modern view. It is not only about refining steel in better ways. 
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] It is about taking a view on demand as well as supply. 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]: [bold]Yes.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] We of course agree with you totally about innovation and research. I am sure that you have read our recent report on these issues. 
[normal]Q150 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] Perhaps I may follow up on 
[normal]what 
[normal]Lord Brooke was asking about. Can you help us to get some sort of feel for how well you think that the various member states of the European Union have responded to the initiatives put forward by the Commission? 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] Which initiatives do you mean? Are you referring to the Youth Guarantee?
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] Yes, but you said that the
[normal]y all form part of 
[normal]a package. I am in effect referring to all these initiatives as a package. 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] It may be too early to assess fully what member states have been doing 
[normal]to engage 
[normal]in the implementation of 
[normal]the 
[normal]new European Social Fund and the Youth Guarantee. Even so, you can see that there is 
[normal]great
[normal] political awareness at the highest European level when you consider the 
[normal]Berlin
[normal] summit and the summit that was held in 
[normal]Paris
[normal]. Both those summits were attended at the head of state and government level—just on the issue of youth unemployment. That is a link to my first answer. We can demonstrate that it is a critical question not only for each member state but for the EU as a whole.
[normal]As 
[normal]was 
[normal]said at the 
[normal]Paris
[normal] summit
[normal],
[normal] it 
[normal]i
[normal]s important to ensure that member states should put on the table their plans for the Youth Guarantee as soon as possible. Looking at the number of member states 
[normal]that 
[normal]have done so up to now, I can see that some are still missing, among which is your country. I can understand that, but it is a pity because the money has been in place since 1 January 2014. The longer member states
[normal] take
[normal] to put forward their plans, the longer it will take them to get the money. I think that the Commission will follow up these plans very carefully and, as you know, there 
[normal]will
[normal] be a big conference in April. Moreover, there is to be a follow-up conference under the Italian presidency, although it is not yet clear whether it will be held at the end of this semester or at the beginning of the next presidency. There is a willingness at the EU level to look closely at ensuring that 
[normal]the tools accompanying the
[normal] initiatives 
[normal]that 
[normal]have been set up are used properly because the political challenge of youth unemployment is so great. That, of course, is why you are producing your report.
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] Have you seen the responses 
[normal]that 
[normal]have been made by member states 
[normal]that 
[normal]have put forward their plans? 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] If you come to our ICM on Wednesday morning—
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] Sadly, we are returning to the 
[normal]UK
[normal] tomorrow evening. 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] You shall be returning to the 
[normal]UK
[normal], but I shall be going to the meeting. 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] We will have concrete proposals on the table with member states explaining to us exactly what they have been doing and what they hope to be doing. Last year
[normal],
[normal] ahead of the 
[normal]setting of the
[normal] Youth Guarantee, we had a very interesting session with colleagues from 
[normal]Finland
[normal] and 
[normal]Austria
[normal]. They were 100% convincing on how to tackle this issue and why it needs to be dealt with. There was talk of a bottom-up and a top-down approach, which is the kind of thing that the European Parliament and national 
[normal]p
[normal]arliaments should be doing.
[normal]Q151 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] Thank you very much for that. I am sorry that we will not be able to come to your meeting, but I am glad to note that our Chairman will be there. 
[normal]Perhaps I may put one last point to you, although it may be a slightly unfair question. How have you rated the response of the various member states? Also, how do you rate the general response of the 
[normal]United Kingdom
[normal] to these initiatives—not just on the Youth Guarantee? 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] I am not empowered to rate the member states and I will not venture to make such a response. The EU has its own rating agencies, but I will not settle this one. 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Perhaps I may suggest that Ms McIntyre would like to make a comment. 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]: [bold]On the 
[normal]UK
[normal] response? This will not be a commitment. 
[normal]The Chairman: [bold]She is an
[normal] [bold]MEP and she is concerned about youth unemployment. 
[normal]Anthea McIntyre:[bold] I am here as the 
[normal]deputy co-ordinator for 
[normal]the ECR Group. Sadly, we do not have the co-ordinators from the EPP, the S&amp;D or ALDE. That is probably a function of holding a meeting on a Monday afternoon. People have long distances to travel and I can understand why they are not always here. 
[normal]I have only a few comments to make on the many questions that have been asked. Youth unemployment is of particular concern to all the countries represented in the Parliament, and it is clear that 
[normal]youth unemployment
[normal] rates are highest in those countries in the most difficult economic situation. My feeling is that we face a real problem with 
[normal]the 
[normal]skills mismatch. There are something like 4 million vacancies across 
[normal]Europe
[normal],
[normal] which are due to the mismatch in skills. By around 2020, we expect that around 90% of jobs are going to require medium to high-level skills. In ICT, the short
[normal]fall
[normal] is expected to rise from 384,000 to somewhere around 700,000 because we do not have the skills. That has to be a huge focus 
[normal]of
[normal] our attention. My feeling is that we need to retain 
[normal]f
[normal]lexibility for member states so that they can address their own particular bottlenecks and I am therefore not in favour of a one-size-fits-all solution. 
[normal]Turning to the 
[normal]UK
[normal], we have had the 
[normal]Youth Contract 
[normal]with a commitment of around £1 billion to it, and we have seen, as has been said, that youth unemployment is coming down. It is really important that we should share best practice across the whole of 
[normal]Europe
[normal]. 
[normal]One of the interesting schemes 
[normal]that 
[normal]has not yet been mentioned is Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs. Right across 
[normal]Europe
[normal] we have seen a decline in people wanting to become self-employed. It is not a route that is often thought about for young people, but I think that we could do a great deal by providing young people with the business skills that will enable them to set up their own businesses, develop their ideas and be encouraged 
[normal]to create 
[normal]their own enterprises. That is certainly something I think we should pursue. 
[normal]Germany
[normal] has been mentioned.
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] It is four o’clock. 
[normal]Anthea McIntyre: [bold]Do we have a couple of minutes? 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] I can see that the consensus is that there is no more time. There is a solution. Would you please write to us because that would be very useful to the 
[normal]Committee
[normal]? I should mention that the real problem is that young people are not actually being prepared for the labour market, which raises a question mark about their employability. This issue relates particularly to the points 
[normal]that 
[normal]have been 
[normal]made 
[normal]about the huge number of vacancies and why there is such a high level of mismatch. 
[normal]Would anyone like to use our remaining few minutes to add to the comments that have been made during this session? 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] First, I must thank you all for this exchange of views. I understand that this session will form an official part of your report, so I have to make sure that we look at the whole process in that light. Nevertheless, it is important to make a point as the chair of this 
[normal]Committee
[normal], of which Ms McIntyre is one of the members. In the end we have expressed our personal view
[normal]s
[normal], not the view of the 
[normal]Committee
[normal]. As Ms McIntyre has just said, the policy view of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] would not be shared by the majority of its members. It is important to take that on board. If any members of the 
[normal]Committee
[normal] are willing to contribute in writing, that is fair enough, but we need to be sure about what you will be reporting. Following the visit made by your parliamentary delegation last year, which unfortunately I was not able to attend, I am happy to see that you are back in 
[normal]Brussels
[normal] so that we can continue with th
[normal]ese
[normal] exchange
[normal]s
[normal] of view. I wish you a very good visit. 
[normal]Q152 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Thank you very much indeed. I should like to make a final point. We have been talking about all these young people who in many cases are without hope, while in other cases they are without any skills. Perhaps you 
[normal]will 
[normal]think about how the perspectives, ideas and views of young people themselves have been gathered in order to help different bodies like the EU, national and local government
[normal]s
[normal] to design their responses. We have seen several young witnesses, and those sessions have proved to be very revealing. Have you done that as well, and if so, could we have some indication as to how those interviews went? 
[normal]Pervenche [bold]Berès[bold]:[bold] Well done for pushing the discussion even though I have tried to close it. We had a hearing in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee way ahead of when the timings for this topic on the agenda at the EU level were becoming urgent. We have also met, among others, the NGO representing young people, Gén
[normal]é
[normal]ration Précaire, which is a very proactive organisation. The Council has produced a special report on youth unemployment and we can send you its conclusions. 
[normal]The Chairman: [bold]That would be wonderful. Thank you very much.
