defaultHE regulation, BIS overspend and prospective sale of the student loan book default&#xa0;defaultDecember 2013 default&#xa0;defaultIntroduction default1. The National Union of Students (NUS) is a voluntary membership organisation which makes a real difference to the lives of students and its member students' unions. We are a confederation of 600 students' unions, amounting to more than 95 per cent of all higher and further education unions in the UK. 
default&#xa0;
default2. Through our member students' unions, we represent the interests of more than seven million students. Our mission is to promote, defend and extend the rights of students and to develop and champion strong students' unions, including those in further education colleagues to ensure learners’ interests are represented. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe problems of privatisation default3. The coalition government’s higher education agenda seems to be primarily based on ideology, driven by a dogmatic belief in the efficacy of competitive markets and private finance to deliver a healthy higher education sector. 
default&#xa0;
default4. The ‘black hole’ in the BIS budget caused by underestimations of the numbers of students private providers would recruit and the over-optimistic projections of the revenue to the public to be generated by the sale of the income-contingent student loan book are instances of a wider set of problems created by government reforms. 
default&#xa0;
default5. The government’s vision of the higher education sector of the future is one in which teaching costs are basically privatised but the public carries the risk of changing estimations of the returns from student loans. This generation of students will enter the labour market carrying an immense loan debt, and will in all probably have to pay twice: once in loan repayments and again through general taxation as the unsustainability of the fee and loan model of student funding places further pressure on the public purse. 
default&#xa0;
default6. Any government could wish to expand capacity in the sector, and enhance diversity of provision. But this must be done in a way that is sustainable, that works and that is mindful of the public and students’ interests as well as private beneficiaries. The types of qualification offered, the spread of academic and vocational subjects, the quality of higher education provision and whether we can sustain a lifelong learning offer in England that enables people to return to education – these things matter. The market cannot deliver them. Nor can it deliver meaningful protection for students in the case of institutional failure. 
default&#xa0;
default7. In reality, market mechanisms cannot support the kind of truly healthy, sustainable higher education sector that enables crucial public benefits as well as private, individual benefit. 
default&#xa0;
default8. According to reports, BIS underestimated the numbers of students private providers with designation for student loans would be able to recruit, leading to a budgetary overspend of up to £300 million by 2015. Although student number controls will be introduced for these providers in 2014, this blunder illustrates the problem of introducing new providers into the higher education sector without proper regulatory oversight. 
default&#xa0;
default9. As a result, important public priorities such as student opportunity funding (paid to institutions in recognition of the costs of recruiting and supporting disadvantaged and underrepresented students), teaching high-cost subjects, supporting high quality specialist provision and postgraduate students and supporting poorer students are under threat. At a time when our members report that they are having to provide food parcels to students who literally cannot afford to eat, the government has cut the National Scholarship Programme, a scheme that, for all its faults, at least signalled a commitment to supporting poor students. 
default&#xa0;
default10. Moreover, these students who have unwittingly caused the ‘black hole’ are studying in a context where they have no independent recourse of they have a complaint – their providers are not required to subscribe to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for HE. Their institutions are not asked to show how they support fair access and financial support for poorer students. If their institution shuts down they have no guarantee that they will be able to complete their studies elsewhere. In the majority of cases they will not be able to seek advice, support or representation from a students’ union. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSale of student loan book to private business default11. In principle we do not believe that the loan book, a public asset, should be sold into private hands. Student loans were designed with the intent to ensure that the costs of study fall on the graduate not on the student and they are in essence a contract with the state in which graduates repay in proportion to their income and in which less well-off graduates are protected. 
default&#xa0;
default12. Besides the whole issue of an entire generation whose future is built on debt, the way that student loan repayments are tied to graduate earnings makes it hard to predict what proportion of the loan will not be repaid in the future. BIS estimated the current RAB charge to be 33 per cent (now revised to 35-40 per cent), the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinks 37 per cent and million+ and London Economics estimate it at 39.6 per cent. 
default&#xa0;
default13. In order to make a deal of this nature saleable it becomes necessary to offer a ‘synthetic hedge’ guaranteeing a minimum return – essentially the public carrying the risk of lower than anticipated returns, pushing a cost on future generations for the sake of upfront cash now. 
default&#xa0;
default14. Although the government has promised that terms and conditions of loans would be fixed at the point of sale, we would argue that they should be fixed at the point at which the student takes up the loan. Even if the government delivers on its promise, there is no guarantee that this would continue to be the case for future students and future loan sales. 
default&#xa0;
default15. Andrew McGettigan has suggested that in calculating returns from the sale of the loan book the government has neglected to include the loss of £1.7 billion in lost revenue from repayments. If this is true it suggests that the plans need to be reviewed while the government redoes its sums. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNUS recommendations default16. For-profit providers should not be permitted to seek designation for student loans. Whether the student loan is considered to be public money or students’ money, when the profit motive is placed above the interests of students, the public or the sharing and extension of knowledge then the reputation and quality of English higher education as a whole suffers. Certainly in the absence of adequate student recourse for complaints in private providers or protections for students in the case of institutional failure this recommendation becomes even more pressing. 
default&#xa0;
default17. Students should have the terms and conditions of their loans guaranteed at the point at which they take up the loan. The income-contingent system ensures only that students will have to pay a proportion of their future income above a certain threshold – but the exact proportion, the interest rate and the level of that threshold are not fixed, making it impossible for students to estimate their future repayments. 
default&#xa0;
default18. Government should not sell the student loan book. This is a public asset, and selling future returns to the public at a cut price now is short-sighted. Given that the uncertainty of the precise amount of future returns from student loans make it necessary for government to guarantee a minimum return this amounts to nothing less than putting financial risk on future generations for the sake of a short-termist political fix.
