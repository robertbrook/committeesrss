"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Police for Crime Commissioner for Northamptonshire [CST0075]&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThank you for your letter of 6\nth\n December regarding the Public Administration Select\n \nCommittee's ongoing inquiry into Crime Statistics.\n&#xa0;\nI have been following the progress of your inquiry closely over the past few months\n \nand look forward to reading the Select Committee's final report and recommendations\n \nin due course.\n&#xa0;\nFirstly, I recognise that the accurate recording of crime statistics plays a vital role in\n \nensuring public confidence in policing and is vital to informing operational decision\n \nmaking, a view which I know is shared by my Chief Constable.\n&#xa0;\nSecondly, turning to the questions that you have raised in your letter, I am aware that\n \nin the past policing has been heavily target focussed something which I am not\n \nparticularly keen to reintroduce at a local level, especially following the Home\n \nSecretary's decision to remove centrally appointed targets.\n&#xa0;\nWhat targets if any do you set for your Police Force?&#xa0;\nI think it is important that you define what you mean by 'target'. The abolished targets\n \nHMG refers to set up a perverse performance culture where by it was all about the\n \ntarget and not the outcome - process over people.\n&#xa0;\nI have set one specific numerical target in my Police and Crime Plan. I want to see at\n \nleast a 40% reduction in violent crime offences across our county.\n&#xa0;\nWhen I was first elected as Police and Crime Commissioner, Northamptonshire had\n \nthe same level of violence offences as Merseyside, Greater Manchester and the West\n \nMidlands.\n&#xa0;\nI am sure you will agree that Northamptonshire has little in common with such places.\n \nFor example, they face significant additional pressure on their resources in part due to\n \ntheir more urban environments.\n&#xa0;\nThe 40% reduction is merely a way of describing the kind of transformational change\n \nI want to see. Also it is a challenge to the whole system - not just the Police. For\n \ninstance what will the CPS contribution be to meet that reduction? Prisons? Etc.\n&#xa0;\nWhat impact do you think this has on police recording of crime practices?&#xa0;My hope in setting such an ambitious target is to focus minds on the enormity of the\n \nchallenge we face in making Northamptonshire the Safest Place in England and\n \nNorthamptonshire Police the best performing force in the Country.\n&#xa0;\nThere are a number of checks and balances Police Forces have to contend with\n \nincluding the Home Office, IPCC, HMIC, the General Public and the Police and\n \nCrime Commissioner.\n&#xa0;\nI do not feel that the one specific numerical target I have set for the Force creates any\n \nadditional pressure on the Police. It is however a fact that my Police and Crime Plan,\n \nmy strategic direction and support of the Chief Constable has resulted in the fastest\n \nfall in crime than anywhere in the UK over the last twelve months.\n&#xa0;\nTo me that is the best indication of what I'm doing works.\n&#xa0;\nHow do you assure yourself that recorded crime figures in your area are correct?&#xa0;The recording of crime statistics is first and foremost a matter that sits under the\n \ndirection and control of the Chief Constable.\n&#xa0;\nPolice recorded crime is an important indicator of Force performance and is used in\n \nthe performance and accountability meetings that are held between my Office and the\n \nPolice Force.\n&#xa0;\nA protocol has been established between myself and the Chief Constable which\n \ndescribes how I will hold him accountable for performance. This is built on a trusting\n \nrelationship that the data and information provided to the Office of the Police and\n \nCrime Commissioner by the Force is accurate. \n&#xa0;\nTo what extent can you trust the statistics for your area?&#xa0;Despite National Crime Recording Standards, there is not a level playing field when\n \ncomparing forces. This is due to the fact that the same crime in one force area can be\n \nsubject to different recording practices in another. As a result, those making\n \njudgements on statistics alone might assess Northamptonshire Police as a Force that is\n \nperforming poorly.\n&#xa0;\nThe force has set up a National Crime Recording Standards (NCRS) group led by an\n \nAssistant Chief Constable to \"ensure a professional, ethical and pragmatic approach to\n \nthe recording of crime to provide a policing service with integrity\". This group is\n \nformed by core parts of the organisation responsible for data quality, crime\n \nmanagement and investigation. This group meets quarterly to review performance,\n \naddresses areas of concern and commissions data quality audits. Audits conducted\n \nduring 2013 include: robbery, threats to kill, domestic burglary, vehicle crime,\n \nharassment and Section 5 Public Order Act and criminal damage to dwellings. This\n \nhelps the Force to understand current recording practices and make any necessary\n \nchanges, it is worth noting that few crimes have been reclassified or cancelled\n \nsuggesting the Force's recording for these crimes is accurate.\n&#xa0;\nAt-the beginning of2013, the force adopted an 'investigate to record' practice, which\n \nis applied by other forces, which has coincided with an impact on recorded crime\n \nfigures. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabularies have identified this issue and\n \nare investigating to determine the extent of these changes and to what extent the\n \nreductions reported are 'real'. The Force has reassured me that crime recording retains\n \nthe highest of standards and integrity.\n&#xa0;\nI trust that this provides the clarity that you were looking for. If I can be of any further\n \nassistance in the future, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
