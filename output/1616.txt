[[[ (TIC 064)]]]Norfolk is a largely rural county with significant gaps in its transport infrastructure that disproportionately affect older people, disabled people and those without access to private cars. 28% of Norfolk’s population is over pensionable age, compared to 19% nationally. There are approximately 180,000 disabled people living in Norfolk and 38% of households have an income of less than £20,000. Many rural parishes have between 10-15% of households without access to a car. &#xa0;
