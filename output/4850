[normal]Written submission from Jon Vanstone (BRC [bold]74[bold])[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I am writing in response to the CLG Select Committee’s recent Call for Evidence to establish whether specific problems highlighted in letters you received are isolated issues or part of wider, systemic challenges faced by Competent Person Schemes operating in England and Wales.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Competent Person Scheme Forum (CPF) is recognised as a place for discussion by all Competent Person Scheme Operators about common issues and looks for common approaches to resolve these issues. The Forum makes recommendations to CLG, LABC and other stakeholders as well as encouraging co-operation between competent person self-certification schemes for the common interest of stakeholders.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following discussions at a recent CPF meeting, I would like to suggest that one specific area of interest to the Select Committee is the DCLG ‘Conditions of Authorisation’ introduced in July 2012 which standardises the auditing and operating requirements governing Competent Person Scheme Operators. This includes the requirement for all Competent Person Schemes to have UKAS accreditation by June 2014. It is envisaged that the ‘Conditions of Authorisation’, once given a chance to take effect, will help overcome some of the concerns highlighted in correspondence to the CLG Select Committee following its recent inquiry and subsequent report on buildings regulations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As Chair of the CPF I would value the opportunity to meet with you and any interested colleagues from the Committee, in order to discuss these recent regulatory changes and provide our views on how they can improve the operation of schemes.
