"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence submitted by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (WSC0105)Q 172-173:  Could the Government confirm who is responsible for gathering data on gender diversity in STEM? There is no single body tasked with pulling together all dat\na\n on gender diversity \nin STEM\n. \n \nDiversity within STEM is an issue which is of interest across government with specific areas of responsibility resting with individual departments\n and sponsored bodies\n.\n \n \n&#xa0;\nIt should be noted that, unlike for academic subjects, there is not an agr\need classification of jobs as STEM or non-STEM.  Some judgement has to necessarily be used in analysing data to build up a picture of the 'STEM workforce', and different classifications can give slightly different results\n.\n&#xa0;\nAs part of the BIS-\nfunded STEM diversity programme, the Royal Society \nis\n carrying out a study \nof the \ndiversity of the STEM workforce\n.  This study draws on data from several sources to build a comprehensive picture. \n It will outline a new categorisation of the STEM workforce.\n  \nTheir report \nwill be published early in 2014 and will help us to understand further where women\n,\n and other underrepresented groups, go when they leave STEM education or careers. \n The Royal Academy of Engineering has also carried out analysis of the engin\neering workforce \nas\n part of the STEM diversity programme.\n&#xa0;Q 174-176: Does the Government have any data on where women go when they leave academic STEM research careers?There is no single source of data for people leaving academic research careers as this\n information would be held by the HEIs individually and would require evidence from exit interviews being collated.\nThere is information available on people leaving academic study, and\n \nthe HESA Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) Survey is the most authoritative source of data of where people go on completing first degrees and post graduate degrees.  \nHESA data shows the following about \n2011/12 STEM doctoral graduates:\n&#xa0;\nHESA data shows the following about the STEM workforce:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Destinations of UK &amp; EU domiciled STEM doctorate leavers by genderUK HEIs\nSix months after graduating AY 2011/12\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNumbersPercentageActivityFemaleMaleFemaleMaleUK work\n1,880\n1,955\n72.9%\n69.1%\nOverseas work\n285\n490\n11.1%\n17.3%\nWork and further study\n115\n105\n4.5%\n3.7%\nFurther study\n80\n90\n3.1%\n3.2%\nUnemployed\n115\n130\n4.5%\n4.6%\nOther\n105\n60\n4.0%\n2.2%\nTotal with known activity2,5852,835100.0%100.0%Unknown\n955\n1,065\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTotal3,5403,900&#xa0;&#xa0;Source: HESA DLHE Survey\nAlthough it is currently unclear where women go once they leave research careers, we do know that once people leave academic careers and take a career break it is difficult for them to return. \nThe Daphne Jackson Trust supports women and men who take career breaks from academic research and then wish to return. This scheme has been shown to be highly effective. To date they have supported 250 fellows (8 of whom were men). \n \n7 out of 10 fellows con\ntinue in research for at least 2 years after the end of their fellowship and many continue with research well after this time.  If fellows move out of research after their fellowship they often continue working in a STEM related field, such as teaching or \nscientific publishing and these are people who were not actively using their STEM qualifications during their career break, so they have been pulled back into the STEM workforce. \n&#xa0;\nQ 198-199: Could the Government confirm the timetable for the new teaching capital fund, including when the competition will be designed (by HEFCE) and when the first awards will be made?&#xa0;On 30 September David Willetts\n announced a Spending Review commitment to provide a competitive £200 million STEM capital teaching fund for inv\nestment in Higher Education Institutions.\n  \nThis new funding will be allocated to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) in the 2015-16 Financial Year, for distribution to institutions during that year. In practice, this means funding will\n begin to flow to successful institutions towards the end of the 2014/15 academic year.  \n&#xa0;\nThe details of how we want HEFCE to operate this funding pot will be outlined in the annual HEFCE Grant Letter that is due to be published by the middle of January 2\n014. HEFCE will then provide guidance to higher education institutions in \nS\npring 2014 on how to bid for the funding available.\n&#xa0;\nThe broad criteria that we will ask HEFCE to apply when administering this funding are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ: We would like a consistent time series showing total government funding for initiatives to increase diversity and equality in the workforce in STEM in each year of the current and previous spending review period.  Could you please provide us with figures on total government funding in each year from 2008-09 to 2014-15 for initiatives specifically aimed at promoting diversity and equality in STEM careers funded Government, including those administered or funded by NDPBs such as the national academies and research councils.In line with the Government’s approach to mainstream equality and diversity\n,\n many of our programmes contribute to the aim of in\ncreasing the diversity of the STEM workforce.  Table 1 below shows the funding for equality and diversity specific projects.  Table 2 shows funding for our wider programme to stimulate the STEM pipeline and which contributes to the equality and diversity i\nssue.  The tables include BIS funded programmes and those of some partner bodies including those specifically listed by the Committee.   It should be noted that the National Academies are not NDPBs.  \nThey are independent, self-governing bodies\n that receive\n Government funding for specific programmes and projects\n.  \nThe Higher Education Funding Council for England\n \n(HEFCE) allocates funding to promote widening participation in higher education, some of which supports outreach to students\n from disadvantaged bac\nkgrounds\n who will go on to study STEM subjects.\nThe Research Councils support for promoting equality and diversity in STEM careers is embedded within the Vitae® Programme\n and its focus on the implementation of the Concordat to Support the Career Developme\nnt of Researchers.\n \n Vitae is funded by RCUK and the UK Funding Bodies.\nThe Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers sets out a vision of working practices, roles and responsibilities that the signatories believe will further the attractiv\neness and sustainability of research careers in the UK, and thus ensure the continued provision of well-trained, talented and motivated researchers that is essential to the continuation of our research excellence.\n&#xa0;\nThe 'Every researcher counts'\n \nresources \nto improve equality and diversity for research staff within the HE sector was funded by HEFCE with support from\n&#xa0;\nthe other HE funding bodies and is being delivered by Vitae. This project has developed a network of equality and diversity champions; produced \nresources and case studies for staff developers to embed in training materials for PIs and supervisors and disseminate resources and case studies through national and regional events. The next stages of the project are now also embedded within the Vitae pr\nogramme\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\nTable 1: Diversity Activities funded by BIS&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFinancial Year&#xa0;\n2008-092009-102010-112011-122012-132013-142014-15&#xa0;£\n£\n£\n£\n£\n£\n£\nRoyal Academy of Engineering&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLeading Diversity in Engineering (inc £200k for \nSTEM Diversity Programme)\n0\n0\n0\n275,000\n276,000\n277,000\n278,000\nTotal RAEng000275,000276,000277,000278,000Royal Society&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDorothy Hodgkin Fellowships\n2,922,000\n3,360,000\n3,975,000\n3,779,000\n3,154,000\n2,494,000\n2,031,000\nDiversity \nactivities incl Rosalind Franklin Award\n70,000\n70,000\n70,000\n60,000\n60,000\n60,000\n60,000\nSTEM Diversity Programme\n0\n0\n0\n102,000\n200,000\n200,000\n200,000\nTotal Royal Society2,992,0003,430,0004,045,0003,941,0003,414,0002,754,0002,291,000UK Resource Centre for Women in STEM2,538,0002,443,0002,468,000500,000000Daphne Jackson Trust0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n40,000&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTable 2: Mainstreamed activities from which groups under-represented in STEM derive benefit&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFinancial Year2008-092009-102010-112011-122012-132013-142014-15£\n£\n£\n£\n£\n£\n£\nRoyal Society&#xa0;\nSTEM/education activities\n190,000\n190,000\n190,000\n185,000\n182,000\n177,000\n177,000\nScience communication\n300,000\n300,000\n300,000\n515,000\n515,000\n515,000\n515,000\nTotal Royal Society490,000490,000490,000700,000697,000692,000692,000Royal Academy of Engineering&#xa0;\nBEST Programme\n607,000\n631,000\n657,000\n0\n0\n0\n0\nPublic engagement\n482,000\n487,000\n512,000\n354,000\n353,000\n353,000\n352,000\nTotal RAEng1,089,0001,118,0001,169,000354,000353,000353,000352,000British Academy375,000375,000475,000&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1,270,000STEMNET5,850,0006,303,4006,787,5006,399,3603,423,6645,009,2666,300,000WISE (via STEMNET)\n40,00040,00040,0000000Big Bang Fair0350,000350,000350,000350,000350,000350,000National Science and Engineering Week322,000332,000504,000540,000540,000540,000540,000National Science + Engineering Competion150,000260,000660,000660,000660,000660,000660,000&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.vitae.ac.uk/\n http://www.vitae.ac.uk/policy-practice/462601/Every-Researcher-Counts-resources.html\n In addition the Research Councils provide funding for individual Daphne Jackson Trust Fellowships\n \nInc\nluding\n \nh\nard to reach schools grants\n \nDependent on Efficiency and Reform Group agreement.\n \nInc\nludes the s\nchools programme\n:\n To provide the national fram\nework that excites and inspires young people through first-hand involvement in student-led creative projects in science and technology.\n"
