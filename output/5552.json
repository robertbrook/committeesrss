"&#xa0;\nSubmission from the US Embassy, LondonThe U.S.-UK Relationship (USA 20)Our Story\nRelations between the United States and the United Kingdom are unlike those between any other two countries.  \nThe Times of London wrote in 1913, “\nGreat Britain and the United States\n stand to one another in a special relationship, and between them some departure from the merely official attitude is most natural.”\n  The relationship is still \nspecial and it is still \nnatural\n.  In a 20\n12\n poll, \nninety \npercent of the American public \nviewed \nthe United Kingdom \nfavorably and the trend was rising\n. \n \nPr\nesident Obama \nreflected the American view when he said\n, “…our people – and the people around the world – are more secure and more prosperous when the United States and the United Kingdom stand toget\nher.”\nThe history of the U.S.-UK relationship is not one of unrelieved harmony starting, as it did, with the American Revolutionary War and carrying on into the War of 1812.  \nDuring the \ntwenty-year period from 1895 to 1915\n, historians note that \nU.S. and Br\nitish foreign policies moved into general\n, cooperative\n alignment; they call it the “Great Rapprochement.”  \nW\nhen the U.S. in 1917 overcame its reluctance to ent\ner World War I, \nit \nclearly \nwould do so on the side of the Anglo-French Entente.  \nPresident Woodrow Wilson said the U.S. \nentered the war\n “to make the world safe for democracy.” \n \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt \nechoed that theme \nwhen he announced in 1940 the \nU.S. \nintention to serve as the “Arsenal of Democracy\n” even before entering World Wa\nr II\n,\n and in the 1941 Atlantic Charter, in which Roosevelt and \nWinston \nChurchill pledged to advance democracy around the world after the defeat of Nazi Germany. \n \nThe wartime alliance\n -- \nbased \no\nn joint planning and shared intelligence -- \nproved resilient as\n the U\nnited States\n and UK partnered \nwith \nother \nallies \nto win the Cold War and then to deal with post-Cold War terrorism threats.\n  \nAll along, however, there have been areas of disagreement, as one would expect between two countries \nwith\n global interests.  In the longer sweep of history,\n however,\n what appeared to be fundamental U.S.-UK disagreements now look like\n dated\n disagreements.\n  Most Americans probably are more understanding of the UK’s refusal to commit troops to Vietnam than the A\nmerican public was at the time.  The Skybolt affair\n, which involved\n nuclear weapons \nsystems\n,\n bedeviled the otherwise excellent relationship between John Kennedy and Harold Macmillan\n.  F\nar from marking “the end of the special relationship\n,\n” as was \nthen \nfear\ned\n,\n \ntoday \nit is \nbarely remembered.  Issues have come and gone, the \nstrong \nrelationship has endured.\nClose by Values, Close by Choice\nThe U.S.-UK relationship withst\nood\n shocks because \nit is based\n largely\n on common values (which usually\n,\n but not always\n,\n lead to shared interests)\n.  It’s also\n based on the American and British publics’ preference for each other’s products, \nmanagement styles, \nculture, entertainment, and sense of humor.\n  \nMonty Python and Benedict Cumberbatch’s Sherlock Holmes are hugely popul\nar in the United States\n, as is “Downton Abbey”\n (but Marmite has yet to gain a foothold in \nAmerica\n)\n;  \n”Homeland” \n is the top-rated show\n \nwith British audiences\n.  \nWe are the largest investors in each other’s economies and high\n, mutual\n levels of tourism and \nforeign \nstudy reflect personal \nchoices\n by Americans and Britons to remain close\n.\n  It is not simply a matter of a shared language.  Many countries share languages but lack the instinctive affinity that exists between the United States and the United Kingdom\n.  Americans \nknow more place names from Lon\ndon (Westminster, Baker Street,\n Trafalgar Square, Hyde Park, \nCharing Cross\n) than they do from \nsome\n \nAmerican cities.  Britons have an enduring fascination with the American West\n, jazz, and Hollywood personalities\n,\n and British tabloids have a \nstrong predilection for \ncarrying \nAmerican human interest stories\n.  If evidence is needed that this shared \nattraction\n is \npersisting\n, consider that \na large part\n of America’s youth have grown up \nimagining themselves \nin Middle Eart\nh, Narnia, \nor at Hogwarts.\n  \nMeanwhile, Elvis Presley, Madonna, and Michael Jackson are among the ten top-selling artists ever in the UK.\n  \nPart of the enduring strength of U.S.-UK relations \nalso \ncomes from \nsocietal similarities and \nshared challenges.  \nEconomic success, political stability, and rootedness in freedom and liberty have made both the United States and the United Kingdom attractive countries for immigrants.  In 1960, the foreign\n-\nborn population of both the U\nnited States\n and the UK was around \n5 percent.  Today, the number for both countries\n is around 12 percent.  \nThe U.S. and UK are joint leaders in higher education.  Most international \ncomparisons\n show that American and British universities dominate the ranks of the world’s \ntop\n twenty universi\nties.  In science and research, American and British scientists win a disproportionate number of Nobel prizes.  \nT\nhe text of the U.S. Supreme Court’s \n2008 \nBoumediene decision\n, \nregarding a Guantanamo detainee\n, is a \ntelling indicator of \nthe \ndepth \nof \nU.S.-UK h\nistory, shared culture, and common social challenges\n.  The U.S. Supreme Court \nmade\n \ntwo dozen\n references to English law\n as precedent-setting in the course of its reasoning.  Relying on the decisions of foreign courts is distinctly outside of American\n legal\n tradition.  \nFor the U.S. Supreme Court to cite English law, and for it to \ndo so\n without \narousing \ncomment, says much about the U.S.-UK relationship.\n  \n&#xa0;\nSharing the World’s Stage\nU.S. and UK influence on o\nne another is profound, but \nthe special relationship \nhas \nalso \nhad a great impact \non the world stage\n.\n  \nAt the most fundamental level, the U\nnited States\n and the UK share a “maritime outlook” that prevai\nls over isolationist tendencies.  We believe \ntrade with the world is basic to our pr\nosperity, our national security is tied to events beyond our shores, and the well-being of our countries \ndepends on\n influenc\ning\n developments in other countries.  The United Kingdom’s military capabilities, development assistance budget, and unparalleled “s\noft power” make it a uniquely capable ally for the United States.  \nAs two of \nthe \nfive permanent members of the UN Security Council, the U\nnited States\n and UK speak with rare international authority.  Their shared memberships in NATO, the OECD, the OSCE, an\nd other organizations provide additional\n venues\n in which\n to cooperate to\n their\n international \nadvantage\n.\n  Beyond that, the UK is a member of the world’s most important organization to which the United States does not belong, the European Union.  \nThe United States has \nits own \nclose ties to the EU and does not need the UK to serve as a “bridge” to the organization\n.  B\nut common U.S.-UK attitudes towards world trade, development policy, the value of international sanctions, and other issues, often fin\nd an expression within the EU through UK membership, to the benefit of both the U\nnited \nS\ntates\n and the EU.\n  \nThe United States and the United Kingdom have shared values, a history of global involvement, and a common vision of the world we seek – one of resp\nect f\nor the rule of law, \neconomic development, environme\nntal protection, a liberal trading\n system,\n democracy,\n peace, and one which values a plurality of cultures and religions.  \nTogether, we \nact\n internationally\n to promote\n “fundamental human rights, the dig\nnity and worth of people, the equal rights of men and women, and better standards of life in larger freedom.”  Those are not just American \nand\n British goals\n:\n the words are taken from the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations.  The kind of world we \nwant to live in is much more likely to \nbe \nachieve\nd\n \nwhen \nthe U\nnited \nS\ntates\n and the U\nnited \nK\ningdom\n work together\n.\nJanuary 2014\n \n&#xa0;\n"
