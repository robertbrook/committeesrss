defaultSince the online age verification laws came into force in the UK in September 2007, the children’s organizations have not been made aware of a single instance where a child has 
defaultbeaten the system and got online to gamble. There have been instances where a child has “borrowed” a parent’s credit or debit card and has been able to pass themselves off as the parent, but that raises different issues. There is nothing that laws can do about that, neither is there an easily foreseeable technology fix that can solve it. However, we are not aware of any instances where a child was able to lie about their age and get away with it in an online environment, as they used to do quite easily before the law was changed. By comparison it may not be so difficult to “

defaultThe law should never require an online gambling [operator] to get everything 100% right 100% of the time. That is impossible. But society is entitled to expect gambling web sites to be able to demonstrate that they are making reasonable efforts. Asking someone to tick a box to confirm their age, without more, is not reasonable. It is negligent.”

default“The previous Government sensibly introduced workable age-verification restrictions on online gambling sites in 2005, an excellent model that works well and searches financial and electoral databases to verify that users are old enough to enter the site and engage in the gambling within. It is a workable model, the previous Government introduced it, and they are to be commended for doing so.”
