defaultKey points:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestions
defaultHow robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report? Have the IPCC adequately addressed criticisms of 
defaultprevious reports? How much scope is there to question of the report’s conclusions?
defaultTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?
defaultCan any of the areas of the science now be 
defaultconsidered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which?  What areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?
defaultHow ef
defaultfective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying what is meant by uncertainty in scientific terms? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?
defaultDoes the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?
defaultHas AR5 sufficiently explained the re
defaultasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?
defaultDo the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to 
defaultprevent dangerous climate change?
defaultWhat implications do the IPCC’s conclu
defaultsions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report have for policy making both nationally and internationally?
defaultIs the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?
defaultTo what extent did political intervention influence the final conclusions of the AR5 Physical Sci
defaultence Basis summary?
defaultIs the rate at which the UK Government intends to cut CO2 emissio
defaultns appropriate in light of the findings of the IPCC AR5 Physical Science Basis report?
defaultWhat relevance do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget?
