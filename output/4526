[normal]Questions
[normal]How robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report? Have the IPCC adequately addressed criticisms of 
[normal]previous reports? How much scope is there to question of the report’s conclusions?
[normal]To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?
[normal]Can any of the areas of the science now be 
[normal]considered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which?  What areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?
[normal]How ef
[normal]fective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying what is meant by uncertainty in scientific terms? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?
[normal]Does the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?
[normal]Has AR5 sufficiently explained the re
[normal]asons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?
[normal]Do the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to 
[normal]prevent dangerous climate change?
[normal]What implications do the IPCC’s conclu
[normal]sions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report have for policy making both nationally and internationally?
[normal]Is the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?
[normal]To what extent did political intervention influence the final conclusions of the AR5 Physical Sci
[normal]ence Basis summary?
[normal]Is the rate at which the UK Government intends to cut CO2 emissio
[normal]ns appropriate in light of the findings of the IPCC AR5 Physical Science Basis report?
[normal]What relevance do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget?
