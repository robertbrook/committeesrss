"BRC30\n&#xa0;\nSubmission from Philip Fagg, Managing Director, G.W. &amp; E. Wright Ltd Electrical ContractorsRe: Electric Safety in the home.\nHaving been in the Electrical Contracting Industry for over forty years it is only in recent times that I have felt that Quality Electricians are finally being recognised.\nThe Part P Scheme was introduced to outlaw Rogue Traders in our industry. To a point this worked. The shortfall is that the policing has not been as stringent as the Gas Safe Scheme which works because its legislation.\nAs time has moved on the scheme is recognised by contractors and the fact that most micro businesses are affiliated to one of the Part P Registration Schemes is testament to its success.\nI still believe the general public, especially need to have confidence in a register where they can be assured of a professional trained electrician whom will not only carry out the work safely but be at a price which is reflective of the market. It is not right for all to be within one register when it is clear that they do not meet the standard that others believe the public deserve.\nI believe that the Electrical Safety Register now created by the Electrical Safety Council provides this service and by the fact that it represents 80% of the Contractors within the industry, all of whom have to undergo stringent tests on both quality and compliance is testament to that.\nFor too many years I have seen my industry dragged through the press highlighting bad workmanship, now we have the opportunity to clear this up and to attempt to outlaw the DIYers and Cowboys that do us this harm.\nI implore you to support the ongoing work by my industry to promote Part P to improve awareness amongst consumers and specifiers and to improve enforcement and policing amongst contractors\nWe do need your support for the Electrical Safety Register as this provides clarity for consumers and specifiers who many not necessarily understand the requirements under the Building Regulations; and for this reason, is something which the industry has long been calling on industry to create\n27\nth\n November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
