"&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Amnesty International UK (LAI 0052)&#xa0;&#xa0;\nAmnesty International UK is a national section of a global movement of over three million supporters, members and activists. We represent more than 230,000 supporters in the UK. Collectively, our vision is of a world in which every \nperson enjoys all of the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. Our mission is to undertake research and action focused on preventing and ending grave abuses of these rights. We\n are independent of any government, political ideology, economic interest or religion.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;In April 2013, the Government launched a consultation concerning proposed legal aid reforms. Such proposals were containe\nd in the\n Ministry of Justice’s c\nonsultation \np\naper entitled “Transforming legal aid: delivering a more \ncredible and efficient system”, which proposes \nsignificant reforms to both civil and criminal legal aid in England and Wales. \n&#xa0;\nThese proposals follow unprecedent\ned legal aid cuts introduced by the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, which came into force on 1 April 2013.\n&#xa0;\nAmnesty International UK submitted a written response to the consultation on 3 June 2013, during the course of which we e\nxpressed serious concerns. Those concerns will be repeated herein. \n&#xa0;\nIn September 2013, the Government published its revised proposals and launched an associated consultation. Those proposals can be \nlocated in the Ministry \nof Justice’s consultation p\naper e\nntitled “Transforming Legal Aid: Next steps”. This consultation ends on 18 October 2013. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nOn 18 July 2013\n, the \nJ\noint Committee on Human Rights launched\n an inquiry into the implications for access to justice of certain of the Government’s proposals to reform legal aid\n. \nThe Committee seeks evidence \nin relation to the \nissues raised by the \nGovernment’s legal aid\n proposals\n,\n in particular:\n&#xa0;\nAmnesty International UK is seriously concerned that the \nGovernment’s legal aid \nproposals will deny legal aid and access to justice to vulnerable individuals \nand \nseverely inhibit\n the ability of individuals to hold to account public officials and bodies for their actions\n and decisions.\n These proposals will directly undermine respect for human rights and the rule of law\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nLegal aid is a cornerstone of any fair and efficient justic\ne system; indeed, the Lord Chancellor states in his Ministerial Foreword \nto the \nfirst c\nonsultation \np\naper\n– \n&#xa0;\n“Access to justice should not be determined by your ability to pay, and I am clear that legal aid is the hallmark of a fair, open justice system.”\n&#xa0;\nUnprecedented cuts to legal aid in April 2013, in addition to reductions over the past decade, have prevented thousands of people, including the most vulnerable, from accessing legal advice and asserting their rights as well as placing extraordinary strain\n on the legal profession and courts across the country. \n&#xa0;\nThe Lord Chancellor argues that the public has lost confidence in the legal aid system. No evidence has been offered in support of this statement. It is our view th\nat \nrespect for the rule of law, \nan\nd the principle of equality before the law, are much valued traditions in this country. \n&#xa0;\nIt is our view that rather than saving significant sums, as is the proposed intent of the Government, these proposals will place unprecedented strain on the courts wi\nth the rise of litigants in person. \n&#xa0;\nThose who will be excluded from legal aid as a result of these proposals include some of the most vulnerable people in our society including -  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;The Government’\ns first c\nonsultation \np\naper posed the following question - \n&#xa0;Question 1: Do you agree with the proposal that criminal legal aid for prison law matters should be restricted to the proposed criteria?&#xa0;\nIn the subsequent consultation pape\nr, it is confirmed that the scope of prison law legal aid will be reduced substantially though the Government has modified the original proposal so that legal aid will remain for proceedings before the Parole Board where the Board has the power to direct r\nelease. \n&#xa0;\nThough we welcome that modification, substantial concerns persist. We do not agree with the proposal to remove matters from scope. Ensuring the rights of prisoners is vital; see \nGolder\n v UK [1975] 1 EHRR 524\n. Prison law is a specialist \nfield \ndistinct from criminal law. Advice and representation in the prison law field is provided by highly specialist legal aid providers\n.\n These proposals will negatively impact on such \nproviders and place at risk that specialism and, indeed, the continuing quali\nty of advice and representation. \nThese proposals will have a severe impact on migrants detained in prison at the end of their criminal sentence under immigration act powers. Such detention is without time limit and without any routine judicial oversight. T\nhe detainee only appears before a court or tribunal if he or she is able to instigate this. Detention under immigration act powers is frequently lengthy, sometimes for many years with no automatic judicial oversight of the decision to detain.  \n&#xa0;\nWe are par\nticularly concerned about \nthe impact on \nforeign national prisoners with mental health problems. In the past year, the Government has been found to have failed in respect of its obligations under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights for its \ntreatment of foreign national ex-offenders with mental health problems on four separate occasions. Furthermore, those with a history of torture and ill-treatment, those in need of medical care and those with a limited command of English are at particular r\nisk. If the proposals are implemented, there will be no legal aid to bring cases on prison conditions. There will be no legal aid to address treatment by staff such as bullying, abuse or discrimination.  \n&#xa0;\nWe are also particularly concerned by the impact o\nn foreign national women prisoners who may have additional vulnerabilities including mental or physical health problems. Matters impacted by these proposals include admission to mother and baby units, medical care and other issues of vital importance. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The proposal, stated at paragraphs 3.48 and 3.59 of the\n \nfirst\n consultation\n paper\n, provides that in order to be eligible for civil legal aid, an application must satisfy a two limb “residence test”:\n&#xa0;\n(i)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA person must be “lawfully resident in the UK at the time the application for legal aid is made; and \n(ii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMust have been “lawfully resident” in the UK for a continuous period of at least 12 months at some point. \n&#xa0;\nThe legal aid provider will be required to re\ntain evidence that their client satisfies\n both limbs of the test.\n&#xa0;\nThree exceptions to the above test were \nincluded\n - \n&#xa0;\n(i)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere will be an exception for UK armed forces personnel and their immediate families. \n&#xa0;\n(ii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere will also be an exception for asylum seek\ner only whilst their asylum claim is pending. If the asylum application is successful, legal aid funding will continue for an on-going legal aid matter, but not for any new matter. Such persons will need to satisfy the second limb of the test and wait unti\nl they can demonstrate 12 months lawful residence. If the asylum application is refused, at this stage the exception will no longer apply. \n&#xa0;\n(iii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government has stated legal aid will continue to be available where necessary to ensure compliance with obligat\nions under EU and international law. Precise details are not set out in the consultation document. \n&#xa0;\nSome modifications to the proposal are contained within the September 2013 consultation paper. \n&#xa0;\nAmnesty International believes that the proposal would be \nadministratively unworkable and \nprohibitively \nexpensive. Examples of different groups who will be excluded include \n-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAmnesty International UK believes that the introductio\nn of such a test is a threat to the rule of law and equality before the law. We do not agree with this proposal nor do we agree with the way in which the proposal has been framed. Whether an individual has accrued twelve months lawful residence in the UK i\ns not an adequate or reasonable test of whether a person has a “strong connection” to the UK. It is unacceptable to deny any group of people access to the courts and thus justice.\n&#xa0;\nThe proposal would render significant numbers of people at risk of abuses o\nf power and arbitrary decision-making because they are excluded from the protection of the law. Individuals officials and \nand\n public bodies can act with impunity, as there will be little risk of legal sanction for unlawful action. The proposal will impact \nthe most vulnerable members of our society, including mentally ill immigration detainees, survivors of human trafficking, destitute families, vulnerable women and children. \n&#xa0;\nFurthermore, we believe that the proposal would be administratively unworkable an\nd \nprohibitively \nexpensive. The proposal will impose significant evidentiary hurdles and effectively requires all legal aid providers, in any discipline of law, to have a detailed knowledge and understanding of immigration law. The question of lawful reside\nnce is a complex legal issue and one which practitioners will be unable to resolve in many cases. Furthermore, the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) will face a significant administrative burden in determining whether lawful evidence has been sufficiently \nestablished\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe proposal is likely to lead to an increase in litigants in persons who without legal aid will have no option but to bring the case themselves without legal assistance, placing great strain on the courts with cases that are poorly prepared and poorly arg\nued. \nOur organisation is of the view that legal aid must be available for those pursuing an asylum claim, as well as those who seek to pursue further representations (including a fresh claim for asylum). Persons pursuing such claims may have fled serious \nhuman rights violations, be traumatised or face significant infringement of their human rights\n on return to their country of origin\n; as such they constitute an inherently vulnerable group. In these circumstances it would also be the case that they \nwill\n fin\nd \nit difficult to pursue such a case without access to publicly funded and good quality legal representation. \nWe are also particularly concerned that individuals and/or families pursuing cases concerning Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Right\ns do not qualify for legal aid any longer, \nincluding making\n an application to the immigration authorities \nand/\nor pursuing an appeal. \n&#xa0;\nPersons pursuing such claims face significant infringement of their human rights; the cases are often of fundamental and \nprofound importance to the parties concerned, particularly in those cases that concern the potential separation of family members and/or children. \n&#xa0;\nMany would find it extremely difficult to pursue such a case without access to publicly funded and good qua\nlity legal advice and representation. In addition, the law in this regard is particularly complex. This is evident by the significant amount of judicial time devoted by the courts, both domestically in the UK (particularly in the higher courts, including t\nhe Supreme Court and its predecessor) and the European Court of Hum\nan Rights, to cases concerning A\nrticle 8 and its interpretation. The frequency with which factual, evidential and procedural issues arise in such cases, the inability of many individuals to\n navigate the case themselves, especially for those for whom English is not a first language, and the lack of effective alternatives to specialist advice\n,\n result in our belief that the \nlack\n of funding in such cases is extremely regrettable. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe proposal, stated at paragraphs 3.69 and 3.77 of the\n first\n consultation\n paper\n, is that solicitors should only be paid for work carried out on an application for permission if the Court grants permission. \n&#xa0;\nIn the \nsecond c\nonsultation paper, a modified proposal was advanced. The proposed change is to introduce discretion to permit the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) to pay provide\nrs\n \nin certain cases concluding \nprior to a permission decision without a costs order or agreement.\n \n&#xa0;\nWe do not agree with these proposals, which are likely to have a serious detrimental effect on access to justice. Judicial review is a vital mechanism in holding to account the decisions of public officials and bodies. Given the precarious situation in whi\nch \nlegal aid providers find themselves, even \nindividuals\n with meritorious cases are likely to experience severe difficulties in accessing representation given that legal aid providers will under these proposals not be paid for any of their work unless and \nuntil permission if granted. Such work is “at risk” and therefore poses a direct liability to the legal aid provider who is likely to be constrained as to the cases that they are willing to take. \n&#xa0;\nFurthermore, the Government’s proposed change to allow the\n Legal Aid Agency such a discretion as outlined above, does not negate our concerns. The frequency with which th\nis discretion will be exercised, and in which circumstances, \nis unknown. \n&#xa0;\nThe consultation ignores the fact that many public law issues can be \nand, indeed, are resolved without the need for permission to be granted. This includes scenarios where the decision under challenge is so clearly deficient that the decision maker withdraws or changes it as soon as \na\n challenge is commenced.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe proposal, stated at paragraph 3.86 and 3.89 of the consultation, is to abolish the “borderline” prospects success category, meaning that these cases would cease to qualify for legal aid. \n&#xa0;\nWe do not ag\nree with these proposals. We believe that such proposals will render whole groups of people, including the most vulnerable, unable to hold to account public officials and bodies for poor, unlawful or unfair decisions, even when serious human rights issues \narise. This directly undermines respect for human rights and the rule of law. \n&#xa0;\nSuch cases are relatively few and the projected savings contained in the consultation document are very limited. Not only is it frequently extremely difficult to judge prospect\ns of success before preparing a case, such cases frequently involve matters of particular importance to the litigant. Very few people can bring forward a judicial review claim without the assistance of legal aid. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAmnesty International UK is seriously concerned that the \nGovernment’s legal aid \nproposals will deny legal aid protection and access to justice to poor and vulnerable people \nand \nseverely inhibit\n the ability of individuals to hold to account public bodies an\nd officials for their actions\n and decisions\n. These proposals will directly undermine respect for human rights and the rule of law.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe legal aid sector is a difficult arena in which to operate for legal representatives, given the reductions in funds that\n have occurred over the past decade or more. We are aware of reputable law firms that have closed and other\ns\n who have seriously restricted their work \nas a result of previous reforms. For instance,\n the closure of \nboth \nRefugee and Migrant Justice\n and the Imm\nigration Advisory Service in recent years\n, organisation\ns\n of significant size\n and prominence\n, creating par\nticular strain upon the refugee and immigration sector.  \n&#xa0;\nExpert legal advice and representation at an early stage results in a fairer consideration \no\nf legal and factual issues\n and can reduce the need for costly appeals in many cases. The proposals in their current form could result in the further closure of reputable law firms and departments who will be unable to continue their work.\n&#xa0;\nAs an organisation, Amnesty International is unable to provide legal advice or representation, to those who require it. We do receive a significant number of enquiries from persons who seek advice on how to locate legal representation and/or other services\n, including from persons in detention. Our organisation devotes a significant proportion of our resources in responding to such enquiries. We strive to help such people by referring them to experienced legal specialists who can provide representation in th\neir clients’ best interests. This is very difficult in some parts of the country where the impact of past cuts means that good quality legal representation is \nextremely \nhard to find.   \n&#xa0;\nWe believe that the impact of these proposals, should they become a r\neality, will be felt widely by charities and voluntary sector organisations. We are concerned about the implications for Non-Governmental Organisations and voluntary sector organisations, which are ill-equipped for this purpose. We believe that such organi\nsations will be overwhelmed with enquiries which they are not resourced to manage; many such organisations also face significant financial and resource challenges in these difficult times. \n&#xa0;\nAmnesty International UK believes that the result of these propos\nals will be further restriction\ns\n on the ability of individuals to access publicly funded and good quality representation and restriction\ns\n on the ability of representatives to discharge their duties to a professional standard. In conclusion, any further red\nuction in \nlegal aid funding would be unwelcome and lead to serious negative consequences. \n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n10\n&#xa0;\n Amnesty International UK, ‘\nGovernment's legal aid cuts threaten to 'decimate' access to justice - new warning’ (\n03 June 201\n3) \nh\nttp://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=20806\n"
