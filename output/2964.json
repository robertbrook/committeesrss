"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Council of the Isles of Scilly (TIC 116)\n&#xa0;\nIn response for your request to provide evidence on passenger transport in isolated communities we refer directly to your suggested bullet points. In addition in order to provide a more detailed understanding of transport issues in small island communities we have also attached three documents; 2 related to medical transport (one of which directly reports on issues caused by adverse weather) and the other a broader piece of work comparing the current economic and connectivity situations in the Isles of Scilly and comparing them to other similar island communities, mainly in Scotland (with sections 2.9 inter-island transport, 2.11.1 Sustainable transport strategy findings and 3 links to the mainland of particular relevance). \nAlthough outside the scope of the questions put in the press notice for this inquiry\n,\n one other area of transport \nin isolated communities of \nparticular\n importance to\n our island\ns\n and economy, is the role of transport in import and export of material. This applies to mail, perishable goods, supplies manufactured items, building materials etc. The role and importance of a regular affordable and efficient universal\n mail delivery service cannot be understated.\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
