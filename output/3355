defaultAbout The Royal College of Pathologistsdefault&#xa0;default1.1
default              
defaultThe Royal College of Pathologists (RCPath) is a professional membership organisation with charitable status. It is committed to setting and maintaining professional standards and to promoting excellence in the teaching and practice of pathology. 
defaultPathology 
defaultis the science at the heart of modern medicine and is 
defaulta core component in 70
default%
default of clinical interventions (di
defaultagnosis, 
defaultchoice of treatment, efficacy of treatment)
default. The College aims to advance the science and practice of pathology, to provide public education,
default to promote research in pathology and to disseminate the results. We have members across 19 
defaultspecialties 
defaultworking in hospital laboratories, universities and industry worldwide to diagnose, treat and prevent illness.
default2default              defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;default2.1
default              
defaultIn this submission 
defaultthe 
defaultRCPath focusses on where efficiency ga
defaultins can be made and where there 
defaultis a risk of money being wasted.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultPathology is a major clinical service and is involved in most clinical interventions. 
defaultIt drives most 
defaulthealthcare decisions
default and is a core componen
defaultt in 70
default%
default of clinical interventions (diagnosis, choice of treatment, efficacy of treatment). 
defaultIt employs 25,000 staff and costs the NHS in the order of £2.5 billi
defaulton a year, representing nearly 
default4%
default of total NHS expenditure.
default 
defaultDemand across virtually all discipli
defaultnes of pathology has been rising at an average of 10
default%
default per annum between 2003-2006 (latest available figures).
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultThe 
defaultReport of the Second Phase of the Review of NHS Pat
defaulthology Services in England
default (The 
defaultCarter Review) suggested that savings of between 10
default%
default a
defaultnd 20
default%
default could be achieved through the reconfiguration and consolidation of pathology services. At a national level, this would imply annual savings of £250 
default-
default £500 million in total, based on figures for 2005.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultThe 
defaultRCPath welcomes this opportunity to 
defaultsubmit evidence to the Health Select Committee on this important issue.
default&#xa0;
default3.default              defaultEvidence that defaultrequests for defaultpathology tests and services defaultare defaultvariabledefault&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultThe increasing importance of pathology in relation to healthcare cannot be overstated. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThere has been a large rise in requests for pathology tests over the past decade, with the not unexpected associated effect on expenditure. Much of this rise seen in pathology test use is justified, and can be related to the development of new clinical gui
defaultdance, patient pathways, health screening initiatives, Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF) targets and the availability of new, more useful tests – especially in the field of 
defaultmolecular pathology.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultThere are a number of reasons 
defaultwhy 
defaultdemand for pathology services 
defaultis 
defaultlikely to continue to rise:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultThere is also evidence that shows 
defaulta 
defaultconsiderable level of inappropriate requesting
default -
default some have estimated this to be anywhere between 
default5%
default and 98
default% (
defaultVan Walraven C, Naylor CD. 
defaultDo we know what inappropriate laboratory utilization is? A systematic review of laboratory clinical audits
default. JAMA 1998; 280: 550-
default55
default8).
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultMany benchmarking studies have been carried out looking at the variation in laboratory test ordering between countries, regions and individual hospital wards or general practices. 
defaultThe Diagnostic Atlas of Variation
default uses audit data that collects information 
defaultabout the entire GP pathology workload reported within England. The data highlights huge differences in test requesting rates for commonly requested 
defaulttests, much of which cannot be 
defaultexpl
defaultained by differences in patient 
defaultcase mix between primary care trusts or 
defaultgeneral practices. 
defaultWhile there may be other factors to explain 
defaultsome of the variation, t
defaulthe implication is that there are large instances of both over-requesting and under-requesting of pathology tests.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultWhile this may be down to variable knowledge of ho
defaultw to b
defaultest use laboratory tests among
default GPs, there is also the problem of specific test availability, with an effective “diagnostics by postcode” system in place
default. This means
default that some of the newer tests are not available at all in some regions of the country 
defaultdue to cost or lack of awareness
default. An example of this is
default defaultB-type natriuretic peptide
default defaulttesting for heart failure, where there is patchy use ranging from high to none at all.
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultInappropriate over-testing has significant effects on financial expenditure, not only on the direct cost to the laboratory, but also as a result of the costs of subsequent 
defaultunnecessary, knock-
defaulton investigations that may be ordered following the inevitable fa
defaultlse positive result. The damage to patient care may
default,
default however
default,
default be even more significant, with inappropriate investigations leading to inappropriate interpretation and indeed incorrect diagnoses. In addition, the diversion of much valued resources towards pa
defaultying for unnecessary investigations means that the opportunity cost that could be used to accelerate much needed new developments and services is delayed or even lost. Under-requesting has similar effects with many patients missing out on much needed inves
defaulttigations
default,
default resulting in missed or delayed diagnosis or management.
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default              
defaultPatients rely on their GP
defaults
default to request the right tests to correctly diagnose and monitor a range of health conditions
default, such as diabetes or heart disease
default. GPs also use a range of tests t
defaulto screen people at risk of a disease 
defaulteven where there
default is no evidence of the disease. The National Institute for Health 
defaultand 
defaultCare Excellence (NICE) has issued a number of guidelines for the use of pathology laboratory tests by GPs. Despite this, The Royal Co
defaultllege of Pathologists has evidence that GPs’ use of
default these tests is highly variable. It is 
defaulttoo often not cost-effective and not always in the best interests of patients. The College thinks that more specialist pathologist input into GP requesting of tests c
defaultan improve efficiency.

defaultThe College has collated evidence 
defaultthat

default              
defaultHbA1C (diabetes)default:default defaultO’Kane et al (Anndefaultals of defaultClindefaulticaldefault Biochemdefaultistrydefault 2011;48: 155-158default)
default reported on the requests for  HbA1C (diabetes) and thyroid function tests in one year by 58 practices covering 284,609 patients in N
defaultorthern
default Ireland. There was wide variability in test request rates and the practices with the highest requ
defaultest rates for these tests were also the highest requesters for all other blood tests. 
defaultThere was no relationship between request rates for HbA1c and thyroid function and the known prevalence of diabetes and hypothyroidism respectively or with Quality and 
defaultOutcome Framework scores used through the 
defaultGeneral Medical Services 
defaultcontract to remunerate GP practices.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultThe Atlas of Variation Datadefault (not yet published)default defaultshowed wide variation in the testing for and monitoring of ovarian cancer. 
defaultCarbohydrate antigen 125
default (CA-125)
default, is
default 
defaulta protein found on the surface of ovarian cancer cells, and in some normal tissues
default. It 
defaultis a 
defaulttumour marker for ovarian cancer. Traditionally, the C
defaultA-
default125 test has been used to monito
defaultr treatment for ovarian cancer and to 
defaultdetect whether cancer has returned after treatment has been completed. CA-125 is also elevated in association with other ovarian pathologies. Most of the use for both of these tests is in the confirmation of a suspected diagnosis and in the monitoring of t
defaulthe response to treatment. Specialist units are the main users of these tests, although some testing takes place in general practice. Data regarding use of this test is available for Primary Care Trust 
default(PCT) 
defaultlevel only
default.
default&#xa0;default4.4
default              
defaultFor PCTs in England, the estimat
defaulted rate of use for CA
default-
default125 tests ordered by GPs ranged from 0.11 to 9.0 per 1
default,
default000 practice population (80-fold variation). When the five PCTs with the highest estimated rates and the five PCTs with the lowest estimated 
defaultrates are excluded, the range 
defaultis 
default0.92-
default8.4 per 1
default,
default000 practice population and the variation 9-fold. This is not due to differences in the prevalence of ovarian cancer. Some variation probably reflects differences in professional practice and commissioning prioritisation.

defaultt governance protocols. Pathology messages to primary care were intercepted for a period of 23 days in June 2012. In all 1.8 million messages containing samples of 38 million test results for approximately

default              
defaultRegardless of whether the variation reveals over or under requesting, this variation reflects inefficient use of NHS resource and may indicate overall unacceptable levels of health care. 
default&#xa0;
default5.default              defaultPathology Demand Optimisation (PDO)default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultIn 2013, the RCPath set
default up a Pathology Demand Optimisation (PDO) Group comprised of representatives from the major pathology disciplines, pathology societies, industry representatives, the National Pathology Programme and lay involvement. The purpose of this initiative was to al
defaultlow the major pathology stakeholders to work with already established leaders in the field of Laboratory Demand Management research to enable the development of specific Pathology Demand Management Guidance in the form of a toolkit of recommendations and a
default Minimum Retesting Interval (MRI) advisory strategy. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultThe 
defaultuse of 
defaultMRIs is
default of vital importance and aim
defaults
default to define the minimum time interval whereby tests should be repeated
default. This avoids
default unnecessary repeat testing – a common problem in secondary care with laboratory tests frequently being repeated whenever the patient crosses an interface of care
default,
default such as a ward transfer. This is of increasing importance following commissioning and the in
defaultherent risk of multiple pathology providers. While developments with the N
defaulta
defaultt
defaultional Laboratory Medicine Catalogue
default (NLMC)
default, which should improve communication and transferability of pathology 
defaultresults, will help, the availability of consensus, peer reviewed or 
defaultin some cases evidence based MRIs are essential.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultWhen MRIs are defined
default,
default they will need to be implemented.

default The benefits of defining and implementing MRI

defaultIn summary, Pathology Demand Optimisation is of vital importance to 
defaultensure the right test is done to
