"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Malaria Consortium&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;\nMalaria Consortium is one of the world's leadin\ng organisations dedicated to\n comprehensive malaria\n and neglected tropical disease control and child health\n in Africa and Southeast Asia. As an international non-governmental organisation, we undertake programmes in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, \nsurveillance, operational research and health \nsystem strengthening in Nigeria, Uganda, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Mozambique, \nGhana, Senegal, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar\n. While malaria control is at the heart of our strategy, we also\n undertake complementary\n work on\n child health including\n integrated community case management of childhood illness (ICCM)\n, malnutrition\n and the control of \nn\neglected \nt\nropical \nd\niseases (NTDs).\n Our \nconcentration\n is\n on improving access to care for the poorest and most marginalised in society, including women, children and ethnic minorities.\n&#xa0;\nMalaria Consortium \nwelcomes the opportunity to\n have\n input into this \nimportant inquiry. We have focussed our submission on those aspects of democracy and development in Myanmar that relate specifically to health, \nthe \narea of our organisationâ€™s primary\n expertise.\n Our organisation refers to Myanmar/Burma as Myanmar and so for the purpose of this submission we shall use this title.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSubmission &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
