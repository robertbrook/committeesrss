[normal]&#xa0;[bold]AFS0071[bold]Written evidence submitted by Jane Eades[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]One of the problems in commenting on whether academies 
[normal]narrow the gap for disadvantaged children is that information is increasingly difficult to obtain. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The information on GCSE results has changed and only recently has the performance of children on free school meals been included. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The information on the Df
[normal]E website is more difficult to find, which means that individuals have greater difficulty in challenging the misinformation given out by Ministers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, comparing the percentages of the SEN figures for academies between 2008 and 2010 is interesting. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It shows that, on average, Academies are reducing the percentages of children who have special needs.
