[[[TRANSFORMING REHABILITATION: INFORMATION SESSION]]]I understand that, following our recent conversation, the Justice Committee Clerk has now been in touch with the Department to arrange an informal information session with the senior officials who are leading the Transforming Rehabilitation work. I am pleased that you and your colleagues are able to take up this offer to find out more about our important plans for reducing reoffending through this programme of reforms.As you are aware, the Transforming Rehabilitation Strategy published in May this year set out our plans for transforming the way in which offenders are managed in the community in order to bring down reoffending rates. The key elements of the programme are:.Funding for the supervision of offenders makes up a sizeable proportion of the Department's budget, and we are faced with the challenge of trying to do better for less. We can either impose further cuts on the structures we have, risking increases in re-offending and leaving short-sentenced offenders without support after release. Or we can reform the system so that it provides more effective rehabilitation at a better value to the taxpayer, in a way that is sustainable for the future — and reinvest some of the savings in support for short sentence prisoners, an objective that has wide support. We can only do that if we bring in the best of the public, voluntary and private sectors to work with offenders: it is the reforms in their totality that will bring us closer to the important goal of a year-on-year, incremental reduction in re-offending rates.&#xa0;Before you meet with officials in the Department I thought it would be helpful to set out the progress we are making carefully, and systematically, to transfer from the current system to the new operating model in Autumn 2014. I have set out below some of the key activities that will be taking place over the course of the next year around each key part of the reforms — this includes the work that is being undertaken around people transition, testing the system, and the Transforming Rehabilitation competition.

[[[1 - Creating the National Probation Service and Community Rehabilitation ]]]

[[[Companies: Transition of Probation Service]]]The Programme has been engaging closely with the leadership of Probation Trusts, including Human Resources leads, on the support that they need to transition staff to the new system. The Programme has established a People Transition Service (PTS) to support this work and the PTS have had regular contact — both face-to-face and through teleconferences - with Trusts about how the plans for moving people to the new system are progressing.We are committed to giving Trusts all the information, resources and support they need to successfully transition to the new system. In November the staff allocation process will be commenced in all Trusts and we will work with Trusts in the coming months to clarify any issues relating to the allocation of both people and infrastructure to either the National Probation Service or the Community Rehabilitation Companies.The Programme has worked with operational staff from Trusts to test the design of the future operating model. This has included testing the developing risk allocation tool, the case allocation process and the Payment mechanism. We will ensure that offenders are clear who their Offender Manager will be by having a considered process for transferring cases. The Department remains committed to continuing to work closely with Trusts to test key aspects of the new system. We have plans in place to roll out business readiness tests at key stages of implementation so that we can ensure we are managing the transition to the new system in a safe and measured way.This testing will support our plans for operational delivery to transfer from the Probation Trusts to the National Probation Service and Community Rehabilitation Companies by April 2014. At this point all critical systems and process will be in place, so that in the run up to the Autumn we can focus on ensuring that, at the end of the competition, providers will take on viable going concerns. We want there to be continuity in the staff who are managing the caseload, continuity in the buildings that are being used and fully functioning ICT systems, which is why our focus during this period will be on ensuring stability as the changes bed in.The creation of the new National Probation Service and Community RehabilitationCompanies by April next year is the first phase in a transition that will then continue with the award of contracts to providers later next year. We expect to see transformation taking place gradually, as providers then start to re-design services by taking advantage of the new freedom to innovate and bringing together expertise from a wider range of providers. This phased approach to implementation means that we can move to the new system in a safe and measured way.

[[[2 - Opening up the Market to a diverse range of new rehabilitation providers ]]]

[[[and introducing Payment by Results]]]The competition process is now underway, following the publication of the OJEU notice in September.We know from our market engagement events that there is a high level of interest in the competition for offender services from a diverse range of providers across the voluntary, community and private sectors. As of mid-October over 100 organisations have expressed their interest in competing as potential Tier 

[[[I ]]]providers, and of that number 70 have completed the registration process via our e-sourcing portal. It has always been our intention for these reforms to open up the market to a variety of providers. Bringing together the best of the public, private and voluntary sectors will allow us to draw on a broader range of expertise, with payment by results offering a strong incentive to improve upon existing service delivery. For our system really to work, I want, to see a whole range of organisations working to get to grips with offenders' life management problems, signposting them to accommodation, education, or health services, or offering a mentor. The competition process has been designed to enable bids from a range of organisations, including the voluntary and social sector, and to enable genuine partnerships to be formed in order to tackle reoffending. To support this, the Department is embedding good market stewardship principles into the system so that there is fair, reasonable and transparent treatment of all those involved in the direct and indirect provision of services.Due to the high level of interest and the subsequent number of clarification questions asked by providers in preparing their responses, we have allowed potential providers an additional 14 calendar days for their pre-qualification responses to be finalised, which must now be submitted by 14 November. The competition timetable remains on track, and the Programme's competition team and transition team are working closely together to ensure both workstreams are aligned.

[[[3 - Extending Statutory Rehabilitation]]]The Offender Rehabilitation Bill, which is passing through Parliament and today had its second reading in the House, extends statutory supervision for those offenders who receive custodial sentences of less than 12 months. The Bill will enable rehabilitation services to be extended to this group of offenders for the first time, and to start to address the high reoffending rates we currently see. It demonstrates to them that the Government is serious about giving them the support they need to turn their backs on crime, while at the same time being clear there will be consequences if offenders choose to keep on offending.

[[[4 - Establishing the Through the Gate Resettlement Service]]]We recently announced that 82 prisons will be designated as 'resettlement prisons' so that providers can continue the rehabilitation work they have begun in custody into the community. Work is currently being undertaken by the Department to test the model in the North West. This testing will inform the planning for reorgnising the remainder of the estate in the New Year.

[[[Assurance]]]The programme team has been working closely with the Probation Association, Probation Chiefs Association, and with Probation Trusts at each stage of the process, and we will continue to do so as we implement the reforms. We have established a Sounding Board, which has been meeting since March, so that we can hear directly from Trust leadership.We have developed a Business and System Readiness process for the programme to provide assurance that the restructured business, its systems and support infrastructure, including shared services, are ready to go live.This process aims to:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ensure that every aspect of the new service and the system reform beingdeveloped are thoroughly validated prior to proceeding with implementation;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Provide the programme and the business with the assurance that the system performs as expected in an environment that mimics implementation as closely as possible;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Support the 'business as usual' function to ensure that structures and resources are in place to respond to the reforms as requiredThe team are currently working with colleagues from Probation Trusts, MoJ and NOMS and other stakeholders to define the criteria that will be used to test readiness at each stage of transition. The team have developed these criteria with input from the Ministerial Sounding Board as well as discussions with a number of Probation Trusts and practitioner groups. There is no doubt that this is a significant programme of reforms, but one that we are implementing carefully, with the transition taking place in a series of phases. It is my view that we cannot afford to not act now while reoffending rates remain so high. It is also my view that to delay these reforms would create more uncertainty for staff within Probation Trusts about their future role in the system, uncertainty that I would like to avoid.I hope that this information will be useful to you and your Committee colleagues in preparing for the areas you wish to focus on during the information session with officials from the Programme and I look forward to hearing the detail of the areas that you discuss.
