defaultWritten evidence submitted by Nike Inc. [WAS0021]default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultExecutive Summarydefault&#xa0;
defaultIn many
default countries, physical activity is disappearing from daily life. Our physical, emotional and economic well-being has become increasingly compromised as a result. This is a situation that health infrastructures, social services and national economies cannot p
defaultossibly endure. Physical inactivity is now an epidemic and we must act urgently to break its deadly cycle. If we reach children when they are young enough, before the age of 10, they can learn to love physical activity and sports for life. They’ll reap the
default rewards and pass them on to the next generation.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe must also find ways to integrate the physical activity we’ve already lost back into our daily lives. Amongst many things, this relates to the way our cities are designed, schools are run, workplaces are
default structured, and how community environments are shaped.
default&#xa0;
defaultNo single organisation
default or institution can fix this alone. It will take global, national, state and local governing bodies, and their leaders, corporations and their employees, civil society, individuals and communities. All of us need to be part of the solution and it is impera
defaulttive that we focus and align our agendas to move forward quickly. Designed to Move is a framework to get everyone headed in the same 
defaultdirection.
default It focuses the work into one vision and two “asks” that can change the future. Nike, Inc, Sustrans, Young Founda
defaulttion, British Heart Foundation and many others are pleased to present this Framework for Action on behalf of the many experts and organisations that have uniquely shaped this way forward.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith combined expertise, diverse resources and collective commitment
default, we can create a new way of life for all - one that unleashes our extraordinary human potential. 
defaultWe thereby welcome the 
defaultinquiry
default announced by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee concerning women &amp; sport. Whilst our work and body of research does not loo
defaultk into gender specifically, we feel 
defaultthat we can provide some useful 
defaultinput. 
default&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefaultA recent UK-wide study by Griffiths 
defaultet
default. 
defaultAl  (
default2013) describes levels of physical activity, sedentary time and adherence to Chief  Medical officers P
defaulthysical 
defaultA
defaultctivity
default Guidelines among primary school-aged children. The guidelines suggest that all young people should engage in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) for at least 60 min every day while reducing sedentary time. Moderate activities include b
defaultike riding and playground activities whilst vigorous activities include sports such as running and swimming. The study concludes that only 51% of the total 6497 children who took part in the study achieve recommended level of physical activity. 
defaultAn importa
defaultnt observation in relationship to female participation in sports is that gender turned out to be the most significant variation to influence physical activity levels. While over half of the boys (63%) achieved met every day CMO (Chief Medical Officers) gui
defaultdelines, this counted for only 38% of the girls. Additionally, the study confirmed that girls were consistently less active than boys across all ethnic groups.
default 
defaultThe article calls for effort to boost P
defaulthysical 
defaultA
defaultctivity
default levels among young people to the level a
defaultppropriate for good health.
defaultPhysical inactivity is quietly threatening the social and economic prosperity of the United Kingdom. Economists estimate the annual combined cost of 
defaultinactivity-related health problems and lost economic output 
defaultto be approximately
default UK £20 billion annually.
default 
default 
defaultWhile this is unsustainable, the 
defaulthuman cost is far greater. For example, a study published in the 
defaultLancet 
defaultestimates that nine percent of all premature deaths worldwide are attributed to physical inactivity.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultKnowledge of the 
defaultconsequences of physical inactivity has been emerging for years. For example, between 1994 and 2008 in the United Kingdom, the prevalence of obesity increased by 79 percent in men and 47 percent in women.
default 
default 
defaultAmong British children ages 2-10, obesity increas
defaulted by 56 percent. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultDesigned to Move
default is a call-to-action supported by a community of more than 70 public, private and civil sector organizations dedicated to ending the physical inactivity epidemic. 
defaultIt brings together an extensive body of research on 
defaultthe benefits of physical activity, sport and play, and it puts forth a Framework for Action to completely alter the physical activity levels of whole populations. 
default&#xa0;
default2012 Move 
defaultIt
default report
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe physical inactivity crisis is certainly not unique to Britain 
default- it is taking hold around the world. However, we now know that the epidemic is pervasive here and it is projected to worsen. In fewer than two generations (1961-2005), Britons have reduced their levels of physical activity by 20%. If no action is taken, t
defaulthe drop will be on the order of 35% (from 1961 levels) by 2030.
default 
default 
defaultThe time for action is now.default&#xa0;
defaultThe research is compelling and frightening. This year, physical inactivity will kill more people than smoking.
default 
default 
defaultToday’s children are the first generation to 
defaulthave a shorter life expectancy than their parents.
default 
default 
defaultIf we look at the other end of the spectrum,
default defaulta physically active young person is less likely to smoke, become pregnant or use drugs.
default 
default defaultAnd their prospects for future income
default 
defaultand educational attainment ca
defaultn improve dramatically.
default 
default 
defaultSomething needs to change – and quickly.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt this point, the issue of physical inactivity is so deeply entrenched in our daily lives that no one entity will be able to fix it alone. The issue will require cross-party support and t
defaultranscend politics. Everyone—from government and civil society to corporations and individuals—has a vested interested in solving this problem. As such, everyone has a role to play.
default 
defaultIt will require multi-sector collaboration including new public-private app
defaultroaches that deliver the right incentives in the system to create real change.
defaultDesigned to Move’s 
defaultgoal is to create a world where physical activity, play, and sports are all both highly valued and an expected part of life. Our efforts are focused on creating positive experiences for children, so they can learn to love sport in a way that enables them t
defaulto realize their full potential as they grow older. The Framework for Action provides a best roadmap to inspire and motivate children toward a better, brighter future. Because everyone needs to move more to lead healthier, happier lives, the Framework is eq
defaultually focused on opportunities to integrate physical activity into daily life—wherever we live, work, move and play. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNike, the Premier League, ICSSPE, British Heart Foundation, Young Foundation, Sustrans, and others are working together to drive these ef
defaultforts forward.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
defaultresponse
default to the specific barriers highlighted by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee we will look at the following:
default&#xa0;
default1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultReasons why participation in sport by women decreases.
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe variety of sports on offer to girls at school.
default&#xa0;
default1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultReasons why participation in sport by women decreases.default&#xa0;defaultDesigned 
defaultto Move is a framework which advocates for universal access to sport and physical activity
default. I
defaultt recognises that a focus on the hardest to reach groups such as young girls is needed to tackle
default the issue of 
defaultdecreasing sport and physical activity levels prevalent in 
defaulttoday’s
default society. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn order to address this urgent issue w
defaulte 
defaultmust create positive early experiences of sports and physical activity for
default 
defaultall children. We must specifically focus on the first 10 years
default of life in order to break the
default cycle of physical inactivity and subsequent negative consequence to individuals and society.
default&#xa0;
defaultInactive parents often have inactive children, as children follow by example. Children with two inactive parents are 5.8 times less
default likely to be active. Therefore, focusing on increased physical activity among our children should be a core priority in order to break this cycle
default 
defaultand 
defaultthereby 
defaultcreate a society where physical activity and 
defaultparticipation in sport
default is the norm rather than the e
defaultxception. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe benefits for society and individuals are enormous. Whilst productivity levels and the number of graduates increase, fuelling a stronger economy, research shows that on the individual level physically active adults are significantly less lik
defaultely to suffer from anxiety, depression or psychological distress. Overall there is an enormous upside in having future generations who are physically active.
default&#xa0;
defaultBetter use of community resources will facilitate and increase participation in sports. 
defaultA cross-sectoral approach at the hyper local level is essential to best utilise existing resources. The solution requires a coordinated approach that considers the way our 
defaultcities are designed; that schools become hubs for physical activity before, during a
defaultnd after formal education takes place; that our workplaces are structured to prioritise activity; as well as how community environments and voluntary organizations are engaged at local level.
default Better use of local resources, by children for example, should i
defaultn turn have a positive effect on their parents who see the enjoyment they take from being physically active. This would essentially encourage the positive cycle of activity.
default&#xa0;
defaultGovernment and private/commercial resources should be optimized and new alternati
defaultve ways of financing should be identified. There is also potential to improve measurement of impact and 
defaultoutcome of physical activity on community levels
default; to s
defaultpecifically track changes driven by occupational, transport, leisure and domestic factors
default; and to 
defaultd
defaultisaggregate by age, gender, culture, income levels, location and specific intellectual or physical needs. This 
defaultcould 
defaulthelp to more accurately allocate resources, where they would give the best possible effect.
default2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe variety of sports on offer to girls at schdefaultool.default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultAs demonstrated in the seven design filters
default we believe that sport should be designed for Universal Access and if we are to have the biggest impact we should prioritise the hardest to reach. Girls and women are identified as one of these groups. 
defaultWhile 71% of boys do not meet the minimum physical act
defaultivity guidelines, the same counts for 81% of girls
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultCreating and reinforcing positive female role models should be further encouraged and be from all levels including; parents, siblings, teachers, coaches, elite athletes and females in the media.
default&#xa0;
defaultBest p
defaultractice suggests that if it is not practical for boys and girls to play together (e.g. for cultural or religious reasons), opportunities should be created for both genders and investment should be made in female coaches to increase girls’ comfort and parti
defaultcipation. Additionally, girls respond well to activities that include friends and peers. A practical example of this would be the Nike Training Club which uses a physical activity curriculum focused on girls and using female instructors. The program also e
defaultnables the training of girls to become instructors for their friends. Nike piloted this in schools across London in 2011 and has it has since been adopted by several schools within the United 
defaultKingdom 
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe need to ensure that pathways are available for th
defaulte talented and at the same time enable opportunities for all 
defaultto
default regularly participate in sport and physical activity. There is a need to develop the right incentives and motivations for children to participate. We should focus on creating feedback 
defaultfor 
defaultchil
defaultdren
default as a positive enabler - 
defaultall children get excited about reaching personal achievements and/or contributing to team goals. Building group and individual feedback loops into activities lets children know how they are doing and provides motivation for all
default levels of ability.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe role of the teacher, coach or mentor is fundamental to creating positive early experiences of sport and physical activity for children. It is vital that we recognize the
default value of the coach within schools and that a coach or teacher delivering physical activity should be well trained and celebrated. 
defaultCoaches must be trained to deliver age
default-
defaultappropriate physical activity options, adapted to children`s developmental age rather 
defaultthan chronological age
default.
default 
defaultCurrently, physical education teachers aren’t valued and coaches often don’t fare much better, except at the very highest level. This is counterintuitive considering the importance of ensuring that children receive top quality, fun and positive experiences
default of sport and physical activity.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Designed to Move framework has developed seven design filters which should be considered when creating an environment for positive experiences of 
defaultsport 
default. These include universal access, ensuring that the activity is
default age appropriate, dosage and duration of the activity, ensuring that the activity is fun, providing incentives and motivation, positive feedback and positive role models and instructors.
default&#xa0;
defaultInterest in sport during their teenage years is an important societa
defaultl concern, but in a world with limited resource the evidence shows that to genuinely break the cycle of physical inactivity we need to focus on the first 10 years of life.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe recognize that there is a need for greater coordination between schools, voluntary organisations, sports clubs and private enterprise. As a society we need to create environments and communities which actively encourage the whole community to integrate 
defaultphysical activity back into our daily lives. This is the fundamental call to action in ASK 2 of Designed to Move.  
default              
defaultFurthermore, 
defaultour research has shown that children under ten are the game-changer for encouraging increased physical activity at all later 
defaultage groups and segments of society. Current policy does not prioritise this age group.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuoting the 2012 
defaultMove It
default 
defaultreport:
default&#xa0;
defaultIn January 2012, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) launched Sport England’s new strategy, ‘
defaultCreating
default a sporting habit
default for life: A new youth sport strategy’.
default 
defaultThis outlined a number of important changes to sports policy, including a focus on young people (14 to 25-year-olds), a transitions programme to sustain participation into adulthood, a performance regime for the Nati
defaultonal Governing Bodies (who have failed to significantly increase participation rates) and increased funding to open up existing facilities, such as secondary schools, for community use.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe new emphasis on young people is encouraging, but we believe that 
defaultthe strategy fails to address some of the core structural and policy problems. The philosophy of sports policy remains embedded in supporting elite and competitive sports.
default&#xa0;
defaultPhysical activity levels have typically been observed to drop when people are at pa
defaultrticular transition points in life, such as 
defaultpuberty
default 
default. Research shows that b
defaulty the age of 15, European children are 50% less active than they were at the age of 9. Children performing sports during secondary school is associated with a 7-8% increase in inco
defaultme every year of a person`s life, along with 15% greater chance of attending college or university. 
defaultA critical intervention at a young age, in line with ASK
default #1 of the Designed to Move Framework, could help to reverse these statistics and enable children to
default remain physically active. We believe that these early positive experiences are essential to breaking the negative cycle of inactivity.
default Central factors for such positive experiences are great teachers and role models, well-designed activity programs adapte
defaultd to the age level, positive feedback and universal access.
default&#xa0;
defaultParents and caregivers are the most influential advocates and cheerleaders for children. It is therefore important to communicate the benefits of physical activity to these groups. However, when 
defaultchildren become teenagers, influence will shift from parents to friends and piers. Program
defaultme
defaults therefore need to be designed to reflect this shift and focus and invest in diverse role models, from everyday relations to well-known athletes. In addition, we n
defaulteed to re cognize and 
defaultenforce
default the importance of older teenagers as 
defaultrole
default models
default and the potential power of their mentoring influence on younger children
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultBest Practice suggests that physical activity programs are age-appropriate. Children between the 
defaultages
default of 13-16 should be participating in integrated group activities by building values and societal lessons and be offered opportunities for leadership and a variety of sporting roles
default.
