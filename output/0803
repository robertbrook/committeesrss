[normal]Alliance Boots is a leading international pharmacy-led health and beauty group, employing over 70,000 people in the UK. The group’s businesses in the UK include the Boots pharmacy chain, Boots Opticians, our full-line wholesaler Alliance Healthcare Distribution Ltd and our clinical homecare specialist division, 
[normal]Alcura
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Boots UK operates the largest chain of community pharmacies in the United Kingdom. It is synonymous with pharmacy in the public mind and Boots is one of the country’s most trusted brands.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our company has around 2477 stores trading under the Boots brand, of which 2390 have a pharmacy. These are located in all the places where people live, shop, work and travel, with many open well beyond normal office hours and at weekends. Our chain encompasses pharmacies which serve small local communities,
[normal] including some of the most deprived locations in the country,
[normal] and health centres through to those which are part of the largest retail and destination shopping centres.
[normal] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Boots stores are readily accessible to almost everyone in the UK. Nearly 500 of them have been in the same prime high street location for more than 40 years. It is estimated that 88% of the UK’s population is within a 10 minute drive of a Boots store, and 98% within a 20 minute drive.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Boots UK, and the wider Alliance Boots group, operate right across, and in support of, primary, secondary and community care providing a wide range of valued public health services and wellbeing advice, supporting patients with multiple long term conditions, and providing vital medicines to care homes. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our vision for healthcare seeks to reshape understanding of primary, secondary and community care by positioning community pharmacy as a first port of call for healthcare and public health needs. Increasing accessibility to healthcare in the first instance and ensuring a greater number of services are available in those locations is the foundation of better public health, early intervention and the prevention of disease. This will also release the capacity across primary and secondary care to deliver more complex clinical healthcare services in the community, which is in the interests of patients and taxpayers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe this vision was reflected in the House of Lords Select Committee on Public Service and Demographic Change recent report which recognised the need for service redesign to ensure that NHS remains financially sustainable. Ensuring healthcare services are accessible, available and affordable empowers patients to seek professional advice, supports self care, and drives a cultural change where the patient’s needs are the most important variable.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As medicines experts pharmacists have a clear role to play in helping patients self manage long term illness and disease. The New Medicines Service and Medicines Use Reviews are helping patients to better understand how to take their medicines and avoid complications arising from poor adherence leading to fewer hospitalisations and greater patient satisfaction. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The effective management of long term conditions is also dependent on healthcare professionals working together in the interests of patients, and for healthcare leaders to recognise, and respond to, the broader professional and systemic changes that have occurred over recent years. T
[normal]he shift of services away from secondary to primary and community care is necessary in the pursuit of a more responsive and cost effective health service with value unlocked through greater collaboration across the professions. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A major challenge facing health and social care is the treatment of chronic illnesses. More than 15 million people – 30% of the population 
[normal]–
[normal] in the UK have one or more long term 
[normal]conditions. By 2025 it is projected that more than 18 million people will have at least one long term condition.
[normal] 
[normal]The Department of Health estimate that 70% of the total health and social care budget is spent on long term conditions.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Current projections, from the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), estimate that without service redesign NHS and social care costs will increase dramatically as our population ages. The OBR estimates that health spending will rise from 6.8% of GDP in 2016
[normal]–
[normal]2017 to 9.1% of GDP in 2061
[normal]–
[normal]2062. At the same time social care costs will increase from 1% to over 2% in the same period.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One major challenge is that people are living longer but are not necessarily living healthier lives. Currently co-morbidity is more likely to lead to prolonged periods of time spent in hospital and the use of multiple medicines treatment.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Increase in life expectancy hasn’t resulted in a significant extension in healthy life years of the population. Average life expectancy for a male born 2008-2010 in the UK was 78.1 years while average disease free life expectancy was 63.9 years.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Inequality within the UK remains problematic. For males born between 2006 and 2009 life expectancy in the least deprived areas in England was 81.4 years, while disease free life expectancy was 69.4 years.
[normal] 
[normal]For males born in the most deprived areas of England over the same period life expectancy was 73.3 years and disease free life expectancy 54.6 years.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Health
[normal] [bold]services will have to adapt to changing circumstances. There must be a greater emphasis on community based care that can deliver accessible, available and affordable services. Accessibility to services is essential for empowering the patient in making decisions about their own health and wellbeing. Empowerment is crucial for an effective public health service with a focus on prevention and earlier diagnosis. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At the same time a more ‘personalised’ approach to health and social care could bring cost savings to the NHS and Local Government if services can be successfully joined-up and coordinated. To ensure the quality and standards of care continue to rise, national frameworks and standards should be introduced to allow services to be benchmarked and best practice identified and adopted.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Service redesign shouldn’t cost more. Better use of existing healthcare provision such as community pharmacy would go a long way in re-orientating how services are designed and delivered.
[normal] 
[normal]The previous Government engaged McKinsey &amp; Co
[normal] to examine the key areas of NHS expenditure in terms of potential efficiency savings. McKinsey found that around a quarter of the potential savings it identified (£2.7bn-£4.1bn) would come from “shifting care into more cost-efficient settings”. This includes moving services from secondary into primary and community care. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Improving public health is essential in managing costs and the NHS must recognise the value of disease prevention by addressing key health determinants contributing to illness and disease. Managing long term conditions more effectively through earlier diagnosis and timely intervention is crucial. As is the case with diabetes management, interventions through regular clinical checks and patient awareness are important to avoid disease progression and further complications.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These steps will not require significant new investment or services but the better use of what already exists. The 11,406 community pharmacies in England are well placed to deliver public health services and care to patients with long-term conditions. Pharmacists are highly qualified healthcare professionals, trained in medicines management and advising on health issues. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Pharmacies currently provide a range of services including, but not limited to, smoking cessation, NHS health checks, medicines use reviews, alcohol and drug user services, sexual health screening and treatment, weight management services, vaccinations, minor ailment schemes and medicines management and adherence support.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Nearly 99% of the population can access a community pharmacy within 20 minutes
[normal].
[normal] They operate where people live, work and shop and are a mainstay on high streets across the country including in deprived areas or rural communities where accessibility to other primary care services are often limited. For the estimated 500,000 people in the UK, who are not registered with a GP, community pharmacy provides vital access to health services and advice
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As highlighted in the case studies below, Community Pharmacy provides healthcare that is accessible and convenient. Many operate extended opening hours including weekends when other primary care services are often not available. The convenient and universal access to highly trained pharmacists providing ready advice and help alleviates the need to visit a GP in the first instance and provides the major point of access to healthcare to those not registered with a doctor. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The projected increase in the number of people suffering from long term conditions will continue to have huge implications for health spending and the NHS must focus on removing duplication and inefficiency in the system. Community pharmacy already contributes strongly to the efficiency of the NHS. The National Audit Office
[normal] 
[normal]found that between 2005 and 2009 pharmacies became 8% more efficient (delivering 17% more volume for only an 8% real-terms increase in funding). In addition, purchasing efficiencies driven by pharmacies had saved the NHS over £1.8bn. These savings continue to be made, with prescription volumes having risen 70% in the past decade.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Boots pharmacists in England and Wales carried out over 760,000 Medicine Check-ups during 2011-12 and played an important role in the launch of the NHS ‘New Medicine Service’ in England.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The New Medicine Service (NMS) was introduced in 2011 and provides support for people newly prescribed a medicine to help improve medicines adherence. The service has initially focused on particular patient groups and conditions, including Asthma, COPD, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. It is improving patient adherence and increases the patient’s engagement with their condition and medicines, supporting patients in making decisions about their treatment and self-management.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Boots pharmacy services are characterised by a condition led approach: Diabetic patients are offered a wide range of services, tailored to the individual. We offer day to day access to expert advice around all aspects of diabetes management, helping people to understand their medication, offering support for self-care and signposting local support organisations.

[normal]Looking after eye health and regular eye checks are really important for diabetic patients and ongoing support is offered by Boots Opticians. A large volume of undetected (and untreated) eye conditions are picked up during routine sight tests. Optometrists play an important role in the detection of glaucoma, cataract, age-related macular degeneration, diabetes and diabetic retinopathy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Once patients have been established on treatment for diabetes, then there is a continuing need for support to ensure that they get the best from their medication. This is particularly 
[normal]important when the effects of the disease, or related complications such as high blood pressure, may not be immediately obvious. Pharmacies should also be able to support patients on a continuous basis, as necessary, with advice, aids or devices, and/or reminders (such as charts or text messages). Increased medication adherence should help maintain health and prevent or delay the development of complications, reducing hospital admissions.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With the number of people with diabetes set to increase to 3.8 million by 2020
[normal],
[normal] demand for screening, monitoring and treatment for diabetes is set to rise considerably. The NHS must make the most of existing primary care services, skills and expertise to meet this challenge.
