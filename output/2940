[normal]Comments on the biodiversity offsetting proposals[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Choice on use of offsetting
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]RenewableUK is not against the principle of introducing biodiversity offsetting in England on a voluntary basis. Subject to following the mitigation strategy in Box 2 of the consultation document (i.e. avoidance-mitigation-compensation), we would in principle be supportive of the introduction of a fully permissive approach to offsetting, where developers choose whether to use the proposed offsetting metric to assess the impact of their projects and the means for compensation.

[normal]The pilot biodiversity metric
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Different types of development will affect
[normal] a given habitat in different ways. For wind energy development, it is important to consider its benefits in terms of climate change mitigation and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions which are resulting from displacing other, more polluting forms of energy generation. This has long-term positive implications for biodiversity protection. At 
[normal]the same time, the footprint of wind energy projects on the land is much smaller than other development which involves buildings, hence the effects on a given habitat or species will be quite different. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In some cases, wind energy projects are able to provide a number of biodiversity enhancements on site, as part of site management plans. Additionally, in the vast majority of cases agricultural landuses are able to continue on sites where turbines have been installed, again due to the light footprint of wind energy development. 
[normal]On this basis, the metric needs to be adjusted for different types of development and infrastructure and this 
[normal]level of 
[normal]detail needs to be included in any proposals for the introduction of biodiversity offsetting. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thresholds on offsetting
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For wind energy projects, the threshold needs to be different than those for housing, for example. Wind energy does not have a large footprint on the land and the way it may affect habitats and species will therefore be different to having more ‘solid’ development like buildings. As commented above, i
[normal]t is also important to consider its benefits in terms of climate change mitigation and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions which are resulting from displacing other, more polluting forms of energy generation. This has long-term positive implications for biodiversity protection
[normal]. 
[normal]On this basis, the metric as well as the thresholds need to be adjusted for different types of development. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Covenants
[normal]3.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]RenewableUK recently submitted comments to the Law commission’s conservation covenants consultation
[normal], which are relevant to the suggestion in Defra’s consultation (see Section 5.8) that covenants may be used to secure biodiversity offsetting
[normal]. 
[normal]In summary, under the current system 
[normal]wind energy schemes are often affected by restrictive covenants. 
[normal]In some cases t
[normal]hey
[normal] 
[normal]end up restricting wind energy development, which may otherwise be acceptable in planning
[normal] 
[normal]terms.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Under current legislation, restrictive covenants are in favour of one nearby piece of land, so developers can
[normal] 
[normal]sometimes negotiate a release with the landowner who holds the benefit, or obtain title insurance to allow a
[normal] 
[normal]scheme to continue. In some cases therefore, commercial factors can persuade landowners that a covenant is
[normal] 
[normal]no longer necessary or relevant, thus freeing up land for development. This is particularly the case where
[normal] 
[normal]covenants were entered a long time ago by previous landowners and the surrounding area has become more
[normal] 
[normal]built up.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Under the new conservation covenants, the body enforcing them will not stand to gain financially from
[normal] 
[normal]releasing covenants, so large areas of land could more easily be sterilised. Unless “public interest” protections
[normal] 
[normal]are built into the new system, this runs contrary to planning policy, at a time 
[normal]when there is pressure to build
[normal] 
[normal]new homes, and when the majority of the public support renewable energy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At the moment, restrictive covenants are completely separate from the planning regime. So a site could
[normal] 
[normal]receive planning consent for a turbine for example, but the scheme be prevented by a historical covenant in
[normal] 
[normal]favour of a private landowner. If there is to be a new statutory scheme (and particularly because it will make
[normal] 
[normal]it easier to sterilise large areas of land and harder to negotiate a release), it is our view that public interest in
[normal] 
[normal]land being available for renewable energy schemes should be considered and included
[normal] in any new provisions for the establishment of covenants in relation to biodiversity offsetting
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Any new proposals to introduce covenants for the purposes of biodiversity offsetting should ensure that wind energy is not unduly restricted by covenants which are out of date. 
[normal]It is our view that there are two possible ways of building a “public interest” element into the new system
[normal], which could solve this issue
[normal]:

[normal]Effects on planning applications
[normal]3.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is our view that, should it be introduced, biodiversity offsetting should not be backdated. Introducing such a requirement and backdating it would have a negative impact on the financial viability of projects which are already in the system. Not backdating any biodiversity offsetting requirements would ensure that wind energy projects which are already in the planning system are not affected. At the same time, new projects which are entering the system will have a chance to consider their options pre-application and choose the best route forward in selecting the suitable sites for proposing development.

[normal]Deciding whether harm is significant
[normal]3.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In deciding whether harm to an ecosystem is significant, it is important for local authorities to bear in mind the following two principles of defining significant harm, which are established under the Environmental Protection Act:
