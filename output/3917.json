"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Professor Robert Beveridge [FBB0020]&#xa0;\nSubmission by Professor Robert Beveridge of the University of Sassari, Sardinia to the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee Review into the Future of the BBC.\nIt may be useful for this submission to be read in conjunction with my oral and   written evidence to the House of Lords Communications Committee Inquiry into media plurality \n- \nbefore which I appeared on 29\nth\n October 2013\n.\n&#xa0;\nWhat should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?\nFor\n nearly one hundred years, the terms of reference for the BBC have been tenable and broad enough to allow for the Corporation to develop and meet with success the challenges of new technologies and changes in culture and society.\nThere is and was no substantial reason for amending these \n–\nexcept perhaps for the  addition of a fourth term- connect- which can work on a number of levels, \nconnecting with people and society, \nconnecting as in online and digital technologies and \nconnect as in enabling communities and individuals, regions and nations to connect with each other.\nThe current charter was a step change in that it introduced a new set of public purposes. These have some merit in terms of trying to apply largely bureaucratic performance indicators and some measurement of what are \n–\n in the end- necessarily sets of qualitative judgments. \nHowever, the trinity of educate, inform and entertain have the merits of being succinct, comprehensive and jargon free which is important for transparency and public accountability.There have been many attempts at definitions of public service broadcasting and the UK has led the field in ensuring that some of the characteristics of public service have been and are maintained across terrestrial broadcasting in and for the UK.\nIt is easier to say what is not PSB than what is per se as a very great variety of content can be designated as PSB and rightly so.\nIn terms of news and current affairs, the cultural values of PSB, vital in and for a democracy, comprise, of course, impartiality, balance and accuracy although \ndefinitions of these will always be, in practice, both contentious and their achievement a matter of continual striving and aspiration.\nSo it could be said that there is a minimum set of characteristics \n–\nas in news above- but also varying levels of performance in meeting PSB objectives. For example, the budgets for ITN news can be reduced and the on screen content less comprehensive as a result.\nIn the end, what the BBC and PSB must do is not measure their success by profit but strive to \n“\nmake the good popular and the popular good\n”\n as was stated by a previous BBC Director General.\nT\nh\nis means that attempts to make the BBC only operate within a m\narket failure envelope are self-\ndefeating as the competition provided by the BBC is and has been widely acknowledged to help other PSB providers such as channel 3 for example to me\ne\nt that competitive challenge and broadcast better quality content.\nSo the BBC should not withdraw from programming or service areas such as entertainment as they can also provide educational, economic, cultural and democratic benefits for society.How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?\nThe BBC submission to \nthis consultation will \nprovide a wealth of research calculated to demonstrate high levels of success. These will not, in fact be erroneous per se but will comprise an agenda and part not all of the picture.\nThe Select Committee should make a particular point of interrogating the data and agenda around the performance of the BBC in relation to public purposes:” Sustaining citizenship and civil society” and especially “Representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities” and reflect upon the BBC’s own findings in relation to purpose gaps etc There is clear and unambiguous evidence that the BBC and BBC Scotland have failed to address with success the purpose gaps which exist in relation to viewers and listeners in Scotland.In the even that voters in Scotland do not opt for independence, there will be an even more pressing need for the BBC to find ways of closing these purpose gaps.There is no excuse for continuing failure in this issue and this is despite the improvements in labelling etc resulting from the implementation of   recommendations and some improvements based on the ‘King’ report into impartiality in the reporting of the nationsTherefore, the time has come to take stronger measures to address this problem and the seeming reluctance of BBC Management to make more progress means that the BBC Trust and/or its successor and/or the new Charter need to find ways of ensuring success in this matter.(This problem is also one which affects ITV/ITN and OFCOM should also take measures to ensure improvements in this area on the part of its licensees.)\nWhere the BBC has demonstrated excellence in performance is in the establishment of BBC Alba and its partnership with MG Alba. The programming which has resulted, audience size and appreciation data etc have all demonstrated that the BBC can achieve the best of public service broadcasting- and on a relatively small scale with small budgets.There is a clear case for a substantial increase in the budgets and investment in BBC Alba and it is very much to be hoped that this will comprise one of the recommendations or results from this consultation.The \nBBC\n Trust's Review and Assessment 2012\n, page 35, available at \nhttp://downloads.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/pdf/2012-13/bbc-bbctrust-annualreport-review-and-assessment-2012-13.pdf\n \nPublic Attitudes to Broadcasting in Scotland\n available at \nhttp://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/01/21104900/0\nAre the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?\nThe public purposes serve a purpose. They enable a framework for evidence based qualitative judgements although achieving them can more readily be said to be the responsibility of society as a whole rather than solely or primarily the BBC alone.\nWhere they have failed, arguably, is in helping the BBC to become more innovative and find diversity of voice and content within and across the UK with the exception of the excellent contribution made by BBC Alba.However, even this is shown on a dedicated digital channel rather than by incorporating perspectives and programming from the Gailhealtachd into mainstream news, channels etc and this represents a lost opportunity.The comments above on Scotland and the BBC in relation to purpose gaps also demonstrate that it is one thing to have a purpose gap but another to ensure that the BBC addresses and closes it. Therefore there needs to be work on finding ways of ensuring that the BBC does properly meet these challenges rather than as at present and -year after year-  recognising them without dealing with them as has been the case with viewers and listeners in ScotlandGiven that the support for the licence fee depends on every citizen being provided with some tangible return as well as seeing the manifold economic, cultural and democratic benefits enjoyed by society as a consequence of the BBC\n’\ns funding and organisational model, there is a case for amending the public purposes to enable the BBC to more formally rest on the justification of reach by and through its overall services rather than ratings.  \nRatings will, in any case, change and diminish as a result of fragmentation of audiences etc but the ability of the BBC to establish and sustain national conversations and event broadcasting is unrivalled and needs to be supported as does the need for the Corporation to concentrate on quality in the face of pressures to adopt \n‘\nfast food like\n’\n content.\nSome programming takes time to win and audience and for the writers, performers etc  to hit their stride. Only Fools and Horses and Monty Python are only some of the examples which required a second series to achieve lift off.  The BBC must be secure enough to take risks and move away from marketing nostrums into more creative areas.\nWhat scope, scale and remit should the BBC have? \nThere is a strong case, which I have been advocating for some time, for BBC 2 and 4 to merge. \nT\nh\nis seems to be gaining momentum. The problem with this is that it can only be a recommendation to the BBC and /or the BBC T\nr\nust or its successor body else the BBC\n’\ns independence might be compromised. \nTherefore we cannot have politicians, government or even Parliament(s) interfering at that level of detail\n.\nThe BBC should continue to operate at its current level of operations, taking into account public value tests for new services and value for money as appropriate but within the broad overall remit of the new charter\nShould the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? \nThere should be, as indicated above, increased investment in BBC Alba, perhaps by doubling its budget.What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?\nThe introduction of the WOCC: the window of creative competition has led to a range of problems, not least the Brand/Ross affair where the form of outsourcing etc could have been said to be at least a contributory factor albeit small in the extent to which the programming was in tune with BBC values and standards\nT\nh\nis leads, naturally to the question: \nW\nhen and how is a programme really a BBC programme? This impacts on levels of trust from viewers and listeners.\nWhat is clear is that in-house delivery rather than commissioning externally leads to the employment of staff who are much more imbued with the values and standards of the BBC and much less danger of lapses of judgement or taste or quality.\nIt is therefore important that the WOCC is amended to ensure that there are higher guarantees of quotas for in house production.\nThe danger thus far is that, via the WOCC, we have been saying a kind of back door privatisation of the BBC, to the detriment of the interests of the licence fee payer, the Corporation and its staff and society as a wholeHow have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?\nThe BBC\n’\ns commercial activities have been the subject of well-founded criticism especially in relation to the acquisition and then the disposal of the Lonely P\nlanet \noperation. I was on record as opposing this at the time and the range and substance of my concerns were, in due course, proven to be right\nWhat role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?\nThere is now a case for each licence fee payer to be given a unique pin code to allow them to access BBC services \nwhile they are abroad on business or holiday or to enable them to download content television AND radio- for which they have already paid through the licence fee.\nThis\n would put into practice the \n‘\nyour bbc\n’\n rhetoric, - help to make a reality of DG Hall\n’\ns ambition for the BBC\n’\ns relationship with licence fee payers to move towards a different engagement with them as owners; to sign in and join in.\nIt would also remove the irritation felt by some of needing to subscribe to or pay channels for repeat content \n–\n which they have already funded via the licence fee.\nThis would also be a good stepping stone on the way towards a more personalised,        mobile technology driven BBC system of content delivery and distribution.\nHow should the BBC be funded beyond 2016? \n            \nThe licence fee and without top slicing.The licence fee should now be set at a benchmark figure for the whole charter to prevent political interference of the kind attempted by DCMS Secretary of State HunT who disgracefully treated the BBC as a kind of government department which needed to have cuts imposed for broader political reasons. The recent interventions by Conservative Party Chairman Shapps are further evidence of the inability of politicians to respect the necessary political independence of the BBC.\nThis is an illness which affects governments and politicians of all parties whether Conservative, Labour, SNP or coalition. It is absolutely necessary for there to written judicial strength guarantees to protect the independence of the BBC\n&#xa0;\nThe funding model of the licence fee has lasted for decades. There is no reason to change as it has been successful which but there is a clear need for inflation proofing and to remove the ability of any government (most recent evidence being the actions of the then DCMS Secretary of State Hunt) to interfere and try to bully the BBC in hurried late night deals etcIs there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?\nNOTop slicing damages accountability and gives less power to broadcaster and increases opportunities for regulatory or political interference. Please also see comments on funding and the licence fee as aboveWhat comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries? \nThe BBC remains the world benchmark for public service broadcasting and content and the UK government should welcome, cherish and support this achievement.&#xa0;\nHow should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?\nThe governance of the BBC remains a live issue for politics and regulation per se.\nMoreover, it is clear that the UK is moving towards an ever more federal-like polity with the Parliament in Edinburgh and Assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast having legitimate expectations of \n–\nat the very least- having an appropriate level of involvement in the accountability processes which the BBC \n–\nand (not incidentally) Channel 4, S4C, \nthe\n Gaelic Media Service and not least OFCOM are required to meet.\n&#xa0;\nBroadcasting should no longer be a power reserved to Westminster.There should be an amendment to the Scotland Act 1998 to allow for the BBC to have a measure of formal accountability to the Scottish Parliament, with the annual report of BBC Scotland presented  to the Parliament and subject to scrutiny and debate although Minister of the Scottish Government (or indeed the UK government) should be held accountable or presume to be responsible for the decisions and policies of what is an independent corporate body. Given the fact that the BBC World Service is now funded out of the licence fee and the profits of BBC Worldwide- the time has also come for the decisions on the provision of content in other languages etc to be a matter for the BBC and its governing body- advised rather than set by the UK government.In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?\nThere is a strong case for establishing the BBC Charter on a permanent rather than a ten year basis. It is impossible to imagine a UK without the BBC. Universities have Royal Charters which operate for centuries. Therefore we must ask why the BBC Charter is given only for ten years.The answer would that the changing nature of technology and society and culture requires this kind of scrutiny at pre-determined intervals. But what is also clear is that opening up the debate every ten years leads to repeated arguments around the scale, scope and existence of the BBC with the many enemies of the Corporation attempting yet again to have the BBC privatised or diminished, in each case for their own ideological and/or economic interests.\nI have never forgotten attending one of the Burns seminars in 2005 when a participant attempted to open up the question of the very existence of the BBC as well as the licence fee and had to be told by Lord Burns that a previous seminar in the series had already addressed this issue. \nThe central point is that from 1926 until 2006, under the previous governance structure – ie the BBC Governors, the BBC succeeded in meeting the challenges of the enormous changes in technology- from wireless to television to the internet- in society and culture and taking into account the many political pressures applied to it.The governors were both – in modern parlance- regulators and cheerleaders – but they succeeded in bringing us the BBC which existed in 2006. Despite the political claims that the current BBC Trust is broken- and the problems of Savile etc, and the variable performance of BBC Trust officials at Westminster, it is not clear or proven that the Trust needs to be abolished rather than reformed.&#xa0;I should be happy to provide further ideas on this and other matters should the committee wish to call me to give evidence.November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
