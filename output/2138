[normal]Household waste: de-criminalisation.

[normal]The decriminalisation of household waste disposal:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Big Brother Watch was set up to challenge 
[normal]policies that threaten our privacy, our freedoms and our civil liberties, and to expose the true scale of the surveillance state. Founded in 2009, we have produced unique research exposing the erosion of civil liberties in the UK, looking at the dramatic expansion of surveillance powers, the growth of the database state and the misuse of personal information. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is heartening that the Government is taking a common sense stance towards working with households rather than reprimanding them. The culture of handing out fines as a first port of call has incentivised surveillance and 
[normal]contributed to the collapse of trust, with residents feeling that their council is more interested in 
[normal]fining
[normal] them than delivering valuable services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is clear that there are far better ways of improving public safety, improving household recycling and keeping the streets clean than heavy handed fines and overzealous enforcement of regulations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This issue directly feeds into the relationship between local councils and residents, at a time when a range of issues have led communities to feel that their local authorities too quickly turn to surveillance or monitoring in response to problems. We previously exposed how 68 local authorities had been secretly putting microchips in residents’ bins whilst 2.6 million household bins had been 
[normal]microchiped
[normal].
[normal] We welcomed the Communities Secretary’s announcement in January 2013 that hefty fines would be abolished for putting your bin out on the wrong day or “putting the wrong yogurt pot in the wrong bin”. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]We therefore welcome the amendments made in the Draft Deregulation Bill. We believe that the creation of a two tier process, a written warning followed by a letter of intent, will ultimately reduce the administrative burden on councils and will provide a proportionate response to individuals, removing a dangerous incentive towards increased surveillance and monitoring. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Local authorities should focus on tackling the root causes of problems and seeking to build public support for policy decisions. The deregulation bill furthers both of these issues by removing counterproductive incentives and putting in place a clear process for enforcement that strikes the right balance between privacy and good policy.
