Additionally\n,\n \nt\nhe effort needed to achieve this goal has been \nsignificantly\n \nunderestimated by many politicians. The 2\n050 target \nwill only \nbe realised\n if there is a\nn expanded\n coherent strategy which combines \ncross-party \npolitical will \nwith \na platform on which social change can be built.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe creation of the Energy Technologies \nInstitute\n (ETI)\n has enabled 52 low carbon pro\njects to be commissioned but this is a relatively small contribution to the Government’s targets\n,\n and a significant \namount\n of work must be \ndone\n to \nachieve the ultimate goal. Whil\ne\n the ETI has begun working on transport projects \nthe engineering challenge of\n decarbonising \nboth \ntransport\n and heating \nmust be \nin \nthe vanguard of the next decade\n’\ns programmes.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLow carbon innovation will be important to the future prosperity of the UK, not least through enabling low-carbon energy cost reduction,\n \nand it is easier po\nlitically to make progress in technological areas than in the social changes that also will be required. \nControlling the impact of climate change by decarbonising human activity on a global basis requires a revolution in the behaviour of populations and go\nvernments. The Stern report wrote that climate change risks “major disruption to economic and social activity, later in this century and in the next, on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half o\nf the 20th century.”\n We recognise that the UK \nsocial and\n political landscape does not yet reflect the urgency or significance of decarbonisation and many actions that are needed\n \nfor example in providing sustained R&amp;D for the development and demonstration \nof new technologies at scale,\n are not yet politically possible.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBusinesses and the research community cannot on their own deliver the level of change necessary without much stronger \nincentives\n or \nthe direct control of \nGovernment. \nThe current Government ap\nproach to UK low-carbon technologies essentially anticipates cost reduction to come from \"on the job\" learning stimulated through subsidised deployment of an existing range of technologies. Such an approach is \nunlikely\n to result in \nsubstantial innovation l\neading to significant cost reductions,\n or significant innovation of new technologies, but rather minor steps forward to enable deployments that meet the UK's short-term targets for renewables uptake. \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government’s current approach appears to be \nlargel\ny predicated on the notion \nthat technological development will allow a continuation of current lifestyles but with a greatly reduced carbon impact. \nWe do not \nhowever\n have sight of an \naffordable\n ‘technical fix’ that will allow a continuation of the UK’s ene\nrgy-\nhungry \nculture \nand\n a reduction in \nCO\n2\n emissions by 80%\n relative to 1990 levels by 2050\n. The task is made more difficult \nby predicted UK population growth and changing demographics. In this regard the Office of National Statistics (ONS) projects that th\ne UK population will increase from 63.7 million to 73.3 million over the \nnext \n25 year\ns\n, alongside a long-term trend of a reduction in average household size combined with an\n increase in the number of households.\n \nAdditionally\n, the UK’s aging population wil\nl place more demands on the \nenergy network through healthcare and heating requirement.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgainst the background identified above, it is unlikely that the Government will manage to \nachieve the targets at\n the lowest possible cost.\n&#xa0;\n2.              Does the Government have the right balance of focus between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies?&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nA balance between energy efficiency, renewable\n energy\n and other low carbon technologies has yet to be achieved.\n The Government’s main drive \nhas \nbeen \nto\n \nproduce more energy \nto cope with demand \nby \nintroduc\ning\n \nmore \nlow carbon \nand \nrenewable \ntechnologies\n, whil\ne\n relatively little \neffort\n has been \nmade\n \nin \ndeal\ning\n with \nthe \nfundamental\n issue of domestic and commercial energy \nefficiency\n.\n Subsidies for loft a\nnd cavity wall insulation are not \nsufficient in themselves\n to ensure a reduction in energy \nusage\n; more effort is needed to encourage households and businesses\n to reduce their energy consumption\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nThe UK 2050 target for decarbonisation focuses on the C\nO\n2 \nequivalent \nemissions from the UK while g\nenuine decarbonisation \nmust\n consider the \nUK’s global \ncarbon footprint. Measuring \nnational \nCO\n2\n results in driv\ning\n up energy cost for local manufacturing \nand the export\ning\n of jobs and\n emissions to countries that may\n have more carbon intensive processes. Over time\n,\n global agreements\n may emerge and these anomalies removed. \nThe innovation agenda and priorities should reflect the global nature of the task and not be constrained by local targets \nthat are\n at the expense of\n areas that will genuinely reduce the country’s global CO\n2\n footprint. \nManaging low carbon innovation with the resources and speed required, presents an opportunity to help rebalance the global economy but the UK cannot do this alone.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nA successful \noutc\nome\n will require substantial effort on six fronts of the carbon reduction strategy – energy efficiency, renewables, nuclear power, energy storage, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and a smart grid to pull these together. The progress made on a new nuclear \nstation at Hinkley Point is very welcome. \nHowever, to ensure that retired nuclear capacity is renewed and a significant proportion of the fossil fuel stations are replaced by nuclear power, the UK will need many more similar stations. In order to deliver o\nn the Government's aspirations for future UK transport and heat energy demand to be met through electricity, then this requirement is enhanced and CCS must be included along with the maximum possible contribution from renewables, enabled through energy sto\nrage and smart grid technologies.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nWithout \ngenerous \nsubsidies \nor draconian regulations, \nit is difficult (if not impossible) to meet all three objectives\n at the same time\n. The costs of \nrenewable energy, \nlow\n-carbon technologies or energy-efficiency\n measu\nres, are \nin many instances\n so high that, unless energy becomes far more expensive, there are not sufficient \ncommercial\n incentives to invest\n or innovate for cost-reduction.\n3.              What outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely to achieve? How should its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success?&#xa0;3.1\n              \nAlthough the changes to \nLCICG \nmay\n \nbe positive, they are unlikely to make a significant difference to the inadequate and piecemeal funding of R&amp;D in low-c\narbon energy systems. \nAt the time the 2008 \nClimate Change \nAct was published, few recognised the enormity of the challenge it contained. The Royal Academy of Engineering subsequently studied these targets and, in a report published in March 2010,\n wrote \n“Turning the theoretical emissions reduction targets into reality will require more than political will: it will require nothing short of the biggest peacetime programme of change ever seen in the UK.\n”\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nThe decarbonisation of Britain is a project \nclose\nr in scale to the 1940s production of armaments \nbut this has not been recognised by Government\n in funding terms or regulatory regimes\n. It is most unlikely that it will be achieved by the combination of funding mechanisms \nalready in operation\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nSignific\nant spend has been incurred in economics resea\nrch. Government often\n place\ns \ncontract\ns with economics consultancies\n on subjects such as an evaluation of revised rules for the renewables obligation.\n Although this may give the impres\nsion of action, there has \nbeen little relative \nprogress towards innovation in the development of \naffordable\n low carbon technology or achieving low carbon energy targets.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nAlthough DECC may have improved the situation by re-launching the LCICG, \nwhich \nis\n welcome\n, they still have \nto work through the 16 bodies listed in the consultation \nas well as various Catapult organisations, \nEPSRC, \nESRC, NERC, AHRC, IEA and many other bodies which all have some input to funding for research into \nlow carbon\n, public attitudes to the technologies a\nnd the use made of them. \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nM\nost\n renewable energy research and innovation \ncurrently\n takes place in the university sector. There are 13\n2\n members of Universities UK at least half of \nwhich\n undertake energy research, usually \nas part of a consortium\n. EU webs\nite\ns\n on renewable energy resea\nrch list\n \nmany\n bodies involved in distribution of funding and there are \ndozens of\n organisations involved in promoting and coordinating research.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nAs a result of this \ncomplex \nstructure, research funding mechanisms spread resources very thinly and carry a huge administration overhead. Typically a research grant is worth £3m over 3 years and involves half a dozen institutions, allowing each to employ a couple of researchers. \nBy w\nay of an example it is worth comparing\n R&amp;D funding for renewa\nble energy with funding for \nthe\n \nTrident successor. Investment in facilities at AWE is currently running at £1bn p.a.\n In \nMarch 2013 the MOD confirmed assessment phase spending on new submarines \no\nf\n £2.8bn\n.\n In contrast a\n recent press release from DECC\n reported that “f\nour offshore wind projects will receive a share of £2.5m Government investment under the Offshore Wind Component Technologies Scheme\n”\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nIf the importance of decarbonising the UK \neconomy is as great as desc\nribed by Lord Stern and \nthe Royal Academy of Engineering, it is surprising that there has been so little direct Government investment\n in research\n. This situation is quite different to that in many of our competitor \ncountries\n, suc\nh as China, \nwho run large-scale national research facilities and appear to make progress that we seem unable to achieve.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n              \nT\nhe private sector\n is unlikely to put significant resources into major \nR&amp;D activity\n, such as CCS\n, nuclear\n or renewable energy, unl\ness there is a clear economic case\n for their adoption\n and e\nvidence of long-term policy continuity. \nAt pr\nesent, for renewables, the only economic case for private sector investment is based on the continuation of the \ncurrent\n subsidy regime. Recent change\ns i\nn road fuel escalator duties,\n reductions in PV feed-in tariffs,\n active debate over cutting green taxes,\n and proposals to freeze energy prices\n do not instil confidence in a continuity of policy that could justify \nsustained \nR&amp;D investment with long \npayback times.\n&#xa0;\n4.              Are the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the innovation process, including over the long-term?&#xa0;4.1\n              \nAt present the Government and LCICG are not targeting the \nright stages \nof the innovation proc\ness. \nThe escalation of costs as a project moves from TRL1 to TRL9 is particularly marked in \nlow carbon\n technologies. These are attempting to harvest energy from very diffuse sources and thus are inevitably physically large. By their nature, they operate in\n aggressive environments – the windiest and most remote hillside, the fastest ocean currents, \nand the\n most exposed coastlines – and so development \nand demonstration\n at full scale becomes difficult and expensive. \nIn the case of nuclear, prototype systems re\nquire specialist facilities with exacting regulations. \nMany developments flounder at this \nfull-scale demonstration phase, \nbetween lab-based research and full-scale commercial deployment.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nThe costs \nencountered between TRL3 and TRL7 \nare particularly dif\nficult for SMEs. Even if research is grant-funded, no company wants to invest the time and effort of its employees in developments that do not result in long-term profitable manufacture. The complex structure of \nthe privatised energy industry and its multi\n-party supply chain can bring \nhelpful market behaviours and independence of actions, but\n it\n also \ncreates barriers to innovation and, coupled with a complex and \nchanging\n regulatory and subsidy framework, makes it \ndifficult\n for smaller companies to undertake\n \ndevelopment in this area.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nIt is important that \nGovernment &amp; LCI\nCG target investment towards th\ne\n \nso-called \n“valley of death” and support demonstration of new technologies at scale. For many technologies, this is where investment of a few tens of milli\nons of pounds is \nmost often\n needed. By that stage the development \ntypically\n involves a committed research establishment, developer and manufacturing partner so competition is not appropriate. Not all funding need come from government but an underwriting scheme that leverages private investment could bring forward deployment of, fo\nr example, marine turbines\n and energy storage\n \ntechnologies \nby years and show \nwhether they are commercially\n viable or not\n. A public-private long-term funding model may be less costly in the long-term than serial rounds of \npiecemeal \npublic funding. The latte\nr are often subject\n to political short-termism and\n are potentially used inefficiently due to the distraction of bidding for the next tranche of funds.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nA further problem with the current approach is the political assumption that energy prices can be he\nld at roughly current levels\n,\n and the private sector can be persuaded\n to\n invest heavily in new low-carbon generation. Recent announcements of a \nlong-term\n “strike price” \nfor Hinkley Point C of roughly twice the current wholesale price for electricity\n,\n and \no\nnly slightly lower than\n the target price for offshore wind generation\n set\n in a May \n2012 report by the Crown Estate\n are indicative of decarbonised energy costs.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nRealistically, wholesale energy prices \nwould\n have to rise by a factor of at least two and \npossibly three for private sector investment in renewables, CCS, nuclear power and energy storage to become attractive propositions without subsidy. On the assumption that it is unrealistic to expect low-carbon generation to be heavily subsidised from gene\nral taxation far into the future, there are important \nwelfare\n questions around the\n combination of increases to the minimum wage, personal tax allowances, social security payments, etc. \nthat \nwould allow energy prices to double or treble in real terms, witho\nut increasing the number of people in poverty or fomenting social unrest.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.              What is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment?&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nEnergy systems are, by their nature, long-term investments. A nuclear power station \ntakes 10 years t\no plan and build, operates for 6\n0 years and then takes several decades to decommission. The North Sea oil industry, the national gas grid and the electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure were developed over decades. For the \nprivate sector to invest in developments and innovations\n that, even if completely successful are unlikely to make more than modest returns on investment, \nconfidence in long-term market conditions and policy arrangements is required\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nAt present, it is\n far from clear whether there is a coherent national strategy that will last \nthree\n years, let alone the 30 years necessary to ensure adequate returns on R&amp;D investment. \nAs an example, \nsome parties have\n argued for the closure of the domestic gas grid and tr\nansfer of domesti\nc heating loads to electricity whilst \nother \nparties \nare arguing for an expansion of “fracking” which would enshrine gas as the fuel of choice for domestic heating for many years to come.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nAn\n uncertain policy and market environment acts\n to discourage\n private sector investment. Government funding could play a role in underwriting such R&amp;D but present short-term timelines do not provide this incentive.\n6.              How should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low carbon innovation will be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?&#xa0;6.1\n              \nThe re-launch of the LCICG will go some way to refreshing the energy efficiency and low carbon technologies schemes, however care must be taken to ensure that apathy from society and indu\nstry does not once more set in. \nAs noted \nin question 1,\n \nthe \ncurrent Government approach to UK low-carbon technologies essentially anticipates cost reduction to come from \"learning by doing\" stimulated through subsidised deployment of an existing range of t\nechnologies. Such an approach is \nunlikely\n to result in any substantial innovating of the cost-out of these technologies, or significant innovation of new technologies, but rather minor steps forward to enable deployments that meet the UK's short-term targe\nts for renewables uptake.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nGiven Government's long-term aspirations to stimulate an affordable, secure low-carbon supply of energy, with electricity as the energy carrier – there will have to be great improvements in cost-effective building efficiency and in energy storage, amongst \nother innovations. It is important that Government energy R&amp;D policy takes \neach of\n these forward in parallel. I\nf one area lags behind\n,\n the overall system will be far from optimum\n. The Government should\n \nfocus strongly on finding innovative ways to fund the \ncapital costs associated with the development of demonstration plant at full scale. DECC should work closely with BIS and the Treasury to develop such innovative Government financing arrangements, which are the key to unlocking the technical innovation tha\nt will lead to cost reduction for commercial deployment of low-carbon technologies.\n&#xa0;6.3\n              \nSimplification of and accessibility to the schemes for domestic users, with focus on energy efficiency in the home, should \nalso \nbe key. Attention should be given to th\ne Green Deal, ensuring that a \nsubstantially increased number of households\n can get easy access to funds to pay for energy efficient modifications to their homes.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nBusiness would also benefit from the Green Deal but DECC should concentrate on assisting \nbusinesses to find ways to not just reduce their energy consumption but also store energy and even generate their own power using a combination of low carbon technology and energy recycling.\n&#xa0;\n7.              How is the Government maximising opportunities to learn from and partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?&#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nThe UK Government is partnering with several EU countries on Low Carbon initiatives, but it has been recognised by the International Energy Agency\n that the UK is not participating in g\nlobal initiatives at the same level.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nThe G\novernment could for example work with the World Bank on the Low-Carbon \nLiveable\n Cities (LC2) Initiative, its goal to reach\n \n300 of the world’s largest developing country cities with planning and financing suppo\nrt over the next four years. However there are initiatives closer to home which the government could partner\n with\n that already have a global dimension. UK Universities have for many years been partnering with other \ni\nnternational \nu\nniversities to work on low\n carbon innovation. Sussex University\n h\nas been working with the African Technology Policy Studies Network to look at the adopting of low carbon technology in Kenya\n. \nAdditionally, \nfour UK universities have partnered with three Chinese universities to inves\ntigate low carbon buildings and eco-cities\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.3\n              \nThe UK government should take greater interest in these \ntypes\n of initiatives and \nutilise\n their findings to help develop policy.\n&#xa0;\nAcronyms&#xa0;\nAHRC\n              \n              \nArts and\n Humanities Research Council\nBIS\n              \n              \nDepartment for Bus\niness Innovation and Skills\nCCS\n              \n              \nCarbon Capture and Storage\nDECC\n              \n              \nDepartment for Energy and Climate Change\nEPSRC\n              \nEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council\nESRC\n              \n              \nEconomic and Social Research Council\n \nETI\n              \n              \nEnergy Technologies Institute \nEU\n              \n              \nEuropean\n Union\nIEA\n              \n              \nInternational Energy Agency\nLCI\nCG\n              \n              \nLow Carbon Innovation Co-ordination Group\nNERC\n              \n              \nNatural Environment Research Council\nSME\n              \n              \nSmall and Medium-sized Enterprises\nTRL\n              \n              \nTechnology Readiness Level\nUK\n              \n              \nUnited Kingdom\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n Nicholas Stern, \nThe economics of climate change\n, Cambridge University Press, 2007. \nSummary of Conclusions\n page xv.\n \nhttp://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/npp/national-population-projections/2012-based-projections/index.html\n \n \nGenerating the Future: UK energy syst\nems fit for 2050.\n Report by the Royal Academy of Engineering, ISBN 1-903496-54-1, March 2010\n Pöyry Consulting: \nPotential impact of revised renewables obligation technology bands – a report to the Department of Energy and Climate Change\n, December 2011\n S\nee, for example, European Renewable Energy Council  \nhttp://www.erec.org/organisation.html\n \n \nhttp://www.lockheedmartin.co.uk/uk/news/press-releases/2012-press-releases/MoD-Announces-Investment-in-Nuclear-Facilities.html\n \n House of Common Library: \nUpdate on the Trident Successor Programme\n  SN06526, 13 August 2013\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/renewable-energy-delivering-green-jobs-growth-and-clean-energy\n \n House of Commons Library, \nTaxation of r\noad fuels,\n SN824, 26 March 2013.\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data\n/file/43085/5386-government-response-to-consultation-on-comprehensi.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2013/10/from-harry\nph-what-about-some-green-tax-cuts.html\n \n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/nov/09/energy-prize-freeze-public-sector-ed-miliband\n \n \nhttp://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/media/305094/Offshore%20wind%20cost%20reduction%20pathways%20study.pdf\n Public Funding for Innovation in Low Carbon Technologies in the UK, National Audit Office, Oct 2013\n \nhttp://steps-centre.org/wp-content/uploads/Low-Carbon-Develop\nment-briefing.pdf\n \nhttp://www.reading.ac.uk/CME/research/cme-InternationalResearchCentreforLowCarbonGreenBuildingandEco-Cities\n.aspx\n"
