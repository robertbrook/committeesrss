[normal]The Government is assessing the viability of a biodiversity offsetting scheme
[normal] in England
[normal]. Any scheme 
[normal]taken forward must consider species. The current habitat
[normal] focussed
[normal] metric 
[normal]is unlikely to address the individual needs of species when re-creating habitat. T
[normal]his 
[normal]will 
[normal]lead to losses of biodiversity rather than be
[normal]ing
[normal] a step towards fixing the problem.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many sp
[normal]ecies require specific and particular 
[normal]habitat
[normal] conditions
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]often at a very fine scale
[normal]. 
[normal]These 
[normal]are influenced by 
[normal]aspect, geographical location, soil biology
[normal], past uses of the site
[normal] etc. 
[normal]The current metric does not take this into account and as a result newly c
[normal]reated habitats are unlikely to
[normal] 
[normal]reflect the original fine scale conditions 
[normal]necessary for 
[normal]certain species.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are gaps in knowledge 
[normal]about the biology of some 
[normal]species
[normal] and this 
[normal]will affect the suc
[normal]cess of offsetting
[normal] 
[normal]schemes. A
[normal]s we don’t know what they nee
[normal]d to complete a full life cycle
[normal] it is very difficult to successfully replace what has been lost
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We don’t have 
[normal]a
[normal] consistently detailed species and habitat data to use as a 
[normal]quantifiable 
[normal]data 
[normal]set as 
[normal]starting point for offsetting
[normal] schemes
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Resources are needed to address 
[normal]knowledge 
[normal]gaps in 
[normal]species biology 
[normal]and develop a robust 
[normal]set of baseline data to work from.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Buglife is the only organisation in Europe devoted to the con
[normal]servation of all invertebrates - 
[normal]everything from bees to 
[normal]beetles, worms to woodlice and jumping spiders to jellyfish. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are more than 40,000 invertebrate species in the UK, and many of these are under threat
[normal] from extinction
[normal]. Invertebrates are vitally important to a healthy planet – humans and other life fo
[normal]rms could not survive without them. The food we eat, the fish we catch, the birds we see, the flowers we smell and the hum of life we hear, simply would not exist without bugs. Invertebrates underpin life on earth and without them the world’s ecosystems wo
[normal]uld collapse. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Buglife is submitting 
[normal]this evidence 
[normal]to ensure that species, specifically invertebrates, are
[normal] considered 
[normal]when 
[normal]assessing the practicalities of an offsetting scheme and 
[normal]looking at 
[normal]whether or not 
[normal]a biodiversity offsetting scheme should go ahead. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Habitats where rare and endangered invertebrates can be found are constantly under threat from development. Mitigation and/or compensation for th
[normal]ese
[normal] habitat loss
[normal]es is 
[normal]often inadequate
[normal] 
[normal]and invertebrate surveys are 
[normal]frequently 
[normal]not carried out
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An example 
[normal]that is 
[normal]sobering to look at is the loss of 
[normal]wildlife-rich 
[normal]brownfield land in the Thames Gateway. Buglife has calculated that in the Thames Gateway and surrounding area 
[normal]over 50% of 
[normal]high va
[normal]lue 
[normal]sites have been lost or damaged since 2007. 
[normal]Whilst not always the first thought for 
[normal]nature conservation brownfield land can be home to as many rare invertebrates as 
[normal]ancient woodland
[normal],
[normal] so this loss
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] not good news for biodiversity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many species take refuge at brownfield sites where 
[normal]cycles of disturbance and abandonment
[normal],
[normal] combi
[normal]ned with low nutrient soils
[normal] give ris
[normal]e to a wide variety of habitats. 
[normal]Many invertebrates have complex life-cycles, needing different things at different stages, s
[normal]o they often require two or more habitats close to each other
[normal]. Brownfield land can be perfect for this and as a result some 
[normal]sites can have as many rare invertebrate species as ancient woodland, and many act as important ‘reservoirs’ of wildlife. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For offsetting to be successful there needs to be a few ground rules. 
[normal]Whilst 
[normal]there are many factors contributing to how successful offsetting will be in England 
[normal]there are 
[normal]two issues that Buglife considers 
[normal]paramount. Firstly 
[normal]it must
[normal] always be a last resort
[normal], ensuring 
[normal]the mitigation hierarchy of ‘avoid, mitigate and compensate’ is followed. 
[normal]Offsetting 
[normal]cannot become a ‘green card’ for development. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Secondly, offsetting should be applied to all species – this includes Species of Princip
[normal]al Importance for Conservation in England (
[normal]Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 
[normal][Section 41]) and those included on Red Data Lists, Nationally Scarce lists (where available) and Regionally Scarce lists
[normal] (endangered and threatened species)
[normal]. F
[normal]ocussing on only on legally protected species will not realise the targets set out in Biodiversity 2020.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An offsetting metric has been developed by Defra to calculate the area of habitat that needs to be created to offset a loss. This
[normal] currently does not address impact from a species perspective. 
[normal]Many species require specific and particular habitat conditions
[normal],
[normal] often at a very fine scale. These can be created though aspect, geographical location, soil biology, past uses of the site etc. 
[normal]For some species, such as invertebrates, a formula based simply on habitats will not automatically 
[normal]assess 
[normal]the original habitat’s complexity or structure 
[normal]and translate it 
[normal]into the new area of habitat. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For example, an area of lowland meadow is to be lost to development and the quantity of habitat recreation required is calculated. However it could be the bare and open ground, varied topography or damp areas within this habitat that provide key resources 
[normal]for priority invertebrate species. There is no way to ensure recognition of this within the current metric and the new habitat may not provide all lifecycle requirements for that species. As a result populations will decline and it may become extinct in th
[normal]at locality. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Location of the offset is crucial and needs to be strongly reflected in the metric. It must be close to the original loss as possible so that it is able to benefit the species using the area of land to be lost. Non-mobi
[normal]le species may not be able to colonise sites over a certain distance and
[normal] the specific climatic conditions
[normal] 
[normal]on 
[normal]a site can be vital to ecological va
[normal]lue.  For example brownfield sites in the Thames Gateway are specific to their geographical location, climate a
[normal]nd aspect. As a result these sites have a completely different species assemblage to brownfield sites in an area such as Teeside.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is also important to start identifying possible receptor sites as early in the process as possible
[normal]. This will help
[normal] to ensu
[normal]re 
[normal]that 
[normal]offset sites are within established ecological networks and not isolated, 
[normal]and that there is thorough assessment of the quality of a receptor site. It would be unacceptable to have new habitats created on areas that are already of high ecological value 
[normal]but 
[normal]of a 
[normal]different 
[normal]type
[normal]. This would lead to additional biodiversity losses – a
[normal]n issue that does not appear to have been covered in the metric. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is imperative there is an investment in underlying data, this needs to extend to mapping of both habitats and species of principal importance
[normal] and ensur
[normal]e
[normal] that 
[normal]Local Wildlife Sites schedules are up to date
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Without
[normal] information on what species and habitats there is and where they are located across an region or area, 
[normal]it is impossible to quantify biodiversity loss and gains
[normal], 
[normal]plan how develo
[normal]pment will affect biodive
[normal]rsity and understand development impacts across England.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This need has been highlighted by the Somerset offsetting scheme where a species focussed metric has been developed
[normal] independently of Defra
[normal]. This scheme is showing some positive results, a key reaso
[normal]n for success is the level of habitat and species data that is held by the county. This has guided the need for and location of offset schemes. Unfortunately not all counties or biological record centres have access to such thorough datasets to work from a
[normal]nd many local authorities do not even have an ecologist, let alone enough resources to compile these data.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The biology of a species will affect how easily offsetting can be applied and whilst we know of species where suitable habitat can be created relati
[normal]vely quickly and easily, e.g. certain bees, butterflies and dragonflies, there are significant omissions in our knowledge. The gaps for some species are so large it would make it impossible to successfully recreate the 
[normal]specific requirements 
[normal]as they are unk
[normal]nown. For example, the 
[normal]Four banded weevil wasp (
[normal]Cerceris quadricincta
[normal]) and Five banded weevil wasp (
[normal]Cerceris quinquefasciata
[normal]) 
[normal]are 
[normal]Species of Principal Importance 
[normal]where suitable habitat exists but 
[normal]it is 
[normal]unoccupied, for unknown reasons. The Streaked bombardi
[normal]er beetle (
[normal]Brachinus sclopeta
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]has such complex lifecycle
[normal],
[normal] as it is necessary to create the right conditions for the beetle
[normal]+
[normal] and its host 
[normal]species,
[normal] it is very difficult to recreate a habitat for them with any certainty of success.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]F
[normal]urther work is needed to ensure that any offsetting scheme taken forward delivers biodiversity gains for species – and not just for European Protected Species but the lesser known species that underpin biodiversity. This is the only way to achieve no net l
[normal]oss of biodiversity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are gaps in knowledge about species
[normal]’ biology
[normal] that will affect how successful an offsetting scheme
[normal] will be
[normal]. A robust baseline data set must be gathered 
[normal]to be used 
[normal]as 
[normal]a quantifiable starting point.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A realistic assessment of resources must be taken. Currently local authorities are poorly placed to engage with schemes due to a 
[normal]lack of 
[normal]local authority 
[normal]ecologists.
