defaultoften at a very fine scale

defaultThese 
defaultare influenced by

defaultThe current metric does not take this into account and as a result newly c

defaultThere are gaps in knowledge

default&#xa0;

defaultResources are needed to address

defaultand develop a robust 
defaultset of baseline data to work from.
default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBuglife is the only organisation in Europe devoted to the con
defaultservation of all invertebrates - 
defaulteverything from bees to 
defaultbeetles, worms to woodlice and jumping spiders to jellyfish. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are more than 40,000 invertebrate species in the UK, and many of these are under threat
default from extinction
default. Invertebrates are vitally important to a healthy planet – humans and other life fo
defaultrms could not survive without them. The food we eat, the fish we catch, the birds we see, the flowers we smell and the hum of life we hear, simply would not exist without bugs. Invertebrates underpin life on earth and without them the world’s ecosystems wo
defaultuld collapse. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBuglife is submitting 
defaultthis evidence 
defaultto ensure that species, specifically invertebrates, are
default considered 
defaultwhen 
defaultassessing the practicalities of an offsetting scheme and 
defaultlooking at 
defaultwhether or not 
defaulta biodiversity offsetting scheme should go ahead. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHabitats where rare and endangered invertebrates can be found are constantly under threat from development. Mitigation and/or compensation for th
defaultese
default habitat loss
defaultes is 
defaultoften inadequate
default 
defaultand invertebrate surveys are 
defaultfrequently 
defaultnot carried out
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn example 
defaultthat is 
defaultsobering to look at is the loss of 
defaultwildlife-rich 
defaultbrownfield land in the Thames Gateway. Buglife has calculated that in the Thames Gateway and surrounding area 
defaultover 50% of 
defaulthigh va
defaultlue 
defaultsites have been lost or damaged since 2007. 
defaultWhilst not always the first thought for 
defaultnature conservation brownfield land can be home to as many rare invertebrates as 
defaultancient woodland
default,
default so this loss
default 
defaultis
default not good news for biodiversity.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany species take refuge at brownfield sites where 
defaultcycles of disturbance and abandonment
default,
default combi
defaultned with low nutrient soils
default give ris
defaulte to a wide variety of habitats. 
defaultMany invertebrates have complex life-cycles, needing different things at different stages, s
defaulto they often require two or more habitats close to each other
default. Brownfield land can be perfect for this and as a result some 
defaultsites can have as many rare invertebrate species as ancient woodland, and many act as important ‘reservoirs’ of wildlife. 
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor offsetting to be successful there needs to be a few ground rules. 
defaultWhilst 
defaultthere are many factors contributing to how successful offsetting will be in England 
defaultthere are 
defaulttwo issues that Buglife considers 
defaultparamount. Firstly 
defaultit must
default always be a last resort
default, ensuring 
defaultthe mitigation hierarchy of ‘avoid, mitigate and compensate’ is followed. 
defaultOffsetting 
defaultcannot become a ‘green card’ for development. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSecondly, offsetting should be applied to all species – this includes Species of Princip
defaultal Importance for Conservation in England (
defaultNatural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 
default[Section 41]) and those included on Red Data Lists, Nationally Scarce lists (where available) and Regionally Scarce lists
default (endangered and threatened species)
default. F
defaultocussing on only on legally protected species will not realise the targets set out in Biodiversity 2020.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn offsetting metric has been developed by Defra to calculate the area of habitat that needs to be created to offset a loss. This
default currently does not address impact from a species perspective. 
defaultMany species require specific and particular habitat conditions
default,
default often at a very fine scale. These can be created though aspect, geographical location, soil biology, past uses of the site etc. 
defaultFor some species, such as invertebrates, a formula based simply on habitats will not automatically 
defaultassess 
defaultthe original habitat’s complexity or structure 
defaultand translate it 
defaultinto the new area of habitat. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor example, an area of lowland meadow is to be lost to development and the quantity of habitat recreation required is calculated. However it could be the bare and open ground, varied topography or damp areas within this habitat that provide key resources 
defaultfor priority invertebrate species. There is no way to ensure recognition of this within the current metric and the new habitat may not provide all lifecycle requirements for that species. As a result populations will decline and it may become extinct in th
defaultat locality. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocation of the offset is crucial and needs to be strongly reflected in the metric. It must be close to the original loss as possible so that it is able to benefit the species using the area of land to be lost. Non-mobi
defaultle species may not be able to colonise sites over a certain distance and
default the specific climatic conditions
default 
defaulton 
defaulta site can be vital to ecological va
defaultlue.  For example brownfield sites in the Thames Gateway are specific to their geographical location, climate a
defaultnd aspect. As a result these sites have a completely different species assemblage to brownfield sites in an area such as Teeside.
default&#xa0;
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is also important to start identifying possible receptor sites as early in the process as possible
default. This will help
default to ensu
defaultre 
defaultthat 
defaultoffset sites are within established ecological networks and not isolated, 
defaultand that there is thorough assessment of the quality of a receptor site. It would be unacceptable to have new habitats created on areas that are already of high ecological value 
defaultbut 
defaultof a 
defaultdifferent 
defaulttype
default. This would lead to additional biodiversity losses – a
defaultn issue that does not appear to have been covered in the metric. 
default&#xa0;
default7.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is imperative there is an investment in underlying data, this needs to extend to mapping of both habitats and species of principal importance
default and ensur
defaulte
default that 
defaultLocal Wildlife Sites schedules are up to date
default.
default 
defaultWithout
default information on what species and habitats there is and where they are located across an region or area, 
defaultit is impossible to quantify biodiversity loss and gains
default, 
defaultplan how develo
defaultpment will affect biodive
defaultrsity and understand development impacts across England.
default 
default&#xa0;
default7.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis need has been highlighted by the Somerset offsetting scheme where a species focussed metric has been developed
default independently of Defra
default. This scheme is showing some positive results, a key reaso
defaultn for success is the level of habitat and species data that is held by the county. This has guided the need for and location of offset schemes. Unfortunately not all counties or biological record centres have access to such thorough datasets to work from a
defaultnd many local authorities do not even have an ecologist, let alone enough resources to compile these data.
default&#xa0;
default7.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe biology of a species will affect how easily offsetting can be applied and whilst we know of species where suitable habitat can be created relati
defaultvely quickly and easily, e.g. certain bees, butterflies and dragonflies, there are significant omissions in our knowledge. The gaps for some species are so large it would make it impossible to successfully recreate the 
defaultspecific requirements 
defaultas they are unk
defaultnown. For example, the 
defaultFour banded weevil wasp (
defaultCerceris quadricincta
default) and Five banded weevil wasp (
defaultCerceris quinquefasciata
default) 
defaultare 
defaultSpecies of Principal Importance 
defaultwhere suitable habitat exists but 
defaultit is 
defaultunoccupied, for unknown reasons. The Streaked bombardi
defaulter beetle (
defaultBrachinus sclopeta
default)
default 
defaulthas such complex lifecycle
default,
default as it is necessary to create the right conditions for the beetle
default+
default and its host 
defaultspecies,
default it is very difficult to recreate a habitat for them with any certainty of success.  
default&#xa0;
default8.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultF
defaulturther work is needed to ensure that any offsetting scheme taken forward delivers biodiversity gains for species – and not just for European Protected Species but the lesser known species that underpin biodiversity. This is the only way to achieve no net l
defaultoss of biodiversity.
default&#xa0;
default8.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are gaps in knowledge about species
default’ biology
default that will affect how successful an offsetting scheme
default will be
default. A robust baseline data set must be gathered 
defaultto be used 
defaultas 
defaulta quantifiable starting point.  
default&#xa0;
default8.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA realistic assessment of resources must be taken. Currently local authorities are poorly placed to engage with schemes due to a 
defaultlack of 
defaultlocal authority 
defaultecologists.
