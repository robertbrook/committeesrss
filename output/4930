default1.1default 
defaultAction with Communities in Rural England (ACRE) is the national umbrella for 38 rural community-led regeneration 
defaultorganisations known as Rural Community Councils. ACRE itself was formed in 1987, but its members were created between 1920 and 2011, and so it 
defaultpossesses vast experience across the entirety of rural England with regard to devolved decision-making processes.
default&#xa0;
default1.2default 
defaultACRE is a charity and, together with the 38 Rural Community Councils, forms the ACRE Network.
default&#xa0;
default1.3default 
defaultACRE is co-financed by Defra to provid
defaulte information on the impact of government policies in rural areas. 
default The possibility of fiscal devolution to cities and city regions has potential impact on rural areas; we have noted disparities in how rural communities are served through existing devolved
default structures (
defaulte
default.g. Local Government, Local Enterprise Partnerships etc.) and wish to see all areas treated with equity.

default3.1default 
defaultThe ACRE Network is governed by, and serves, public, private and civil society organisations across rural England. The Network’s activity – primarily an enabling one 
default(providing information, training, consultancy, guidance and networking opportunities) – has a strong focus on participatory democracy, bringing public, private and civil society bodies together at a very local level (e.g. in a single village) to plan for t
defaulthe socio-economic and environmental wellbeing of a particular geography. This is a form of government ‘by the people and for the people’ that should augment representative democratic structures such as Parish, District
default / Borough
default, Unitary and County Council
defaults.
default Our work in this field has included supporting:
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe creation of over 4,000 community-led plans (setting economic, social and environmental priorities at local level, and enabling the attraction and delivery of external funding to provide new services an
defaultd facilities)
default; usually with participation rates between 60 and 90% of the population
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultManagement of over 11,000 community-owned 
defaultfacilities
default (largely village halls, but also community-owned shops, pubs, transport operations etc.) These facilities support over 70,000 jobs in rural England.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the first six months of the 2013/14 financial year alone t
defaulthe work of the ACRE Network underpinned the o
defaultpening of more than £40 million of affordable housing
default, helped create 118 new businesses (and assisted a further 287, including village shops, to maintain their viability and / or improve performance) and provided over 9,000 people living in rural areas wi
defaultth access to health and social care services (keeping this number of people out of residential care saves around £180 million a year
default). In addition, 2,886 village halls used the services of ACRE Network members: these venues represent an asset value of aro
defaultund £2.1billion and are a space in which more than 20,000 jobs deliver goods and services
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.2default 
defaultWe see, on a daily basis, the benefits of cross-sector working in tightly defined geographical areas. This means inclusive decision-making processes, drawing o
defaultn a wide skills’ base, locally-tailored solutions to specific problems and even the ability to attract and generate further investment. The scaling-up of such an approach, to deliver on specific agendas, is something we welcome.
default&#xa0;
default4. defaultRural impactdefault&#xa0;
default4.1default 
defaultWe 
defaultare particularly pleased to see that the Chair of the Communities and Local Government Committee, Clive Betts MP, has recognised a need to identify how rural areas might be impacted by proposals for fiscal devolution to cities and city regions.
default&#xa0;
default4.2default 
defaultWe are
default co-financed by Defra to provide information on the impact of Government policies in rural areas. In the instance of a proposal such as the one considered here, impact can only be surmised
default,
default as there are many variables to be taken into account.
default&#xa0;
default4.3default 
defaultWe know
default from our own membership (i.e. 38 Rural Community Councils) that the importance of policy initiatives on rural areas varies greatly – as, indeed, is local investment targeted at community-led regeneration generally. Our figures suggested that, on a per hea
defaultd of population basis, local public sector investment in our network can vary hugely – in 2012 we found an example variation of £0.19 
defaultper head in one area
default (e.g. Kent), but £3.80 in another (e.g. Central Bedfordshire
default.) We know also by early work with Local
default Enterprise Partnerships containing significant urban populations, that some (e.g. Coast to Capital) are very cognizant of rural economic growth – and how this contributes to a wide geography – and so are already investing in agendas such as affordable hou
defaultsing and community-owned workspace
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.4default 
defaultWhere an area (
defaultthat might contain a city
default)
default has a major rural hinterland, that perhaps is recognised as a key contributor to the economy (or has its own economic challenges and a substantial rural population) then there are positive signs that devolved decision-making can be beneficial for rural ar
defaulteas. We could cite the work of the New Anglia LEP as an example, or indeed various economic development initiatives (e.g. use of the LEADER mechanisms to support innovation in local business and community enterprise, broadband roll-out, multi-village neigh
defaultbourhood planning)
default 
defaultseen in Cumbria over the past decade.
default&#xa0;
default4.5default 
defaultImpact on rural areas might also be affected by the representational composition of structures created to oversee investment. Our network is involved in a number of structures designed to grow 
defaultthe economy, but doing this by setting and delivering on local priorities. However, there is an inconsistent picture across the country, and in some places our members have not become part of structures – and this tends to reflect on the ‘political positio
defaultn’ of either rural areas
default, community-led regeneration
default or civil society in relation to economic growth in those places. 
defaultExamples of our Network’s involvement in such structures (as at December 2013) is:
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default4 on LEP Boards (representing 10% coverage)

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
default5. defaultRural areas are integral, and not peripheral, to city regionsdefault&#xa0;
default5.1default 
defaultMuch of England’s rural land is devoted to production of energy (e.g. 
defaultfood), and this benefits the whole country. By necessity this energy production requires large amounts of land, and so settlements within it tend to be small – often meaning that it is more expensive to deliver specific services or run major businesses in 
defaultrural areas. Much of our Network’s activity is targeted at alleviating the impacts of this: nobody should be disadvantaged because they live or work in a rural area.
default&#xa0;
default5.2default 
defaultHowever, rural areas often do miss out on major investment – or adequate means to add
defaultress market failure. Our network’s role is to provide the tools and expertise that allow rural communities to 
defaultidentify, articulate and address their needs. These needs do not exist in isolation but often struggle to be met because necessary investment is t
defaultargeted at urban areas where greater concentration of need exists (even if total figures for specific problems are less than in 
defaultsurrounding, but spread out, rural areas!) To this end we have worked with the Oxford Consultants for Social Inclusion (OCSI) to
default produce data sets
default covering the rural share of deprivation, economy and other subjects across the entirety of England. We can generate reports at LEP, County Council, Clinical Commissioning, District Council, Parish and even individual place level. The ai
defaultm is to demonstrate that any policy or investment decision will impact a specific cohort of the population living and / or working in a rural area.
default&#xa0;
default5.3default 
defaultRural areas are integral to city regions because the energy (e.g. food) produced 
defaultis also consumed in 
defaulturban areas. P
defaulteople working in cities may live in rural locations and there is much access to the countryside for leisure and recreational purposes. While spatial disadvantage arises in rural areas from the need to use land for agriculture, horticulture, f
defaultorestry etc. – i.e. the land needed means small populations and less strong economies of scale for delivering services or operating certain types of business – the function of rural areas is to support the whole population. We see, therefore, that there is
default 
defaultinterdependency
default between rural and urban areas and thus the former is an integral part of 
defaultany geography that is not purely urban in its confines.
default&#xa0;
default6. defaultRecommendationdefault&#xa0;
default6.1default 
defaultAt this stage we have one recommendation to make: devolved fiscal responsibilities should be subject to rural-proofing. 
default&#xa0;
default6.2default 
defaultWe wish to see fair allocations of resource to rural areas, as opposed to an ability for devolved structures simply to invest in t
defaulthose places with the single greatest return on investment (thus compounding disadvantage elsewhere.) Where spend of public money is to come under greater control, then a means of attributing this to take into account rural population, land area and depriva
defaulttion levels should be considered. Our experience is that great inconsistencies exist across the country in how rural areas are served through existing devolved power, and that a strong national framework needs to be in place as a ‘check and balance’ agains
defaultt further disadvantaging some rural areas.
default&#xa0;
default6.3default 
defaultDefra has produced various rural-proofing toolkits which might be used as a starting point for this process. We would be happy to help shape a sensible rural-proofing guide fit for the purposes of a fiscal de
defaultvolution to cities and city regions agenda.
