[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;1.1              We welcome the Committee’s interest in ensuring access to adequate passenger transport services by people in isolated communities where operating scheduled bus or waterborne services, say, would be uneconomic and rarely justified.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.2              In such areas, there are many who are prevented from participating fully in education, training, employment and social activity because they lack access to a motor vehicle.  This problem acutely affects the young, the elderly and disabled people of all ages, denying them the contribution they could make to community life.  Those with mental health problems may have these exacerbated by isolation.&#xa0;              Communications (telephone, cellphone, internet access, information) may also be lacking or of poor quality in remote areas, creating issues of their own, and with consequences for access to transportation services. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.3              A range of transportation needs are apparent.  These include emergency transport, transport to medical services, commuting, shopping, visiting friends and relations, and accessing long distance travel, or recreation and leisure facilities.&#xa0;              Emergency transport in remote areas is provided by Air-Sea Rescue (ASR), the Air Ambulance, Royal National Lifeboat Institute (RNLI), the Coastguard, mountain rescue, blue light services and other organisations.  Response times are often significantly longer than in urban areas and the Committee may wish, for the purposes of the Inquiry or otherwise, to review the adequacy of their coverage. &#xa0;              We assume that daily or frequent commuters would not choose to live in remote areas without the assurance of good access by car or scheduled ferry, bus or rail service.  However, it would surely be undesirable were people to be forced out by lack of access to a motor vehicle or public transport service.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.4              Provision of transportation services in remote areas is inherently expensive because of the distances, the low population density and hence their limited and spasmodic take-up, low utilisation of equipment and high fuel costs.&#xa0;              Organisations seeking to plug the gaps are invariably based on volunteers, charitable donations, uncertain local government grants and/or low-paid staff along with Concessionary Fares Rebates.  The continuity and reliability of the services offered may be               undermined by intermittent and/or low cashflow and therefore staffing.&#xa0;              Few local CTAs or groups wanting to form CTAs will have the resources to prepare submissions to the Inquiry.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.5              The reliance that remote communities have on the available paratransit services is often extreme.  Over-provision is never an issue, though there may occasionally be some duplication and often spare capacity.  &#xa0;              With the rising costs of fuel and car use, the essential nature of lifeline service provision should be recognised, and positively rather than passively supported.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.6              It is a fortunate characteristic of many isolated communities that neighbours assist each other informally as a matter of course.    However, such assistance can never be taken for granted, with age, infirmity, absence, demands of employment and others they care for creating uncertainty.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.7              Our submission canvasses some potential solutions to easing the physical and social isolation and consequential loneliness, the decline in mental health, lack of healthcare access and other problems that afflict many small communities located largely on the fringes of the mainland.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1              In cities and towns, where many of our decision-makers, employment and major facilities are located, most have a choice of a range of transportation modes, routes and services available.  In areas not well served by public transport, most may walk or cycle.&#xa0;Many households do not usually require a second car (or a car at all) to reach their employment, medical appointments, shopping centres, education facilities, leisure opportunities or social events.  The rest of the household tend to walk, bus or cycle.&#xa0;Families, friends and neighbours are often available to support each other in illness and older age.  Families without a car available can often visit by bus or on foot to help out when needed.  Isolation happens, but not often through lack of access to a car or alternatives.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.2              Businesses in urban areas are unlikely to struggle to find a range of employees, unless they are looking for very specialist skills or knowledge, or customers.  Many people will be able to reach the workplace, even on a shift basis, with or without their own transport.&#xa0;              &#xa0;2.3              This extensive flexibility allows people to adopt least-cost strategies (eg. trip-specific modal choice) for personal transportation (or have no choice, as in the case of young people).  Walking and cycling is more practical.  Public transport services tend to be frequent, though often under-utilised in off-peak hours.  &#xa0;While private motoring is increasingly expensive, especially over the relatively short distances that cars are typically used in cities and towns (&lt; 8km), it may remain dominant until Peak Oil begins to bite.  Electric vehicles may never be a solution for most people.&#xa0;              Tougher economic conditions are unlikely to cost many people in urban areas their jobs, their ability to go shopping or visiting friends or family.  However, Councils should be required to identify areas where transport provision is poor, and ensure that access is available to all by public transport or a viable community-based alternative.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.4              In rural and other remote areas, the picture is altogether different.  This is not due to a difference in the people - it is just geography. &#xa0;For most people, it is too far to walk to shops, doctors, leisure centres and, in many cases, to visit relatives.  Most country roads do not have any kind of footpath or street lighting.  &#xa0;Cycling is an option for some people on some journeys, but most country roads are not safe for cyclists.  Places people want to or need to visit on a regular basis are not often close enough to make cycling a viable option. Buses are often not viable in remote areas.  Where dependent on central government funding, many financially supported services have faced major cuts.  Where buses do operate, services are unlikely to run in the evening, and there is often nowhere sheltered and safe to wait. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.5              Many rural centres – larger villages and small towns – now have limited public transport.  However, accessing them from the surrounding area is still difficult on foot or by bicycle, as the distances are often significant.  Safe roads for pedestrians and cyclists typically do not begin until within the town or village. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.6              People and businesses in remote areas have the same transportation requirements as people in urban areas.  Unless a car is available though, access to goods and services will be restricted, often severely. &#xa0;              Rural businesses are less likely to be able to recruit suitable employees.  Potential workers without access to a car may find some areas and employment completely inaccessible, and other areas only at restricted times of the day. &#xa0;&#xa0;2.7              Put simply, people and businesses in rural areas without ready access to a car whenever required suffer a lack of opportunity economically, socially and in accessing health and care services.  Because of the ageing population and the increasing cost of motoring threatening car access to more households, remote areas are being depopulated, especially of younger people and becoming even more isolated.  There is no foreseeable possibility of a change in this trend.  &#xa0;Closing services and facilities due to Government funding cuts have disproportionately more impact in remote areas where the next service or facility may be completely out of reach.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.8              One option is to take the goods and services to isolated communities. Many people in rural areas shop online, but this threatens local businesses, reduces choice and removes the opportunity for social interaction and community development. Older and more vulnerable people often do not have this option.  Some people e-commute, which works well for some, but it increases of the isolation of the remainder, severely limits job opportunities and does not achieve the same social benefits most working people enjoy. &#xa0;Mobile libraries, hairdressers and so on provide excellent services, but they are delivered in a way that is necessarily limited.  They do not provide all the social benefits of visiting premises and meeting other people, or identifying the full range of services available. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q1]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?]]]&#xa0;Q1.1              In the first place, the authorities should accept, as the Chair of the Committee says, that…&#xa0;People from different communities across the UK should have access to adequate transport services Louise Ellman MP&#xa0;              This immediately establishes the legitimacy of a lower bound in demand.&#xa0;              While this demand will be at a much more reduced level in isolated rural, coastal and island communities than in towns and cities, the same types of requirements other than for daily commuting can be safely assumed. &#xa0;&#xa0;Q1.2              We propose that systematic surveys are undertaken of a sample of such communities to identify all the travel requirements they generate, including those at present unfulfilled.&#xa0;              The team that authored this submission would be ideally placed to carry out such research,               preferably in cooperation with other paratransit providers.&#xa0;&#xa0;Q1.3              This is not to suggest that all transportation demands will be realisable or should be all financed by central and/or local authorities.  Even favoured city dwellers do not expect that, especially as costs are rising for all motorised modes.  Neither do they expect fast travel, given our over-reliance on the least efficient mode – cars.&#xa0;              Peak Car might well be bringing despair to motor manufacturers, but that simply shows they are failing to respond to the market and not producing affordable mass transit vehicles!&#xa0;&#xa0;Q1.4              In the case of urban and suburban areas with poor transport connections, questions should be asked of Councils procuring transport services as to why some areas are not well served.&#xa0;              Recent changes to bus operator grants and cuts in local authority finances have forced both parties to review services and any subsidies that were provided, vis-à-vis other possibly more pressing claims on their stretched budgets.  &#xa0;The reduction in public support appears to have marginalised some urban communities, reducing their access to community and social life and their employability.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q2]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with ]]]

[[[disabilities, older people, young ]]]

[[[people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?]]]&#xa0;Q2.1              To the extent they are provided by local initiatives, the latter appear to be struggling to meet those varying demands, given their often high cost.&#xa0;              Nevertheless, the fundamental legitimacy of those demands requires us to address all the issues such client groups give rise to.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q3]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated ]]]

[[[communities? How can these challenges be overcome?]]]&#xa0;Q3.1              Cost, and the variability of demand.&#xa0;&#xa0;Q3.2              It would be unfair to impose such requirements on commercial operators, and provided that community-based initiatives were well-supported financially, probably unnecessary.&#xa0;&#xa0;Q3.3              It would be reasonable for isolated communities to have access to ferry ports, railheads and               bus stops where rural and island providers could safely leave passengers for their onward               journeys.  &#xa0;              This may mean the construction of a shelter, and be further facilitated by the provision of better real-time and other passenger information in remote locations – which is especially problematic where there is no cellular telephone or data signal.&#xa0;While we would be reluctant to support any further retrenchment of scheduled bus and rail services anywhere, there may be, albeit probably limited, potential in shortening the routes and/or reducing the frequencies of the latter where community initiatives could fill the gap, switching the available funding accordingly.&#xa0;&#xa0;Q3.4              It is probably the case that (financially-supported) community transport associations are better placed to provide transport services to isolated communities than (subsidised) commercial operators.  Community transport is cost-effective, responsive and non-profit making, but it must be financially viable and, as importantly, financially stable.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q4]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in ]]]

[[[isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?]]]&#xa0;Q4.1              Given their very limited resources, it is unsurprising that many local needs are not currently being met.                Some Councils have been supportive to the extent their constrained budgets allow, while others do not assist community transport in any way.  Local CTAs have found it impossible to engage with many of the latter.&#xa0;&#xa0;Q4.2              Community transport associations do not waste their scarce and precarious funding.  Much administrative time is spent in scrambling for limited funds, often from a wide variety of sources.  This makes planning ahead very difficult, and expansion to better meet existing needs virtually impossible.&#xa0;&#xa0;Q4.3              The Preseli Rural Transport Association (Green Dragon Bus), for example, secures funding from Concessionary Travel rebates, a Service Level Agreement (with Pembrokeshire County Council), a service bus route (for Ceredigion County Council), various grants and European rural area funds.  Small or very small amounts come from membership fees, mileage contribution and donations.&#xa0;&#xa0;Q4.4              The best way to support transport associations that have shown themselves to be well-supported by the local community would be by way of grants…&#xa0;- to develop their websites (preferably using a template that would fit readily within the portals of transport information providers) and telephone support for those without internet access- to assist with procurement of vehicles, insurance and maintenance&#xa0;- to market their services within their area of operation&#xa0;- to encourage their use by tourists and recreational travellers.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q5]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?]]]&#xa0;Q5.1              Taxis could and should occupy a very different role than hitherto in the UK.  They ought to complement other public and community transport services, such as buses in low-density areas, and at off-peak times.&#xa0;They should be cheaper to hire, while at the same time ensuring that their drivers obtain a reasonable income.  &#xa0;&#xa0;Q5.2              An imaginative assessment should be made of their potential in urban, rural and remote areas before this question should be answered.&#xa0;&#xa0;Q5.3              It is probably much cheaper to provide taxis and other demand-responsive transport services to isolated communities than scheduled bus or rail services.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q6]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? ]]]&#xa0;Q6.1              Lack of central and local government commitment over time.  &#xa0;              Community Transport organisations have no certainty of funding beyond a year or two for most funding sources, putting service development, provision and employment at constant risk.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q7]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[How can these s]]]

[[[ervices be made more affordable?]]]&#xa0;Q7.1              The real opportunity is to invest properly in remote area transport, through supported public transport, community transport, car clubs, scooter hire for young people, Dial-A-Ride for the older and more frail, and other Community Transport solutions such as Country Cars, community minibus hire, taxi and car sharing and other local and national schemes for those without access to a car when they need to travel. &#xa0;              Community transport associations endeavour to provide an appropriate range of services to the extent their finances permit, but these are patchy at best.&#xa0;&#xa0;Q7.2              Greater take-up of such services will reduce their per capita cost, which is bound to occur as car use continues to decline and the population ages and becomes more infirm.  However, we contend that affordability is not the issue.  &#xa0;              The focus must be on adequate provision to ensure a reasonable level of access and mobility for all, now and in the future.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1              There is much national and local Government rhetoric regarding equal access to services, ensuing equal opportunities for all in education, employment, business development, social and health care and so on.  But none of these can be addressed without proper access to transport in remote areas, where the largest deficiency lies. &#xa0;There is no point in having the best hospital, factory or school if people cannot get to them and home again safely and affordably. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.2              Adequate public and community transport provision enables remote communities to become more economically sustainable, reduces isolation, ensures access to goods and services, reduces mental health problems and difficulties in accessing medical services.&#xa0;It ensures access for people and businesses to earn money and contribute to the economy. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.3              The Inquiry is timely, in that transportation costs will continue to rise, and existing services will continue to be threatened.&#xa0;Access and mobility that urban dwellers currently take for granted are a quantum leap above that available to people is isolated communities.&#xa0;Access to jobs, services, health care and a social life is critical to both physical and mental health.  To our ageing population, isolation is a challenge.  &#xa0;In some rural areas, such as southwest Wales, younger people are moving out to find employment and older people are moving in to retire.  The ageing of the population is accelerated, exacerbating the problem where car-less living is already least-well provided for.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.4              In many areas, there is no support for community transport from Councils.  Local groups seeking assistance to establish community transport have often been unable to find anyone in the Councils to engage with.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.5              We suspect that there may be few submissions to the Inquiry from local CTAs, potentially undermining the Committee’s objectives.&#xa0;              We understand that very few local CTAs would have the resources available to apply to preparing a submission.&#xa0;5.1              To periodically survey remote populations as to their mobility and access requirements, and                community transport associations for ridership, trip lengths, costs and other metrics. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;5.2              To provide a reliable source of additional and long-term grants to fund or part-fund community transport, with specific consideration being given to the items listed in Q4.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;5.3              To encourage the development of best practice in the sector, by funding appropriate learning resources.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;5.4              To encourage all Councils to review their provisions for community transport.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;5.5              To regularly survey Councils as to the extent of their support for community transport.&#xa0;

[[[Note]]]&#xa0;              The submitting organisations propose to apply for funding…&#xa0;                            - to survey a sample of remote areas to identify typical transportation requirements&#xa0;- to survey community transport associations, and groups intending to establish a CTA&#xa0;                            - to survey Councils and their support for community transport&#xa0;- to research and produce a best practice manual.&#xa0;&#xa0;              We would be pleased to discuss this proposal further with the Committee if requested.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
