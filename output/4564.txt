[[[xecutive summary]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Government education reforms, aimed at improving school standards, have led to an increasingly autonomous schools system, through conversion of existing schools to Academy status and opening of new schools as Free Schools. These schools have greater freedoms in a variety of areas including whether to expand school places to meet demand, decide self-improvement needs and are their own admissions authority.   1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; These reforms have directly led to a decline of the traditional council role in education. Yet, government is clear; local authorities as champions of children and parents, with a democratic mandate, have a responsibility that every school do their best for the local population. Local authorities continue to hold legal duties covering education including to ensure sufficient school places, overall responsibility for school performance in the local area and fair access for all children.1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since 2010, schools that have converted to Academy status have risen from 38 to 185 at secondary level and from 0 to 125 at primary level in the capital. At the same time, more Free Schools have been set up in London than in any other part of England. Of the 174 Free Schools opened in England, a total of 58 (34 per cent) are in London. 1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As a greater proportion of London’s schools convert to Academy status and further Free Schools are set up, the Department for Education will be unable to work with or provide the necessary support needed by each school. 

[[[Recommendations]]]2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Based on evidence from across London, London Councils has identified gaps within system that put at risk the aspirations behind government reforms. Local government has a vital role to play in ensuring continued improvement to the schools system. The following five changes are needed to support autonomous schools flourish whilst at the same time providing parents with the reassurance needed within the education system:2.1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To support schools address signs of failure at the earliest opportunity - Local authority issued early warning notices for Academies and Free Schools should be supported by a statutory backstop, in the same way they are for maintained schools.2.1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To ensure new schools are setup in areas/wards where there is projected demand - A change in government policy to put new school applicants in touch with London boroughs at the earliest chance.2.1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To support vulnerable children – Government should provide Fair Access Panels with the power to issue a direction to an Academy to admit a hard-to-place pupil, as they currently do with maintained schools &#xa0;2.1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Making the education system more accessible to parents and local communities - Ensuring Academies share the same statistical returns with local authorities at the same time they make them available to the Department for Education. &#xa0;2.1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, giving local authorities the powers to order a financial audit or investigation for Academies, as they can currently with maintained schools.

[[[?]]]3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Local authorities are legally responsible for providing school places for every child resident in their area. To do this, boroughs closely monitor the supply and demand for places and ensure there is sufficient school capacity to meet the needs of their community.3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; All regions are experiencing a rise in demand for school places but this a pressure not spread evenly across the country. Over the 10 years since Census 2001, London’s population grew by 900,000 (11.6 per cent). 3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; London Councils latest analysis has shown that between 2012/13 and 2016, the shortage of school places is set to reach 118,000. For many local authorities, it is becoming increasingly challenging to create additional classrooms in existing schools. 3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Local authorities no longer have the sole responsibility for commissioning new school places in a local area. Existing academies, of which there are 368 in London, are responsible for their own expansion and should they opt to do so, bid directly to the Department for Education for funding. The Government also approves applications for new Free Schools without consultation with local authorities. 3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Within boroughs and across London, like all regions, engagement with academies to expand and liaison with Free School applicants before they submit a bid to government vary significantly. There is no systematic approach in place and many local authorities only find out about plans to expand or create new Free Schools once they have been approved by Government. This makes it difficult for local authorities to be able to include these new places in medium to long term place planning. 3.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In particular, as recently highlighted by the National Audit Office report Establishing Free Schools, a number of Free Schools approved by the government are set up in temporary premises, failed to open or are not in wards/areas of projected demand. This has made it extremely difficult to coordinate admissions as parents may select a school that does not open, cannot accommodate their child or is no in an area of projected demand.

[[[pport for schools at this level?]]]4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Local authorities have 198 statutory duties relating to education and children and young people's services to discharge. Irrespective of school provider type, local authorities have three core responsibilities in relation to education - ensuring a sufficient supply of school places, tackling underperformance in schools and ensuring high standards as well as supporting vulnerable children. 4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As a more autonomous education system has evolved, it has become increasingly challenging for local authorities to discharge these duties. At the same time, central government’s ability to support academies and free schools will become progressively strained as the number of Academies and Free Schools increases. &#xa0;4.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Local authorities, as champions of children and parents, with a democratic mandate, have a responsibility that every school should do their best for the local population and therefore, ensure the aspirations behind government reforms are fulfilled. Based on evidence from across London, London Councils has identified five key changes that are needed to address risks in the system. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Enabling continued school improvement]]] Academies and Free Schools are responsible for their own school improvement as outlined in the Education Act 2011. However, some schools will not be able to thrive on their own and DfE and Ofsted do not have the capacity to work with each school in the country to prevent standards declining. It is critical that support and challenge is offered to schools at the earliest possible moment to minimise the impact that any signs of failure may have on the quality of education a child receives.&#xa0;4.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; London boroughs are well placed to do this and have successfully demonstrated how they use early warning notices, when serious issues emerge, to turn around performance in maintained schools. London Councils is calling on government to enable local authorities to issue early warning notices to all state funded schools, supported by a statutory backstop, to ensure that they are acted upon by schools, irrespective of type to prevent failure.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Meeting the growing demand for school places]]] Many Academies and Free Schools work closely with local authorities and consult them on the potential to expand or set up new schools. However, there is no systematic approach in place and many local authorities only find out about plans to expand or create new schools once they have been approved by the government. In some instances in London, Academies and Free Schools have opened in areas where there is limited demand for schools and therefore, take up of places is extremely low by local families. &#xa0;4.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To address these inconsistencies within the system, London Councils believes there is a strong role for local authorities, with their expert local knowledge and intelligence, to offer a package of support to Academies and Free Schools. This could include effective advice on viable sites and development costs; and ensuring schools sufficiently meet community needs. This would enable local authorities to broker effective relationships with Free School candidates and support those that demonstrate quality, cost-effectiveness and meet the growing need for places.&#xa0;4.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In order for this to be effective and deliver parental choice in state education, London Councils is calling on government to share information on Free School candidates at the earliest opportunity.

[[[orting vulnerable children to achieve positive outcomes]]] Supporting vulnerable children to achieve positive outcomes is an integral part of a local authority’s duties. It is important that the education reforms do not hinder a borough’s ability to fulfil these duties, particularly in relation to schools. &#xa0;4.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Placing excluded pupils in appropriate schooling is a particularly difficult duty to deliver and every part of the school system needs to share equally in this responsibility. To ensure the system is viable in a world with a majority of Academies, government needs to act to empower Fair Access Panels to issue a direction to an Academy to admit a hard-to-place pupil, as they currently do with maintained schools.

[[[Making the education system more accessible t]]]

[[[o parents and local communities ]]]In an autonomous schools sector driven by choice parents will play an increasingly important role in shaping local education provision. However, many parents will need support in order to make informed decisions as they navigate their way through the market. It will be increasingly difficult for parents to locate, understand and compare data for all schools as the market diversifies. &#xa0;4.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; London Councils is calling on all schools, including academies, to share the same data and statistical returns with local authorities at the same time that they make them available to the DfE. Local authorities can then make this data available to local parents and also use it to support the local family of schools, challenging those where issues are emerging, and enabling the more effective delivery of their statutory duties.&#xa0;4.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, local authorities should be able to conduct a financial audit or investigation into any school, including Academies, if they feel that there are issues deserving further scrutiny. This information would be important for the wider community to be able to assess the value for money provided by a school.&#xa0;December 20134&#xa0;
