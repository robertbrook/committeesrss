defaultAs well as prejudicing the parties, lack of re
defaultpresentation is likely to impact on the timely conduct of the care proceedings.  It is unclear how some parents could be expected to provide evidence of residence in time for the crucial first hearing, or what the position of a children’s guardian with no 
defaultability to instruct a solicitor on behalf of the child would be.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn our response to the 
defaultTransforming Legal Aid
default consultation we 
defaultasked the government for confirmation that respondents to care proceedings (which are not excluded from the residence test) will
default continue to be entitled to legal aid as now whatever their residence status - both those who are here unlawfully or beyond our borders - who are parents who can go on to take responsibility for looking after their children and maintain the children’s futu
defaultre within their family. 
default We are hoping for specific details in the government’s response to the consultation responses when published.
