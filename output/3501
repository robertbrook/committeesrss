[normal]Forum of Private Business – Supplementary [bold]w[bold]ritten evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Many thanks for the opportunity to give evidence last week. I am perfectly happy with the transcript of the session. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There were a number of pieces of supplementary evidence that I wished to send through following that appearance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is partly down to the constant change of regulations around some of the key areas of managing staff e.g. parental leave, flexible working. I highlighted the latter in the committee session. Despite questioning a number of ministers on the flexible working ‘right to request’ policy, no one has yet answered why the Government has ignored the mantra to ‘legislate as a last resort’ and is imposing administrative frameworks around a process that works in practice already. Time would be better spent promoting the benefits of flexible working (which we fully acknowledge) rather than creating a system where employers will end up being taken to tribunal not because they get a decision wrong but because they didn’t follow the correct procedure. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If government wants to retract or create a micro business exemption for a sizeable piece of legislation, this would be the one. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An “approved apprenticeship standard” will radically change the apprenticeship system in England.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It will strip out much of the complexity and rigidity of the current system in developing frameworks. This is a positive step as it will help to reduce some of the key barriers for employers and enable a restructuring of the skills system so that it properly reflects the needs of employers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Inflexibility and complexity in the current system
[normal]FPB members have reported one of the main issues with apprenticeships is the lack of flexibility. The current frameworks are extremely rigid and the process of developing new frameworks is hugely time consuming and is therefore not really an option for small businesses. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]According to the Federation of Industry Sector Skills &amp; Standards (apprenticeship frameworks online pages) there are currently 207 different apprenticeship 
[normal]frameworks available in England, with a further 165 available in Wales.
[normal] The choice for employers is vast and many of the current frameworks go unused. For a small employer, particularly those not currently engaged in the skills system, such a wide ranging choice of frameworks acts as a disincentive. It adds additional complexity to the apprenticeship system and the lack of flexibility within a chosen framework prevents many from being able to deliver the exact training they require. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The rigidity of the system at the moment hampers valuable employer engagement in the design. Sector Skills Councils and awarding bodies are responsible for developing the vast majority of apprenticeship frameworks. Although some SSCs do represent the employer interest effectively the vast majority do not truly reflect their sectors interests.
[normal] The 2012 OECD 
[normal]Skill Beyond School
[normal] study of the English Skills system concluded, “it is widely recognised that SSCs have been only variably effective in engaging employers.”
[normal] Similarly the OECD also concluded that “The English model of awarding organisations largely rules out both routes to employer engagement” when drawing a comparison to the ‘top down’ and ‘bottom up’ models of employer engagement in the design of vocational qualifications that exist elsewhere in Europe. It would be fair to say that employer engagement in the design of apprenticeships is currently is low and small employer engagement is even lower. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Employer engagement in the design of standards
[normal]25% of Forum members believed that tailoring apprenticeship schemes more for the employer would help restructure the skills system and make it more employer focused. Employer engagement in developing standards is a significant step to ensuring apprenticeship programmes deliver the skills employers require and in a way in which that suits the world of business. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There will be an element of administrative burden that falls on employers as a consequence of the reforms. However the ability to for employer and representative bodies to:
[normal]“make proposals to the Secretary of State as to the content of a standard (including proposals for its revision, revocation or replacement)”
[normal]will align apprenticeship training to employers needs and enable the standards to evolve more freely as the needs of business change and develop. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The development of Industrial Partnerships as part of the Employer Ownership of Skills Pilots has the potential to take on much of the burden when developing standards. It is essential that as these partnerships develop the small business voice is properly represented in all sectors and that large employers work effectively with their supply chains to ensure training needs are met. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It must be remembered that despite this radical reform to the apprenticeship system some of the current frameworks are valued by employers and effectively meet the needs of business. In these cases it is vital that these frameworks are transferred into 
[normal]the new approved standards to ensure time and money is not wasted replicating what already exists. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Bill will insert an additional chapter (chapter A1) into the 
[normal]Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009
[normal] to enable employers to have a much bigger role in designing standards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is a significant change from the existing legislation giving the SoS the power to:
[normal]“prepare and publish standards for such sectors of work as the Secretary of State thinks appropriate” A2 (1). 
[normal]It also allows for: 
[normal]“Employers, or representatives of employers, may make proposals to the Secretary of State as to the content of a standard (including proposals for its revision, revocation or replacement).” A2 (5)
[normal]Main point here for us is that it is good that the regulations are being simplified to enable much greater employer engagement BUT employer engagement must come from a range of businesses, of different sizes. 
[normal]Second potential issue is the centralised control of new apprenticeship standards. If SoS sign off is all that is required (simplifying the process significantly) it is necessary that officials in the Dept have the necessary capabilities to assess the proposed standard to prevent poor quality standards being signed off.
