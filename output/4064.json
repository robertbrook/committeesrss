"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from the Electrical Safety Council (BRC 54)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0; \nThe Electrical Safety Council (ESC) welcomes the opportunity to submit \nwritten evidence to the Communities and Local Government Committee inquiry into the Building Regulations certification of electrical installation and repairs in dwellings.\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0; \nAs the \nUK\n’\ns\n only\n charity committed to reducing electrical fires and electricity-rel\nated injuries at home and at work\n,\n our remit is to promote and encourage\n public awareness of issues surrounding electrical safety. We\n therefore\n have a\n particular interest in ensuring consumers \nknow how and where to find a c\nompetent, qualified electrician. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0; \nOur submission focuses on:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0; \nW\ne\n are\n also\n currently working with industry partners to address concerns\n expressed by the Committee\n over the existence of two registers, and to reach a solution \nthat best meets\n the interest of consumers.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0; \nWe wish to reaffirm our commitment to Part P, which \nis\n vitally important \nto\n regulat\ne\n industry\n and ensure \nconsumer \nsafety\n. We have argued strongly in f\navour of Part P, and were supportive of the Committee’s recommendation that it should be retained.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0; \nWe believe that the Competent Persons Scheme remains the best and most cost\n-\neffective \nway to maintain standards amongst electrical contractors\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0; \nHowever, we\n have seriously\n considered\n the written evidence of individual contractors who expressed concern\ns over the existing system\n,\n and have sought \nin this response \nto address\n the points they made.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0; \nPart P is\n a cost\n-\neffective way for government\n to\n ensure\n \nthat electrical work in new and existing homes is carried out \nto a standard that minimises\n \nthe \nhealth and safety risks \nassociated with electric shocks and electrical fires\n.\n Its importance is likely to grow as the \ntype of electrical work carried out in the home continue\ns\n to change\n and broaden\n;\n supporting Government policies on renewables, electrical vehicles and smart meter\ns by ensuring that electrical installation work in dwellings is \ncarried out\n competently\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0; \nCompetent Persons Scheme\ns (CPS) licensed under Part P\n ensu\nre\n that all \nregistered\n electricians are trained to a high standard and assessed regularly. Though \nCPS \nmembership is voluntary, \nover 4\n0,000 firms had chosen to register as \nof\n February 2013.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0; \nSince the introduction of Part P, \n27,000\n more contractors carrying out electrical installation work in dwellings have \nbeen inspected on a periodic basis\n than was previo\nusly the case. \nThe Part P Impact Assessment stated that the number of properly qualified individuals and firms represents a “strong proxy” for the quality of electrical work undertaken.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0; \nConsumers have benefited as a result. Whilst they may not be aware of\n Part P specifically, the existence of re\ngulation has deterred ‘\ncowboys’ and provides consumers with confidence about the work they are paying for.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0; \nIn addition, \nPart P prevents approximately 2.6 fatalities and 421 injuries per year due to electric shock, \nand 2.8 fatalities, 10 serious injuries and 77 minor injuries due to electrical fires\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0; \nRespondents to the Government’s \nrecent \nconsultation supported the view that Part P has had a positive impact on the quality of electrical installation\n work\n; of those w\nho had a view\n,\n 64% \nstated \nthat the standard had improved, including 96% of t\nhe building control bodies that gave an opinion\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0; \nA \n2011 \nsurvey of nearly 4,000 \nelectricians, \nregistered \nacross\n the three main Part P Competent Person\ns\n Schemes\n,\n found that \n53%\n believe\nd\n the standard of electrical work ha\nd\n improved as a result of the implementation of Part P. This \noutcome \nwas supported by a separate but less wide-ranging study \ncommissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government and conducted \nby\n bu\nilt asset consultancy\n EC Harris\n \n. \n&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0; \nCrucially, through \nCertsure\n, consumers\n now\n have a way to follow up any deficient work and a guarantee that applies to the work even if the company undertaking the work has ceased to exist\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.9\n&#xa0; \nOne submission made to the \nCommittee and published on 9 October questioned the ESC’s use of statistical data in our original evidence from February 2012, stating we had claimed there had been a drop in fires when in fact there had been an increase since Part P came into force. This \nmisrepresents what ESC stated. From 2004-2008, there was a 17.5% drop in the combined number of fault fires associated with two categories of data that we \nbelieved to be\n \nmost relevant to the operation of Part P, ‘Mains Wiring: After Meter’ and ‘Mains Wirin\ng: Before Meter’ (Relevant data tables, as provided to ESC by the Department for Communities and Local Government, are set out in appendix 1). \n&#xa0;\n2.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince this time, the category used to record such fires has been broadened to ‘Electricity supply - Wiring, cab\nling, plugs’. This effectively collates three former categories into one, making a direct comparison – as cited by the respondent in order to prove ESC’s error – impossible. However, as the data used to inform the \nsubmission\n had not at the time of writing \nbeen made available, we have been unable to fully corroborate this view.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0; \nWhilst there is significant \nevidence of the value of Part P\n,\n its impact could be greater\n and more ne\neds to be \ndone to raise consumer awareness\n – which according to our latest poll is 14%\n. We welcomed the Committee’s earlier\n recommendations to Government \nand \nare pleased \nthat th\ne\n issue again features in this inquiry. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0; \nChanging consumer behaviour and raising awareness of important safety issues takes a long time and substantial investment. \nAs the industry’s only consumer-focused organisation, the ESC is committed to promoting and encouraging public awareness of issues su\nrrounding electrical safety. \nOver the last 7 years we have invested \n£7.89 million\n in consumer awareness campaigns and \nhave an important role to play in ensuring that consumers know how and where to find a competent, qualified electrician.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0; \nThe ESC spent\n \n£1.42\n million\n \non consumer awareness campaigns focussing on electrical safety in 2012/13. By the end of 2013/14 the ESC will have spent a further £978,000 on similar consumer campaigns.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0; \nOver the last 5 years, the ESC has provided over £1million to communit\ny groups across the UK in direct grants to help raise awareness of electrical safety and improve electrical installations in vulnerable people’s homes.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0; \nIn addition to regular annual campaigns to boost awareness of the importance of electrical safety, the \nESC has over the last year funded four campaigns focussed on Part P and the importance of using a competent, qualified electrician. Audience research shows that these consumer campaigns have been seen or heard by consumers 204.5 million times this year. A \nfull breakdown of audience reach for each of these campaigns is below:\n&#xa0;\nFebruary campaign\n– \n \n32 million\nJune campaign\n– \n 127 million\nAugust campaign \n– \n 40 million\nNovember campaign\n – \n5.5 million\n3.6\n&#xa0; \nConsumers will further benefit \nfrom the new conditions\n of license for competent person scheme operators, which will require them to spend a \ndefined \namount on public awareness activities. This condition will be effective from June 2014.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0; \nWe believe th\ne\n system \nis\n robust \nand there is significant evidence \nto prove this, which we have set out below\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0; \nW\ne have\n also\n seriously\n considered\n the written ev\nidence of individual contractors who expressed concern\ns over the existing system, \nand have asked the relevant Competent Persons Scheme\ns\n to\n address the detail within their submissions. \n \nOur submission provides a brief overview of the overall system. \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0; \nIn its report into Building Regulations applying to electrical and gas installation and repairs in dwellings (March 2012), the Committee described the “stringent criteria” which must be met by organisations wishing to establish a Competent Persons Scheme. \nThose organisations must set an appropriately high standard of competence for members, and commit to testing members to that standard. \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0; \nIn turn, prospective electrical contractors must undertake an accreditation process in order to become members of \na\n Com\npetent Persons Scheme.\n Contractors must complete a minimum of 224 guided learning hours in order to gain the qualifications necessary to \nbe considered for accreditation\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0; \nA further advantage to the current system is the focus on \nimproving \nstandards year-on-year. \nWe are pleased that \nthe Minimal Technical Competence (MTC) to apply for Part P certification has been gradually raised since the introduction of the regulations in 2005. As of April 2013, those \nwishing to register with a Scheme must\n demonstrate competence equivalent to a Level 3 qualification.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.6\n&#xa0; \nNor is accreditation guaranteed. The average first time pass rate of the accreditation process is 81.4%.\n&#xa0;\n4.7\n&#xa0; \nOnce qualified, electrical contractors are subject to regular assessment as members o\nf the Competent\n Persons Scheme. Contractors are inspected at least once a year by an appointed supervisor\n w\nho records\n a range of \nindicators\n,\n including the quality of their workmanship and the state of their equipment\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.8\n&#xa0; \nThe \nSelect Committee’s original \nreport concluded that \nan “expected benefit” of \nthis system of stringent accreditation and regular assessment had \nwould be\n higher quality workmanship, and a fall in the number of installations by poorly qualified contractors\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.9\n&#xa0; \nT\nhe process of assessment \nis\n \nunder constant review\n, with improvements made as necessary\n. \nFor example, a\ns a result of the Part P Impact Assessment\n,\n the principle of “risk-based inspection” has been introduced\n.\n \n This means\n, for example,\n that members with poor customer complaints records can be inspected more often, and those with exemplary records less.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0; \nThe Committee has made clear its reservations over the \nexistence of two registers of electrical contractors and the potential for confusion amongst consumers. Reasons for the development of two registers were discussed at length in the course of oral evidence to the Committee on 2\nnd\n September 2013. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0; \nHowever, \nwe recognise the Committee’s concerns and in order to address the\nm\n \nhave\n held meeting\ns\n&#xa0;\nwith Certsure and NAPIT\n, \nagree\ning\n to seek to develop one easily identifiable quality mark, underpinned by a register of all full scope Part P registered electricians, tha\nt provides a single point of reference for consumers to refer to when seeking an electrician to \ncarry out\n work in their home.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0; \nIt is anticipated that the proposal will include all licensed Part P Scheme Operators in England and Wales who meet the new schem\ne requirements in line with DCLG’s timeline\n (June 2014)\n, and would lead to the removal from the market place of both existing registers (ElectricSafe Register and the Electrical Safety Register).\n&#xa0;\n We\n,\n along with the above mentioned organisations\n,\n have written to the Parliamentary\n under\n Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government setting out our intentions and seeking Government support in this regard.\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0; \nWe are keen to \nwork \nclosely \nwith \nboth the \nComm\nittee and the Department on the develo\npment of a new register\n,\n to ensure that it meets the objectives of policy makers,\n and will keep all parties\n informed of\n on\n-\ngoing\n developments.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0; \nIn light of the Committee’s on\n-\ngoing inquiry focused on the building \nregulations, t\nhe ESC \nwould like to raise its concern regarding proposals for \nthird party inspection and testing\n. \nWe believe that\n, by allowing professional electricians the opportunity to sign off the work \nof their peers, the new scheme undermines the self-\ncertification principle of Part P and thus could lead to significant numbers of electricians de\n-\nregistering in favour of having their work signed off by others. If this scheme does lead to mass deregistration, it would also mean a fall-back in the number o\nf electricians being inspected and tested every year \nand resultant safety implications.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0; \nIn order to avoid the outcome above, we\n \nrecommend that third party inspections exclude work carried out by means of trade\n. This mirrors requirements for gas \ninstallations and would, in our view, mean that the system does not have the unintended consequence of encouraging electricians to renege on their C\nompetent \nP\nerson \nS\ncheme\n membership. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n&#xa0; \nThe ESC is a UK-wide charity \ncommitted to reducing electrical fires and elec\ntric\nity-related injuries at home and at work.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n&#xa0; \nEvery year over 20,000 domestic fires are caused by faults and misuse of electrical appliances and installations throughout Great Britain. A further 2.5 million U\nK adults experience a mains voltage electric shock each year and around 70 people die from electrical accidents in the home.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nBuilding Regulations Part P,\n Electrical Safety in Dwellings\n, impact assessment, Dec 2012, p5\n \nIbid\n, p18, para 67\n \nEC Harris report for DCLG, February 2011\n \nOfQual\n - \nEAL Level 3 Certificate In Installing, Testing and Ensuring Compliance of Electrical Installations in Dwellings\n - \nhttp://register.ofqual.gov.uk/Qualification/Details/600_7695_1\n \nBuilding Regulations applying to electrical and gas installation \nand repairs in dwellings\n, p20\n"
