"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\nETUC position on House of Lords’ call for evidence on EU action to tackle youth unemployment&#xa0;1. Do you think that the EU should be providing funding to Member States to tackle youth unemployment? Does EU action respect Member States’ powers in the area of social and employment affairs?&#xa0;\nCertainly, the European Commission has funds that may well be addressed to combat the high rates of youth unemployment and the precarious work for young people all over Europe.\n&#xa0;\nDuring much of its history, the European Union had been the guarantor of a model which fought for social justice and equality through the defence of a strong Welfare State in all its members States. Unfortunately, since 2010 the European Commission diverted from this policy to another which only aim is on fighting the deficit through public expenditure cuts and the reduction of social and labour rights. Many times, these decisions are taken in violation of national powers in these matters. These policies have resulted into nothing but increasing levels of poverty, precariousness and inequality both in the labour market and the society as a whole\n&#xa0;\nThe only way to ensure respect to Member States' powers in the area of social and employment affairs while also guaranteeing a comprehensive social policy is through a sound dialogue between social partners and, where appropriate, with other organizations of civil society. This procedure should be followed both at the birth of these measures at European level as well as during the implementation and follow-up of these measures in the Member States.\n&#xa0;\nIt is then clear that the ETUC is against the intervention of the Commission in decisions on the national budgets of Member States, especially when this is limited to the obligation of reducing public expenditure on education, health and social services, as well as to deregulate labour relations. This behaviour deserves an even greater opposition when the intervention comes from organizations which are not subject to democratic control (like the IMF). Yet, the situation that we are living in the last time is unprecedented: while this interference occurs (and in a way particularly disproportionate in those countries intervened by the Troika), at the same time it has been beginning to put into question the legitimacy of the European social partners to sign joint agreements which could be later converted into Legislative Directives to be transposed to the 28 countries of the EU. It is important to state that this enters in direct contradiction with the Europe 2020 strategy.\n&#xa0;\nHence, it is crucial to make a sound statement that European social partners are legitimized by the Maastricht Treaty to make binding decisions on the issues of their responsibility. To block this process, because it comes from the Member States or the Commission itself, is an attack to the rights of European workers and a charge against the democratic bases underpinning the European Union.\n&#xa0;\n2. How do you think that the EU can best ‘add value’ to Member States’ efforts to tackle unemployment?&#xa0;Here it is important to mention the recently finalized process of European Social Dialogue which ended up with the signing of a \nFramework of Action on Youth Employment\n. This document contains proposals to combat youth unemployment through four main lines of action: training, transition between the educational system and the labour market, employment policies and self-employment. The document highlights the need of ensuring quality transitions and decent work for young people through a variety of actions to be undertaken by the Member States.\n&#xa0;\nThe added value of the EU to this Framework of Action is obvious, since it is a political document which parts from the dialogue and is constituted from the exchange of best practices in youth employment throughout the 28 countries of the Union. \n&#xa0;\nThe joint document recognizes that structural labour market reforms alone will not solve the problem of the youth unemployment and that other macroeconomic policies are needed.\n&#xa0;\nAnother element which could still further enhance its “added value” would be to make the transposition to the Member States more binding, since the Frameworks of Actions are not that obliged but they are a set of recommendations. The transposition of European legislative initiatives in the field of employment and social policies must be always conducted through a process of dialogue between the social partners and the national Governments, this is certainly another \"added value\" of the EU which has been deteriorating over time.\n&#xa0;\n3. Is there sufficient disaggregation in EU measures to tackle youth unemployment between, for example, support for young people classified as being not in education, employment or training (‘NEETs’), support for newly qualified graduates looking for work, and general career guidance?&#xa0;It must be admitted that, at least on the paper, the different measures included in the Youth Employment Initiative (Youth Guarantees, apprenticeships and internships schemes, among others) seem to be tailored to the wide range of social and economic realities of unemployed young people in Europe. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, a study in greater depth should be carried out on what measures may be most appropriate for each young person according to his level of education and his social background. For example, second-chance schemes for young people who have left their studies in order to retake the education system can be an effective method to help them in their professional career; while the promotion of entrepreneurship – another measure fostered by the EU – may only be useful to a very specific sector of the population (those who have attained a high level of education or are specialized in a very concrete and practical field; but not for any case).\n&#xa0;\n4. Are the EU’s accounting, monitoring and evaluation procedures sufficient to be able to determine whether EU funded projects to tackle youth unemployment have been successful or not? Are there ways in which they could be improved?&#xa0;\nThe European Union carries out a conscientious follow up of the programs it funds. Either way, greater involvement in the processes of accounting, monitoring and evaluation of the social partners at all levels (European, national, regional and local) – as well as other involved stakeholders – would undoubtedly improve the effectiveness of any European measure.\n&#xa0;\n5. How do you think the funds allocated through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and the European Social Fund (ESF) could best be spent?&#xa0;Insisting on the idea braced in the previous questions, the European funds could best be spent through the support of those measures which are the outcome of social dialogue. Thus, the different lines of action that the \nFramework of Actions on Youth Employment\n encompasses would be a good example of policies to be supported by the European Social Fund, to name a few:\n&#xa0;\nEducation:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTransition from education system to labour market:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEmployment policies:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHowever, it is worth to draw attention to the need of a substantial change in the macroeconomic policy of the European Union from a strategy focused on austerity towards a “\nNew Deal\n” that wagers on investing in strategic sectors which generate quality employment and on the defence of the Welfare State. Otherwise, any isolated measure that seeks to improve the employment situation of a part or the total workforce will be soon doomed to failure because of the lack of demand and the deregulation of the labour relations.\n&#xa0;6. Do you feel that young people (aged 15-24), youth groups and their representatives are involved and consulted to a satisfactory degree in the decisions being made around EU funding for youth unemployment projects, and how they are administered?&#xa0;Employment policies and social policies should be negotiated by the social partners. Wherever the role of social partners is left aside, measures should be taken to foster their participation in decision – taking. \n&#xa0;\nYoung people – either they are working, looking for employment or studying – are represented by Trade Unions as members of the working class. \n&#xa0;\nIt is important to note that European Trade Union organisations have organizational structures conformed by young workers in order to defend the interests and rights of young people. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, as it has been done so far, sometimes the Social Agents can count with the collaboration of civil society organizations (as it would be the case of the \nEuropean Youth Forum\n), but in any case being appointed as a social agent. The most representative trade unions are those who reach the status of social agent since they are elected through trade union elections that take place in companies and the Public Administrations. The inclusion of a third group would break this democratic balance in the way it is enshrined in the Treaty of Maastricht.\n&#xa0;7. Should the EU and Member States take into account the positive and negative socio-economic impacts of youth migration due to unemployment when designing measures to tackle youth unemployment? How might any negative consequences be mitigated?&#xa0;The European Union and the Member States must take into account that the immigrant population is the one suffering worst working and life conditions. In this way, measures should be driven to improve the social and labour situation of these young people, with special attention to the case of the young immigrant women.\n&#xa0;\nThe defence of a regulated migratory model will not only result in the improvement of the quality of life of the people who come to Europe from other countries, but will also contribute to the economic growth and the stabilization of the population challenges that the European Union faces.\n&#xa0;8. How can the EU and Member States embrace new technologies and new methods of working to combat youth unemployment?&#xa0;\nNew technologies can certainly help to promote faster contact between young people and the Administration at the time of launching initiatives to combat youth unemployment. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, when designing these channels of communication, it should be taken into account that there are sectors of the population - those living in conditions of social exclusion or risk – which have no access to these technologies. In this way, active policies specifically aimed at these groups should be boosted.\n&#xa0;\n21 October 2013 \n&#xa0;\n"
