[[[Executive Summary]]]High quality education for all children, including disabled children, in their first years of schooling builds a foundation for future learning and for healthy and productive family and civic life. Literacy skills equip a person both to  gain knowledge and understanding of their immediate environment, and to make sense of the wider world. Research shows that a child who is able to read and write is better able to contribute to his or her personal and community well being. The Primary Education Development Plan (PEDP III), Big Results Now (BRN) and the LANES literacy and numeracy proposal all firmly recognize the importance of education to support literacy development, so as to ensure better lives for  Tanzanians including people with disabilities. But the challenges are many, including semi-trained teachers for literacy, a lack of Braille reading materials to read, besides having few textbooks transcribed into Braille.The CBP’s experience in Braille book provision is in line with  DFID’s mission to support disabled children and youths to improve their lives, and prepare them to become responsible citizens in their communities.

[[[Introduction]]]The Children’s Book Project for Tanzania is a local Non – Governmental Organization whose main goals are to cultivate a strong reading culture among children in Tanzania through the provision of books to children for the purpose of increasing and widening their knowledge and developing their reading skills; through  the teaching of literacy and support for reading in the formal education system via in-service training of teachers; and through supporting indigenous authorship and publishing.

[[[Description of CBP Activities]]]CBP’s programme has three main components which include:CBP implements  professional development for trainers. This is led by CBP’s experienced staff. Trainers are trained for 15 days, divided into three 5-day workshop sessions spread out over 8 months. In addition to training of teachers, CBP provides reading materials to help children learn to read and develop life-long habits of reading. Schools are supplied with reading materials, and teachers are given training in library management and in reading promotion.CBP provides book sector training to publishers, writers, illustrators and editors, with the aim of developing their professional skills,  hence improving the quality of the books produced.

[[[of Braille Books for Visually Impaired Children.]]]Rationale for the ProjectIn 1994 CBP organized a Children’s Book Day at the National Library. Among the invited children where visually impaired children from Uhuru Mchanganyiko, in Ilala District, Dar es Salaam region. The children performed a poem which  expressed how  they were being neglected in CBP’s book project activities, while normal children were provided with books.The children raised their concern that they had very few textbooks in Braille and there were no reading books. Following the request, CBP embarked on a programme to produce  Braille books for visually impaired children. Those were the first readers ever produced for visually impaired children in the country. To date, CBP has transcribed 37 story books for visually impaired children. The books have been distributed to 25 schools which cater for  disabled children.Currently there are more than 2,000 visually impaired children in primary schools in Tanzania. Among them are two specials namely Bwigili in Dodoma region and Furaha in Tabora region. There are also integrated schools which are Uhuru Mchanganyiko in Dar es Salaam,Mazinyungu in Morogoro region and another one in Lushoto, the rest are inclusive schools.

[[[ Activities]]]CBP will carry out a needs assessment to determine the actual number of visually impaired children who are in primary schools in Tanzania. The number of visually impaired children will determine the print run of the Braille books to be produced and distributed to schools. Apart from getting this crucial information, the project will also provide data on the list of schools with such children and number of tutors and teachers available for these children. The information will support project planning.2.

[[[ ]]]Training of Trainers Select a number of tutors from the colleges which train teachers for visually impaired children and train them on how to teach effective literacy skills .and prepare them to become trainers and mentors.. Train teachers through in-service teacher training, using the  train the trainer model.. The initiative is focusing on enabling teachers to acquire book management skills  for Braille books, and providing them with basic librarian skills;and also working to to incorporate reading materials into the school’s instructional strategies and  culture through library development and instructional practice..The Braille book provision initiative strongly supports PEDP III which states the necessity for school libraries and supplementary materials to support learning and teaching.Provision of Braille Books to integrated schools which cater for visually impaired children and to inclusive schools will support instruction strategies, literacy development and learning outcomes. These materials will support the quality of education, the country’s literacy development and nurture children’s lifelong habits of reading during a formative period of learning.CBP has participated in the preparation of the government (Ministry of Education and Vocational Training) proposal on literacy and numeracy (LANES) to the Global Partnership in Education (GPE), which has been approved. The proposal to GPE  accommodated neither the  provision of reading books to both normal and visually impaired children nor the establishment of school libraries.Furthermore, these measures were also absent from the new presidential initiative Big Results Now (BRN) and the PEDP III activities In this respect CBP is appealing to DFID to take the responsibility to provide Braille Books to improve the children’s outcome and eventually contribute to improving the quality education.December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;3&#xa0;
