How might they change?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat scope, scale and remit should the BBC have? Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow should the BBC be funded beyond 2016? Is there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries? How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nSuch as the wireless cameras operated by the BBC and Sky \nNews, and the radio microphones used in virtually all television production and many West End shows.\n \nReith, Into the Wind 1949\n \nCommunications Act 2003 – Section 264\n \ne\n.g. \nSpeech by Michael Grade, ‘Building Public Value’ 29 June 2004; \nBBC Press Release\n: Michael Grade resigns as BBC Chairman 28.11.06\n Lords Communications Committee Report: “Public service broadcasting: short-term crisis, long-term future?” (March 2009)\n BBC Trust documents – Purpose Remits March 2013 \n \nBBC Blogs - Olympics: Red Button\n - Tuesday 14 August 2012\n \nOfcom Press Release - New HD channels on terrestrial TV – 16 July 2013\n \nSociety of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and CAP – Q3 2013\n BBC Trust documents – Purpose Remits March 2013 \n \nConnectivity, Content and Consumers: Brit\nain’s d\nigital platform for growth –p29\n \nBBC Trust documents – Purpose Remits March 2013\n \nSelect Committee on Select Committee on the BBC Charter Review  – First Report - 2005\n \nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport, Review of the BBC's Royal Charter: \nA\n strong BBC, independent of government\n, March 2005, p. 2\n \n \nSpeech given by Tony Hall, BBC Director-General, at the BBC Radio Theatre in London on Tuesday 8 October 2013.\n BARB Establishment Survey, Q1 2013  \n 3 Reasons LLP, Spring 2013 Market Model\n  \n \nBARB viewing figures, Jan-Mar 2013  \n \nPACT 2012\n Thinkbox: Screen Life: TV in Demand 2013  \n Local television funding agreement – BBC Trust May 2012\n"
