"FBA0011/13-14\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn June 2010 the Government committed to improve the way in which tax policy is developed, communicated and legislated, and published a consultation document: \nTax policy-making: a new approach\n. In December 2010 the Government published \n“\nThe new approach to\n tax policy making: a response to the consultation\n”\n, which set out details of the new tax policy making process. \n&#xa0;\nDuring the Tax Policy Making consultation, officials met more than 40 tax practitioners to discuss the way we make tax policy: including lawy\ners, accountants, and tax managers and received over 40 written responses.\n&#xa0;\nFollowing consultation, the Government announced five major changes which have a substantial impact on the way tax policy is made and communicated: \n&#xa0;\n• Where the Government is emba\nrking on \nmajor areas of tax \nreform\n, it will set out its policy objectives and rationale for reform, building on the approach taken in the Corporate Tax Road Map. \n• Tax policies will be developed over a \nlonger policy cycle\n. The majority of tax measures will be announced at Budgets for inclusion in the Finance Bill the following year at the earliest. \n• The Government will use the period between the Budget and the following Finance Bill to consult on proposed policy changes \nand draft legislation. The Government published a \nTax Consultation Framework\n that outlines its approach to consultation on tax policy and \nlegislation. In summary, the framework commits to:\n&#xa0;\n• The Government will ta\nke a \nmore strategic approach\n to \ntax \navoidance, and its response to significant avoidance risks will be balanced with improving predictability and stability in the tax system. The Government published a \nProtocol\n setting out the circumstances in which it wil\nl announce legislative changes with immediate effect outside fiscal events. \n&#xa0;\n• \nWhen announcing changes to tax law, the Government will ensure that it clearly sets out what the change is\n;\n why it is being proposed and what impact it will have. \n&#xa0;\nEvaluation of the tax policy making processTax Professionals Forum\nThe Government is continuing to engage with the Forum on areas where, on occasion due to concerns regarding avoidance, \nit has not been able to follow the full stages of the new approach.\nOffice of Tax Simplification\nFinance Bill process:&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\nUNCLASSIFIED\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
