"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from \nBritish Retail Consortium\n [PCC Progress 29]\n&#xa0;The British Retail Consortium (BRC) welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the\n Home Affairs Select Committee\n inquiry into the work and effectiveness of Police and Crime Commissioners.   This paper briefly summarises the \nBRC’s views, which are most relevant to the following strands of the Committee’s inquiry: \nAbout The BRCThe \nBRC \nis the lead trade association for the retail sector and the authoritative voice of the industry. We bring toge\nther a \nwhole range of retailers across the UK, from small independents to large multiples and department stores, selling a wide range of products through high street, out of town, neighbourhood, rural and online stores.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe level of c\nrime committed against businesses is significant and \ncontinues\n to be of real concern to BRC members.\n  \nAnalysis \ncarried out by the \nby the Metropolitan Police\n \nfor the Mayor’s Office\n found that in 2012/13, businesses were \nthe \nvictims of 15% of all reported crime in\n London\n.\n \n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are in the process of analysing the results of the \nBRC Annual R\netail Crime Survey\n for 2013.  T\nhe last report, published earli\ner this year, \nfound that in 2011-12:  \n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite the level of retail crime, \ntackling \nit is often not considered a priority by law enforcement and retailers \nremain\n frustrated about the often poor response they receive to \nreported \ncrimes.  Crimes committed against retailers, such as shop \ntheft\n, are still \nperceived\n by many as 'victimless'.  Such a view fails to \nrecognise\n the importance of the retail sector to local communities and the fact\n that the same offenders target\ning shops \noften \ncommit other crimes in their local areas.  \nIt also fails to recognise the impact on employees themselves.  \nLocal perceptions of \ncrime and criminality are undoubtedly shaped by what people experience in their shopping centres and local stores.    \nMeasuring business crime 2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA fundamental problem with assessing the impact of business crime \ni\ns that there is no agreed definition of it\n.  \nWe cannot fight \nit \neffectively until the true scale of the problem is measured and understood.   \nThis is why the BRC fully supports the work by DCC Sue Fish, ACPO lead for Business Crime, to introduce a single, national \nbusiness crime \ndefinition.\n  \nThis, along with the capability of police forces to ‘tag’ such crime on their recording systems, would represent a major step forward. It \nwould \nallow \nthere to be \nfocused partnership\ns\n between businesses and the police to tackle retail crime, utilising resources more effectively to target hot spots within each force area.\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf this definition is introduced by ACPO, we would expect PCCs to \nhelp \nensure that their police forces implement \nit \nas soon as possible and have in place the necessary \nIT \nsoftware to start recording and measuring business crime.  \nIn time, w\ne would like to see business crime statistics published by each\n police force in the same way that\n other crime data is routinely m\nade available. \n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe BRC \nsupported \nthe introduction of elected P\nolice and \nC\nrime \nC\nommissioners\n.  We undertook a range of work both before and after the PCC elections to \nexplain \nhow, \nthrough working with retail\ners, PCCs can help to cut crime\n affecting local communities.  The BRC\n produced guidance for PCC \ncandidates\n, \nand held \na number of meetings with individual PCCs to discuss retail crime. \nBusiness Crime in PCC Police and Crime Plans 3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEarlier this year the BRC conducted an informal review of \npublished \nPCC Police and \nCrime Plans for 2013-17, to examine the extent of \ncommitments \nwithin them \nto tackle business crime and retail crime \ni\nn particular.  \n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe majority of the Police and Crime Commissioners have recognised \nin some way \nthe \nneed to work \nwith businesses in their Plans. Out of the 41 newly elected Commissioners, over half of them (27) refer to engaging with business as part of their crime fighting strategy. \n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever the degree\n to which PCCs \nset out specific proposals to tackle\n crimes affecting \nbusinesses \nvaries greatly, \nfrom \nbrief \nreference\ns\n to \nconsulting \nwith \nbusiness to more detailed commitments about specifically working with retailers to tackle crime affecting them. \n  \nLondon: A dedicated Business Crime Strategy 3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn 26 November the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime published a consultation on a business crime s\ntrategy for London\n.\n  The BRC very much welcomes this and had been engaged\n in the early stages of the \nconsultation process \nto help \nshape the \nstra\nt\negy\n.  \nIf delivered, \nthe \nproposals within the draft strategy would represent a significant step forward in how business crime is tackled, such as: \n&#xa0;3.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe BRC would like to see the production of a dedicated business crime strategy replicated by PCCs elsewhere. Whilst t\nhe\n strategy is still in development and crucial \nissues such \nhow \noperational delivery \nwill be achieved have yet to be resolved\n, the \napproach being taken in London is a very positive one. \n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA specific example of where PCCs could help to deliver improvements for retailers is in relation to\n the police response to fraud, \na\nn issue of\n major concern \nfor the sector\n.\n  \nThe introduction of \nAction Fraud\n in April 2013 created a single, central reporting centre for fraud.   Action Fraud feeds reports of fraud into the NFIB for further analysis, which then sends cases out to local police forces for further action.  \nHowever \nfrom an enforcement perspective\n \nthe \nnew \nprocess is \nfailing \nretailers, \nfor the following reasons:\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe extent of the problem is made clear in t\nhe MOPAC consultation \ndocument.  In London of the solvable fraud reports which have been sent out from the NFIB to the MPS for further action since the inception of Action Fraud, just 3% have been solved.\n  \n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRetailers would like PCCs to \nwork with their local police forces to improve their response to \nfraud\n and deliver improvements for businesses in this area. \n&#xa0;5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSet out below are \nthe BRCs \nrecommendations for how PCCs could \nhelp to \nreduce \nretail\n \ncrime more effectively\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;British Retail Consortium\nDecember 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n MOPAC,  \nBusiness Crime Strategy: Protecting Jobs and Growth in London: Consultation on draft proposals\n, 26 November 2013\n British Retail Consortium, \nRetail Crime Survey 2012\n, January 2013\n \nhttp://www.apccs.police.uk/fileUploads/Business_community_engagement/PCC_Guidance_retail.pdf\n&#xa0;\n MOPAC,  \nBusiness Crime Strategy: Protecting Jobs and Growth in London: Consultation on draft proposals\n, 26 November 2013\n Ibid.,p.9\n"
