[[[Written evidence submitted by Queen’s University, Belfast (WSC088)]]]&#xa0;

[[[Executive Summary]]]: This submission recognises the under-representation of women’s in STEM academic careers. Queen’s University Belfast is making this submission of evidence because of its expertise, built up over a period of 14 years, in taking concerted action to address this problem. The submission draws on this experience to: &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What should universities and the higher education sector]]] 

[[[do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;              We are of the view that the culture of an institution is embodied in its structure and practices, policies and procedures. It is also embedded in the way people think and act. Over the last decade, in Queen’s we have introduced policies, changed practices, and challenged unconsciously-held views on women’s academic contributions.  This has led to women having greater visibility across the university in many and varied roles, including leadership roles; inviting leading women in science to give annual lectures and keynote addresses; partnering with external institutions at local, national and international level to bring role model women into the University; having an active commissioning programme for portraits of important University women. In addition, regular networking opportunities for mid-level and senior women provide opportunities for sharing experiences and providing mutual support and friendship across disciplinary and managerial lines. Ensuring gender balance among invited speakers is given importance at all levels, as is actively seeking suitably qualified women for membership of international and external advisory panels. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;              At               Queen’s, we have identified the particular ‘sticking points’ for women in terms of career progression. These mainly occur in the transition from Lecturer to Senior Lecturer/Reader. We have found that a critical issue at this career stage for women is finding the best way of balancing home and work commitments. Among the policies and practices we have introduced to support women at this career point include:  a maternity cover scheme to enable women take their maternity leave without worry about replacement costs; a ‘research only’ semester for women scientists returning from maternity leave; enabling women to return from maternity leave on a part-time basis while guaranteeing that they can return to full-time work when they wish; a summer holiday scheme and after-school club for children of academic staff; on-campus comprehensive full-time childcare provision; flexible working practices that are taken into account in a positive manner in the promotion application process. The role as SWAN Champion, often taken by early career women, is also considered a formal aspect of career development, and time spent on this administrative activity is taken into account in School work-load allocation models.&#xa0;&#xa0;              We know from speaking with women in our institution that they are less likely to put themselves forward for promotion if they do not understand the criteria and the process.  From an early point in tackling gender imbalance in the institution, it was clear that promotion procedures needed to be made more transparent. An early, and continuing, initiative is the annual ‘promotions seminar’ at which academic and professional leaders responsible for the process demystify the promotions criteria and procedure. This is held at a point in the university cycle when academics have time to prepare their applications, four months before the formal promotion application call is made. Along with this annual seminar, the long-running and award-winning mentoring scheme plays an important part in encouraging women to apply, and in assisting women with their submissions. Many schools now proactively identify candidates for promotion rather than waiting for people to self-select. Furthermore, service as a SWAN Champion is recognised as demonstrating leadership in the promotions criteria.               Over time, we have found that women’s chances of being successfully promoted match, and even outweigh, those of men.  Of the 181 women mentored since 2000, 51% have secured promotion, some on more than one occasion. Our continuing challenge is to encourage women to apply for promotion, as they still do so at a lesser rate than men. The close monitoring of the gendered patterns of promotions is undertaken by the Equal Opportunities Unit, working in tandem with Queen’s Gender Initiative, and overseen by the Standing Committee of Senate. The strength of the promotions-supporting actions derive from this vital evidence base, as do many of the other initiatives undertaken by the University to support women’s career progression in academia.&#xa0;&#xa0;              We have found that one of the most common points at which women abandon an academic career is at the level of post-doctoral researcher. This career stage often coincides with the time in women’s lives when pregnancy and childcare demands are at their most acute, and/or older family members, including parents, require care and support. As women in Northern Ireland (as elsewhere) still take responsibility for the majority of childcare and domestic work, Queen’s is conscious of the need to provide flexible working opportunities to enable women advance their careers in a similar manner to men. There are a range of initiatives across the 20 Schools in the University, and institutional policies in place, to facilitate flexible working so as to reconcile work and family life. Among these are: recognition in the promotion documentation that flexible working does not militate against promotion; holding key School meetings during core hours and scheduled well in advance; allowing women researchers going on maternity leave to place their research grants in abeyance, and the institution shouldering the cost of replacement researchers for the duration of the maternity leave.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;These are some examples of the initiatives Queen’s University has taken in order to attract and retain talented women academics. 

[[[We know that one measure, or one method, does not bring success in this regard. Instead, we employ a wide variety of strategies that act on multiple levels, along with senior management commitment to and School-level ownership of the ambition to make the institution more attractive, accessible and fulfilling as a place of work for talented women and men.]]] We implement a comprehensive integrated action programme to deliver this multi-levelled approach, Gender and Leadership in Science and Society (GLiSS).&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;21.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Challenge funding bodies such as HEFCE and RCUK to show that they are dedicated to gender equality, especially at senior levels: on their councils, advisory boards, grant panels and other decision-making fora. Specifically, Funding Councils could be incentivised to develop Intermediate Research Fellowships to support women to consolidate their research profiles having had one or more periods of maternity leave. There is a gap in the funding available for New Investigators and Senior Investigators which affects both female and male academic scientists. However, the impact is greater for female research-active academics who have had to take leave at this crucial juncture and who are therefore disadvantaged in their CV and publications record. A prompt on the application form specifically encouraging candidates to identify periods of maternity/paternity leave or periods of part-time working for family reasons would be helpful in explaining gaps and apparent fall-off in productivity, and would send a strong message of recognition of such circumstances.&#xa0;21.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Require funding councils to place gender diversity at the core of their funding applications processes, with a focus on quality rather than quantity and a stated recognition of the challenges faced by many young female researchers in combining careers in science with caring responsibilities.&#xa0;21.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Require Higher Education Institutions to review the position of women in academic leadership and, as an initial step, set timetabled targets for improvement in a manner similar to that advocated for women on corporate boards by the 30% Club and the related 2013 Thompson Reuters study. &#xa0;21.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Monitor key data on gender equality in STEM at different career stages, using the data produced by HESA.&#xa0;21.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Commission a government review into women’s participation in decision-making in STEM in the HE sector similar to that conducted by Lord Davies on women in decision-making roles, and commit to acting on its recommendations. &#xa0;21.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Initiate a women in science awareness programme, targeted at the general public, schoolchildren (girls and boys), to make science, and STEM, part of girls’ ambitions.&#xa0;21.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Consult with the HE sector regularly about how to best attract and retain women in                    STEM academic careers.&#xa0;21.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Utilise the Athena SWAN framework, and others, to evaluate and monitor     actions aimed at achieving parity between academic women and men in  STEM.&#xa0;21.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Invest in long-term support for Athena SWAN.&#xa0;21.10&#xa0; Provide positive recognition for HEIs working to achieve equality.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0; Department of Finance and Personnel (2012) Women in Northern Ireland, September 2012, pp. 19-20.
