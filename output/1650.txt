[[[About the TCPA]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[ ]]]The Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA) is an independent charity working to improve the art and science of town and country planning. The TCPA puts social justice and the environment at the heart of policy debate and inspires government, industry and campaigners to take a fresh perspective on major issues, including planning policy, housing, regeneration and climate change. Our objectives are to:&#xa0;

[[[esponse]]]The TCPA has chosen to respond solely to the question ‘Why is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK?’ Through leading two Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) projects the Association has become aware of the vast differences between the UK and other European countries in terms of the use of community and district heating as well as CHP. &#xa0;

[[[ The positive role of planning in delivering community ]]]

[[[heating]]]Planning can play a key role in delivering community heating. Through the work of the TCPA and Friends of the Earth led Planning and Climate Change Coalition we have explored the ways in which planning policies can support community heating and CHP. Our Planning for climate change - guidance for local authorities which was published following the National Planning Policy Framework in April 2012, sets out best practice policies for plan making and development management, as well as highlighting the importance of evidence gathering. &#xa0;

[[[an projects]]]The TCPA currently leads two Intelligent Energy Europe projects which both champion the positive role of planning in the delivery of community heating and CHP. Leadership for Energy Action and Planning (LEAP) has been established to facilitate a network of pan-European municipalities to plan and deliver local sustainable energy solutions in line with the Covenant of Mayors. A partnership of ten organisations from seven European Union (EU) countries have come together to improve their capacity as key actors in speeding up the local uptake of sustainable energy measures and the move towards a low-carbon local economy. &#xa0;The project highlights case studies of how local authorities can work in partnership to help community groups deliver community heating schemes. The project also focusses on the key role of the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) in delivering these objectives.&#xa0;A recently published Case Studies Paper from the LEAP project sets out four key recommendations to ensuring greater deployment of decentralized energy, including district heating/ CHP, as follows:&#xa0;The TCPA’s second Intelligent Energy Europe funded project is Spatial Planning and Energy for Communities In All Landscapes (SPECIAL). The three year project started in March 2013 and focuses on training planners to link spatial planning and energy. Spatial planning and urban planners have a pivotal role in developing energy strategies and action plans, and the SPECIAL project has been set up to help bridge the gap between climate change/energy action planning and spatial and urban planning. The project will address the barriers to having a positive and holistic regulatory framework in place, and the importance of creating energy opportunity maps, based on sound evidence bases, which can direct community groups to the most appropriate locations for community heating projects.&#xa0;As part of the TCPA’s training for the SPECIAL project the Association and project partners have visited developments in Sweden where district heating is the most common source of heating for apartments and commercial buildings, whilst it is also used for detached homes to a lesser extent. During a training week in the UK the project partnership visited the CHP scheme in central Milton Keynes operated by Thameswey Central Milton Keynes Ltd. This exemplified some of the challenges and opportunities of establishing a district scale CHP scheme in the UK. Set up in 2005, the Milton Keynes scheme required a partnership with English Partnerships (now the HCA) and benefited from the agency being both the planning authority and landowner. It took place ahead of mainstream planning policy for district heating in Milton Keynes. However, the Council now has a Core Strategy Policy on ‘Community Energy Networks and Large Scale Renewable Energy Schemes’, where it promotes the use of renewable energy schemes that can demonstrate that there will not be any negative social, economic, or environmental results from the scheme. The Council also has the following requirements:1. For developments of more than 100 homes, applications should show that the potential for community energy networks has been explored2. For development of more than 200 homes, applications will require community energy networks, unless it can be proven that this is not feasible on technical or economic grounds3. Regardless of the number of homes in a proposal, where an existing local energy network is established, developments will be expected to connect to the network, if feasible&#xa0;The TCPA believes spatial planning has a key role to play in identifying suitable locations for the installation of district heating and CHP. Through energy opportunity mapping and heat mapping planners can spatially map demand, capacity and constraints. As the above example illustrates they can also require new developments to consider installing district heating systems, or require them to connect to existing ones.    &#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; Planning and Climate Change Coalition (April 2012) http://www.tcpa.org.uk/data/files/PCC_Guide_April_2012.pdf  LEAP project (2013) http://leap-eu.org/  SPECIAL project (2013) http://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=1134
