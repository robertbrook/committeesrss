defaultWritten evidence from Neil Taylor (CYS021)
default&#xa0;
defaultI am a keen and experienced cyclist (about 7000 
defaultmiles 
defaultper year). My wife and I have ridden tandem in 29 countries. Probably the most hostile and aggressive driving we have encountered is from a minority of drivers in this country.
default&#xa0;
defaultSuch drivers do not 
defaulttake seriously their duty of care to vulnerable road users (cyclists and pedestrians).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe situation is different in many continental countries where there is 
defaulta  ‘rebuttable
default presumption’ in favour of the vulnerable party 
defaultie
default the motorised vehicle driver is
default held to be responsible
default for a collision
default unless they can prove otherwise.
default&#xa0;
defaultAdopting this measure here would make far more motorists pay due care and attention.
