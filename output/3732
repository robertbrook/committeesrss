[normal]Written evidence from Neil Taylor (CYS021)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am a keen and experienced cyclist (about 7000 
[normal]miles 
[normal]per year). My wife and I have ridden tandem in 29 countries. Probably the most hostile and aggressive driving we have encountered is from a minority of drivers in this country.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Such drivers do not 
[normal]take seriously their duty of care to vulnerable road users (cyclists and pedestrians).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The situation is different in many continental countries where there is 
[normal]a  ‘rebuttable
[normal] presumption’ in favour of the vulnerable party 
[normal]ie
[normal] the motorised vehicle driver is
[normal] held to be responsible
[normal] for a collision
[normal] unless they can prove otherwise.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Adopting this measure here would make far more motorists pay due care and attention.
