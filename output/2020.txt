[[[Summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Optical Confederation welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the Committee’s inquiry on the Draft Deregulation Bill.&#xa0;The Optical Confederation supports &#xa0;

[[[1.) A duty to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth]]]&#xa0;1.1.) In a recent submission to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Optical Confederation argued for the scope of the growth duty to be widened to encompass the significant and widespread practice of commissioning of public services by public authorities.  In our case, this would relate to NHS eye health services. This is often simply another form of regulation and, if applied inappropriately, can add significantly to business costs and small business risk without public benefit. A similar duty on public sector commissioners might also be a step forward. &#xa0;1.2) We have seen considerable positive progress in this area under the current Government’s NHS reforms and by NHS England’s commitments to a Single Operating Model for sight testing contract applications, contact compliance and the ‘earned autonomy’ model, and it is hoped that this will continue. &#xa0;1.3) There are however aspects of the Any Qualified Provider (AQP), national contract and contract compliance for other services which provide very high barriers to market entry for small and large businesses alike. The Optical Confederation is keen to work with NHS England on this, as the new health and social care system becomes established during 2013-14, in order to see how these areas can be improved.&#xa0;
