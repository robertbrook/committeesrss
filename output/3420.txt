[[[comment on draft Deregulation Bill]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Introduction]]]Oil &amp; Gas UK is the principal trade association for the offshore oil and gas exploration and production industry in the United Kingdom, with more than 390 member companies, comprising oil and gas operators and investors and a broad spectrum of the supply chain: contractors, suppliers, law firms and consultants.We welcome this opportunity to respond to the Deregulation Bill that has been drafted for pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses.As a trade association for the UK’s offshore oil and gas industry, our comments address Clause 28 of the Deregulation Bill and reflect the views of our members.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Summary of key points]]]Our members did not take issue with the principle behind the proposed amendment to the Petroleum Act and no concerns were expressed about Model Clauses being implemented in a “document to be published by the Secretary of State” as opposed to regulations. However, the below comments were made:

[[[Oil &amp; Gas UK position]]]Whilst there is not necessarily a concern about Model Clauses being implemented in a “document to be published by the Secretary of State” as opposed to regulations, the Bill is unclear as to the process by which Model Clauses will be introduced and scrutinised in future. Members were keen to understand, in particular, what ability the industry will have to comment on any proposed amendments or new editions before they are published and come into effect.It was proposed that a period of consultation should be required.  The process to be followed for any document published outside of the regulations would need to be given due consideration and developed.Another concern was whether such a process could tend towards individual licences having individually negotiated terms (the Bill seems to leave this possibility open although it is assumed this is not the intent).  The view of Oil &amp; Gas UK is that this should not be the case on grounds of lack of transparency and administrative complexity and should be expressly addressed in the legislation.Below is a summary of the opinions of our members.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Member One]]]We do not see any reason why model clauses should continue to be issued in regulation form only, particularly now that the applicable model clauses are set out in full within each licence and the regulation is not required as a point of reference.   Therefore, we do not have an issue with the principle behind the proposed amendment to the Petroleum Act. However, we do believe that the current proposals are too vague as no further information is given on what form the model clauses will take if not set out in regulation and what the new process will be for issuing such model clauses. It may be appropriate for the process to be governed by legislation even if the model clauses themselves are not.  If the process is to be contained in legislation, this could also be effected by an amendment to the Petroleum Act introduced by the Deregulation Bill.We would therefore recommend that the change should not be introduced in the Deregulation Bill unless and until the new process for introducing model clauses other than by regulation has been agreed.  The issues should be considered at the same time – it does not seem appropriate to make the suggested change now and consider the details of what form the model clauses will take and the new process for agreeing them at a later stage. To summarise, we believe that the industry should not support this amendment without more detailed proposals also being made as to new form of model clauses and the process for agreeing such model clauses going forward.  If it is the case that the Government already has proposals on these issues, those proposals should be shared with industry as soon as possible.We have a further concern as to the volume of model clauses that this could lead to and how often the model clauses will be amended.  It would be preferable to maintain a good level of uniformity across licences.  If the Secretary of State is able to issue model clauses out with regulation, will this lead to a larger volume of model clauses being used at any one time?This should also be considered alongside the process for issuing new model clauses and restrictions on how often new model clauses can be introduced by the Secretary of State may be required.  It may be appropriate for there to be one or more sets of model clauses issued for each Licensing Round. The proposed model clauses for that Licensing Round could then be released at the same time as the Licensing Round is announced (e.g. one set of model clauses per type of licence).&#xa0;

[[[Member two]]]We agree with your assessment that it is unclear as to how model clauses will be introduced / scrutinised and that industry should have the ability to comment on proposed amendments.  The wording does also appear to leave it open for individual licence terms to be negotiated, which we agree should not be the case.&#xa0;

[[[Member three]]]Overall, there is a benefit to speed up the legislative process and thereby allow Secretary of State published documents as opposed to regulations. However, it is important to have clarity and transparency around the process concerning a simplified process on Model Clause which with the draft Bill is difficult to foresee, both concerning possibility to influence by the industry and how such clauses could be applied individually.&#xa0;

[[[Member four]]] (with suggested amendment to the Clause)&#xa0;We agree that some period of consultation is required. We are not sure what legal obligation exists for consultation about regulations (and suspect it’s part of the Contracting Out and Deregulation Act). In any event, we have suggested an amendment to s4(2)(B) - see above - to ensure that there will be no reduction in the level of consultation.We also agree that DECC is unlikely to agree different clauses for different licences. Apart from the points you make, DECC will be concerned to treat applicants equally for fear of JR.&#xa0;
