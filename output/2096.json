"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAsylum Support Appeals Project (ASAP) – Written evidenceASAP is a legal advice charity specialising in asylum support law. It was set up in 2003 with the aim of reducing the destitution of asylum seekers by protecting their legal rights to food and shelter. ASAP runs a \npro bono\n representation scheme, called the Duty Scheme, at the First-tier Tribunal (Asylum Support) (the Tribunal). The Duty Scheme operates daily and appellants are assisted by ASAP staff and around 30 volunteer solicitors and barristers. In 2012 we represented in 455 cases, just over half the number of appellants with oral hearings.  ASAP also provides training on asylum support law to voluntary sector agencies and runs a telephone advice line. We seek to influence asylum support policy through research, lobbying and strategic litigation.  \nWe are responding only to Clause 40 of the Bill\nSummary\n&#xa0;\nOur response will engage with questions 3, 7 and 9 (not set out here) of the consultation.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n16 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
