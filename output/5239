default evidence on the following questions:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.1 BasicNeedsdefault&#xa0;
defaultBasicNeeds is an international development organisation that was founded in 2000 by Chris Underhill MBE with the aim of bringing about lasting change in the lives of people with mental illness and epilepsy, and their family members.
default&#xa0;
defaultBasicNeeds’ purpose is to 
defaultenable people with mental illness or epilepsy and their families to live and work successfully in their communities defaultby combining health, socio-economic and community orientated solutions with changes in policy, practice and resource allocation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBy delivering the BasicNeeds Model for Mental Health and Development, BasicNeeds has worked with hundreds of national and international partners and reached more than 
defaulthalf a milliondefault people with mental illness and epilepsy, and their family members.  Based on its community generated experience and knowledge, BasicNeeds has challenged the status quo, leading and affecting change in national and global policy and practice.
default&#xa0;
defaultBasicNeeds has had a significant impact on policy and systems change 
defaulton local, regional, 
defaultnational 
defaultand international 
defaultlevel
defaults and has worked closely with the 
defaultWorld Health Organisation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBasicNeeds empowers people with lived experience of mental illness to come together collectively into 
defaultself-help
default groups (SHGs) and 
defaultself-advocate
default for their needs and their rights. In Ghana, a national association of people with mental illness and their caregivers was founded
default from SHGs.
default 
defaultTogether with
default BasicNeeds, 
defaultthe association 
defaultplayed a key role in influencing the passage of a new mental health bill that was
default finally
default approved in 2011. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBasicNeeds has also played a critical role in national reform in Kenya, Laos PDR, India, Uganda, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. At a global level, BasicNeeds has influenced the development of the WHO’s mhGAP Intervention Guide. It 
defaultlends its
default expertise to The Lancet Movement for Global Mental Health (which Chris Underhill leads), the PRIME global research coalition in mental health, 
defaultNational
default Institute of Mental Health t
defaulthe WHO Global Forum of Mental Health, and two WHO steering committees. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBasicNeeds has conducted a 
default number 
defaultof research studies on both mental health and development policy and practice, and recently co-authored a case study on the implementation of the BasicNeeds model in Nepal that was published in PLoS Medicine, a peer reviewed journal.
default&#xa0;default2.2default&#xa0; 
defaultBasicNeeds’ adefaultssociation with DFIDdefault default&#xa0;
defaultSince BasicNeeds was established in 2000, DFID has provided significant funding through its grants schemes to BasicNeeds programmes in low and middle income countries (LMIC).  
default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultn 2013 
defaultBasicNeeds established an
default important relationship with DFID 
defaultas, via a bilateral aid programme, 
defaultBasicNeeds Ghana 
defaultbegan 
defaultproviding its expertise to the government of 
defaultGhana to support the implementation of their 2011 Mental Health Act.  
default&#xa0;
defaultBasicNeeds is also a partner in the DFID funded research on mental health, called 
defaultthe 
defaultProgramme for Improving Mental Health Care (PRIME) led by Cape Town University. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAlong with the European Union and Grand Challenges Canada, 
defaultDF
defaultID is
default one of the few funders making an effort to invest in mental health. Currently the investment tends to be focused on research but notably DFID and the European Union, through supporting BasicNeeds programmes
default, have
default supported service delivery. There is a challenge to translate the research into much needed services delivery, see our recent blog for comment on this:

default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3 defaultMental healthdefault&#xa0;
defaultMental illness is seen as both a cause, and a consequence of poverty
default and ill-health
default.  Globally, an estimated 13% of all disease is attributable to mental health disorders, and neuropsychiatric conditions contribute the most to this overall burden: more 
defaultthan either cardiovascular disease or cancer.
default As highlighted by the latest Global Burden of Disease Report, mental illness is projected to be the leading burden of disease by 2030. As Alan Lopez, one of the leading contributors to the report noted, “
defaultmental health is perhaps one of the most neglected of neglected diseases in global health
default”.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlmost three quarters of those suffering from mental illness live in low and middle income countries
default, where up to 85% of people with severe mental health conditions do not have access to much needed mental health treatment (the figure for high income countries is 35-50%).  
default&#xa0;
defaultMental health is extremely under-resourced with the complete absence of mental health budgets in almost a third of countries.  In LMIC there is a severe lack of psychiatrists, and the majority of people resort to consulting traditional healers that can result in human rights abuses.
default&#xa0;
defaultPoverty brings with it heightened stress, social exclusion, malnutrition, violence and trauma, all of which contribute to mental illness.  It is a vicious circle, as those with mental illness experience widespread stigma and discrimination, suffer violence and abuse, they find it harder to get work, get an education or contribute to family and community.  They are more prone to other forms of illness and disease, and find it harder to access health care.  
default&#xa0;
defaultImpaired mental health can lead to disability or premature death. 
defaultA mental health condition is therefore considered a disability if it has a long-term effect on normal day-to-day activity.

default 
defaulthas
default learnt that to be effective, programmes must 
defaultstart
default with people living with mental illness or epilepsy; and 
defaultaddress illness, poverty and social exclusion of affected people and their families in a sustainable, holistic way
default.  
defaultBasicNeeds has over the past thirteen years developed a unique Model which does just that, this Model is described below:
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultBy putting people living with mental illness and epilepsy at the centre of the development process,
default defaultBasicNeeds has demonstrated 
defaultwith robust evidence ‘what works’:
default 80% of affected people involved in BasicNeeds programmes
default 
default:

default3.3 defaultThe role of disabled beneficiaries in planning, managing and monitoring DFID defaultpolicy and programmesdefault&#xa0;
defaultBasicNeeds
default believes 
defaultto ensure sustainable outcomes
default people affected by mental illness or epilepsy, particularly those who are most marginalised and living in poverty, 
defaultmust
default participate in and lead solutions that will transform their lives.
default  
defaultThe design and delivery of all 
defaultBasicNeeds 
defaultprogrammes funded by DFID 
defaultare underpinned
default by this belief
default 
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultBasicNeeds
default has a rich experience of 
defaultsupporting the development of SHGs of people with mental illness and epilepsy and their carers. These are sustainable independent registered structures and are empowered to self-advocate. 
default 
defaultAs previously described a national users association has developed in Ghana as a result of the
default SHG movement
default and the voices and advoc
defaultacy that this association brings
default to the
default delivery of the
default DFID bilateral project 
defaultmentioned is notable
default. 
default This development was supported through funding from Comic Relief.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs well as supporting the development of the government capacity to provide mental health services the bilateral project
default supports
default all the elements of the
default implementation of the BasicNeeds Model. This includes
default the development of a further 
default1237 community based SHGs and 175 district service users/care-givers association
defaults in Ghana that will significantly strengthen the Users movement
default, 
defaultcontributing to ensuring services meet their needs and  that change is 
defaultsustainable
default 
default.
defaultWe recommend that DFID consult disabled people’s organisations (including associations of people with mental illness) on new policy. Meaningful consultation with these civil society 
defaultgroups should
default take place using
default appropriate 
defaultmethodology
default. Through our work we have notably developed
default participatory methodologies
default 
defaultthat ensure the inclusion of people with mental illness and epilepsy
default 
defaultsuch as Participatory Data Analysis
default; these are described in the references below. 
defaultConsultations can be f
defaultacilitated when required by NGOs 
defaultwith experience as in the case of BasicNeeds
default 
defaultor initiatives such as participate
