[normal]About the Society for General [bold]Microbiology[bold]The Society for General Microbiology (SGM) is a membership organisation for scientists who work in all areas of microbiology. It is the largest learned microbiological society in Europe with a worldwide membership based in universities, indust
[normal]ry, hospitals, research institutes and schools. The SGM publishes key academic journals in microbiology and virology, organises international scientific conferences and provides an international forum for communication among microbiologists and supports th
[normal]eir professional development. The Society promotes the understanding of microbiology to a diverse range of stakeholders, including policy-makers, students, teachers, journalists and the wider public, through a comprehensive framework of communication activ
[normal]ities and resources.
[normal] 
[normal]Further information about SGM is provided in Appendix 1.

[normal]research is UK-wide.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Universities strong in microbiology are distributed throughout the country (see section 4.2). 
[normal]Looking at the private sector, 
[normal]firms
[normal] conducting microbiology R&amp;D
[normal] are also found throughout the UK: some are associated with former ICI or Big Pharma sites, such as Billingham in County Durham or Alderley 
[normal]Edge
[normal] in Cheshire; others co-locate with universities; others still locate in scienc
[normal]e par
[normal]ks, or strike out on their own.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In July, the Sheffield-based vaccine discovery start-up
[normal] Absynth received £850k funding from 
[normal]Fusion IP
[normal], The North West Fund
[normal] (European Union-backed), and the
[normal] Technology Strategy Board
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In the chemicals and fuels sector, large enterprises with microbiology activities are based in 
[normal]Teesside
[normal];
[normal] and microbiology-based 
[normal]small and medium-sized enterprises (
[normal]SMEs
[normal])
[normal] in Oxford, Guildford, Hertfordshire, Edinburgh, inter alia.  Increasingly
[normal],
[normal] traditional
[normal] chemical companies (e.g
[normal].,
[normal] 
[normal]INEOS
[normal] at
[normal] 
[normal]Grangemouth
[normal]) are becoming interest
[normal]ed
[normal] in the applications of Synthetic Biology to create “microbiological factories”
[normal] 
[normal](see section 4.4)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is a real possibility of 
[normal]growing 
[normal]significant research, development, and produc
[normal]tion processes across the country, with clear translation of benefits to the economy, environment, and public health.

[normal]icrobiology
[normal]’s vitality 
[normal]in the universities
[normal]We
[normal] live in
[normal] 
[normal]exhilarating
[normal] times
[normal], in terms of research and innovation
[normal] in microbiology. 
[normal]Genomics, the metagenome, the microbiome, microbial ecology, synthetic biology
[normal], 
[normal]industrial biocatalysis, fermentation technology, biochemical engineering 
[normal]and new developments in
[normal] 
[normal]bioinformatics, all imply a range of opportunities that have emerged from micr
[normal]obiological research
[normal] in universities
[normal], or 
[normal]are 
[normal]having significant impacts upon 
[normal]the
[normal] productivity and inventiveness
[normal] of university research
[normal].
[normal] These present opportunities to tackle
[normal] 
[normal]wider problems such as climate change, biofuels
[normal] and chemicals
[normal], food and water secu
[normal]rity, infectious disease, 
[normal]and 
[normal]antibiotic resistance
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The universities 
[normal]have particular
[normal] 
[normal]strengths
[normal] for effective R&amp;D
[normal], notably
[normal]:

[normal]Emerging 
[normal]opportunities to
[normal] fight infectious disease
[normal]M
[normal]icrobiology research
[normal] concerned 
[normal]with 
[normal]‘
[normal]anti-infective
[normal]s
[normal]’
[normal] technology (to detect
[normal], prevent, and treat 
[normal]infectious disease)
[normal] is an emerging source of private sector innovation
[normal]. 
[normal]There are critical 
[normal]development
[normal]s across three areas, namely
[normal] (
[normal]1
[normal]) 
[normal]antimicrobial drugs aimed at bacterial and fungal 
[normal]infections (particularly vital due to the rise of antibiotic resistance
[normal] in bacteria
[normal])
[normal]; 
[normal](
[normal]2
[normal]) 
[normal]diagnostic devices
[normal]; and (
[normal]3
[normal]) vaccines
[normal].
[normal] Collectively, these measures have the potential to solve infectious disease
[normal]s, such as 
[normal]those in the
[normal] globally-important
[normal] aged care 
[normal]sector (e.g., 
[normal]hospital-acquired infections
[normal])
[normal], and also represent significant opportunities in the global healthcare
[normal] market
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]Chief Medical Officer
[normal] has drawn attention to the problem of antibiotic resistance. 
[normal]We
[normal] 
[normal]welcome 
[normal]wider
[normal] 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment
[normal] 
[normal]moves
[normal] on this top
[normal]ic
[normal], 
[normal]such as
[normal] recent
[normal] 
[normal]investments 
[normal]made by
[normal] the Technology Strategy Board 
[normal](
[normal]via the Biomedical Catalyst
[normal])
[normal],
[normal] and
[normal] the Ministry of Defence
[normal].
[normal] There is significant potential in
[normal] 
[normal]an emerging commercial sector: o
[normal]ur own survey indicates that there are now at least 20
[normal] small
[normal] firms across the 
[normal]UK actively
[normal] involved in research 
[normal]on antimicrobial resistance
[normal] (see the Microbiology Research Map, online
[normal])
[normal].
[normal] These firms deploy a range of different approaches, from 
[normal]investigation 
[normal]of natural products, to development of vaccines, and other m
[normal]ethods.
[normal] 
[normal]Diverse approaches represent a richness of endeavour.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]But f
[normal]urther commitment is critical 
[normal]if we want 
[normal]take-off for 
[normal]a wider range of measures including antimicrobial therapies, diagnostic devices, and vaccines (
[normal]as is 
[normal]support for 
[normal]skilled
[normal], 
[normal]motivated, i
[normal]maginat
[normal]ive and well-trained scientists
[normal] in this field
[normal])
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]D
[normal]ifferent, but complementary, approaches
[normal]

[normal]ould usefully be 
[normal]driven forward

[normal]B
[normal]iotechnology in the green economy
[normal] – opportunities, and challenges
[normal]It is estimated that over 30,000 different chemicals are now in commercial use. 
[normal]U
[normal]nstable oil prices – and emerging green technologies – are prompting a transition
[normal] from oil-based chemistry
[normal] towards alternative, renewable starting materials. 
[normal]Firms involved range from the very large
[normal], 
[normal]to SMEs.
[normal] Microbiological research 
[normal]plays
[normal] a pivotal role, as the yet-to-be-developed production processes depend on bacteria and fungi to convert sugars into useful
[normal] chemicals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are 
[normal]two
[normal] interrelated aspects to government support 
[normal]for science in this
[normal] 
[normal]area
[normal]. 
[normal]The first concerns research and development to establish viable production processes
[normal] using pre-existing knowledge (
[normal]knowledge 
[normal]translation)
[normal]; good progress is bein
[normal]g made here
[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]second
[normal] concerns basic research on 
[normal]the 
[normal]microbi
[normal]al
[normal] physiology
[normal] 
[normal]needed to 
[normal]operate
[normal] these processes
[normal] on an industrial scale
[normal]; 
[normal]in this area
[normal] there is
[normal] significant
[normal] weakness.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]G
[normal]overnment
[normal] support
[normal] 
[normal]for knowledge translation 
[normal]has helped the UK into
[normal] the
[normal] top 
[normal]five
[normal] of 
[normal]EU
[normal] countries for commercialisation of research in this 
[normal]field
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment 
[normal]recently expanded its backing
[normal] for applied research
[normal] 
[normal]through the
[normal] 
[normal]Biological Sciences and
[normal] Biotechnology Research Council (BBSRC)/Technology Strategy Board (TSB)-funded Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This scheme, which launches in 2014, should be encouraged.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On the second aspect, however, there appears to be less progress
[normal]. 
[normal]One significan
[normal]t scientific issue for R&amp;D expenditure is scaling-up production. When moved to large scale – as is needed for industry – useful end products kill the micro-organisms producing them. Yields are therefore too low. 
[normal]W
[normal]e are yet to develop an ‘off-the shelf’ ind
[normal]ustrial biotechnology.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As noted in a policy research paper from NESTA – and widely acknowledged elsewhere – creative solutions will emerge from greater collaboration between chemical engineering 
[normal]and
[normal] microbiology.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Engineering and Physical Sciences R
[normal]esearch Council (EPSRC) supports
[normal] relevant
[normal] research but the funding is targeted at the engineering
[normal] side
[normal]. The BBSRC is the major Research Council 
[normal]of relevance
[normal] to the microbiological 
[normal]side
[normal]; BBSRC funding
[normal] for ‘industrial biotechnology and bioenergy’ amounts to 
[normal]£26.2
[normal]m in 2012/13, but this is split between 18 often eclectic areas ranging from tissue engineering to biomass crops.
[normal] The 
[normal]focus
[normal] 
[normal]is therefore
[normal] diffuse
[normal],
[normal] with 
[normal]relatively little opportunity for 
[normal]the 
[normal]scientific
[normal] 
[normal]committees
[normal] that allocate
[normal] research
[normal] 
[normal]funds
[normal] to ma
[normal]ke 
[normal]major investment in one area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is, as a consequence, a huge funding gap for applied microbiological research in technology readiness levels 1-4 (discovery, research
[normal],
[normal] and proof of concept)
[normal] for key areas of
[normal] basic science underlying
[normal] industrial biotechno
[normal]logy
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]The BBSRC 
[normal]Networks in Industrial Biotechnology and Bioenergy (NIBB)
[normal] 
[normal]will 
[normal]usefully 
[normal]link together interested researchers for the purpose of knowledge exchange
[normal], but 
[normal]they are not
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] research
[normal] funding mechanism
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It would therefore be worth examin
[normal]ing
[normal] the 
[normal]value of a ring-fenced 
[normal]funding
[normal] pathway for synthetic biology, targeted at microbial physiology for 
[normal]industrial application. This could go some way to supply the
[normal] research needed
[normal] in terms of scaling-up production processes.

[normal]The importance of Public Sector Re
[normal]search Establishments
[normal] (PRSEs)
[normal]We 
[normal]looked at
[normal] the Chief Scientific Advisor
[normal] (CSO)
[normal]’s recent list of PSREs
[normal] 
[normal]to determine where microbiological research 
[normal]concentrates
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The CSO does not make the conventional distinction between ‘PSREs’ (taken to mean institutions d
[normal]irectly under a ministerial department), and ‘research institutes’ (government-funded, but held at arm’s length through the Research Councils). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In our analysis, there
[normal] are a total of about 30 research establishments
[normal] and research institutes
[normal] with significant microbiological interests
[normal] (see map
[normal];
[normal] detailed
[normal] list available on request from 
[normal]the Society for General Microbiology
[normal])
[normal]. The majority
[normal] are located in England
[normal]; o
[normal]ne is 
[normal]in
[normal] Northern Ireland
[normal] (not included on the CSO’s list)
[normal]; and two in Scotland
[normal].

[normal]T

[normal]se
[normal] institutions
[normal] 
[normal]cover the gamut of microbiological research, from the most applied, to 
[normal]the bluest skies;
[normal] 
[normal]but sharing a clear 
[normal]focus on
[normal] 
[normal](i) 
[normal]infectious disease
[normal];

[normal]and

[normal], with a longer time-
[normal]horizon than 
[normal]the shorter-term

[normal]offered to universities
[normal], and acting as nuclei for innovation
[normal].
[normal]
