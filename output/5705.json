This is our third evidence session \nin our \ninquiry \ninto land reform in \nScotland\n. It would be helpful if for the record you said who you were, what your background was and what your area of expertise was. Is this the first time we have had two professors out of two? No. We have had scor\nes of professors before, but we \nhave\n usually\n always had a normal \nmortal with them \nrather than\n exclusively professors.\n              \nGraeme Morrice: We \nhad three\n at one time\n.\nChair: Okay. Tell us who you are\n, then\n.\nProfessor Cheshire: \nMy name is Paul Cheshire. I am professor of economic geography at the LSE. I am interested i\nn urban economics, land markets and\n land use planning effects viewed from an economic perspective.\nProfessor Adams: I am David Adams. I am the professor of property and urban studies at the \nUniversity\n of \nGlasgow\n. My interest is in the interaction between planning and property real estate markets, primarily in an urban context. In relation to this inquiry, I am one of the advisers to the Scottish Government’s land reform review group.\n&#xa0;\nQ292&#xa0; \nChair: Thank you very much. \nAs you will appreciate, most of \nus here do not have a backgrou\nnd in this area of work. Don’t\n feel you will be insulting us by telling \nus very\n \nbasic things. W\ne would much rather be told very basic things twice than have them skimmed over. \nGiven the fact that l\nand reform in Scotland has traditionally focused on rural\n rather than urban land—w\ne \nare interested in both of those—\nand the distortions caused by the tax system\n, d\noes it make sense for us to make, however, a substantial differentiation between the \nway in which urban\n land markets\n \nand rural land markets work, or is there a substantial degree of overlap?\nProfessor Adams: T\nhere is a substantial degree of overlap\n if \nyou look at markets in a particular\n way\n,\n which places great emphasis on th\ne behaviour and\n strategies of the owner\n. I\nt looks at the relationship between the strategies and key players, such as estate agents, so there are ways in which you look at land markets that can be as applicable in urban and rural areas.\n              \nHaving said that, the issues are rather \ndifferent. In urban areas, certainly in key settlements in \nScotland\n such as \nGlasgow\n, there is a huge overhang of land \nthat is not being used. It has been \nvacant and derelict for a long period of time. In rural areas\n, such\n la\nnd is very rare in terms of \nunused land on the Scottish Government’s vacant and derelict land register, for example, and the issues are much more about ownership structures and the extent to which\n,\n as a result of those ownership structures\n,\n the land is being used to \nsustainable effect or not.\nProfessor Cheshire: I would come at it from a rather different view. My basic message to you would b\ne that all the work\n that\n I\n \nhave done, \nand\n that\n an in\ncreasing number of scholars\n around the world have done\n,\n \nreinforces the conclusion that \nland markets are \namazingly efficient at capitalising almost everything. By “capitalising\n,”\n I mean that the price of land reflec\nts everything about its value and\n use, including intangible things like not just cur\nrent aircraft noise \nbut expected future aircraft noise. Some very interesting work is g\noing on in \nBerlin\n at the moment. T\nhere is a \nproposal for a \nnew airport\n,\n and the proposed flight paths and opening date have been changed over time. Each of those changes is already capitalised into the land markets in \nBerlin\n. I\nf you try to help poor farmers by giving them subsidies, it gets capitalised i\nnto the price of land. I\nf you give\n inheritance tax relief\ns\n to farmers to try to keep family farms going, it gets capitalised into the price of land and squeezes \nfamily farmers out. I\nf you give subsidies to farmers, it gets capitalis\ned in the price of rural land. I\nf you give planning permission with parti\ncular obligations, t\nhe expected value of those obligations\n—because it is always in the future—is \nagain reflected in the price of land. This seems remarkably efficient\n,\n given\n that\n \nwe know there is\n a fair degree of\n \napparent monopoly in land markets\n, but you still have trade\n and it is trade on the margin that really matters. In urban areas\n,\n \nbecause \nlots of houses are changing hands\n,\n the process\n may be rather quicker and \ncomplete than it is in rural areas where the volume of trades is rather less relative to the total stock of land.\n&#xa0;\nQ293&#xa0; \nChair: Professor Adams, I presume you agree with tha\nt. It is always quite helpful for\n us to have witnesses disagreeing and fighting between themselves, because it then illustrates for us the areas perhaps we need to give further thought\n to\n. If either of you do not say anything about the other’s answer, we will assume that you agree 100%.\nProfessor Adams: I do not think you can assume that you can get two economists in a room to agree. I do not fully agree with what Prof\nessor Cheshire has to say. H\ne comes at it from a different mode of economic analysis that has its strengths as well as \nits \nweaknesses. There are a number of issues in what he has to say. First, the difference between price and v\nalue needs to be much clearer. For example, o\nne of the i\nssues\n is \nthe huge difficulties\n in ascertaini\nng what the value is, \nthose difficulties \noften \nbeing the resul\nt of not enough price evidence—\nin other words, not enough transactions.\nIn terms of the transactions in land and how the market works, we often find that \na lot of the deals are done in a fairly closed way. Land is advertised t\no a very short list of people. I\nt is not openly marketed; it is not an open competition; it is th\nrough contacts and networks.\n I would take what we call \na \nmuch more institutional view of the land market than perhaps Professor Cheshire\n takes. For example, the \nbig land agents in Scotland are very important in what one m\night call making the market and the way \nthey lead people on, \nthe way in which \nex\npectations are formed and\n the way in which\n behaviour is changed\n. Y\nou might put \nthose two perspectives together\n because, if you take both of them, you might start to get towards \nthe truth. I am not saying \nyou should take one and ignore\n the other, but you\n should not necessarily expect \nthat when you get two of us in a\n room we will agree.\nChair: That is helpful.\nProfessor Cheshire: As to the issue of price and value, it is yes and no. I do agree that there are some things which clearly have value\n \nwhich\n \nit is \ndifficult to put prices on. W\nhat is the value of habitat, for example? What is the value of an SSSI? What is the value of something which reduces the chances of gl\nobal warming? The problem \nis that \nyou have these very long-ter\nm and uncertain outcomes and \nit \nis very difficult to value. I\nn that sense\n,\n I am not disagreeing with my \ncolleague. There are some things,\n but \nmost of the things which actually happen, like the value of open space, the value of shooting rights, the value of fishing rights, the value of land for food production, the value of land as a licence to receive subsidies, or the value of land as a licence to receive exe\nmption from inheritance tax, are \npretty well\n \npriced in the market.\n&#xa0;\nQ294&#xa0; \nChair: \nProfessor Adams, I want\n you\n to clarify the distinction that you seem to be drawing between value and price. Without getting into metaphysics and the like, I just presume\nd\n that the only way in which you could measure \nthe \nvalue of a piece of land, as with a piece of art, was the price somebody was prepared to pay for it. Am I missing a point here?\nProfessor Adams: No. You are right, but then it depends on how much evidence you have of that. Let’s say you are valuing a semi\n-\ndetached hou\nse. You would expect\n \nthere to be \na lot of comparable transactions you can draw on. If you are valuing a highland estate, for example, there will be very few relative transactions, and therefore the task of the valuer becomes much more difficult\n. H\nypothetically\n, if\n you sent 10 valuers to do that exercise\n, the research shows that\n you would come up with 10 different answers. The question would be: how different are they? That depends on how particular is the form of property. If it is a semi\n-\ndetached house, the differences might not be very much; if it is a highland estate, the differences \nbetween different valuers \nmight be quite a lot.\nProfessor Cheshire: I am putting no trust in v\naluers whatsoever\n,\n b\noth from pe\nrsonal experience but also\n from\n \nacademic s\ntudies of how reliable they are. A\nll my evidence would be drawn from large-scale statistical studies of transactions, and that is where you c\nan get really fine detail. It\n is not just a question of two semi\n-\ndetached houses in the same road being rather similar, but you can identify statistically the implic\nit price of each attribute. E\nvery property is different\n,\n but it is compose\nd of a bundle of attributes. If \nyou have got a large sample of transactions\n—a \ncolleague at the LSE has just been analysing 1\n&#xa0;\nmillion house transactions to identify the price that is put on green belt land\n—\nyou can get very accurate\n statistical evidence, but I would never trust a valuer to give me an accurate answer.\n&#xa0;\nQ295&#xa0; \nChair: \nProfessor Adams in particular, o\nne of the difficulties we have with th\nese hearings\n is that when you nod it is not recorded, so you have to say something. Let it be recorded that Professor Adams agreed with the idea that you should never trust a valuer.\nProfessor Adams: Professor Cheshire is right\n. If you have a large number of transactions in a particular form of property, the kind of econometric analysis that he specialises in becomes far easier. If you are undertakin\ng that kind of analysis for, say,\n highland estates, it becomes much more difficult than it would be if you were doing it \nin an urban context for,\n say, semi\n-\ndetached houses.\nProfessor Cheshire: You can probably do it with a sample of 100 transactions\n, and over time \nyou can get pretty good information\n. I have just done a study of \nLondon\n office mark\nets where \nI have identif\ni\ned\n 650 transactions\n, only 51 of which\n are interesting, and it is \nvery clearly statistically identified.\n&#xa0;\nQ296&#xa0; \nMr Reid: Following on from what you said earlier about everything, including tax and subsidies\n,\n affecting the value or price of land, are you able to tell us what\n \ndistorting effects the taxation regime has on land in \nScotland\n?\nProfessor Cheshire: As I understand it\n, \nthe \ninheritance \ntax exemption of agricultural land applies in \nScotland\n as it does in \nEngland\n. That\n clearly has inflated the price of agricultural land in \nEngland\n quite substantially. I have not done the work\n,\n and \nI \ndo not know that anyone h\nas done the specific work. M\ny guess is that\n,\n if you compare agricultural land prices in \nEngland\n or \nScotland\n with equally productive land in, say, \nFrance\n where you do no\nt\n have that, you are looking at something like a factor of four.\n&#xa0;\nQ297&#xa0; \nChair: \nWhen you say “a factor of four\n,”\n does that mean it quadruples?\nProfessor Cheshire: It is something like\n. I have not\n got a statistical standard\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ298&#xa0; \nChair: When you say “a factor of four\n,\n”\n does that mean that the price\n is four times higher than it would otherwise be?\nProfessor Cheshire: \nThan it would be without the inheritance tax relief.\n&#xa0;\nQ299&#xa0; \nMr Reid: What about other taxes—\nfor example\n,\n capital gains tax? There is forestry exemption.\nProfessor Cheshire: It\n works in for\nestry as well. It used to be that the\n only reason for \nplanting trees wa\ns to keep your accountant happy as a very big \nwealth holder.\n&#xa0;\nQ300&#xa0; \nMr Reid: Is it only forestry where capital gains tax exemption applies?\nProfessor Cheshire: As I understand it, in \nScotland\n that is true; it\n is only forestry, but it has a significant impact on the value of forestry\n. \nIt also has d\nistorting\n effec\nts on how forestry is managed because\n I think\n i\nt applies to the trees, not \nto \nthe land.\n&#xa0;\nQ301&#xa0; \nMr Reid: Can you expand on what distorting effects it has?\nProfessor Cheshire: I\nt is not \none of \nmy particular area\ns\n of expertise. As I\n understand it, it affects \nhow old the timber is before you crop it\n. You\n crop it to maximise your tax exemption rather than your timber yield.\n&#xa0;\nQ302&#xa0; \nMr Reid: So it is the trees themselves rather than the land.\nProfessor Cheshire: I think \nit \napplies to the trees rather than the land in the case of forestry in \nScotland\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ303&#xa0; \nMr Reid: \nAre there any other effects of the\n tax system that distort\n land value\ns?\nProfessor Cheshire: Obviously, the\nre are agricultural subsidies. T\nhe single farm payment does, but it is better than the alternative.\n&#xa0;\nQ304&#xa0; \nMr Reid: What about the move to \nan \narea-based system? Have you analysed what effect that will have?\nProfessor Cheshire: I am sorry; you will have to clarify that.\n&#xa0;\nQ305&#xa0; \nMr Reid: The common agricultural policy is moving away from the single farm payment to an area-based system.\nProfessor Cheshire: \nIf it goes to conservation payments, that is clea\nrly in the public interest. T\nhat will then negatively affect the price of agricultural land\n,\n because\n,\n by and large\n,\n more environmentally \nfriendly f\norms of farming reduce output of\n saleable food, and therefore tend to reduce income generated from \nfood, but they may increase \nrecreational income. It is a complicated system, and once you press one button it may pop out somewhere else.\n&#xa0;\nQ306&#xa0; \nMr Reid: \nHow complicated is it to carry out quantitative r\nesearch to try to work out \nthe distorting effects\n of subsidies or taxation\n?\nProfessor Cheshire: I am quite an old academic. I have reached the position where I \nthink \nalmost\n every\n well-intentioned intervention \nh\nas other consequences which\n have not been foreseen, and \nwhich \noften completely offset the good intentions of the original intervention.\n&#xa0;\nQ307&#xa0; \nChair: That is a very positive thought to leave us with, is it not?\nProfessor Cheshire: I do not want to be a counsel of despair.\n&#xa0;\nQ308&#xa0; \nMr Reid: Do you regard state intervention as market failure?\nProfessor Cheshire: No. You clearly need state intervention in land ma\nrkets because there are \nserious endemic problems of market failure in la\nnd markets. You\n clearly\n \ndo need policies to preserve national parks, heritage coastline, SSSIs\n and habitat; otherwise, they will just d\nisappear. Y\nou should do it carefully and bit by bit rather than clapping in an across-the-board poli\ncy that\n is one size fits all\n,\n because that will most likely have detriment\nal effects\n. I\nncremental change is a good idea with things like this. Suck it and see. The move to the single farm payment\n wa\ns better than the \nsubsidi\nes, \nheadage\n \npayments, \nless favour\ned\n a\nrea payments\n a\nnd so on, which simply intensified\n farming in very bizarre and\n,\n I am afraid\n,\n environm\nentally unfavourable ways. T\no go to conservation payments would be a b\netter move, but not all at once:\n go gently.\n&#xa0;\nQ309&#xa0; \nMr Reid: Professor Adams, was there anything you wanted to add?\nProfessor Adams: No. I broadly concur with what Professor Cheshire has said on the taxation implications.\n&#xa0;\nQ310&#xa0; \nChair: \nI am glad you agree on this, but are you saying to us that the price of land would be a quarter of the price it is at the moment were it not for the inheritance tax exemptions?\nProfessor Cheshire: You are \ntaking away my very cautious academic caveats. I have not done the work. That would be my back-of-the-envelope gues\ns\ntimate\n, but \nit is work that could be done.\n&#xa0;\nQ311&#xa0; \nChair: How do you get the figure of a quarter? First, I \nappreciate\n you\nr general point that \nthat makes land more valuable than it would otherwise be. \nI can understand that. \nWhy four times rather than 24 times, or 400 times?\nProfessor Cheshire: \nL\nooking at the starting point\n when this was introduced—i\nt is not \nall that old\n—and \nlooking at \nwhat has\n happened to agricultural land prices\n \nrelative to visible agricultural incomes, and how land prices \nhave risen\n relative to incomes\n; \nthe rate of appreciation of agricultural land compared wit\nh other sorts of land since \ninheritance tax relief;\n and also the difference between the value of land in Britain w\nhere you have this\n tax relief,\n \ncompared \nwith\n other countries where you don’t, on land which is, \nroughly speaking, equally productive\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ312&#xa0; \nChair: \nIf we came out with a recommendation and had it implemented that inheritance tax relief for agricultural land and rural estate\ns should be abolished, you\n reckon that the price would fall t\no a quarter of its present level\n.\nProfessor Cheshire: Again, you are taking away my academic caveats. I would recommend that you commission a piece of good academic work to give you a much better approximation of the answer that I am able to give, but in general I think you should take away inheritance tax relief.\nChair: We will come on to that later on.\n&#xa0;\nQ313&#xa0; \nGraeme Morrice: \nGood afternoon, gentlemen. \nScottish Land and Estates, which, as you know, is the representative body for landowners in Scotland, told us previously in evidence\n:\n \n“M\nuch is made of the fact that some individuals in Scotland own large landholdings, but large landholdings are equally as common in other countries, especially in countries where the produ\nctive value of the land is low.”\n Do you think it is fair to say that the productive value of Scottish land is\n low and that is why large land\nholdings are common?\nProfessor Adams: There is a whole series of historic \nand \nsocia\nl reasons why we get large land\nholdings in Scotland. If we \ntake just one example, Murray Estates\n goes back to 1563 and\n Mary Queen of Scots. There is an example\n of a large landholding\n that does all sorts of different things and is quite heavily involved in property development in new towns and so on\n and so forth\n.\n \nIn those circumstances, there is a huge var\niety of different sorts of \nrural \nland\nowners in \nScotland\n,\n some of whom are\n more active and some of whom \nare \nmore passive. Those reasons are historic, institutional and behavioural\n, as well as th\ne reasons\n you mentioned.\n&#xa0;\nQ314&#xa0; \nGraeme Morrice: Professor Cheshire, do you want to comment on that?\nProfessor Cheshire: As a generalis\nation, I think it is true. “L\ness productive\n”\n may just \nmean “v\nery inaccessible\n.”\n In\ntrinsically\n, it may\n be quite productive land, but\n,\n i\nf it is very inaccessible\n,\n \nthat will make it in some sense less productive; it will earn less revenue. There is a broad statistical association between less productive land \nand larger holdings, whi\nch is what you would expect. M\ny colleague may hav\ne a point \nin \nthat t\nhere is a historic\nal\n and institutional\n structure to it as well. \nI rather doubt that that is a complete explanation, but you would expect \nthat \nin \nthe highlands of \nScotland\n, \nwith its pretty short growing season\n, you would have\n relatively larg\ne land\nholdings\n for them\n to be viable.\n&#xa0;\nQ315&#xa0; \nGraeme Morrice: So it is to do with the topography\n of \nScotland\n,\n in particular\n \nthe h\nighlands and islands, and \nth\ne issue of super-\nsparsity and ru\nrality\n.\nProfessor Cheshire: And elevation, climate\n and the basic fertility of the soil, but it is also to do with the structure of inheritance\n, \ntraditional land ownership and so on that has come down the years, and the fact that estate duty and inheritance taxes have not worked in quite the way they were expected to. Equally, you have got to put it against the inequality in earnings and incomes. If you have an unequal society\n,\n you are going to have unequal ownership of property.\n&#xa0;\nQ316&#xa0; \nChair: To follow up one point, y\nou said that inheritance tax and other taxes had not applied in the way they were intended to. Can you clarify how you thought they were intended to work, and how they are actually working in practice?\nProfessor Cheshire: \nWhen they were introduced in the early 20th century I think they were intended to reduce the generational passage of wealth, so you had a more meritocratic outcome. I do no\nt think they have. There continue to be\n so many loopholes in the\n system, \nand agricultural land is one\n of them\n. People who are big in buying agricultural land are\n \nmaking their money\n mainly\n in other walks of life\n,\n and they are becoming farmers for tax purposes.\n&#xa0;\nQ317&#xa0; \nChair: So\n the answer to that would be \nto apply inheritance tax without exemptions to all land.\nProfessor Cheshire: If your aim is to try to reduce the generation\nal\n transmission of inequality.\n&#xa0;\nQ318&#xa0; \nChair: \nWhat would \nbe \nt\nhe consequences of that for land\nholdings in areas like those in\n \nScotland\n?\nProfessor Cheshire: Over a long period of time, they would tend to become\n less concentrated, but w\nhether that is a good thing is another issue.\n&#xa0;\nQ319&#xa0; \nChair: You think it would \ntend\n to become less concentrated, \nand \nnot simply rich people losing\n some of their money as a res\nult of inheritance tax\n and\n other rich people coming in and buying it and losing it in turn\n. T\nhe estates might remain, as it were\n.\n I do not quite follow why you automatically assume that the estates would be broken up.\nProfessor Cheshire: It is easier\n to keep something than \nto buy it. It\n is easier to keep something intact over \ntime. B\nits will tend to get sold \noff, so it stays in the families. I\nt happened to a lot of the estat\nes after the first world war \nwhen there were unexpected deaths\n. You had to \nsell off part of the estate\n, so it \ngot smaller because you had to pay the inheritance tax. The other prob\nlem is\n, as I was saying earlier,\n that \nyou plug one loophole and a clever accountant finds another, so it is easier said than done.\nChair: \nThe view \nthat you have of valuers is the one\n we have of accountants and lawyers. We have not examined or considered professors at all\n,\n so at the moment you are fine.\n&#xa0;\nQ320&#xa0; \nMr Reid: \nHow widespread is the agricultural exemption\n from inheritance tax? \nDoes it apply to sporting estates or to forestry?\nProfessor Cheshire: I think you have to be officially recognised as a farmer only.\n&#xa0;\nQ321&#xa0; \nMr Reid: But does it \napply to forestry?\nProfessor Cheshire: \nForestry is a separate category, so t\nhere is a separate tax regime for exemption from capital gains tax primarily in the case of forestry. I am not a tax accountant, but I think it then applies to the timber rather than the land itself, so that is why it affects the cropping age of the timber. It also affects the value of the land.\n&#xa0;\nQ322&#xa0; \nMr Reid: A lot of these estates are owned by trusts. If there is not inheritance tax to pay because it is agricultural land, why did these families see the ne\ned to establish trusts \nto keep the land in the family?\nProfessor Cheshire: Because they did have to pay estate d\nuty, and trusts are one way in \nwhich you can avoid paying various forms of inheritance tax.\n&#xa0;\nQ323&#xa0; \nMr Reid: That is tax on the non-farming part of the estate.\nProfessor Cheshire: No, because the exemption from inheritance tax specifically for farming is a relatively recent innovation\n; I think it is about 15 or 20 years old.\n&#xa0;Q324&#xa0; \nMr Reid: So these trusts were set up before then.\nProfessor Cheshire: Yes\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ325&#xa0; \nGraeme Morrice: We were also told by Highlands and Islands Enterprise\n that,\n with regard to the purchase of large tracts of rural land\n,\n the return on investment that is generated as a result is disproportionate to the value attached to the land. Would you agree with that? If so, could you maybe explain how it is disproportionate?\nProfessor Adams: Could you explain what they said in more detail?\n&#xa0;Q326&#xa0; \nGraeme Morrice: According to the note that I have here, that is what they said. I do not know whether anybody else wants to expand upon that.\nChair: I\n read from their\n evidence: \n“\nWith respect to the purchase of large\n tracts of rural land and forestry e\nstate\n i\nslands, it is our experience that the contemporary value of such land is disproportionate to the return on investment that such assets typically generate. This could be shown as a direct legacy of the economic context and fiscal environment of land ownership over time in \nScotland\n,\n and the legacy which presents a barrier to diversified land ownership \npatterns in \nScotland\n today.”\n&#xa0;\nQ327&#xa0; \nGraeme Morrice: I am sorry. I assumed you would have read their comments to the Committee previously.\n \nProfessor Cheshire: No.\nGraeme Morrice: Don’t worry about it.\nProfessor Cheshire: You have to take account of the value\n of\n the land for\n \ntax avoidance purposes\n. T\nhe \nagricultural returns may be relatively low\n,\n but it may still be a\ndvantageous to invest in it.\n I do not know.\n&#xa0;\nQ328&#xa0; \nChair: W\ne will have to check this, but presumably \nland \nsimply \nas an\n appreciating store of value makes it somewhat more attractive than\n as a productive asset. T\nhat is the background to q\nuite a lot of the evidence \nwe have had in writing and informally from people\n. I\nf you put your money into land it will only appreciate\n,\n almost irrespective of what you do with it.\nProfessor Adams: There is a body of research that looks at what is called psychic income, which is non-monetary \nincome that gives you ben\neficial feeling, whether\n in terms of status, power or whatever it happens to be. In assessing the returns to landowners and what their motives are for buying highland estates, if we simply look at their financial year-on-year returns\n,\n that is not the whole picture. They are in there for a whole series of other reasons\n, and they may well have a return that to them is not a monetary one.\n&#xa0;\nQ329&#xa0; \nChair: That is presumably\n the equivalent of\n conspicu\nous consumption, is it not, \nto keep up wit\nh the Joneses, as it were? T\nhere is nothing much that the Government can do then to affect that element of it, but there is something\n the Government can do\n to affect the inheritance tax regime. It is just a question of whethe\nr or not there is anything \nwe ought to be taking into account when making recommendations\n about \nprices being so much higher than what would seem\n to be an objective value. T\nhe objective value in those circumstances is based on the productivity of the land, but, as you say, there are other factors. Is there anything in particular\n \nyou would draw our attention\n to in\n academic research that wou\nld help quantify that and \nhelp us look at the extent to which that is something that is applicable in the highlands and islands?\nProfessor Adams: No, because I do not think that kind of mode of analysis has been applied very largel\ny to this question.\n I am not aware of anyone who has done a piece of work that could answer the question that you are asking.\nProfessor Cheshire: A\nn agricultural economist at the \nUniversity\n of \nWales\n,\n \nBangor\n, \ntried to work out the rate of return in agriculture since about 1780. Allowing for the cost of land \nas part of the capital \nemployed in agriculture, his conclusion was that the rate of return, if you looked at it in the long\n \nterm, had not changed over about 200 years. It is very low. The reason is partly the psychic income where there appears to be a ready supply of people who are keen simply to own agric\nultural land to be farmers. T\nhat tends to push up the price of land at the margin, which means that, if you take account of the value of the land i\nn the total cost of farming, i\nt pushes down the return.\n              \nIf you look at the price of land since, say, 1930, you have periods of very substantial reduction. You can see the anticipation and then entry into the common agricultural policy reflected in the price of land around about 1970. You can see the very bad harvest in the US\n and \nthe \nincrease in \nthe set-\naside acreage in the US\n, at the same time as\n interventions from the USSR\n purchasing in the 1970s pushing up the price of food. That had an almost immediate effect\n on the price of land. I\nt is the same with tax relief. Essentially, it is subsidy plus tax relief. That is why the price of land has been rising over time\n. M\naybe people draw false expectations about future prices, because those subsidies \nand the tax relief can go away, in which case\n,\n without doubt\n,\n the price of land would fall.\n&#xa0;\nQ330&#xa0; \nChair: Can I \nclarify to what extent the assumption that land will grow in value\n,\n and therefore i\nt i\ns a good place t\no put your money, rather than\n, say, fine art or gold bars\n,\n helps drive the price up?\n Is there an extent to which you can say\n, just as you were so specific about \n“\nfour times\n”\n earlier on\n—\nProfessor Cheshire: I was very definitely not specific.\n&#xa0;\nQ331&#xa0; \nChair: \nSpecific\n-\nish.\n \nIs \nthere a quantifiable figure you would pick up and say that 20%, 40% or \n200% of the price is simply because people are using it to store their wealth, as distinct from having it in a bank account, on the assumption that land will appreciate? Can you help us with that at all?\nProfessor Cheshire: I have not done the calculations. \nYou could commission a relatively cheap bit of work for someone to work out the present value of the capitalised flows of expected subsidies and tax relief \nand what i\nt was adding to\n the price of agricultural land. \nOf course, it involves the expectation that these things are going to continue in the future.\n&#xa0;\nQ332&#xa0; \nChair: \nThese unknowns or variables are going to be affecting the amount of income that is drawn from the land in terms of agricultural subsidies and the like. Am I right in thinking that they will also affect the anticipated capital values of the land? Therefore, it is a bit like buying stocks and shares. You are not buying them to do anything with them; you are just buying them to sit there in the expectation not necessarily that you will draw divide\nnds from them\n,\n but \nthat \nthey will simply \ngrow. If you want to avoid that sort of speculative bubble, how do the Government address that?\nProfessor Cheshire: I do not think it is a pure speculative bubble, but it does involve the expectation that subsidies are going to rise rather\n than fall, which is possibly \noptimistic\n, but it \nalso \nmay\n be, as David said earlier, the\n psychi\nc element \nalso\n exists and\n \nmay\n also\n \nbe rising in value\n over time. A\ns you get richer\n,\n you can afford to engage in the luxury of owning a large amount of grouse shooting, or whatever it \nmay be. There is\n globally\n an increasing\n number of \nvery rich p\neople who may be \ntaking advantage of that.\nChair: We cannot deal directly with snobbery\n by G\novernment action, but presumably we can deal with the question of subsidy and so on. That is helpful.\n&#xa0;\nQ333&#xa0; \nGraeme Morrice: I am hopeful that you are aware of the policy aims of the Scottish Government’s land reform review group in relation to the topic of land ownership. In general terms, is it possible to achieve the Scottish Government’s aims t\no diversify land ownership, \nand, \nin particular\n,\n to expand community ownership\n,\n without tackling the question of land values?\nProfessor Adams: It is certainly possible to expand community ownership. There are a number of aspects of that. Top of my list of expanding community ownership would be to simplify the whole process, because it is remarkably complicated under the current legislation for the community right to buy to be effective. Part of the remit of the land reform review group is to look at the processes by which that community right to buy can be\n registered and then exercised.\nHaving said that, you then have to fund any community buy-out. That is partly ab\nout the Scottish land fund and G\novernment funding; it is partly about\n,\n in some cases\n,\n c\nharitable funding, lottery funding\n and so on\n and so forth\n; \nbut it is also about the short time scale in which cash has to be raised to fulfil the community buy-out.\n Clearly, if \nthe capitalisation of taxation incentives to which\n Professor\n&#xa0;\nCheshire\n referred were \nnot there and land were cheaper, it would become a lot easier, but, irrespective of going down that line, there i\ns a lot you can also do\n to promote community ownership, \nin terms of both \nspeeding up the process and the amount of money that is available under the current system.\nProfessor Cheshire: I largely agree, but it i\ns not an either/or. T\nhe more expensive land is\n,\n the more \nconcentrated ownership\n tends to be and \nthe more damaging \nagricultural practices will be \nto the environment. The argument that you need agricultural subsidies to safeguard the environment is the exact opposite of reality. What you need are conservation subsidies to preserve the environment. The cheaper the price of land, the easier it is for smaller people to enter the market, whether they are community groups or \njust \nsmaller land owners.\n&#xa0;\nQ334&#xa0; \nChair: \nCan I seek a view on the question of state aid rules? Professor\n&#xa0;\nAdams, you mentioned the question of raising the money and so on. We have had a couple of sessions where people have been telling us about the difficulties of state aid rules. We are not entirely clear at the moment whether or not these are bein\ng used as camouflage, or \nthings to hide behind\n, \nrather than genuine difficulties in purchasing. Can you give us a bit of assistance \nwith \nthat?\nProfessor Adams: That is not an area in which I would claim specific expertise, but I think there is a ge\nneral\n issue of the risk-averse nature of the bureaucracy. If you stand back a little and think about the objectives of community ownershi\np\n, they are quite different \nfrom the way in which land has been held in \nScotland\n over a long period of time. That \nrequires people to take risks. I\nt requires communities to take risks because they have responsibilities as a result, but \nit also requires people within G\novernment agencies to take risk\n,\n and perhaps push out the boat further than they wo\nuld to make things happen and, i\nf they do not break the rules\n,\n they certainly bend them. \nA\ns well as looking in detail at the specifics of state aid, maybe it is just as important to look a\nt the cul\nture within the G\novernment organisations that are responsible for interpreting those rules.\n&#xa0;\nQ335&#xa0; \nChair: That certainly echoes \nthe sentiment we were expressing la\nst week, or whenever we held our\n last session. That is very helpful. You have emphasised the difficulties of the bureaucratic process\n, and\n there is the issue of raising money and so on. Presumably, the question of land price is an enormous barrier to community land ownership, notwithstanding these tinkerings, as it were\n.\n Unless there is an unlimited pot of money, which is then caught by the state aid rules presumably, not much progress can be made while land retains its existing price level.\nProfessor Adams: If we are getting down to the level of individual buy-outs, for example, there is a process within the statute \nof an independent\n valuation being commissioned on behalf of the Scottish Government. The aim is to identify what would be open market value for which the community has to stump up the cash. Coming back to what I was saying\n earlier, \nit is quite a difficult task for a valuer \nto take\n maybe\n \na small piece of land that the community wants to buy\n—perhaps\n it is\n part of a much larger estate—and say definitely what \nthe \nopen market value is. The tendency of the whole process \nis to give a more cautious \nand\n higher estimate of open market value than would probably be the case if you had a public auction of that single piece of land for the particular purpose that t\nhe\n particular community body wanted to buy it for.\n There is \ndifficulty within the statutory process of trying to judge what open m\narket value is for a product \nwhich there are very few transactions to compare against.\n&#xa0;\nQ336&#xa0; \nChair: Presumably, i\nf the Government \nannounce\nd\n tomorrow that \nthe \ninheritance tax allowance and so on was being abolished\n,\n the valuations bein\ng arrived at would be much\n lower, almost a quarter.\nProfessor Adams: The valuers could make an estimated adjustment\n. T\nhey would feel much happi\ner \nto see some transaction evidence over a period of time.\n&#xa0;\nQ337&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: \nIt is interesting to take that argument further. Y\nou are talking about coming up with an open market value but in a market which effectively is dysfunctional\n,\n because it is massively affected by subsidies and hi\ndden taxation. In terms of \ngetting to a point where you are getting good value for the public purse, surely you have to deal with the market issues; otherwise, you deal with the bureaucracy of \na \ncommunity buying a piece of land \nand\n make that easier, but, at the end of the day, you are still left with a \nprice, a \nvaluation of the market, or otherwise, that is massively inflated by the system. Surely, from the point of view of getting proper value for money for what is effectively public money that you are handing over to buy this\n property, you should be dealing with the market\n,\n which is distorting the value of the property that you are then handing money over to buy.\nProfessor Cheshire: The market value of land is what they pay in the market. That will reflect the capitalised values of these subsidies and other things we have been talking about. It is asking\n a lot\n too much\n of valuers to give you any reasonably sensible valuation of what the land would be worth in the absence of those. At one stage\n,\n most of what we were paying farmers for environmental aspect\ns was essentially for their for\ngone subsidy\n \nfor not producing food. The problem is that we were paying out \nof\n two pockets at the same time. Take away the tax breaks and subsidie\ns and c\nonvert the subsidies into conservation payments, which would have real community value but would also support farmers’ income, and the price of land will fall. If you did that\n,\n there would immediately be a lot of land coming\n \non \nto \nthe market because a lot of it is being held simply because it provides a way of shielding wealth against tax.\n&#xa0;\nQ338&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: \nTo use your analogy, that is precisely what we are doing here\n. We are \npaying out of both pockets\n. We\n are paying communities to help them \nto \nbuy the land but also paying the subsidies\n which inflate the market value of the land.\n \nProfessor Cheshire: \nT\nhe money you are giving communities\n to buy the land is\n to compensate people for money you are already giving them through the tax break. It is a problem of policy failure rather than\n of\n market failure.\n \n&#xa0;\nQ339&#xa0; \nChair: \nThat is \na very good way of putting it. On t\nhe question of the community wanting to purchase land\n, i\ns there anything about the parcels of land that communities tend to want to buy \nthat distinguishes them from other land? To some extent, land is land, but maybe it tends to be in particular locations\n. Is there anything \nwe ought to be aware of that it wou\nld be useful for us to consider?\nProfessor Adams: In some cases, it is whole estates that communities \nhave wanted to buy out \nin order \nto remove the\n landlord and control the estates\n themselves\n;\n in other cases, it is small plots of land on the edge of a village, o\nr whatever it happens to be. B\nut the community right to buy also applies to all settlements\n with populations \nunder 10,000\n. In Nei\nlston\n,\n the community bought out a bank building and turned it into \na community \ncentre. S\no\n,\n \nacross the piece, \nthe pieces of land or property that communities might be interested in purchasing\n are quite varied\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ340&#xa0; \nChair: B\nut there is nothing in that which\n in a sense ought to lead us towards a particular policy prescription.\nProfessor Adams: \nAs to \nthe po\nlicy prescription,\n in terms of the community right to buy\n,\n the legislation is devolved under the\n Land Reform Act,\n t\nhe Scottish land fund and so on. The\n immediate legislation\n is\n for the Scottish Parliament. If changes of the taxation regime indirectly made that easier, that would probably\n be welcome\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ341&#xa0; \nGraeme Morrice: \nIn your view, is it proper for G\novernment to intervene in land markets with the aim of reducing the price of land?\n              \nChair: I take it that is a hard one.\nProfessor Cheshire: \nI think it is proper for G\novernments not to intervene in ways that increase the price of land.\nGraeme Morrice: That is a good answer.\n&#xa0;\nQ342&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: T\nhey already do.\nProfessor Adams: \nAs they presently do.\n&#xa0;\nQ343&#xa0; \nChair: \nThey could quite easily withdraw from the market by changin\ng a whole number of things \nthey are presently doing. I understand that.\nMike Crockart: \nOr withdraw the intervention\n rather than further\n intervention.\nProfessor Adams: I think your whole question makes presumptions of how you construct la\nnd markets and\n prices. That is the problem with the question, and probably why I hesitated over it. I cannot see\n any mileage in the long term in\n G\novernments wanting to intervene in the way you have said, but there are a number of th\nings that G\nove\nrnments could do. For example, G\novernments have a role \nto play in ensuring much better information within the market. That may or may not have price implications. For example, the question of\n exactly who \nowns the\n land, what price has been paid and\n what the mortgages a\nre is a contextual action that G\novernments can take that, \nin certain circumstances\n,\n may well result in price changes. This is quite separate from the debate on taxation, but I do not think that going in and saying, “We are going\n to subsid\nis\ne land prices \nand try to get prices down that way\n,”\n is correct. The other way round—removing subsidies that may be keeping prices high—may well be appropriate.\n&#xa0;\nQ344&#xa0; \nGraeme Morrice: \nCan I look at the options? From the evidence\n that\n we have received to date, there appear to be three ways in which public policy could influence land values: first, reforming the system of tax reliefs and subsidies; secondly, regulation of the land markets; and, thirdly, fiscal measures such as land taxes to moderate or reduce land prices. From your own research, which of these three options do you think would be the most effective in reducing land values?\nProfessor Adams: \nCan I add a fourth?\n              Graeme Morrice: Of course. I was going to ask later on whether there\n are any other options that \nperhaps \nyou \nmight like to share with us.\nProfessor Adams: This is particularly applicable within urban areas, but I suspect it is applicable to a lesser exte\nnt within rural areas. W\nhere you have people holding on to land and not doing much about it\n, \nbecause there are very few holding costs \nfor keeping land unproductive, o\nne could introduce various measures \nto bring that land for\n sale. They could \nbe direct or indirect.\nIn my view, o\nne of the huge problems\n we have in\n urban Scotland is that we have large areas of land, some of which has been vacan\nt\n, or under the same ownership\n,\n f\nor a long period of time. What G\novernments could perhaps do most productively is e\nnsure that that land came to\n market. That does two things. First, it gets us away from all these estim\nates of value; it gives us \nreal hard price evidence, and that probably means some write-down of owners’ expectations\n, because there are \nexpecta\ntions of value in urban areas. Secondly, i\nt also helps to produce new opportunities within urban areas. I have argued that strongly in urban areas. There may be parts of rural \nScotland\n where that applies \nas well.\n&#xa0;\nQ345&#xa0; \nGraeme Morrice: How \ndo you dampen expectations of owners in terms of future potential value?\nProfessor Adams: You need to be pretty direct about it.\n Y\nou have to take the view that there comes a point where holding on to land without doing much about it is not in the public interest. Whether you define that as two, three, five or 10 years is an open question, but at that point there needs to be a procedure by which that land can be put to public auction. Whether it is public land or private land does not matter. Some of the land is held by public authorities\n. T\nhe majority of land is held by private bodies\n. We \ndo not even know who holds\n some of\n it. If we put that land to public auction, we start to get a more realistic assessment\n of what prices probably\n are,\n reflect\ning\n today’s economic circumstances\n, and that is a stimulant \nto new activity.\n&#xa0;\nQ346&#xa0; \nGraeme Morrice: \nHow do you bring about that situation? Obviously, you would have to make that mandatory.\nProfessor Adams: Yes. \nI have published a paper on this. You would need to have a legislative procedure\n with all the safeguards you would suggest. These are what we call hard core vacant sites. It is not land that has\n been vacant for a year or two; it has been vacant through one boom and slump and the next boom\n,\n and nothing has happened. In many parts of \nurban \nScotland\n,\n we need structural change. Part of that structural change is an acceptance that l\nand values are not as they were\n and\n,\n in order to get that structural change\n,\n we need hard evidence through transactions. I think the best way to do that is a public procedure by which you can force that land to public auction.\n&#xa0;\nQ347&#xa0; \nChair: \nBefore Professor Cheshire comes in,\n can I clarify something? Y\nou mentioned increasing the costs of holding land. What did you have in mind?\nProfessor Adams: \nIn some jurisdictions\n,\n there is what they c\nall a vacant land tax. If you have a piece of land that\n has been sitting idle for a number of years\n,\n a tax is imposed on it, and there are arguments for and against that. I think it is a fairly indirect mechanism. You can say that you tax land to raise the holding cost of keeping it vaca\nnt. It\n would take a long time \nfor that \nto work through\n. A \nmore direct mechanism is to have almost an inverse compulsory purchas\ne order. It is not the state acquiring it but the state saying\n,\n \nafter a period of time\n, “Y\nou\n’ve\n had your chanc\ne to make use of this land. You haven’t\n made use of it. This now has to go to auction and someone else can\n have it.”\n&#xa0;\nQ348&#xa0; \nChair: Surely, in those circumstances\n,\n you can quite easily h\nave a carousel of owners. I\nt is not held by the same group, trust or structure for any length of time\n, but after six months it is\n sold to another front company and it keeps rotating.\nProfessor Adams: \nYou could deal with that through the terms of the contract and the property rights to give an implied option to the public authority\n \nthat\n,\n if someone bought it and\n \ndid noth\ning for a period of three years\n for ex\nample, it would\n then vest in the\n public authority. \nThat would probably not need to be exercised, but you would have to put something in the contract to avoid precisely the problem you mention.\nProfessor Cheshire: I am not \nentirely 180 degrees away from what has just been said, but I would be more cautious\n. There are holding costs which\n vary according to the type of land holder. Historically, one of the problems might have been\n with\n pub\nlic authorities where there wa\ns no cost penalty to them and they simply were not behaving as if this was an asset which was potentially worth something. There may be some land tie\nd up in that way, but privately \nheld land has got a cost which is the opportunity cost of doing something with it. It may be that the owner expects the future value to be higher and there is an optional demand process going on\n. It may also be\n,\n \nin some former industrial\n areas\n,\n that the remediation costs \nof the land mean that it \nis not worth doing anything with\n it, \nunless you get quite substantial public assistance to remediate it.\n              \nWhen you come to rural land, it is\n very dangerous territory. What is land that is not having anything done with it? Is \na nature reserve\n an area of land that is having nothing done with it\n? I\ns it a habitat\n \nthat you are not wanting to develop in any way? I can\n certainly see an argument\n f\nor a vacant land tax. C\noming back to\n \nthe tax relief that exists for agricultural land\n, \nI can see an argument for rateable values being applied to\n such\n land\n,\n certainly in England\n—I \nam not quite sure about the situation in Scotland\n—where \nagricultural land is exempt from local taxation.\n That seems an odd state of \nthe world. \nI can see that you can’t\n charge a very high \nrateable value\n,\n but \nif there were \nsome rateable value. Of course, \non the margin you \nhave things that are farmed.\n I know that in \nScotland\n you have areas where maybe you could do some sort o\nf very extensive farming but the land may be held by absentee landowners who\n ar\ne really doing nothing at all. Therefore, s\nome nominal rate on vacant land, even rural vacant land, might be justifiable. That would get capitalised into the value of the agricultural land\n.\n If you were liable for paying those rates, the value of land would fall.\n&#xa0;\nQ349&#xa0; \nChair: Professor Adams, can I pick up a point you made about not knowing who holds the land? Is there a way in which that ought to be addressed?\nProfessor Adams: If I can give you some precise figures on that, there is almost 11,000 hectares of vacant and derelict land in \nScotland\n. According to the Scottish Government’s statistics,\n the ownership of 12% of that is \nunknown to the local authority. That is in a country where we have the register of sa\nsines and\n the Land R\negistry. \nWe have very good historic records of land ownership. According to the Scottish Government’s statistics, \nlocal authorities have \nno idea who owns \n12% of the vacant and derelict land in Scotland\n.\n That is the kind of problem we face in trying to make land markets work.\n&#xa0;\nQ350&#xa0; \nChair: \nHow should that be dealt with?\nProfessor Adams: There are issues around land registration and the speed of moving over to the new system. They are issues that the land reform review group has been asked to consider. No doubt\n,\n there will be ideas on that coming out of the land reform review group. There is a question as to whether\n,\n in the modern age\n,\n where you can get so much information from the internet\n,\n we should\n have \na \nsystem t\nhat, if y\no\nu wanted to\n \ncheck who owns a piece of land\n, there would be quite efficient publicly \nkep\nt\n \nregister\ns, \nso \nt\nhere is no doubt\n, and\n \nyou could very easily find out who owned that piece of vacant land in your community\n,\n and you could at least send them an e-mail and ask whether they would be interested in selling. That is one of the problems at the moment.\n&#xa0;\nQ351&#xa0; \nChair: \nT\nhere is no reason why the relevant authority, which\n presumably\n would be the Scottish Government or local authority, should not have the opportunity to compulsorily purchase land for which there is no identifiable owner, and then the money is not handed up unless the owner appears.\nProfessor Adams: \nLocal authorities have that power. If we look across \nScotland\n, the n\number of local authorities which\n are skilled, experienced and undertake compulsory purchase regularly is very small now. \nIt has been whittled down from the\n position\n \n30 or 40 years ago. \nDundee\n is a very good example of an authority that has used compulsory purchase to undertake a major city centre redevelopment. People point to Dundee and say\n, “T\nhis is how it can be done.\n”\n Most Scottish local authorities are not really in that league. They do not have the skills and certainly \ndon’t have \nthe finance. Compulsory purchase is uncertain legally and financially.\n There are \na lot of constraints to put local authorities off going down that l\nine, particularly with \nall the financia\nl cutbacks. My view is that an auction may be a way to try to\n get some of the markets to work themselves a bit better\n,\n without necessarily having to rely on lo\nc\nal authority compulsory purchase.\n&#xa0;\nQ352&#xa0; \nChair: \nIn the event that an owner could not be identified, their land would be sold at auction and they would get the proceeds if they ever appeared. Is that roughly the way in which this would work?\nProfessor Adams: \nThere are ways in which the local authority can deal with that. I am not sufficiently\n knowledgeable about\n what the local authority would\n then do with the proceeds\n—\nwhether they would have to hold on to them for someone to turn up an\nd say they owned it, or \nwhether \nthey could deal with it in another way.\n&#xa0;\nQ353&#xa0; \nChair: Presumably, it is reasonable for us to expect the Scottish Government’s commis\nsion, to which you are an advise\nr, to resolve all these matters since all these are devolved at the moment. We are a bit hesitant to intrude into things that are devolved. Where it is appropriate, we will do it if it ties in with what we are looking at, but presumably this is something they ought to resolve when they report in April.\nProfessor Adams: The group \nhas a fairly broad remit from the Scottish Government\n, as you will know and \nwill \nhave seen. It is charged with a whole range of issues that relate primarily to devolved matters, and it will be coming forward with a report in response to that remit.\n&#xa0;\nQ354&#xa0; \nChair: Is that a yes or no? I was saying it was reasonable for us to expect that they will come back and resolve this. I am not quite sure whether or not you agree.\nProfessor Adams: It depends on what you mean. I cannot say that the land reform review group will resolve it as you think it shou\nld be resolved. I am not a member of the group; I am advising it.\n&#xa0;\nQ355&#xa0; \nChair: \nIt is reasonable for us to expect them to resolve it in some way, not necessarily the way we would want.\nProfessor Adams: Let’s put it this way: I think you will find they will try to address it.\nChair: That is helpful.\n&#xa0;\nQ356&#xa0; \nGraeme Morrice: I had finished my line of questioning, but what was flagged up was the interesting\n stat\n with regard to vac\nant land. You said that\n 12%, which is about one eighth, of that land does not have an identified owner. You are saying that local authorities will not be aware of who owns that land, if indeed it is owned at all. Are ther\ne any other bodies out there which\n would be awa\nre of that, apart from the land\no\nwners themselves? T\nhat is a remarkably high figure.\nProfessor Adams: It is. \nAs a gross figure,\n \nthe ownership of \njust over 1,300 hectares of vacant and derelict land in \nScotland\n, \naccording to the Scottish Government’s survey\n, is\n unknown to the local authority.\n&#xa0;\nQ357&#xa0; \nGraeme Morrice: And, therefore, not known by any public body.\nProfessor Adams: \nW\nith quite a bit of digging within the registers\n, some of that\n might be discoverable. I have not drilled down below that, but I was surprised by that figure.\n&#xa0;\nQ358&#xa0; \nChair: Professor Cheshire, do you want to comment on this exchange?\nProfessor Cheshire: This is \na level of detail where I probably do not h\nave anything very useful to offer.\n&#xa0;\nQ359&#xa0; \nChair: To be fair, that does not always stop some of our witnesses commenting. That is a remarkable degree of self-restraint.\nProfessor Cheshire: Having said that, of course I will say something. I just happened to be in a discussion the other day when roughly this sort of conversation was going on. They were identifying ownership\n,\n but failing to identify options. Sometimes it may be owned land or land that is not owned, but there may be a third party, or even fourth party, that has an option on certain rights associated with that land, like future development rights.\n&#xa0;\nQ360&#xa0; \nChair: Presumably, i\nf somebody has an option over a piece of land that is derelict and lying unused and it comes up for auction, they have the opportunity to step in beforehand either to exercise that option at that stage or participate in the auction.\nProfessor Adams: The option would be registrable, so you would discover it by the normal search processes.\n&#xa0;\nQ361&#xa0; \nChair: In that case, if you identify it\n,\n \nit\n would not apply to any of the land for which there is no identifiable owner, since presumably you will have an idea of what the option is against it, so to speak.\nProfessor Adams: I am not sure of the technicalities of that. I am just trying to think it through. You would expect, if there was an option on land, that it would be one where the outright owner as well as the option holder were known.\n&#xa0;\nQ362&#xa0; \nChair: I am aware from my experience in \nGlasgow\n that there are blocks of air where tenements have been demolished and they have been unable to identify the owner. The tenement has collapsed, so theoretically somebody still owns that block of air, but they managed to find a way round it and move on. To what extent are these difficulties a bit like the Gordian knot? If there was a will to address them, they could be addressed relatively straightforwardly.\nProfessor Adams: Let me take you to a study that we did of major redevelopment sites in Aberdeen\n, Dundee and two English cities\n—\nNottingham and Stoke. These were areas of at least two hectares, so they were substantial sites. We did the study in the 1990s and looked at 80 in detail. Last year we went back. How many of those 80 had now been developed? Forty\n-\nthree had been fully developed; 20 had been partially developed; and 17 were in exactly the same condition as they were in the mid-1990s. That exemplifies the issue that in many of these cities you have areas of vacant derelict land that has been in exactly the same condition for decades.\n&#xa0;\nQ363&#xa0; \nChair: \nYes, b\nut is it not the case that there would almost be no economic use to which some of these derelict sites could be put? I know of areas where the community is devastated, but, unless a local authority or public body wants to step in and build something on that on an uneconomic basis, there is absolutely no way in which the market will be able to identify any profit that can be made from developing it.\nProfessor Cheshire: That is a very important point. It is not just an either/or; it is a gradation of what the costs are of remediating and servicing the land and what the value of the land would be were it developed. This is very variable. A city which has got outward movement of population, for example, may have very substantial areas of land which essentially have no economic viability, unless there is major public intervention. My view is that that public intervention needs to have a very good case to justify it. I am not saying it cannot have a case, but it is not necessarily the case that it is worth intervening.\nProfessor Adams: I disagree to some extent with what is being said.\nChair: Oh, good.\nProfessor Adams: The reason I do that is two\nfold. First, different potential users have different profit expectations. Those profit expectations turn into the way\n that\n they appraise potential schemes for development. When we are talking about whether particular pieces of land are viable we need to ask: viable for whom? They may not be viable for a large multinational company; they may be viable for a small local housing association, for example, because of the different ways the development appraisal is undertaken, the different profit ratios and so on. In some parts of urban Scotland\n,\n the answer is not multinational companies coming in; it is encouraging local enterprise, local community organisations, local co\n&#x2011;\noperatives and local housing. Some of the lessons from rural \nScotland\n in terms of community initiative are quite easily transferable to urban \nScotland\n, if the land was available.\n              \nThe other matter comes back to what I have written about, which is unrealistic price expectations. If the market were working as Professor Cheshire says and it was a nice, perfect one, we would not have this situation. I come back to the difference between expectations and price. Part of the problem you might have in making the economics work is getting landowners in urban areas to be prepared to sell at more realistic prices that would encourage all sorts of things to happen. I take the view that the land market in urban areas is very dysfunctional, and part of the result of that—it is not the only cause—is extensive land vacancy.\nProfessor Cheshire: I am sceptical of the evidence of dysfunctionality. The problem is that any action is about something that is going to happen quite a long time in the future. It requires investment now if you are going to develop or remediate a piece of land, but your returns are quite a long time in the future. Yo\nu also \nhave \nto negotiate a G\novernment process, planning process and so on, so there is an awful lot of uncertainty associated with these things. If the holding costs are low, which is a possible argument for a vacant land tax, it simply may make commercial sense to sit on land for a very long time.\n&#xa0;\nQ364&#xa0; \nChair: I think we now have a much greater understanding of what we do not understand. That is progress. We are now moving to the known unknowns to some extent. Can I come to the question of the Mirrlees review? Do you agree with the observation in that review that tax reliefs in the \nUK\n are more generous than in other countries and push up the price of agricultural land?\nProfessor Cheshire: Yes, but not all other countries. It is a continuum. Many countries have no tax reliefs, but we have a series of tax reliefs and subsidies. All European countries have got common agricultural policy payments. Not all of them have inheritance tax relief; not all of them have rate relief.\n&#xa0;\nQ365&#xa0; \nChair: I used to be told at \nschoo\nl\n,\n for my big sums tests, “Show working.” Can you prove it? Is there evidence? I understand the point you are making. What evidence can you point to that we can take to somebody else as a justification for arguing a policy change?\nProfessor Cheshire: I am sorry; I missed that.\n&#xa0;\nQ366&#xa0; \nChair: I understand the point you were making that tax reliefs are more generous and push up the price of agricultural land. I just want to be clear that there is firm evidence for that, and \nthat \nyou can show us how you have reached that conclusion.\nProfessor Cheshire: In \nBritain\n,\n you can show quite clearly that\n,\n when you introduce agricultural subsidies and they have been increased\n,\n that has been capitalised into the price of agricultural land. When inheritance tax relief was introduced, over a relatively short time\n,\n \nit\n was capitalised into the price of agricultural land. You can compare the price of agricultural land in Britain with similarly productive land in, say, France where you have common agricultural policy support but a lower regime of tax advantages associated with it, and you see a lower price for agricultural land. That is not 100% proof. You could commission better proof, but you would have to do the research. As far as I am concerned, I am convinced that that is the case. If you look at historical patterns of agricultural land, you can get those back to the early 20th century. If you go into historical statistics, you can get them back to the 18th\n&#xa0;\ncentury. \nYou can see these things going through during the Napoleonic wars; you can see the opening up of the British lamb market to \nNew Zealand\n lamb with refrigeration, and that is reflected in land prices.\nChair: Excellent. Our report would be greatly assisted by being able to quote reference to Napoleonic land prices in support of any particular policy prescription. We will leave our advisers to make sure they can manage to work that in somewhere.\n&#xa0;\nQ367&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: I have a question that goes back to\n fiscal and\n tax interventions to deal with the dysfunctional market or policy, whichever way you want to look at it. Earlier \non, \nyou seemed to be saying that\n,\n in general\n,\n interventions do not work; they have unexpected consequences, and, to be frank, we should probably take away some of the ones we have. But you have just said that the potential for a vacant land tax as an intervention might be a way of dealing with some of those things.\nProfessor Cheshire: If you want to bring forward development. It was a conditional statement. It depends on what your policy objectives are. Broadly, there are reasons for having comparable tax treatment for all productive assets. Land is a productive asset. You might argue that there are social dimensions to land use, but there are certainly environmental issues associated with land use which suggest you should have a particular tax treatment to favour certain categories. In general, the lower the prices of agricultural land\n,\n the more variety of ownership and the more environmental benefits you will get.\n&#xa0;\nQ368&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: What is your view of a land value tax, or is the problem there in defining what the value is?\nProfessor Cheshire: You are back to taking with one hand and giving back with the other. Why have the tax break in the first place, which, apart from anything else, is leading people who have no association with land or farming to become quite extensive agricultural land controllers?\n&#xa0;\nQ369&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: That is the rural side of things. Would it be different on the urban side where you do not \nhave the same distortion\n?\nProfessor Cheshire: Here I disagree with my colleague. It seems to me that the enormous distortions in the urban market arise from the planning system and the separation of use categories. You are allocating supply for different uses independently of market prices and generating distortions at quite incredible levels. For example, agricultural land to the north of \nOxford\n is worth about £10,000 a hectare. If you can get permission to build houses on it, it is worth about £8\n&#xa0;\nmillion a hectare.\nProfessor Adams: That\n point in relation to the difference between agricultural and urban land is entirely correct. I have slightly different figures, but the point is correct. Within the kinds of urban areas I am talking about, which are the industrial areas of Scotland that have undergone huge structural change, it is not very hard to persuade the planners to give you permission for whatever you want to do. In those areas—we are\n a million miles from the south-\neast of England—the huge constraint is not planning. They will welcome you with open arms. There has been criticism of the way \nGlasgow\n has regenerated over a period of 20 or 30 years. The arms have been too open there. There is not a lot of evidence in those areas that the constraint is primarily a planning one.\nProfessor Cheshire: I have done research on this. You can look at a paper in \nT\nhe\n&#xa0;\nEconomic Journal\n in 2008\n,\n where we estimated the regulatory cost in about 20 office centres across Europe. While \nGlasgow\n was lower than, say, \nBirmingham\n, which is fairly shocking, it still stood out. All British office centres, with the single exception of \nNewcastle\n, had very substantial regulatory costs associated with their restrictiveness. Like Glasgow—this is from the top of my head\n, from memory\n—it was equivalent to about a 200% tax on the costs of construction associated with the supply restriction.\n&#xa0;\nQ370&#xa0; \nChair: Professor Adams, you are about to disagree.\nProfessor Adams: The areas I am talking about are not primarily in the centre of \nGlasgow\n; they are in the inner city of \nGlasgow\n. There are one or two pieces of land in the centre of Glasgow, which I know well, where often owners are holding out for the next boom to come, but, irrespective of some disagreement with Professor Cheshire’s work and his methods, I am not arguing about office centres\n, I am arguing \nabout large areas of often vacant de\n&#x2011;\nindustrialised land in British cities.\nProfessor Cheshire: I do not have detailed knowledge of the Scottish situation, but across most of England\n,\n housing is so valuable because of the restriction on supply that it is crowding out other uses. If you look at the price of land zoned for industry relative to land zoned for housing, there is a big discontinuity there. There is a similar discontinuity at the boundary between land zoned for offices compared with land zoned for housing. Certainly, in most English cities\n,\n housing \nis essentially crowding\n out any marginal commercial use, and therefore is increasing the costs of commercial use of land.\nProfessor Adams: As to the areas I am talking about, you could come with a housing scheme, industrial scheme or commercial scheme—whatever it happened to be—and in most cases Glasgow city council would fall over and sign up. These are very different places from many parts of \nEngland\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ371&#xa0; \nChair: Can I pick up a point about the size of land holdings, and whether or not the taxation treatment deals with them differently? We have been told by Scottish Land and Estates that “there is generally a level playing\n field in relation to reliefs…\nregardless of size of landholding.” Is that a fair assessment?\nProfessor Cheshire: I do not know.\nProfessor Adams: I do not know the answer to that one either.\n&#xa0;\nQ372&#xa0; \nChair: Agricultural land benefits from inheritance tax at 100%. Another witness has told us that relief from inheritance tax for businesses is “common in the developed world\n.”\n Do you agree with that?\nProfessor Cheshire: I think that is an overstatement. There are cases whe\nre there is a degree of relief—\nfor example\n, family businesses—\nbut it is not an either/or. There is a variation across countries in the extent to which there may be relief from tax for small businesses in an inheritance context, but I think the issue of agricultural land is an outlier in that.\n&#xa0;\nQ373&#xa0; \nChair: Is \nthat, \nagricultural land in the UK \nis \nan outlier?\nProfessor Cheshire: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ374&#xa0; \nChair: When we are doing international comparisons about how agricultural land is treated for inheritance tax, the \nUK\n would be an outlier among those and would be seen to be much more generous in terms of what it permitted people to carry without the impact of inheritance tax.\nProfessor Cheshire: I am not saying there is not another country in the world, but\n,\n in general, if you look across OECD countries, yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ375&#xa0; \nChair: Is there clear evidence to support that? Again, would \nyou \nbe able to refer us to something, if one of our advisers gets in touch with you\n?  I\ns \nthat not just a feeling, and h\nas comparative research already been done on that?\nProfessor Cheshire: I could not cite a specific piece of evidence. I know about some individual countries, but I am not going to offer to do your research for you.\n&#xa0;\nQ376&#xa0; \nChair: We are here. We just thought we would try to pick your brains.\nProfessor Cheshire: Which I am happy to have done.\n&#xa0;\nQ377&#xa0; \nChair: Professor Adams, do you want to comment on those \nfew\n points?\nProfessor Adams: No. It is not something in which I have as much expertise as Professor Cheshire, so I would defer to what he has to say.\n&#xa0;\nQ378&#xa0; \nChair: Land occupied for agriculture, forestry and hunting, shooting and so on is all de-rated at the moment. Given that the c\nurrent business rate is 46p\n in the pound, if we applied the charge to agriculture, forestry, hunting and shooting would that have quite a substantial impact on the capital value of that land? I am presuming, from what you have said before, that you think it would.\nProfessor Cheshire: It would, and I think we should be very careful how we proceed. \nAs I was saying earlier, g\no very cautiously. You can easily end up with a tax which means that the market value of agricultural land is negative, which is not a result you probably want. \n&#xa0;Q379&#xa0; \nChair: I\ns negative?\nProfessor Cheshire: In the sense \nof \nh\now \ny\nou \nare \ngoing to treat the rate\nable value of agricultural land.\n My position is that it should be cautiously set at a low rate.\n&#xa0;\nQ380&#xa0; \nChair: At a low poundage. We have valuations at the moment. Irrespective of whether or not we trust valuers, we can reach valuations on estates and they can be charged, not necessarily at the ex\nisting business rate of 46p\n in the pound, but certainly at a low rate and building it up as and when. The substance of your evidence, I think, is that almost all that increase in taxation would be reflected in the price.\nProfessor Cheshire: Correct.\n&#xa0;\nQ381&#xa0; \nChair: As the tax rose, the price would fall, and \nthen \nthere is an issue for either the local authority or somebody else as to what balance they strike.\nProfessor Cheshire: Yes, and it would provide a mild financial incentive for people to make the best of their land, so to speak.\n&#xa0;\nQ382&#xa0; \nChair: Professor Adams, do you agree with that?\nProfessor Adams: I do not disagree with that. I am happy to leave that to Professor\n&#xa0;\nCheshire.\n&#xa0;\nQ383&#xa0; \nChair: Were we wanting to drive down the price of land, ending de-rating would be one of the easiest ways of doing it.\nProfessor Cheshire: I would start with inheritance tax relief and see what happened, \nthen \nmove to a vacant land tax, if you wanted that, and then move to agricultural re-rating, which is a very modest step.\n&#xa0;\nQ384&#xa0; \nChair: I can see a possible difficulty about vacant land tax on the basis of what is “vacancy\n,”\n particularly in rural areas\n: is\n a single sheep per\n million acres vacant\n \nor not? \nPresumably, you then get into all sorts of complicated rules.\nProfessor Cheshire: You can apply a vacant land tax only to urban land.\n&#xa0;\nQ385&#xa0; \nChair: In rural areas\n,\n you would not have any equivalent.\nProfessor Cheshire: It would be agricultural rating, because you would have your vacant land with a single sheep on 1,000 acres. That land would then be charged an agricultural rate.\nProfessor Adams: There are clear definitions from the Government’s survey of exactly what vacant and derelict land is. They need some adapt\nat\nion, but that would provide the basis for any further policy action.\n&#xa0;\nQ386&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: I would like to address questions on the Valuation Office Agency particularly to Professor Cheshire. Since 2011\n,\n that agency has stopped collecting and publishing land price indices. Among others, you were quite vocal in your concerns about that. Why is it so important to have that information?\nProfessor Cheshire: The information was less than perfect, but it was the only source that existed. There\n are lots of different sources—\nfor example\n,\n the house price indices. There \nwas only one source of publicly \navailable data on land prices. We differ in where we were in the spectrum of \nvaluation\n. My view is that markets yield very valuable information about where shortages are, but where you have a relative restriction on supply compared with demand—there may be good reasons\n for that restriction\n; \nfor example\n,\n you do not want people to build in areas of outstanding natural beauty, national parks or wherever it may be—unless you have information on land markets, you cannot use the information which land markets are generating to guide where you should be releasing more land for development.\n&#xa0;\nQ387&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: The indices are purely a pointer; they show areas that we need to look at more closely, so it is not indicating anything in itself.\nProfessor Cheshire: It is indicating something in itself\n—\nthat there is an excess demand for land in that location relative to some other location. Whe\nre we observe that the price of\n \nland north of Oxford, or within the green belt part of Greater London, is £8\n&#xa0;\nmillion to £10\n&#xa0;\nmillion a hectare, that is not just the land market telling you something; it is screaming that there is a real shortage of housing in that area, if it is at a price that is available for housing land. This is not \nScotland\n, but guidance issued on the national policy planning framework says that land prices should be used as indicative measures to allocate land for development. That came out in October, but all the data had been abolished a year previously.\n&#xa0;\nQ388&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: Your specific concerns are around housing.\nProfessor Cheshire: Because that is the single most important use, but it also supplied data on agricultural land. It is very valuable to have a long series. That series had been available for a very long period. Even if it was not absolutely right, you could see trends over time and make comparisons across areas and regions, and that has been lost.\n&#xa0;\nQ389&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: More generally, would it be useful in giving assistance in exactly the sort of thing we are trying to do, which is to develop our policies particularly dealing with land reform?\nProfessor Cheshire: Without land price data of a systematic sort, you are essentially scrabbling around in the dark. It is absurd that we do not have land data; it is worse than absurd. You cannot even value company assets. There are \na \nlot of companies that own land as part of their asset values. We have no way of objectively assessing those.\n&#xa0;\nQ390&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: Companies do it.\nProfessor Cheshire: With increasing difficulty, but you cannot challenge them because there is no official data series on what has been happening to the price of land.\n&#xa0;\nQ391&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: There was a big debate around the Post Office estate, but valuations were done that put nominal values on it.\nProfessor Cheshire: You can commission specific valuations, but you have no check against some third party quasi-objective source of evidence, so they may or may not be good, but they are one-off; they are not an ongoing basis. How can we challenge some big developer \nthat\n says that their landholdings are worth \nx\n if there are no data on land prices out there?\n&#xa0;\nQ392&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: \nI meant Royal Mail, not the Post Office. Are there other aspects of information, data or transparency, such as patterns of land tenure and occupation, that are important, particularly in being able to develop evidence-based policy\n in this area\n?\nProfessor Cheshire: Historically, Scotland has been much more open about price data for property than England, but there seems to me no reason at all why there should not be publicly accessible data on all transactions in land, including ownership, price and other characteristics of the land, particularly the exact geo-location of the land, because without that you cannot really assess the value of the land in terms of its composite characteristics.\n&#xa0;\nQ393&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: Professor Adams, do you want to comment?\nProfessor Adams: An a\nbsolutely fundamental role for G\novernment\ns\n to play is to make sure this information is available. The key characteristic of the Valuation Office data is that they were independent; they were not\n acting on behalf of, or\n trying to produce an index from a selective number of clients. The position was that they had full access to data because of the particulars delivered, and it was then published. To go back to my point, they were not estimates; they were published as price data. If there is one thing\n that\n G\novernments can do to improve the functioning of land markets it is to have decent information systems. I concur entirely about knowledge of the owner and the price being public. It is absolutely essential; otherwise, the difficulty of values or estimates getting out of line with prices becomes worse. Anything that this Committee could do to have that data series reinstated\n,\n I would applaud.\nProfessor Cheshire: It is absolutely amazing that a modern, allegedly civilised, country does not have any public data on land prices or land ownership. If you think back to the banking crisis of 2007, part of that came out of a mis-valuation of real estate assets. \nIt’s—I’m\n lost for words.\n&#xa0;\nQ394&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: That was prior to these indices not being done.\nProfessor Cheshire: Of course, there were other failures in the system, but you cannot even begin to be worried about what is going on with the value of real estate assets unless, as my colleague said, you have a publicly available quasi-objective source of data.\n&#xa0;\nQ395&#xa0; \nChair: Can I ask whether or not there is any other information—data, patterns of land tenure and so on—that it is valuable to have and we do not have at the moment? You mentioned beneficial ownership, for example. Is there anything else that we ought to seek to have established as an information source in the public sector?\nProfessor Adams: In relation to urban land, there could be much better public knowledge on contamination, for example, because that clearly has a knock\n&#x2011;\non price effect. It is not easy to do. There have been attempts to do it, but one needs to have a system that puts together various pieces of information that affect prices offered and paid in the market, and in urban areas contamination may be one of those.\n&#xa0;\nQ396&#xa0; \nChair: Presumably, that would require somebody going out to assess it. I can see how, when a piece of land is being examined for purchase/sale, \nand somebody gets it tested, then t\nhe information becomes available and it should be held in the public domain, but are you suggesting there would be an automatic process by which the public sector started collecting this information? I can see an\n expense\n argument against that right away.\nProfessor Adams: There might be certain parts where that would be useful, in the same way that there are geological surveys on which areas have had coal mining in the past. That is going to undermine development prospects. You might take that approach. It certainly would not be a blanket coverage, but there might be areas where that would be useful. In other places\n,\n there are simply surveys that have already been done which could be made more public.\n&#xa0;\nQ397&#xa0; \nGraeme Morrice: I wanted to touch briefly on the issue of urban land reform. Professor Adams, you have written about the urgent need for urban land reform. Could you define what you mean by this? What are the key issues that need to be addressed?\nProfessor Adams: The tie-up between urban land reform and rural land reform is all about property rights. The issue would be: who owns and exercises the property rights? Property rights are conditioned by statute, custom and so on\n and so forth\n. Previously, one is starting to question whether a property right that enables you to hold land indefinitely, which I talked about a moment ago, is in the public interest, but let’s move on from that.\n              \nAnother issue is where you are trying to put together a major redevelopment site. Whether it is in the city centre or the edge of the city does not really matter. Particularly in urban areas\n,\n we will often fin\nd many different property right \nholders with different ownership interests. It is a patchwork. Either the local authority comes in and compulsorily purchases the whole lot—the evidence tells us that that happens very rarely—or the private developer operates secretly over a period of time, gradually trying to assemble it, which is a very inefficient way of doing it.\n              \nOne issue that has come up in my paper is the suggestion that in those kinds of circumstances we adopt the legislation that applies in \nHong Kong\n, for example. They have a similar problem but it is much more evident because they have a lot of multi-storey buildings. Imagine a multi-storey building in \nHong Kong\n with 100 different owners and trying to get that together for redevelopment. Many of those buildings are past their sell-by date and you could put something more viable there.\n              \nUnder our system\n,\n the private developer would have to negotiate individually with all 100 owners, or the local authority \nwould put in a\n compulsory purchase order \nand\n buy them all out. The legislation introduced in \nHong Kong\n is such that the private owner simply has to buy up 90% and at that point can go for what you might regard as a privatised form of compulsory purchase. I will not go into the details of that, but that is basically what it is. It is the same sort of principle as company acquisition.\n              \nThe advantage of it is that previously there was a reason to be the last person to sell. If you were the 100th person and he had bought all 99, you could hold him to ransom. You do not know where you will be in the queue. You might be very happy being the 89th because you can still hold him to ransom, but you do not want to be the 90th or 91st person to sell because your bargaining power has gone. In that kind of arrangement\n,\n you have redefined the property right to overcome what is primarily an issue of market failure. You have said, “We will deal with that issue of market failure without necessarily going through a big compulsory purchase. We will deal with it by trying to deal with the way the market operates.” That is an example of what one could do in terms of urban land reform. It would be reform of property rights to speed up redevelopment without the need for compulsory purchase.\n&#xa0;\nQ398&#xa0; \nChair: Professor Cheshire, do you want to add anything to that?\nProfessor Cheshire: A classic problem of land markets is land assembly and the hold-out problem, as it is called, which has been described. I have one slight worry, which you would have to pay attention to. It is easy in \nHong Kong\n where you are dealing with a vertical structure because it is defined before you start, but, if you are talking about land assembly, what is 90%? Ninety per cent\n.\n of what? In some sense, the intended developer would have to identify the area over which they were wishing to assemble ahead of time.\nProfessor Adams: You would probably need to tie that up with at least some acknowledgement by the public authority early on that the area identified by the developer was a suitable one for redevelopment, but it could be done. You could set up the system in such a way, so that is an example where you could make the market work a lot better.\n&#xa0;\nQ399&#xa0; \nMike Crockart: I have a very quick question about the community right to buy. At the moment\n,\n it is very much a rural matter. There are conditions attached to it about the size of the community. We have heard evidence in this inquiry that that should be made universal so it could be brought in\n in\n an urban situation. What is your view of the extension of that right to buy?\nProfessor Adams: The Scottish Government ran a consultation precisely on that point. The consultation responses were overwhelmingly in favour of extending the right to buy to urban areas. I think the principle is one that has quite broad support. There were very few people arguing against it. T\nhe issue is obviously \noperationalising\n it. How do you define the community in an urban area? That is not insurmountable. You might need to take small rather than large distances; you may need to define the community in different ways. For example, there are community councils\n in urban areas\n that represent parts of urban areas, so there are a number of ways in which it would be possible to identify the community so it was not one or two individuals.\n&#xa0;\nQ400&#xa0; \nLindsay Roy: My apologies, gentlemen. I had another commitment this afternoon, so I am acting as \nswee\nper.\n I am sorry I missed your evidence. The scope of this inquiry is quite wide. In relation to the operation of land markets, are there topics or questions that you think we should pay particular attention to, in addition to those that you have discussed today? In other words, are there any answers you have prepared to questions that you thought we might have asked but have not so far asked?\nProfessor Cheshire: I think we have covered quite a lot of the ground over which I think I have expertise. The basic issue is capitalisation and how relatively effective land markets are at capitalising all sorts of what one might think are extraordinarily intangible values, like expected future aircraft noise, local graffiti or quality of fishing. All of this is reflected in land prices. That was the basic message I wanted to get across, and that applies to these tax incentives, tax breaks and subsidies as well.\nProfessor Adams: Although I disagree with the application of a number of the ideas that Professor Cheshire is putting forward, the fundamental principle is that the way land markets in this country work is very directly conditioned by law and policy. It is possible for Parliament and \nthe Government\n to make major changes to the operation of land markets by setting the context slightly differently. We should not think of land markets as\n something natural that appear\n from the sky like the weather. Land markets are constructed through social \nrelationships but also through G\novernment policy and legislation. All that can reconstruct land markets in a different way.\nProfessor Cheshire: I entirely agree. Property rights are not given by God; they are defined by law, and exactly how they are defined is reflected in the prices people will pay in land markets. Coming back to the issue of 12% of land under uncertain ownership, I suggest it is very likely that that land would sell at a discount because of the uncertainty of ownership.\nChair: Colleagues, are there any final points? As I indicated earlier, I now have a much greater understanding of what I do not entirely understand, but at least you have, very valuably, pointed us in the right direction. Thank you very much.\n&#xa0;\n"
