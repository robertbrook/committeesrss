"&#xa0;\nEssex County Council – Written evidencePositioning statement&#xa0;\nEssex County Council is supportive of the aims of the Draft Deregulation Bill in reducing bureaucracy and clarifying legislation that in many cases is outdated or unnecessary. \n&#xa0;\nWe have restricted our comments to those issues where there is a direct impact from the proposals on our role as a local authority or the well-being of our communities. Should further Calls for Evidence be published we will be happy to respond to those as appropriate.\n&#xa0;\nPower to dis-apply legislation no longer of practical use&#xa0;\nWe believe that there are some risks with the proposed power to \ndis\n-apply legislation ‘no longer of practical use’ associated with the subjectivity of the test and with the proposed scope of \nconsultees\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn terms of safeguards regarding the use of the proposed power they are limited to the Law Commissions and Parliament. There is discretion to ‘consult other persons’ but only if the Minister considers it ‘appropriate’. \nWe would recommend including local authorities within the list of required \nconsultees\n if the legislation to be \ndisapplied\n impacts on their areas of competence.\nSpecific tests relating to the term ‘no longer of practical use’ in the parent Act would be helpful but given that the term itself is not defined it is difficult to say what the tests could or should be. \n&#xa0;\nEconomic Growth&#xa0;We support the spirit of the Draft Bill in promoting the principle of economic growth as a duty of non-economic regulators. However, we are concerned that in practice there is the potential for this duty to add to the regulatory burden rather than reduce it. There will need to be safeguards in place regarding the terms of the duty.\n&#xa0;\nWe would certainly welcome testing the proposals with business as the process develops and before the draft Bill becomes law.\n&#xa0;\nAs described above, we are concerned that it might prove counter-productive to the aims of this duty if there were broad potential for challenge on the basis of non-compliance and, equally, scope for a broad spectrum of understanding on what compliance actually looks like. The ultimate effect of the proposal might then be to add to existing regulatory burdens, while adding legal actions which would add delay and cost. Conversations with business on what ‘meaningful regard’ looks like might help circumvent the plethora of potential issues.\n&#xa0;\nApprenticeships&#xa0;The Draft Deregulation Bill makes significant revisions to the 2009 Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act. \n&#xa0;\nECC has a number of concerns about the implications of the Deregulation Bill for the status and standard of apprenticeships.\n&#xa0;\n The Bill states that changes \nto the provisions on Apprenticeships are in line with the Richard Review recommendations.\n&#xa0;\n It is not obvious, however, that the changes proposed support this assertion.\n&#xa0;\nThe Bill removes safeguards in the accreditation of apprenticeship qualifications; in doing so, potentially risking their value to employers and individuals.\n&#xa0;\n \nThese revisions risk undermining the status and standard of apprenticeships called for by the Richard Review.\n&#xa0;\n Of particular concern is the notion of an \nalternative English apprenticeship\n, where the revisions would allow the Secretary of State to grant an apprenticeship where an individual was not working for another person/company and not for reward/payment.\n&#xa0;\n (Section A1 (4) &amp; (5) (a) &amp; (b)).\n&#xa0;\n The removal of the Apprenticeship Agreement – a contract between an employer and an apprentice also gives grounds for concern (Section 32).\n&#xa0;\n Checks and balances that ensure quality currently, namely SASE compliance, will be stripped out of the English arrangements for apprenticeships.\n&#xa0;\n These safeguards remain in the Welsh (&amp; Scottish) apprenticeships architecture.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nThe Richard Review sought to improve the status and standards of apprenticeships.\n&#xa0;\n Whilst wishing to see them be more flexible to react to local employer need, his intention was not to reduce apprenticeships to “\na nebulous catch all term that embraces a range of formal and informal learning experiences, opportunities and attainments.”\n&#xa0;\n \nThe Deregulation Bill strips out too many of the safeguards that prevent apprenticeships from falling into this trap, leaving decision making on standards to the Secretary of State rather than industry and educationalists.\n&#xa0;\n It not only could run counter to the aims of the Richard Review, but also the Wolf Review, which sought to introduce greater academic rigour to vocational education.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIf not handled carefully the proposals in the Deregulation Bill could undermine local efforts to see vocational education viewed as an equal to the academic route and damage the apprenticeship brand in the eyes of business.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nEducation&#xa0;If the proposals contained in the Deregulation Bill become law it will mean that from September 2015 those remaining local authority maintained schools will have the autonomy to set their own school term dates. They will still be required to be open for a minimum of 190 days per year. This is a power that the many Academies and church schools across Essex already have. \nSchools are well placed to make decisions impacting on pupils and their families, however, the impact on home to school transport, sustainable travel plans and also the potential reduction on the window \nwithin which highways works can be carried out with minimal impact on the highway network will need to be taken in to account.\n&#xa0;\nWe are confident that as and when these changes come into force, that Essex schools will work together to exercise their new freedoms with the best interest of pupils and their families at heart. The local authority will be able to provide advice to schools as and when this is needed.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTransport&#xa0;The Draft Bill proposes a number of\n changes to existing legislation particularly with regard to Secretary of State \napproval\n for road humps; permit schemes and restrictions for contractors; pedestrian crossings; and public rights of way.\n&#xa0;\nWe support these changes.\n&#xa0;Waste &#xa0;The Draft Bill proposes the repeal of the criminal offence contained within\n&#xa0;\nthe Environmental Protection Act 1990 which relates to failure to comply with a requirement relating to the presentation of household waste for collection.\n&#xa0;\n This power was only ever available to District and Borough Councils in their capacity as Waste Collection Authorities (WCAs) and therefore has no direct impact on ECC in its capacity as the Waste Disposal Authority (WDA).\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nAlthough rarely used, the decriminalisation does remove a\n&#xa0;\nuseful and simple tool available to WCAs to tackle persistent offenders whose actions can lead to recycling collection being contaminated and \nlandfilled\n – thus increasing costs to local authorities/tax payers.\n&#xa0;\n Although the new clause does provide WCAs powers to issue a fixed penalty for non-compliance, enforceable as a civil debt, there is a stricter nuisance test relating to this and a lengthy process in terms of written warnings to limit its use.\n&#xa0;\n The key concern is whether removing the underpinning criminal offence and replacement with a civil offence will leave councils without an appropriate recourse in cases of severe and repeated abuse.\n&#xa0;\n In addition it is imperative that there is clarity around what constitutes a nuisance as stated in the draft regulations and further guidance should be provided to ensure the act is consistently applied.\n&#xa0;\n The scope of nuisance should cover nuisance in relation to the effectiveness (operationally and financially) of the waste recycling services provided and not just be limited to nuisance in respect of the impact on the local environment i.e. bins being left out.\n&#xa0;\nThe Draft Bill also proposes the removal of the power to establish joint waste authorities in England. We do not believe that that\n will have any impact on ECC or the wider Essex Waste Partnership on the basis that the benefits of greater integration which would be delivered through a Statutory Joint Waste Authority can be delivered through other means, both informal and contractual.\n&#xa0;\n Greater joint working including the amalgamation of service delivery in relation to waste has been adopted by other two tier authorities without the need for a statutory Joint Waste Authority being established.\n&#xa0;\n There is therefore no reason to assume the statutory powers provide for any greater opportunities than what can be delivered through other means.\n&#xa0;\nThe Environment&#xa0;We welcome the changes proposed in the Draft Bill to the Air Quality within the Environment Act 1995. \nThe amendments will not remove the requirement for Local Authorities (LA) to review the air quality and likely future air quality of an area as set out under Section 82 of the 1995.  Nonetheless the removal of the duty of LAs (Section 84, subsection 1) to conduct further assessments will reduce the burden and resources \nrequired by LAs (especially if it’s in addition to information LAs already have) - therefore, allowing local action plans to be implemented and possibly achieving results more quickly. \n&#xa0;\nAs a result there are no objections to the further amendments to the act as proposed to Sections: 842b, 86(2\n)(\nb), \n91(1) and Schedule 11, in paragraphs 1(1)(b) and 4(2)(b).\n&#xa0;\nWith regard to the Climate Change &amp; Sustainable Energy Act 2006, only one energy measures report was published in 2007 with no plans for any more, therefore making the recommendations within the report out dated and either no longer relevant or appropriate for LAs to take into consideration as originally set out in Section 3 of the Act when excising their functions. Therefore we agree that Section 81 (3) of the Climate Change Act 2008 will no longer be required.\nAnd finally…the Aarhus ConventionS47 repeals section 3A of the Local Government Act 1999 - removing the general duty to involve local representatives in the\n exercise of any function, where they consider it is appropriate to do so.  However the Aarhus Convention establishes the right, imposed under European law, for the public to participate in environmental decision-making, including a requirement for arrangements to be made by public authorities to enable the public to comment on environmental decision making. Environmental information is very widely defined.  Care should be taken to ensure this provision is not in conflict with the Convention.\nSeptember 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
