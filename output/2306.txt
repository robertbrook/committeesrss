[[[David Bancroft – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;I am a member of 2 rambling clubs and walk every Sunday in any one of 5 national parks accessible from Manchester on day trips.&#xa0;When I encounter much mud and water in deep ruts and tranches created by motorbikes and 4x4 vehicles I think something must be done to stop irreparable damage.  Surely National Parks are not intended to accommodate convoys of 4x4s and motorbikes.&#xa0;My purpose in writing this letter is to support formal submissions made by:-1. YDGLA (Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance)2. PDGLA (Peak District Green Lanes Alliance)3. GLEAM (Green Lanes Environmental Action Group)4. GLPG (Green Lanes Protection Group)&#xa0;Please give their submissions your favourable consideration.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
