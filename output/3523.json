From the perspective of Washington the UK and EU are increasingly bound together and should remain so for the health and relevance of the transatlantic relationship.\n Nor will the USA appreciate being drawn in to play the part of some form of common friend acting as a councillor \ntrying to limit the damage, not least to its own relations with its European allies, from a UK-EU divorce.\n \n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.swp-berlin.org/en/publications/swp-research-papers/swp-research-paper-detail/article/europe_without_britain.html\n"
