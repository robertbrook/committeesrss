defaultI am writing in response to your invitation for submissions from interested parties on the 
defaultabove.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have been in electri
defaultcal contracting, including 
defaultdomestic wo
defaultrk, for the la
defaultst 
default3
default5 years, 
defaultand have for the last three years run a Training Centre, training apprentices, career-change students and qualified electricians looking to further their knowledge

default&#xa0;
defaultIt is my belief that;
default&#xa0;
defaultPerson scheme and the requirements regarding domestic electrical work
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe public are generally defaultstill not aware, or are confused and even misled about the Competent Person scheme and the requirements regarding domestic electrical work.default&#xa0;
defaultI have over recent years often been asked by friends, relatives etc my opinion of electrical work that they have had
default completed
default by electricians or builders, kitchen fitters and similar trades. Unfortunately, in most cases, they have not heard of or been informed about the Competent Person Scheme. Some have been under the impression that they ‘have to use an NICEIC firm’ 
defaultbut the e
defaultm
defaultphasis is usually on the fact that they must be 
defaultNICEIC and Part P Qualified
default 
default and not that there are requirements to be met under the Building Regulations.
default&#xa0;
defaultI believe this is mainly due to the ‘thrust’ of the marketing and advertising which is usually all about which body the electrician should belong to, NICEIC, ECA, NAPIT, rather than the requirements of the Building Regs, and the responsibilities of the per
defaultson ordering the work as well as the person carrying out the work. 
default&#xa0;defaultThose carrying out work are still often untrained and even working dangerouslydefaultIt is still the case that there is insufficient control over who can operate as an electrician. Doctors have 
default    to be properly trained and registered, as do nurses, teachers, and a host of other professions. This is just as it should be, these people have our lives, or our children’s welfare in their hands. Yet anyone can enter a persons house or place of work, 
defaultalter their electrical installation, leave it dangerous or even lethal, and even get paid for doing it! They need no qualifications and no training, just a rough idea of how to make it work, and no idea of how to make it safe. The recent changes to the Bui
defaultlding Regs, which mean that a third party can sign off someone else’s work make it even easier for unqualified persons to operate. Furthermore, the accreditation bodies do not prevent this.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have had students recently who were completing their Level 3 Cit
defaulty &amp; Guilds 2330 qualification, 
default 
defaultwho enquired with the NICEIC about joining as Domestic Installers. When they asked about qualifications, they were told that they were already overqualified as all they needed was the 17
defaultth
default Edition qualification (2382-12). Th
defaultis rush to get people qualified or registered is really just about taking their money.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is ‘plastered’ all over the internet opportunities for people to ‘train as an electrician in five weeks’. 
default 
defaultCourses that include the 17
defaultth
default Edition, Inspection &amp; Test
defaulting, Building Regs, as WELL as teaching the basic electrical priciples and practices – in FIVE WEEKS! 
default&#xa0;
defaultSorry but this just cannot be done to a satisfactory standard. Consider also, why do we have the term ‘domestic installer’ rather than electrician? Are w
defaulte saying that levels of competency can be lower for those working in domestic environments than for those carrying out commercial and industrial work.   So, I take it, that it is OK to kill or injure people in their own homes, or cause fires etc, as long a
defaults it doesn’t happen to them at work? 
default&#xa0;
defaultThree weeks ago I visited a distressed friend, who had commissioned a ‘builder’ to carry out renovations  and install a new kitchen at her house. She was concerned about the electrical work. When I looked at it    I fo
defaultund that all the sockets in the kitchen, which were hanging down off the wall were ‘live’. They had been left in this condition for two weeks, waiting for the ‘electrician’ to return.
default She has two children in the house. The lighting circuit contained seven 
defaultjoints, at just one switch-drop, which the builder was going to just plaster into the wall. There was a taped up joint behind the washing machine, where a cable had been extended. One of the sockets had a circuit protective conductor just hanging loose, he
defaultnce there was no ‘earth’ on the socket. All the metal boxes behind the sockets had been installed without grommets to protect the cable. Live cables were hanging down from the ceiling where a wall had been partially demolished. A toilet and a sink had been
default installed in the cupboard where the fuseboard was fixed. The sink was literally two inches away from the fuseboard. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile I was there the builder turned up, so I challenged him about the work. It transpired that he does all his own electrical work. I men
defaulttioned the Building Regs. and the requirements of Part P and he was none the wiser. He was not an electrician, was not a competent person, had not notified Building Control, and had no idea of inspection and testing. 
defaultThis is not an unusual case, I have com
defaulte across this type of situation far too often. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDue to the dangerous state of the system, I returned the following day and made everything safe, but how many other substandard installations are going unnoticed?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe other issue here is that due to recent changes, most of this work would NOT be notifiable, he had not installed any new circuits, just wrecked the existing ones! 
default&#xa0;
defaultMost non-
defaultnotifiable
default work does not get tested or certified, despite the existence of the M
defaultinor Works Certificate, as the vast majority of those carrying out these works are unqualified and are not experienced in inspection and testing. By removing the category of ‘non-notifiable minor work’, the confusion over what is and is not notifiable will
default be removed. 
defaultOnly qualified electricians will be able to work on electrical systems, and all work will get inspected, tested and certified properly, and be effectively documented for future information.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe review mechanism is skeweddefault.defaultThe practice of 
default‘yearly reviews’ and visits
default is insufficient in my view. I cannot help but feel it is more for the  benefit of the accreditation bodies as it gives them additional income, rather than an effective review of the operation of the installation firm etc. Most f
defaultirms that I know select jobs that they can ‘show’ to the inspecting engineer, and I have even known people to show someone else’s work, just produce the paperwork to evidence it as their own. 
default&#xa0;defaultThere is widespread confusion about what is required, Part P,default qualifications etc.default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultHow many times do we see ‘Part P qualified’ or ‘Part P approved’ written into marketing literature and on the side of vans, yet those of us that are properly i
defaultnformed know that the successful completion of a Part P course DOES NOT make someone a competent enterprise
default, or
default a qualified electrician!
default 
defaultUnfortunately, the g
defaulteneral public do not know this.
default 
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe numbe
defaultr of ‘Part P’ courses
default that have no real value is also a
default problem. For example, when Part P was introduced, I ‘filled in’ for a 
defaultsick colleague
default, and 
defaultdelivered several lessons of
default a Part P course at 
defaulta local F.E. College
default. During a discussion with the class, it was apparent that they believed they were gaining a qual
defaultification which enabled them to 
default‘
defaultself 
defaultcertify
default’ their own work. I had to inform them that only the approving bodies could 
defaultaward
default them
default ‘competent enterprise status’
default, and that the course, that they had paid £600 fo
defaultr, was informative only so
default they would also have to pay to be assessed by one of the approving bodies. Needless to say, they were not best pleased at the news, but thanked me for clearing things up for them.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis type of confusion is still rife within the industry, and clear, non-b
defaultiased information  is required to ensure that everyone knows exactly what is required. 
defaultRemember also that there is 
defaulta constant influx of new apprentices and other trainees into the industry, they all deserve to receive the correct information right from the
default beginning of their training.
default&#xa0;
defaultSo how do we define a qualified electrician, and at what stage do we look at someone and say, yes, you are qualified, I would trust you to undertake my electrical work?
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe EAWR 1989 and BS7671:2011 both state that persons un
defaultdertaking electrical work should be competent enough to avoid danger. Neither uses the term ‘qualified’. So what do we mean by the term? Taking two definitions from different sources, the term qualified is defined as;
default&#xa0;
defaulta/. 
defaultmeeting the proper standards and r
defaultequirements and training for an office or position or task;
defaultb/. quality or skill needed for a particular activity, 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Wiring Regulations (BS7671:2011) defines a competent person as someone who;
default&#xa0;
defaultPossesses sufficient technical knowledge, relevant 
defaultpractical skills and experience for the nature of the electrical work undertaken and is able at all times to prevent danger and, where appropriate, injury to him/herself and others.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe National Occupational Standards detail the knowledge and skills requir
defaultements for persons involved in electrical  installation work, so why do we allow people who have clearly not attained these standards to carry out electrical work? 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs someone involved both in installation and in training, I have a pretty clear idea of th
defaulte standard of tradesperson I would all
defaultow to work in my house. They must know how to plan and design the installation before they start, and have taken into account the safety of myself and my family. They must possess the knowledge and understanding of ele
defaultctrical systems, to enable them to deal with any issues arising from the alteration of my installation. They must know how to inspect and test the installed installation correctly and safely
default, and be able to provide me with the proper documentation. They mu
defaultst be aware of how the installation process may affect the structure and characteristics of my home, (sound travel, fire safety, ventilation etc). They must work diligently and prevent any damage to mine or my neighbours home or the environment, and provid
defaulte me with a guarantee of their workmanship and materials. So what do I ask them for when they come to tender for the work?
default&#xa0;
defaultDo I ask to see their qualifications, and if so, which ones, and 
defaultdo qualifications on their own prove competence? 
defaultHow much experience
default do they have, or are they fresh out of college? Membership to any of the ‘approving bodies’ does not impress me either, as I have experienced many times situations where ‘members’ do not have a full understanding of what they are attempting to install.
default&#xa0;
defaultHaving studied the National Occupational Standards, I am amazed that they seem to be ‘ignored’ so blatantly by some of the ‘agencies’ that should be helping to maintain the 
defaultstandards. These NOS’s are already written, and provi
defaultde good criteria of
default what we sh
defaultould be looking for in an electrician. I would suggest that if more attention was paid to keeping to these standards, and incorporating them in any future developments in the training, assessment and qualification of electricians, the home would be a safer
default place.
default&#xa0;
defaultSo is there any existing system that sets a sensible benchmark for electrical qualifications, experience and knowledge, as well as checking health and safety awareness? Well, yes there is. Currently the J.I.B. operate a system that recognises qual
defaultifications, job experience and knowledge
default,
default and grades applicants accordingly. In conjunction with the E.C.A. they administer the E.C.S. card system.(Electrotechnical Certification Scheme). 
default&#xa0;
defaultBriefly, the ECS card is the ‘electrical equivalent’ of the CSCS ca
defaultrd 
defaultthat is 
defaultoperated on most construction sites, where possession of a card is required for all personnel to gain access to work on site.
default 
defaultThe CSCS card is awarded following successful completion of a Health &amp; safety test. The ECS card, which should be a req
defaultuirement for all persons carrying out electrical installation, requires two things;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe successful completion of a health &amp; safety exam (a different one to the CSCS card recognising   the additional hazards of electricity).
default&#xa0;
defaultApplication and award of a JIB g
defaultrade based on qualifications, experience and knowledge.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn successful achievement an applicant is provided with the ECS card which details their grading as  assessed by JIB and their details, which can then be shown to potential customers. This provides th
defaulte customer with proof of identification and 
defaultgives them a guide as to the competency of the person tendering for the work. The cost of the JIB application, grading and exam
default 
defaultis £78 in total, which is in my opinion very good value for a system which checks an
defaultd assesses your qualifications and experience, your health and safety knowledge and awareness and provides an identification card for you to show 
defaultto 
defaultcustomers. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI understand that the JIB set wage rates that are currently above some of the cheaper ‘outsi
defaultde’ labour rates, and hence 
defaultsome 
defaultfirms are looking to move away from them, in order to utilise this cheaper labour and cut costs. In the current economic climate obviously 
defaultfirms are looking at all possibilities when it comes to cutting their costs to remai
defaultn competitive. However, we must ensure that this does not also involve cutting the skills and knowledge levels of the workforce. Surely it is worth paying a little more for competent, skilled operatives, after all we would not accept imported cable just be
defaultcause it is cheaper, 
defaultunlessdefault defaultit was up to standard. The JIB/ECA 
defaultadministered 
defaultECS card scheme is the one scheme that 
defaultis currently
default capable of grading all operatives with at least some level of accuracy. 
defaultWe might not always be happy with the grade they set, BUT at least they have standards, and if someone wants to progress up through the levels they can, with training and experience. 
defaultI suggest this system is adopted because I do not believe in re-inventing
default the wheel, (although that is another option) b
defaultut I am 
defaultalso 
defaultsuggesting that we go one step further, and develop the scheme i
defaultnto a license to practice, 
defaultas exists in many other countries.
default&#xa0;
defaultElectricians, electrical contractors, electrical installers andefaultd electrical engineers should be licenseddefault.defaultThe average person would not know how to assess the competence of anyone trading as an electrician, just like 
defaultwith 
defaulta Doctor or a Dentist, they would rely on ‘the authorities’
default to identify and assess those plying th
defaulteir trade accordingly. I do not have a clue about medical issues, so when I visit the Doctor I am totally reliant upon 
defaulther judgement. She could prescribe
default 
defaultweed killer as a tonic, and I would never know, well, not until I was having my stomach pumped anyway!
default The trouble is that, with electrical work, even incompetent persons can get 
defaultlights and sockets to work, but are they safe?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe development of a ‘license’ is a must for this industry. We can play around with ‘competent person’ and ‘competent enterpr
defaultise’ sc
defaulthemes forever
default, but it will not prevent unqualified, unskilled or incompetent persons from having a go at ‘installing some electrics’.
default&#xa0;
defaultA license 
defaultof ‘electrician’ grade 
defaultshould be a requirement for buying electrical installation equipment (cables, 
defaultcontainment, distribution boards, circuit breakers, socket outlets, switches etc), just like having a fire-arms license, and let’s face it, electricity can be just as deadly as a gun in the wrong hands.
default&#xa0;
defaultOnly licensed operatives should be allowed on any site, 
defaultmost of the large
default contractors alread
defaulty operate this way so it will
default be a case of widening the current system and making it a requirement on ALL sites. The current ‘competent person/enterprise’ scheme ne
defaulteds adjusting, so that ONLY licensed operatives can apply, and that all staff working for ‘an enterprise’ should be registered and licensed.
default The criteria 
default for membership to the approving bodies (NICEIC, ECA, NAPIT etc) should be standardised if they are to
default continue ‘approving’, 
defaultso that there is a minimum standard across the board, 
defaultand the grade awarded on the individual license should be taken into account.
default Either that or separate the membership process from the ‘approv
defaultal
default’ process, and standardise the ‘appr
defaultov
defaultal
default’ process! 
defaultThe term ‘domestic installer’  should be dropped, either you are an electrician, or you are not!
default&#xa0;
defaultClarity of all requirements for all grading should be made available to the industry and the public, so everyone knows where they stand, and can
default choose accordingly. Then, when I next knock on somebody’s  door
default, I can show them my license 
defaultdisplaying my grade, and they will know
default who I am and whether I can do their job.
