[normal]Third party interventions[bold]… In recent years the House has frequently been assisted by the submissions of statutory bodies and non-governmenta
[normal]l organisations on questions of general public importance. Leave is given to such bodies to intervene and make submissions, usually in writing but sometimes orally from the bar, in the expectation that their fund of knowledge or particular point of view wi
[normal]ll enable them to provide the House with a more rounded picture than it would otherwise obtain. The House is grateful to such bodies for their help.
[normal]Recognising this, the Supreme 
[normal]Court
[normal] will not ordinarily make costs orders against 
[normal]third
[normal] parties
[normal].

[normal]Once a matter is in court, the more important the subject, the more difficult the issues, the more help we need to try and get the right answer. ... No particular formality is required and t
[normal]he invitation is a very open one, but not I think abused.
[normal]Commenting that ‘provided they stick to the rules, interventions are enormously helpful’, she noted specifically that ‘[o]
[normal]ne
[normal] thing that interveners can do, which the parties may find it more diffic
[normal]ult and more costly to do, is to draw our attention to international jurisprudence which may be relevant to the issue’.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Public Sector Equality Duty[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Impact Assessment[bold]Ensuring that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in all actions concerning children (art. 3(1)), and t
[normal]hat all the provisions of the Convention are respected in legislation and policy development and delivery at all levels of government demands a continuous process of child impact assessment (predicting the impact of any proposed law, policy or budgetary al
[normal]location which affects children and the enjoyment of their rights) and child impact evaluation (evaluating the actual impact of implementation). This process needs to be built into government at all levels and as early as possible in the development of pol
[normal]icy.
