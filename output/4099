defaultThird party interventionsdefault… In recent years the House has frequently been assisted by the submissions of statutory bodies and non-governmenta
defaultl organisations on questions of general public importance. Leave is given to such bodies to intervene and make submissions, usually in writing but sometimes orally from the bar, in the expectation that their fund of knowledge or particular point of view wi
defaultll enable them to provide the House with a more rounded picture than it would otherwise obtain. The House is grateful to such bodies for their help.

defaulthe invitation is a very open one, but not I think abused.
defaultCommenting that ‘provided they stick to the rules, interventions are enormously helpful’, she noted specifically that ‘[o]
defaultne
default thing that interveners can do, which the parties may find it more diffic
defaultult and more costly to do, is to draw our attention to international jurisprudence which may be relevant to the issue’.
