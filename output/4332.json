"&#xa0;\n              \n              \nAdditional follow up written evidence from Public Health England (PHE0022)Information requested from Public Health England&#xa0;I am writing to provide the further information I promised the Committee during the oral ev\nidence session on 19 November.  \nI undertook to provide further information in \nrelation to:\n&#xa0;\nThe Committee also expressed an interest in hearing from me on PHE’s views\n on NHS England’s proposals in relat\nion to NHS allocations policy.  \nI will write separately on this issue following the discussions we have scheduled with NHS England in the next few days.\n&#xa0;\nPHE’s Knowledge and Intelligence Service&#xa0;On 1 April 2013 the regi\nonal Public Health Observatories (PHOs) transferred along with the specialist observatories and the National Cancer Intelligence Network into PHE as a single Knowledge and Intelligence service for England.\n&#xa0;\nThe historical role of the PHOs remains fundament\nally unchanged and is now carried out by PHE’s eight Knowledge and Intelligence Teams.  We are building on the highly regarded work of our predecessor organisations to ensure we have a knowledge service to ensure decisions we make about health are based on\n the best information and evidence available and allow us to secure the best possible\n outcome.\n&#xa0;\nPHE continues to produce a range of interactive resources, reports and profiling tools to help local government and the health service understand health need, make comparisons with other areas and make informed \nd\necisions.  A flavour of our work is given by\n the brief description of some of our key products set out in Annex A.\n&#xa0;\nAll of our resources remain accessible on-line through PHE’s website: (\nwww.gov\n.\nuk/\nP\nHE\n) and our data and knowledge portal (\nwww.datagat\ne\nway.phe.org.uk\n) which allows access to resources across the 140 legacy sites that previously supported the full range of our products.  All legacy sites will be migrated to a new single site.  We are currently working \nwith our users to identify their needs and with the Government Digital Service on the design of the new site. \n&#xa0;\nPHE will work closely with \nt\nhe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to ensure access to high quality public health evidence\n and advice.  NICE is responsible for setting quality standards for health, social care and public health. PHE will ensure full integration of evidence resources from the NICE evidence service into t\nhe PHE Knowledge service.  Our K\nnowledge service will als\no include evidence and guidance from other sources such as the National Screening Committee and \nthe \nJoint Committee on Vaccination and immunisation.\n&#xa0;If any members of the Committee have any queries about the Knowledge and Intelligence Service, our \nproducts, or information needs\n,\n please contact our Chief Knowledge Officer, Professor John Newton (\njohn.newton@phe.gov.uk\n) who would be delighted to help.\n&#xa0;The Evidence on the impact of Minimum Unit Pricing&#xa0;Th\nere is strong evidence\n to support alcohol Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) as an effective strategy to reduce alcohol consumption and alcohol related harms.  The largest impacts would be experienced by hazardous drinkers with somewhat smaller impacts on moderate\n drinkers.\n&#xa0;\nThe latest modelling work by the experts at the University of Sheffield, published in July this year, looks at the impact on consumption and alcohol related harms of a minimum unit price of 40p, 45p and 50p.  Their key findings are set out in t\nhe table below, and their full report can be found at \n(he\nr\ne)\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nImpact of a 40p, 45p, and 50p alcohol minimum unit price (source: University of Sheffield)&#xa0;&#xa0;40p45p50pDrop

experience of the provinces of Canada is most similar to the form of MUP under consideration in the UK and we would be happy to provide further briefing to the Committee if this would be helpful. \n&#xa0;PHE’s review of the health impacts of shale gas extraction&#xa0;In relation to our discussion on the health impact of shale gas extraction there were three points the Committee wanted me to comment further on.\n&#xa0;\nThe first was the request to see the evidence that we co\nnsidered as part of our review.  \nThe full list of references is set out at Annex B. \n \nWe used the best available international information about the process of shale gas extraction to estimate the likely emissions from shale gas extraction, as operated in t\nhe context of the UK regulatory environment, and evaluate any health risks associated with those emissions.  Although shale gas extraction is itself a relatively new process, the substances involved in any emissions, and many of the industrial processes ar\ne not new and their\n risks are well characterised.  \nFor that reason we were able to draw firm conclusions about risk in relation to chemical and radiological emissions, albeit with some caveats.\n&#xa0;\nThe Committee expressed concerns over the nature of some of t\nhe chemicals that may be used in shale gas extraction.  The UK will adopt a risk-based approach to the use of chemicals, and will assess the requirements for each development proposal on a site-by-site basis.  Any chemicals proposed for use in shale gas ex\ntraction fluid need not only to be publically disclosed, but will also be risk assessed prior to use by the Environment Agency, with subsequent peer review by the joint agencies groundwater directive advisory group (which includes PHE).\n&#xa0;\nI would also like \nto provide further information on the origin and governance of the report. \n \nOur predecessor, the Health Protection Agency (HPA), initiated the review in early 2012 in response to requests for advice on the potential health impacts of shale gas extraction f\nrom a wide range of stakeholders including Local Authorities, \nDirectors of Public Health, NHS bodies and members of the public.  The HPA proposal for a review, and its proposed scope, was endorsed by a range of UK public health bodie\ns and environmental reg\nulators.  \nOn \n \n1 April 2013 PHE took on the functions of the HPA.  PHE agreed the review should continue, and that PHE would publish the results.  Any other decision would have called into question the ability of our scientists to contribute to publi\nc debate on the basis of the evidence.\n&#xa0;\nWe consider the findings of our review to be valid and robust within the scope of the draft report, and note that they are consistent with the conclusions reached in a recent Royal Society report into hydraulic fract\nuring (see link \nhttp://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/shal\ne\n-gas-extracti\no\nn/report\n).\n&#xa0;\nPHE Workforce&#xa0;\nThe committee requested additional information on the detaile\nd breakdo\nwn of PHE’s workforce.  \nThese are set out in Annexes C &amp; D. \nWe employ a wide range of scientific, technical, professional and medical staff, on an equal\nly diverse range of activities.  \nThese range from specialised roles in reference laboratories, high \ncontainment facilities, pathology testing for the NHS and vaccine production to the delivery of screening programmes and public health support to\n Local Authorities and the NHS.  \nWe would be happy to provide further details of our activities and their impac\nt. \nI hope this further informati\non is of help to the committee.  \nWe stand ready to provide any further material you may find helpful.  I would like to thank the Committee for the opportunity to talk to you about what PHE does, and look forward to continui\nng our conversation.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\nAnnex A&#xa0;Public Health England Knowledge and Intelligence Service: Key products &#xa0;This annex sets out some of our key data and analysis tools.  All are available through the \nPHE data and knowledge gateway. \n&#xa0;\nOur tools and resources cover a broad range of public health areas, including:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe have a range of products that allow users to understand the health of their local populations and how health varies across the country. \n \nThese include:\n&#xa0;Our stakeholders are asking for products tha\nt can help them make the business case for investing in prevention and public health interventions, and can help them demonstrate effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the work that they are undertaking or proposing. \n \nExamples include: \n&#xa0;\nHealth intelligence networks &#xa0;\nThe heath in\ntelligence networks will provide wide-ranging, authoritative data, evidence and practice.  They will underpin improvement programmes for care quality and outcomes in line with national objectives.  There are five networks in development - \ncancer, cardiovascular disease, mental health, child and maternal health, and\n end of life care. \n \nHealth intelligence \nnetworks bring together many expert stakeholders and partners, including patient representatives and members of the public, to drive improvements in health and care in specific health areas.\n&#xa0;\nAnnex BEvidence sources for the PHE Review of the potential public health impacts of shale gas extractionThis annex sets out the evidence considered in the development of the PHE Review.  The first section sets out the evidence available before December 2012 which received detailed consideration i\nn the production of the
