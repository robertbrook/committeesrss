"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nIan Barker\n (CYS0045)\n&#xa0;\nDear \nSelect Committee,\nI'm speaking as a motorist, cyclist and pedestrian and believe there is enough space for all on the roads.\nBut, there needs to be a change of Attitude and Care\n, by some road users\n.\n&#xa0;\nThis\n proposal for a tightening of \npenalties,\n should make our roads safer at no cost:-\n&#xa0;\nConsider the case where a Pedestrian or Cyclist is obeying the \nlaw\n and is injured or killed by a motorist.\nAs a starting point, that motorist \nshall\n automatically lose their\n driving licence for the period that the victim is disabled.\nSo\n,\n if the pedestrian or cyclist is disabled for a year the motorist will lose their licence for a year.\n \nIf the victim is killed the driver will never drive again.\nThis is a starting penalty; the\nre may need to be bigger penalties.\n&#xa0;\nAnd remember, I AM A MOTORIST\n&#xa0;\n but\n it is the motorist who has the lethal machine.\n&#xa0;\nAlso if a pedestrian is killed or injured by a cyclist, the cyclist will be banned from cycling for the period.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
