[normal]Written evidence from [bold]Jane Green BA Hons Economics and Admin[bold]1. I am an independent economist and researcher and have made a particular study of incinerator PFIs. I campaign for Zero Waste and am a West Midlands ‘Green Leader’. In the past year I have spoken at the Zero Waste International Alliance C
[normal]onference in San Francisco and to the European Parliament in Brussels in support of a petition concerning lack of community ‘Access to Justice’ in regard to waste infrastructure.  
[normal]2. Summary Points
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The drive to build municipal waste incinerators began abo
[normal]ut 15 years ago following the introduction of the Landfill tax which aimed to drive waste away from landfill which releases climate-changing methane gas. The amount of diversion from landfill thought possible 
[normal]by 
[normal]recycling was just 25%.
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Since then recycling
[normal] has reached 42% in England and 52% in Wales with a welsh target of 70% by 2025. The waste hierarchy which prioritises prevention, re-use, recycling and composting, over landfill and incineration, became a legal requirement in England and Wales in 2011. 
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]N
[normal]early all local authority incinerators have been built using PFI/PPP and because of the extremely high costs, often totalling around £1 billion each, the Government has been distributing 
[normal]£3.5
[normal] billion in PFI credits to around 
[normal]28
[normal] projects as subsidies.
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Howev
[normal]er the need for councils to build their own incinerator no longer exists as there is not only an overcapacity of UK ‘residual’ waste treatment predicted for 2015 but there is now a highly competitive waste market for all waste treatment including ‘end of p
[normal]ipe’ processes such as incineration at far lower gate fees.
[normal]e)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The risks to council budgets of 25-30 year incinerator contracts has risen dramatically as it is the council who takes the risk of increases in recycling or future Environmental Legislation leadin
[normal]g to unpaid or underpaid spare capacity.
[normal]f)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Both DEFRA and the Treasury have a major involvement in a council’s decision to choose incineration and both have their own measures of Value for Money which are not in line with those of VfM for individual local au
[normal]thority Business Cases. The Treasury is prioritising large infrastructure projects to achieve 
[normal]national
[normal] economic growth.  DEFRA is agreeing 
[normal]local
[normal] VfM based on 
[normal]national
[normal] targets limited to only 2020 and has not attempted to cost the risk of foreseeable enviro
[normal]nmental legislation
[normal] or
[normal] recycling rates exceeding 50%
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]g)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] The NAO have now begun an investigation into DEFRA’s VfM guidance to councils with regard to incinerator procurement but this may be too late for those councils who are presently signing up to 25-30 y
[normal]ear contracts which involve unnecessary extra £millions from council budgets. 
[normal]h)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I believe it is vital that the DCLG step in now t
[normal]o call for a moratorium for incinerator
[normal] projects 
[normal]which have yet to have contracts 
[normal]signed
[normal]. This would
[normal] 
[normal]allow time to 
[normal]determine goo
[normal]d value for 
[normal]money and whether the economic and environmental objectives of local authorities are being met. 
[normal]Background
[normal]This paper will argue that local authority incinerator contracts are being signed without due diligence in relation to whether they are
[normal] (a) affordable; (b) represent value for money; and (c) 
[normal]will 
[normal]not burden the Councils with unpredictable costs in the future. 
[normal]I
[normal]n particular 
[normal]it considers the assessment and m
[normal]anagement of risk and argues that this
[normal] is inadequate for 
[normal]project
[normal]s
[normal] wi
[normal]th a lifespan of
[normal] 25-30 years which
[normal] could therefore put future Council finances at risk.
[normal]Incinerator project
[normal]s
[normal] should be able to prove that they can
[normal] deliver a commercial benefit to the Councils 
[normal]over their
[normal] 25 
[normal]– 30 
[normal]year economic life
[normal] despite
[normal] 
[normal]c
[normal]hallenges 
[normal]to 
[normal]their 
[normal]business viabi
[normal]lity 
[normal]from
[normal] an increasingly competitive waste market, increased recycling and foreseeable legislation which would restrict the types of waste which can be burnt. 
[normal]For a[bold] [bold]c[bold]ouncil a rigid long term incinerator contract represents risks which could be mitigated [bold]by a more flexible modular system and by accessing the ch[bold]eaper waste market. For the private consortium (Private Partner)[bold] the contract represents an opportunity to ensure a high guaranteed income for [bold]2[bold]5[bold]-30[bold] years[bold],[bold] whilst not having to face competition from [bold]an increasingly competitive waste market. [bold]Financial Parameters
[normal]1. 
[normal]Affordability
[normal] 
[normal]Councils 
[normal]should be
[normal] satisfied that the additional cost of the 
[normal]incinerator contract is
[normal] affordable
[normal] [bold]in relation to:
[normal]1. a)
[normal] 
[normal]Council Budgets
[normal] The es
[normal]timated increase in costs for an
[normal] incinerator above the existing waste budget, the ‘affordability gap’, will
[normal] usually
[normal] begin at 
[normal]around 
[normal]£6 million p
[normal]a
[normal]. The total costs of the incinerator 
[normal]are usually
[normal] around £1bn. 
[normal]A c
[normal]ouncil ha
[normal]s to state that the 
[normal]‘
[normal]likely increases in costs’
[normal] 
[normal]have been included 
[normal]in
[normal]to its MTFP. Given that most
[normal] MTFP
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]are only for 3-4 years 
[normal]this measure cannot mitigate risk for a 25 year project. The risk to Council finances has increased since the financial collapse, with reductions to council budgets making even medium term predictio
[normal]ns of ‘affordability’ problematic. The ring-fencing of waste contract payments will necessitate greater percentage cuts to other Council budgets.
[normal]Spare capacity and minimum tonnages
[normal]All potential new 
[normal]incinerators
[normal] 
[normal]are being 
[normal]built with 
[normal]excess 
[normal]capacity and t
[normal]o
[normal] maintain commercial viability
[normal] will need to sell this space at a price equivalent to the total cost per tonne, including finance and running costs of the plant, estimate
[normal]d to be around £130
[normal] per tonne. As 
[normal]c
[normal]ouncil
[normal]s
[normal] will be contracted to pay for 
[normal]agreed 
[normal]tonn
[normal]age
[normal]s for the 25 year period,
[normal] every tonne which is not used, or used for ‘substitute waste’ which needs Council subsidy, will effectively put up
[normal] the price per tonne to over £13
[normal]0.  This in effect acts as a ‘minimum tonnage’ imperative.
[normal]2. 
[normal]Opportunity Costs
[normal] 
[normal]Acc
[normal]essing the waste market
[normal]The Opportunity Costs of incineration have increased dramatically 
[normal]for 
[normal]council
[normal]s in the past several years and even for those whose procurement began 3-4 years ago. 
[normal]MSW can now be tendered on the competitive waste market far more cheaply (even for incineration or other ‘end of pipe’ solutions) and on shorter contracts than PPP new build. Best practice in waste management is also bringing the combined collection and di
[normal]sposal costs down when recyclables, including food waste, are collected separately and the waste treated ‘per stream’.  
[normal]There has been transparency in waste treatment costs for the past 6 years with the publication of WRAP’s annual Gate Fees Reports
[normal] whic
[normal]h ‘
[normal]presents a summary of gate fees for a range of waste treatment, recovery and disposal options. The indicative gate fees reported here are based on survey information from local authorities, MRF operators, compost facility operators, waste management com
[normal]panies (WMCs) and other market intelligence’.
[normal] The opportunity costs of not accessing the waste market are therefore now very clear with all treatments apart from landfill being considerably cheaper than incineration and in the case of recycling actually pa
[normal]ying councils. The information in these reports allows local authorities to make better informed decisions regarding waste ma
[normal]nagement options but there is little
[normal] evidence that the council
[normal]s use this information.
[normal] 
[normal]Overcapacity and falling gate fees
[normal]Adrian Ju
[normal]dge, now MD for Waste and Bioenergy at
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the UK Green Investment Bank, has warned against the risks of an oversupply of residual waste treatment capacity, ‘
[normal]To properly assess the risks associated with finding the ‘right’ sort of substitute waste at this scal
[normal]e requires a detailed understanding of the local C&amp;I waste market, and this comes at a time when funders have a lowered appetite for merchant risk’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Waste is now a commodity like any other and one for which there is increasing competition in the UK and a
[normal]t a European level; due in part to overcapacity of incineration
[normal] and increasing recycling. All incinerators in the West Midlands area have spare capacity and older incinerators like Coventry which have the historical advantage of established waste supplier
[normal]s are able to charge around half the price which new build incinerators charge to remain commercially viable.
[normal]DEFRA in their most recent ‘
[normal]Forecasting 2020 Waste Arisings and Treatment Capacity’
[normal] 
[normal]suggests that 
[normal]‘Spare capacity in EfW plants in Northern 
[normal]Europe may tempt some LAs to exploit the relatively low gate fees there through short- to medium-term contracts rather than enter into longer-term contracts for investment in new capacity in the UK’
[normal]2. (f) 
[normal]Opportunity Costs of 
[normal]not following 
[normal]Best Practice O
[normal]ptions
[normal]The
[normal] opportunity cost of not following Best Practice 
[normal]in 
[normal]waste management
[normal] 
[normal]could 
[normal]be avoided by 
[normal]the 
[normal]examination 
[normal]of best (and worst) practice across other Councils
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]DEFRA does not 
[normal]provide
[normal] fully costed case studies 
[normal]of best practice 
[normal]to enable
[normal] councils 
[normal]or
[normal] t
[normal]he public 
[normal]to
[normal] make comparisons. 
[normal]However
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]Eunomia Research 
[normal]r
[normal]ecently 
[normal]produced a Report for a Council 
[normal]procuring an 
[normal]incinerator
[normal]. It gives cost comparisons taking into account changing waste management systems and accessing the open waste market. Instead of a 
[normal]240,000 tonne incinerator, they estimate that
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]£10 million p
[normal]a
[normal] would be saved
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]by simply diverting recyclable materials out of the PFI contract and onto the open market. By getting out of the contract altogether
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]£20 million per year could
[normal] be saved.
[normal]A
[normal] Wychaven
[normal] District Report ‘
[normal]Value for Money. Waste service comparisons’ 
[normal] researched a comparable group of authorities and found that half of the authorities with high levels of recycling, including separate food waste collections, actually pay 
[normal]less for their waste s
[normal]ervices
[normal]. They compare Wychaven at 44% recycling with South Oxfordshire at 65% but who pay 10% less on collections. 
[normal]The Audit Commission’s document ‘Well Disposed’
[normal] recommends that councils, ‘
[normal]Work in partnership with WCAs where relevant, to ensure that was
[normal]te management performance is optimised across the local area. This may involve supporting investment in new collection infrastructure in WCAs, where this could improve cost-effectiveness for council taxpayers in the long term’
[normal]. 
[normal]Often councils do not look
[normal] a
[normal]t the savings that could be made in combined disposal and collection costs
[normal].
[normal]There 
[normal]is usually
[normal] no 
[normal]up-to-date 
[normal]independent 
[normal]review 
[normal]undertaken 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]ncinerator proposal
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]in order 
[normal]to assess the opportunity cost of best practice elsewhere
[normal] or risk assessments
[normal], or
[normal] to compare
[normal] 25 year incinerator contract
[normal]s
[normal] versus modular and more flexible options. This 
[normal]is important because 
[normal]the 
[normal]early 
[normal]project weightings which 
[normal]determine
[normal] a choice of incineration 
[normal]are 
[normal]heavily
[normal] weighted towards
[normal] ‘technical’ and
[normal] ‘bankability’ 
[normal]aspects 
[normal]and do no
[normal]t reflect present day environmental concerns or employment and social dimensions.
[normal]6. 
[normal]DEFRA must agree Variation on VfM grounds.
[normal] 
[normal]DEFRA is being investigated by the National Audit Office in relation to its Value for Money Assessments for LA waste incinerati
[normal]on plants.
[normal] A decision by DEFRA to back a scheme and offer grants of millions of pounds is usually enough to convince a council that building its own multi-million pound incinerator is a good business proposition. However DEFRA’s decisive role in assessing
[normal] 
[normal]the long term risks of changing waste legislation and technologies, management systems and markets in relation to costs and VfM is now being examined. 
[normal]In fact DEFRA explains its promotion of incinerator projects in terms of the short term National impera
[normal]tive to meet landfill reduction targets by 2020
[normal] rather than developing sound long term environmental and economic waste solutions for Local Authorities. As we approach the closure of the ‘waste treatment capacity gap’ by 2020 those councils singled out by
[normal] DEFRA to get incinerators are left to face disproportionate risks compared to non-incinerator councils who are free to access short term contracts for spare capacity whilst developing newer, cheaper and greener solutions, accessing the waste market and be
[normal]nefitting from the sale of recyclates.
[normal]The degree to which DEFRA performs an independent scrutiny function for incinerator proposals has been questioned in Worcestershire where there is no record of communication between WCC and DEFRA on issues 
[normal]to do with 
[normal]VfM. In fact the P
[normal]roject’s Risk Matrix lists DEFRA itself as a risk needing mitigation: ‘
[normal]Senior officers to ensure early and continuous engagement with key DEFRA officials throughout process 
[normal]to ensure DEFRA buy in to scheme’[bold]. 
[normal]Treasury influence
[normal]The 
[normal]Treasury’s influence over the type of waste infrastructure available to LAs is via the PFI and WI grants it allows DEFRA, its provision of infrastructure guarantees and its choice of a Private Finance system which is biased towards large inflexible infrast
[normal]ructure on long contracts.
[normal]PFI projects have been described as ‘eye-poppingly’ expensive by Hereford MP Jesse Norman and member of the Treasury Select Committee. The Treasury, in its overriding desire for infrastructure projects (which are funded ‘off-bala
[normal]nce book’) to stimulate ‘growth’ has formed an ‘
[normal]unholy alliance’
[normal] with the private contractors ‘
[normal]which all but bypasses relevant departments in its drive to get deals done’
[normal].
[normal]Following the multi-billion
[normal] 
[normal]pound bail-outs of PFI hospitals in 2012 the NAO has wa
[normal]rned of the cumulative impact of funding infrastructure which is paid for from budget revenue. The Public Accounts Committee when criticising the ‘spend now, pay later’ approach of the Treasury stated; ‘
[normal]We were surprised to find that the Treasury did not h[bold]ave a grip on trends in some key areas of risk or plans for managing them.[bold]’
[normal] 
[normal]Contractual Parameters
[normal]1. (b) 
[normal]Bringing the Waste Contract into compliance with current and foreseeable legislation.
[normal]The OBC risk register for W
[normal]orcestershire’s
[normal] proposed incinerato
[normal]r 
[normal]is typical of other incinerator OBC’s when it 
[normal]states that if ‘
[normal]the councils significantly exceed their recycling targets
[normal] [and] 
[normal]the plant is oversized
[normal]’, it will be ‘
[normal]an additional cost to the Councils
[normal]’. A change in ‘
[normal]the calorific value of delivered residual
[normal] waste’
[normal] is also
[normal] 
[normal]stated to be ‘
[normal]an additional cost to the Councils’. 
[normal] The Councils are named as the ‘risk owners’ in the Risk Matrix for changes in legislation or guidance either at European, National or Regional/local level. 
[normal]These are very great risks for 
[normal]c
[normal]ouncils who will be unable to respond to the rapidly changing waste world
[normal] without paying the private partner
[normal] to provide extra new waste services or infrastructure. This process has already been witnessed by WCC where Mercia’s 15 year old waste contract ha
[normal]s needed 56 variations costing £49 million in order to bring services in line with new environmental policy and legislation. 
[normal]The EU Waste Directive is proposing to ban the incineration of all recyclable and organic material by 2020
[normal] 
[normal]which 
[normal]could clearly resu
[normal]lt in incinerators becoming economically unviable. 
[normal]It 
[normal]appears 
[normal]that the recommendations of the 
[normal]Treasury Select Committee
[normal] that ‘
[normal]PFI is only likely to be suitable where the risks associated with future demand and usage of the asset can be efficiently transfe
[normal]rred to the private sector’ 
[normal]have not been followed.
[normal]DEFRA, who are tasked with applying the trajectory of waste policy in relation to incinerator sizing for waste contracts, forecasts recycling rates peaking at around 50% in 2020 and remaining static for t
[normal]he next 25 years. This appears to contradict both reality and its own Waste Strategy for moving towards a Zero Waste Society. Wales is already exceeding 50% nationally and like Scotland aims for 70-75% within a few years. The Audit Commission’s document ‘W
[normal]ell Disposed’ states ‘
[normal]around 70% of household waste is readily recyclable’ 
[normal]which is confirmed by the top performing councils in England who are now achieving around 70%. 
[normal]Incinerator business cases are being passed by DEFRA without sensitivity analysis for
[normal] 60 and 70 % recycling being carried out.
[normal] 
[normal]Despite being a prime example of infrastructure involving long-term commercial risk incinerator projects have not had either the academic research or governmental monitoring and oversight which other large privatel
[normal]y funded LA infrastructure have received. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In contrast to the conservative predictions of DEFRA, and those parts of the waste industry wishing to secure incinerator contracts, the waste industry as a whole is gearing up to move its investment to the newer
[normal] forms of waste treatment and sees ‘
[normal]the waste market is evolving into one with shorter-term local authority contracts and contracts based on specific waste streams across municipal and commercial sectors.’ 
[normal]Investment will come from ‘
[normal]Corporate investors…, t
[normal]he GIB…, overseas buyers attracted to both the scale of investment and pace of change in the market and Private equity attracted to the growth potential in areas such as recycling.’
