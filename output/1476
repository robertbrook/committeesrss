[normal]Written evidence from 
[normal]Community First (TIC 030)
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Wiltshire Council 
[normal]is 
[normal]currently consulting with local Area Boards, Community Area Partnerships Parish Councils, users and local transport providers about changes to local bus services in a an effort to meet local needs in a cost-effectiv
[normal]e way.
[normal]Wiltshire Council 
[normal]is 
[normal]also undertaking surveys of existing bus service use in order that changes to the bus service network can be made according to demand.
[normal]To mitigate against the effects of changes to local bus services, Wiltshire Council ha
[normal]s
[normal] also consulted with Community First (who in turn canvassed opinions form Community Transport groups) regarding the establishment of a Community Transport business growth social enterprise (established in 2012 called Accelerate) and a Community Transport d
[normal]evelopment fund.
[normal]Lastly
[normal] t
[normal]he Council 
[normal]is 
[normal]responding
[normal] to consultation on rail matter
[normal]s
[normal] undertaken in 2011/12 having submitted a successful bid to the 
[normal]DfT’s Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) to improve Wiltshire’s rail offer.
[normal]As part of the early development of Wiltshire Councils’ Third Local 
[normal]Transport Plan (LTP3) Wiltshire Council invited various stakeholders and other interested parties to attend one of four consultation workshops to discuss the development of the LTP3.
[normal]Wiltshire Council 
[normal]also 
[normal]has
[normal] current
[normal] links with the Wilts
[normal]h
[normal]ire and Swindon U
[normal]ser’s Network (
[normal]a user-led organisation representing people who use health and social services locally) an
[normal]d 
[normal]y
[normal]oung people’s transport issues via the Wiltshire Assembly of Youth
[normal]. Wiltshire Council also undertakes regular consultations with
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]local residents and
[normal] service users, with many of these surveys carried out in partnership with other
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]local public service
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]bodies (see for more details: 
[normal]http://www.intelligencenetwork.org.uk/consultation/
[normal])
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]In relation to bus services the challenges are often related to funding. As the market is de-regulated the scope for private bus operators to look beyond the sustainability of their own 
[normal]operations
[normal] is lim
[normal]ited despite some useful initiatives
[normal] such as Quality 
[normal]Bus 
[normal]Partnerships
[normal] and Better Bus Areas.
[normal]There is however a broader issue of the marketing of bus services to encourage bus use more generally. Locally bus users tend to be mainly older people and those on low incomes. If there was a 
[normal]sustained 
[normal]national 
[normal]marke
[normal]ting 
[normal]campaign to promote bus 
[normal]use 
[normal]- 
[normal]for instance as a wise 
[normal]financial
[normal] as well as environmental choice
[normal] -
[normal] this would make 
[normal]the economics of bus use far easier. In 
[normal]some other European countries
[normal] such campaigns 
[normal]seem
[normal] prevalent and unnecessary car use seems to becom
[normal]ing culturally less 
[normal]acceptable
[normal] 
[normal]as a result.
[normal]In relation to rail services, it is vitally important that smaller stations are not disregarded by train companies in order to improve performance to larger rail hubs and that rail line electrification is conside
[normal]red carefully in this respect. Please see 
[normal]http://www.pewseytrainwatch.co.uk/
[normal] ; 
[normal]http://www.bedwyntrains.org.uk/
[normal] and 
[normal]http://www.westburytrainwatch.org.uk/
[normal] for more details.
[normal]Lastly in relation to rail, whilst 
[normal]Wiltshire Councils’ successful bid to the DfT’s Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) to improve Wiltshire’s 
[normal]rail offer will help to provide better and more consi
[normal]stent rail services locally, 
[normal]it
[normal] is
[normal] important that rail services 
[normal]resulting from this connect with bus services to 
[normal]provide passengers with integrated journey
[normal] options.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Based on the most recent data available, there were 10.4 million passenger trips undertaken by bus in Wiltshire compared to 260,000 passenger trip
[normal]s undertaken by Community Transport (CT) schemes in Wiltshire. 
[normal]There are
[normal] however over 60 CT
[normal] schemes across Wiltshire
[normal] but these groups are mainly fairly small in scale and scope. 
[normal] To make a real impression in addressing the needs of passengers in isolated 
[normal]communities (e.g. to support local CT schemes to respond to changes in local bus services) sustained support funding is needed for infrastructure organisations such as Community First.
[normal]Whilst the DfT Supporting Community Transport (CT) funding is welcome, 
[normal]it is relatively modest and also appears to be ‘one-off.’ Sustained investment (e.g. over 5 years or so) from the Government is needed in the CT sector in order for it to grow to the level required to make a significant difference in addressing the needs o
[normal]f passengers in isolated communities.
[normal]L
[normal]ocal 
[normal]CT support 
[normal]funding differences 
[normal]also 
[normal]need to be addressed – for instance w
[normal]hilst Community First receives funding from Wiltshire Council to provide support to CT schemes in Wiltshire, there is no funding for this s
[normal]upport provided by Swindon Borough Council.
[normal]In addition investment in simple car sharing initiatives / support for 
[normal]facilitating 
[normal]car sharing at the local level could have a significant impact in addressing the needs of passengers in isolated communities. Th
[normal]ere is already evidence locally of car sharing happening ‘under the radar’ but having proper investment in local car sharing could realize both accessibility 
[normal](
[normal]and environmental
[normal])
[normal] objectives relatively straightforwardly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Taxis could be used as an important part of the transport mix in addressing the needs
[normal] of passengers in isolated communities. For instance if taxis are used to provide a failsafe option as part of a car sharing scheme
[normal] 
[normal](e.g. through taxi vouchers or similar) then they could have a useful role to play. Similarly a web-based live portal for ta
[normal]xi operators to use to advertise ‘dead’ journeys may also be useful in advertising journey opportunities / bring down journey costs for passengers.
[normal]Demand responsive transport (DRT) services will only become cost effect
[normal]ive (to both commissioners and users)
[normal] if they are widely used. This will only come about if they are marketed extremely well and the law around pre-booking these services is relaxed. 
[normal] 
[normal]Otherwise the cost of providing these services as things currently stand is likely to lead to their demise.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The main challenges are related to the fact that there are fewer passengers available to be carried and often th
[normal]ey are spread over a larger geographical area than in urban areas.
[normal]Solutions
[normal], however, 
[normal]do not have to be expensive. Community Transport schemes and initiatives such as car sharing are cost effective to run and are therefore affordable for passengers. More 
[normal]investment in these services
[normal] and the marketing of them
[normal] is therefore needed.
