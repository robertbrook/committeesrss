"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Agricultural Biotechnology Council (abc) The views expressed in this submission are those of \nabc\n - the umbrella organisation for the agricultural biotechnology industry in the \nUK\n. \nabc\n, comprising of six member companies, works with the food chain and research community to invest in a broad range \nof crop technologies â€“ including conventional and advanced breeding techniques, such as GM.\n&#xa0;\n These are designed to \npromote the sustainable intensification of agriculture\n by tackling challenges such as pests, diseases and changing climatic conditions\n,\n whilst reducing water usage, greenhouse gas emissions and other inputs.\n \nThe companies are BASF, Bayer, Dow, Monsanto, Pioneer (DuPont) and \nSyngenta\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Background&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow best can we improve UK (and EU) food security, including using resources more efficiently? &#xa0;What is the relationship between the price of food and the cost of producing it?&#xa0;What is the potential value and contribution of science and GM technology to UK food security?&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;How can food and farming supply chains, and the current systems for traceability,&#xa0;contribute to increased resilience?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the obstacles facing food producers, including small farmers, seeking to increase production and access new markets?&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the ways of increasing self-sufficiency in products for which the UK has a comparative advantage?What are the implications of volatility in global food supply and demand for UK food security?&#xa0;&#xa0;Are climate change risks adequately incorporated in UK food security strategies and planning?&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nwww.isaaa.org\n \nhttp://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/\n \nhttp://www.europabio.org/sites/default/files/half_a_century_of_undue_delays_3_june_2013.pdf\n \nhttp://www.easac.eu/fileadmin/Reports/Planting_the_Future/EASAC_Planting_the_Future_FULL_\nREPORT.pdf\n \nEuropaBio\n: GM Crops: Reaping the benefits, but not in Europe\n \nEuropaBio\n: Science Not Fiction: Time to think again about GM\n"
