[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0; I am currently the chair of the Wiltshire Police Branch of the Police Federation of England and Wales.  My previous recent roles within Wiltshire Police provide me with background experience which may provide alternative perspectives which may be of use to the enquiry.  The role I currently undertake also helps me combine my strategic knowledge with that of the views and experiences of frontline officers.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0; Prior to joining Wiltshire Police I gained a degree in Mathematics, Statistics and Computing.  I have now been a police officer for over twenty five years.  The majority of this time has been spent in uniform working within the local policing environment.   &#xa0;1.3&#xa0; In 2005 I became an Inspector in the force control room.  As such I have significant operational experience of the recording of reported incidents and the initial investigation of such reports.  In early 2009 I moved into the force performance team.  During my time in the performance team I had significant involvement in:i.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Professionalising the work of the team to focus on more insightful analysis of force data to drive performance improvement.ii.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Introducing a new performance framework, based on Balanced Scorecard methodology, which had a significant focus on changing culture.iii.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Introduction of the national crime mapping website in Wiltshire.iv.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Analysis into crime and no crime decision making for common assaults.v.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; HMIC Inspection into Wiltshire Police as part of “The Crime Scene” review.vi.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Advising on force policy in respect of Proportionate Crime Recording.vii.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Analysis of crime data to identify potential areas of performance improvement.viii.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Leading work to connect Wiltshire to the Home Office Data Hubix.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Project lead for implementing a Business Intelligence solution to improve the integrity of Wiltshire Police Crime and Incident data&#xa0;1.4&#xa0; This submission is being made on my own behalf.

[[[Summary]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1&#xa0; Poor understanding of strategic performance management by senior police managers leading to dysfunctional behaviours (Paragraph 3)&#xa0;2.2&#xa0; Evidence of misuse of iQuanta data to drive performance. (Paragraph 4)&#xa0;2.3&#xa0; HMIC seeking evidence only on the under recording of crime not the accurate recording of crime. (Paragraph 5)&#xa0;2.4&#xa0; Evidence of over recording of crimes in cases of common assault. (Paragraph 6)&#xa0;2.5&#xa0; The impacts of the over recording of crime. (Paragraph 7)&#xa0;

[[[Performance Management]]]&#xa0;3.1&#xa0; In April 2010 Wiltshire Police introduced a balanced scorecard as a performance management tool.  The intention of this system was to ‘take the numbers’ away from senior managers.  The reason for this was to encourage a culture of looking forward and ‘making things better than they otherwise would have been.’&#xa0;3.2&#xa0; This replaced a system where force performance was measured thorough a small number of year to date Key Performance Indicators (KPI).  These KPI’s were set against targets which were, in general, binary comparison with previous years data.  In addition iQuanta data with comparison to Wiltshire’s family of forces was used mostly to give context to areas where KPI’s had worsened.&#xa0;3.3&#xa0; It is critical to understand how senior managers incorrectly use recorded crime statistics to measure and improve performance.  Below is an example I witnessed in Wiltshire Police.&#xa0;3.4&#xa0; During 2011Violent crime, both volume and detection rates, were identified at an issue in our County division.  Pressure was brought to bear on the performance team to identify ‘how much of a numerical reduction’ would be required for this to no longer be an issue.  The hierarchical nature of the police made it impossible to resist providing this information even though we felt it could risk dysfunctional behaviour.&#xa0;3.5&#xa0; Rather than focus on activities that would have a positive impact on future performance (e.g. improving the quality of investigations or focussed activity to target Night Time Economy (NTE) violence) resource was put into reviewing all Year to Date undetected violent crime.  &#xa0;3.6&#xa0; The purpose was to identify administrative oversights, including incorrect crime classification, crimes not being recorded as detected or crimes that had been identified as being ‘no crime’ not having been recorded as such .  In my opinion this had little or no impact in reducing crime or improving service delivery to victims of crime.  This activity, I believe, was undertaken full-time by two members of staff for at least a month.&#xa0;3.7&#xa0; Reviewing previously completed crimes was a tactic often employed by managers in Wiltshire Police during my tenure within the force performance team.  I suspect Wiltshire Police are not unique in utilising this tactic.   &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1&#xa0; The guidance for iQuanta states that forces should use the data to compare themselves against the average of most similar forces (MSF). &#xa0;4.2&#xa0; Senior managers up to Chief Officer level blatantly ignored this guidance despite representations from within the performance team.  They demanded to be told ‘what number they were in their family of forces’.  If they were second they wanted to be first.&#xa0;4.3&#xa0;  Through adopting this approach managers would again bring pressure to bear on improving the numbers rather than improving the level of performance.  &#xa0;4.4&#xa0; A lack of understanding of twelve month/three month rolling data also lead to insufficient time being given to initiatives to reduce crime to achieve results.  Instant results were expected/demanded from operational colleagues.&#xa0;

[[[HMIC Inspection]]]

[[[ – The Crime Scene]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1&#xa0; During the visit to Wiltshire Police by HMIC in 2011 in support of their thematic inspection ‘Crime Scene’ around 120 incidents were assessed to see if they had been correctly recorded as a crime.

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.2&#xa0;  It was clear that the only issues raised were where an incident that they felt should have been recording as a crime hadn’t been.

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.3&#xa0; I raised directly with the inspectors why they had not identified incidents that had been recorded crime where there was credible evidence to the contrary.&#xa0;5.4&#xa0; The view from the lead Inspector (Superintendent Steve Wallace – Hants Police) was that if a victim thought it was a crime then it should be recorded as such.  Proportionality would come in the investigative stage following an incident being recorded as a crime.  &#xa0;5.5&#xa0; Superintendent Wallace cited his previous experience as a crime registrar in Hampshire Police.

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.6&#xa0; The ACPO report – Understanding Crime Recording also raises the issue that HMIC and crime registrars interpret the question of ‘when to record’ in this way.&#xa0;5.7&#xa0; The view was also shared by our force crime registrar.

[[[Over recording of crimes.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1&#xa0; On becoming Chief Constable of Wiltshire Brian Moore set out to make Wiltshire the “Safest in the Country”.  This became interpreted internally to a more measurable ‘lowest rates of violent crime in the country’.&#xa0;6.2&#xa0; During the summer of 2010, in my role as Performance Manager, I identified that Wiltshire Police had significantly higher rates of ‘no crime’ for less serious assaults than the other ‘top ten forces’ with the lowest violent crime rates.&#xa0;6.3&#xa0; Analysis showed that in excess of 20% of these had been recorded as ‘no crimes’ within five days of the initial report.  At the time force procedures were such that the additional verifiable information (AVI) required to achieve a ‘no crime’ decision often needed to be in documentary form e.g. statement. &#xa0;6.4&#xa0; It became clear to me that for these crimes the AVI would have been available following basic and straightforward enquiries.  I further hypothesised there was a high level of probability that AVI either had been or could have been established within the 3x24 hour period allowed by NCRS to make a decision as to whether to record as a crime.  &#xa0;6.5&#xa0; I further hypothesised there was a high probability that there were other crimes with information which, whilst it would not satisfy the requirement of AVI, would have ‘credible evidence to the contrary’.&#xa0;6.6&#xa0; One of the key differences with reported common assaults, as compared to other crime types, is that in the overwhelming majority of cases the ‘offender’ is known, and named, by the victim.  This provides an opportunity to quickly identify an alternative version of events (as there invariably is) and ethically apply the NCRS threshold tests e.g. do the circumstances amount to a crime in law AND that there is no credible evidence to the contrary.&#xa0;6.7&#xa0; Analysis of a significant sample of common assaults was carried out by myself and a temporary Inspector on our team who had extensive experience as a detective.&#xa0;6.8&#xa0; We took a deliberately literal interpretation of the words of NCRS specifically around the balance of probabilities that it was more likely than not that the incident was as the result of a criminal act and whether there was any other credible evidence.  &#xa0;6.9&#xa0; There does however seem to be a contradiction with NCRS which states it is for the police to determine whether a crime has been committed but states that in most cases the belief by the victim that a crime has occurred is sufficient to justify its recording.&#xa0;6.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our analysis showed that in around 40% of the cases we examined there was other evidence that gave an alternative version of events that could be deemed credible.  &#xa0;6.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This is not to suggest that 40% had been incorrectly recorded.  What we concluded however was that there was a significant risk that crimes were being recorded that shouldn’t have been due to a lack of recognition of credible evidence to the contrary.  &#xa0;6.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In many cases the incidents occur when only the victim and offender are present and there is an absence of forensic evidence.  This presents the police with a significant dilemma. &#xa0;6.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To verify our findings we sought an independent operational Detective Sergeant to also make an independent assessment of the same incidents.  The findings of this DS supported our findings.&#xa0;6.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Similar issues are also raised in the NPIA – Understanding Crime Recording which is available on the College of Policing Website.&#xa0;6.15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Understanding Crime Recording report encourages ‘greater use of professional judgement in relation to all aspects of the crime recording process and in particular around what constitutes ‘credible evidence to the contrary’ and ‘additional verifiable information’.&#xa0;

[[[Impacts of the over recording of crime.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1&#xa0; The over recording of crime can have significant impacts on individuals and police resources.  It can risk public confidence in the police.&#xa0;7.2&#xa0; Quite rightly there is an expectation that police will deal with identified suspects expeditiously.  Often the method of ‘dealing with’ suspects of violent crime is to invoke the power of arrest.  &#xa0;7.3&#xa0; Within Wiltshire Police once a violent crime had been recorded as such and a suspect named and linked to that crime there was a performance culture linked to ‘customer satisfaction’ and  ‘detection rates’ which placed insurmountable pressure on officers to make arrests.&#xa0;7.4&#xa0; As a local Joint Branch Board we are currently supporting an ex-officer who has suffered significant psychological damage as a result of an unnecessary arrest related to a dubious decision making process in relation to an allegation of fraud.  This has had a significant on her life.  Often as police officers we forget the impact that an arrest can have on individuals.  &#xa0;7.5&#xa0; When incidents are not recorded as crimes there is less pressure to make arrests.  As a result investigating officers have more scope to use professional judgement in the investigation.&#xa0;7.6&#xa0; Conversely with increased opportunities for use of professional judgement comes an increased risk that crimes that should have been recorded as crimes haven’t been.  Clear strategies need to be in place to mitigate these risks.&#xa0;7.7&#xa0; The culture of Wiltshire police had a tendency for strategic focus to be on the outcomes of the investigations into recorded crime rather than the quality and integrity of investigations into reported incidents. &#xa0;7.8&#xa0; In respect of recorded crime this improved in late 2011 with an understanding that victim satisfaction survey results had identified low levels of satisfaction with the quality of the investigations.  &#xa0;7.9&#xa0; A plan to improve quality of investigations was implemented and showed positive results.  The same focus was not given to the investigation of incidents.   &#xa0;7.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is constant pressure at all levels of management to improve detection rates.  &#xa0;7.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As Wiltshire’s single point of contact for the National Crime mapping system when it went live I received numerous ‘complaints’ from people about the level of crime in their neighbourhoods.  It became evident that people had concerns that high crime levels may affect property prices.  &#xa0;7.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One of the other concerns that I have is around enhanced vetting.  Where people are named as suspects against recorded crimes there can be a requirement to disclose.&#xa0;7.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In one example I was made aware of related to a decision for disclosure that had been referred to the Assistant Chief Constable for a determination.&#xa0;7.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; During an enhanced CRB check on an individual it became apparent that he was the ‘suspect’ in an allegation of child abuse (physical).  The circumstances were that the allegation had been made by his ex-wife some time after they had separated.  The reporting person wished no further action.  The report however was recorded as a crime and the ‘suspect’ was never approached or advised of the allegation. &#xa0;7.15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The absence of an investigation and the failure to identify any potential evidence to the contrary could have had a significant impact on the job prospects of the accused.  &#xa0;7.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In my view this risks undermining one of the foundations of our criminal justice system of being ‘innocent until proven guilty.’&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
