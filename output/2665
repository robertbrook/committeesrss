default              
defaultWith a membership of more than 410,000 registered nurses and midwives, health visitors, nursing students, health care assistants and health cadets, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is the largest professional union of nursing staff in the world. RCN members work in a variety of hospital and community settings in the NHS and the independent sector. The RCN promotes patient and nursing interests on a wide range of issues by working closely with the UK Governments, the UK Parliaments and other national and European political institutions, trade unions, professional bodies and voluntary organisations.

default              
defaultThe RCN welcomes the opportunity to make a written submission to the Health Select Committee in advance of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) annual accountability hearing on Tuesday 8 October.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.0default              defaultProgress since 2012default3.1 
default              
defaultIt has been a busy year since the publication of the final report of the Professional Standards Authority (then the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence) strategic review into the performance of the NMC
default.
default 
defaultIn response to the strategic review the NMC committed to a programme of change intended to re-focus the organisation on core regulatory duties, improve the transparency of governance within the organisation and demonstrate improved financial management and sustainability.
default3.2 
default              
defaultThe RCN supported the recommendations made following the strategic review and welcomed the NMC’s commitment to improve. Both registrants and members of the public deserve to have a nursing regulator which is effective and fit for purpose.
default 
default3.3 
default              
defaultWe are pleased that the NMC has made progress this year on a number of areas.
default 
defaultFor example, the investment of resources into the fitness to practise function has increased the rate of substantive hearing days to 22 per day, and it is clear the NMC’s executive team continue to work hard to reduce the case backlog and improve efficiency. 
default3.4 
default              
defaultThere have been a number of consultations and listening events organised by the NMC on matters of fitness to practise.
default 
defaultThe RCN has welcomed the opportunity to participate in these.
default3.5 
default              
defaultThe quality of the paperwork and information made available to the public has continued to improve.
default 
defaultIt is now possible to scrutinise the organisation’s Key Performance Indicators and monthly financial information, and we welcome the fact that any registrant or member of the public can access this information via the NMC website.
default4.0default              defaultFitness to practicedefault4.1 
default              
defaultThe ongoing challenge of clearing the fitness to practise case backlog and developing efficient and fair procedures for the future cannot be underestimated. While we welcome the increased investment in fitness to practise in the last year, we are clear that should such a situation arise again where the NMC is unable to handle the number of fitness to practice cases it has, registrants should not be required to foot the bill. It is a matter of serious concern that the financial consequence of the failure of the NMC was simply passed on to registrants.
default4.2 
default              
defaultIn the coming year the NMC will begin moving ahead with the implementation of a model for the revalidation of registrants.
default 
defaultIt will be an immense challenge to develop a model which delivers public protection, whilst being proportionate and financially viable.
default 
defaultWe believe the NMC will need to engage widely and listen carefully to the feedback of registrants and key stakeholders.
default5.0default              defaultRevalidationdefault5.1 
default              
defaultThe RCN strongly endorses the principle of revalidation for nurses and midwives.
default 
defaultAn effective revalidation process will help to ensure that individual registrants are fit to practise in the modern health care environment. A successful programme will be an important tool for ensuring public protection. 
default5.2 
default              
defaultWe note that in his second public inquiry into the system failures at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, Sir Robert Francis QC made a number of recommendations on revalidation for nurses.
default 
defaultHe recommended 
defaultthat the NMC should introduce a system of revalidation similar to that of the General Medical Council (GMC) (recommendation 229).
default 
defaultHe suggested that this might include the establishment of Employment Liaison Officers, whose function would support Directors of Nursing in each organisation to ensure the nursing workforce remains compliant with the NMC’s Code (recommendation 232).
defaultFunding
default5.3 
default              
defaultAn effective revalidation model for nurses and midwives will require sufficient funding to ensure it fulfils its purpose. The GMC acquired significant financial resources in order to develop a sophisticated revalidation model for doctors and we would likewise expect there to be adequate resourcing for the NMC to carry out this important work.
default 
default5.4 
default              
defaultThe projected costs and supporting resources for the revalidation of nurses and midwives, as currently proposed by the NMC, are significantly lower than those that were given to the GMC for implementing revalidation for doctors.
default 
defaultIf revalidation for nurses and midwives is to be a success, it will be essential to establish from the outset a realistic estimate of the cost of designing and implementing an effective model.
default 
default5.5 
default              
defaultAn under-resourced system could pose a risk to patients if it does not deliver protection for the public and could be overly burdensome for nurses.
default 
default5.6 
default              
defaultThe RCN is also clear that revalidation cannot impose further financial hardship on nurses.
default 
defaultRegistrants have already faced a significant increase in annual registration fees, and any further 
defaultincrease would be unsustainable and unfair.
default 
defaultWe therefore urge that careful thought is given to resource requirements.
defaultThe role of the employer
default5.7 
default              
defaultEmployers will have an important role to play in the revalidation process.
default 
default5.8 
default              
defaultThe NMC acknowledged at its open council session in September 2013 the risk posed to effective revalidation by using a model that relies upon action by organisations and individuals over which it has no regulatory authority or remit. Any proposed model would therefore need to address this risk. 
default5.9
default 
default              
defaultA model of revalidation which relies on appraisals would require employers to ensure that nurses receive timely, appropriate and fair performance appraisals, for example. 
default5.10 
default              
defaultThe RCN is aware that at present the quality and provision of appraisals for nurses and midwives is not consistent.
default 
defaultIt will, therefore, be very important for the NMC to work closely with employers to ensure consistency in the way the revalidation process is applied. It will also be important for the NMC to remain up to date with the different health care environments across the UK, in order to meet the needs of registrants working in different models of health systems.
default5.11 
default              
defaultWe will be consulting with our members in order to provide a detailed response to the NMC’s public consultation, when it is published later in 2013.
default6.0default              defaultProfessional advice roledefault6.1 
default              
defaultIn our submission to the Health Select Committee last year, we noted our concerns about the closure of the NMC professional advice line.
default 
defaultSince the line closed, there has been some impact on the RCN, with RCN Direct receiving an increase in calls on matters relating to professional standards. While this is of course a service we provide as one of the many benefits of RCN membership, the NMC has an important role to play in supporting registrations on professional matters and in maintaining its own professional expertise in nursing and midwifery practice.
default 
default7.0default              defaultStakeholder engagementdefault7.1
default              
defaultThe NMC needs to refocus its strategy for stakeholder engagement. There is an urgent need to engage much more fully with registrants, particularly frontline staff, on a four country basis. This would help to enhance registrants’ confidence and sense of ownership of professional self-regulation. 
default7.2
default              
defaultThe NMC must engage directly with registrants, rather than through an intermediary such as a government health department, as is often currently the case. It also needs to constitute genuine engagement, rather than (as was the case with respect to a recent meeting in Northern Ireland on validation) simply summarising existing views on a particular issue. The RCN would welcome the opportunity to assist the NMC in this process in Northern Ireland.
default8.0default              defaultRegistration feesdefault default8.1 
default              
defaultThe RCN took a robust stance last year when the NMC consulted on raising the annual registration fee, initially proposing a raise of 58 per cent, from £76 to £120.
default 
defaultWe argued that this increase was inappropriate and placed too big a burden on individual nurses to make up for historically poor financial management by the NMC.
default 
default&#xa0;
default8.2 
default              
defaultThe strength of feeling of the nursing profession was demonstrated by the results of an RCN member survey, which informed our response to the public consultation.
default 
defaultA total of 85,720 responses were received, with a 99 per cent majority disagreeing with the proposed fee raise.
default&#xa0;
default8.3 
default              
defaultThe RCN played an instrumental role in stating the case to the then Secretary of State for Health, Rt Hon Andrew Lansley MP, for providing additional funding to the NMC to help it to clear its backlog of Fitness to Practise cases. We were therefore pleased to see the offer of a 
default£20 million grant from the Department of Health to contribute towards these costs.
default 
defaultHowever, we were deeply disappointed to see the NMC still chose to impose a fee increase on registrants.
default 
default&#xa0;
default8.4 
default              
defaultNow this fee rise has come into force, the RCN is committed to holding the NMC to account for sound financial management.
default 
defaultWe expect to see evidence of value for money for registrants.
default 
default&#xa0;
default9.0 default              defaultProfessional nursing and midwifery expertisedefault&#xa0;
default9.1
default 
default              
defaultThere has been a regrettable dilution in professional leadership and influence within the NMC in recent years. There is now a smaller Governing Council split equally between lay and nurse or midwife members and neither the CEO or Chair are registrants. Many Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors are concerned that recent developments represent the demise of a model of professionally led regulation.
default 
default&#xa0;
default9.2
default              
defaultIt is essential, both for public protection and to maintain the confidence of registrants, that nursing and midwifery professionals have a strong presence in the development of NMC strategy and projects, and in holding the NMC to account for its performance.
default 
default&#xa0;
default9.3
default 
default              
defaultWe note that in 2013 the NMC agreed the recruitment of two substantive roles – the Chief Executive and Chair of Council.
default 
defaultNeither of these roles has been filled by a registrant i.e. a nurse or a midwife.
default 
defaultIt is of course essential that these critical roles are filled by individuals with the right skills and experience to deliver a fit for purpose regulator. However the RCN also believes that in order to restore both registrant and public confidence in the NMC it is equally important that experienced registrants are members of the Executive leadership of the NMC and that the ambition for the future should be to have, as a minimum, either the CEO or Chair role filled by a registrant. 
default&#xa0;
default9.4 
default              
defaultIn 2012, the NMC also consulted on proposals to reduce the size of the governing council from 16 to 8.
default 
defaultRCN members strongly resisted proposals for council to be reduced so drastically.
default 
defaultWe believe that given the remit of the NMC across the UK and across all branches of nursing and midwifery practice, the council must be of a sufficient size to allow for a breadth of experience and skills. Given that half of council members must be registrants, the council offers an important opportunity for registrants to contribute to the shaping of the NMC’s strategy.
default 
defaultThe RCN was, therefore, pleased that the proposals were altered, with a final decision taken to reduce council to a middle ground of 12.
default&#xa0;
default10.0default              defaultFitness to PractisedefaultAreas of improvement
default10.1 
default              
defaultThe RCN is pleased to see that the NMC has offered Consensual Panel Determination (CPD), which 
defaultallows a nurse or midwife who is subject to a fitness to practise allegation to agree a provisional sanction with them. If the NMC are able to reach agreement, they will put it before a panel for consideration and the panel will then either agree to this sanction, or send the case to a full hearing. 
default10.2
default              
defaultWe have found CPD to be successful for less serious cases. When the NMC presenters have turned down a CPD proposal by the RCN, it is our experience that the final sanction by the panel has tended to be proportionate, although this is an observation based on a small sample. This suggests that the Regulatory Legal Team (RLT) are not agreeing unduly lenient CPD outcomes.
default10.3
default              
defaultThe RCN is also pleased to see Voluntary Removal (VR), a mechanism through which nurses and midwives who are subject to fitness to practice proceedings can voluntarily remove themselves from the register, offered by the NMC in a significant number of our cases. VR brings cases to a humane conclusion particularly for registrants who are unwell or close to retirement
default10.4
default              
defaultThe use of CPD and VR have led to fair outcomes for our members which have been achieved efficiently. 
default10.5 
default              
defaultThe RCN welcomes the outcome of
default 
defaultthe NMC’s consultation on the process for interim order hearings, which has has led to a system for avoiding adjournments that also allows the registrant a fair length of time to prepare their arguments and documentation in support. 
default10.6 
default              
defaultWe are also pleased to see that the NMC has put into place some structural changes for preparing cases for final hearings that provide a better system for the NMC case presenters and registrant representatives to engage prior to final hearings to identify the issues. This system includes Specialist Case Officers (now called Case Preparation Officers) working closely with the NMC’s RLT on caseloads that are allocated to individual lawyers in the RLT. 
default10.7 
default              
defaultThe intention is that there is a lawyer with authority at the NMC who can be contacted to consider whether charges should be amended, statements redacted, documents obtained etc. This could mean that all the issues have been ironed out as far as the parties can achieve by agreement before the hearing, so that valuable hearing time is not spent on the day dealing with these issues. 
default10.8
default              
defaultWhile we feel that such a system seems sensible, there is a very variable extent to which it is working in practice. When it does work, it undoubtedly leads to a saving in time and a proper focus on the key issues by the panel.
default10.9 
default              
defaultThe RCN welcomes the fact that the NMC has offered no evidence in a larger number of cases, suggesting that there has been a more robust review of cases, rather than discovering at the hearing that there was never a real prospect of proving the case
defaultAreas of Concern
default10.10 
default              
defaultThe NMC’s most recent figures show that 61% of fitness to practice cases result in no further action, either because it is found that there is no case to answer, or because no sanctions are applied. Such a high number of cases requiring no further action indicates that the screening process is not working as it should. This is unfair to registrants, not least because of the risk to their professional reputation, but it is also a waste of their fees.
default10.11
default              
defaultWe understand the NMC has plans to introduce professional case examiners to make decisions at the investigation phase of the process to decide if cases should proceed to a final public hearing. They have also proposed to introduce a new power to review decisions to close cases at investigation stage.
default 
defaultWe now need to see more detail about how these proposals will work in practice and we look forward to working with the NMC and Government as part of the consultation process
default10.12
default              
defaultWe are disappointed that there can still be detected among some lawyers in the RLT an overly prosecutorial approach, and this filters down into other areas as set out below. At times the investigation concludes as soon as there is any evidence that supports a case to answer, rather than the opportunity being used to investigate all the circumstances in a neutral way. For example, not all witnesses may be contacted. The RCN understands that the new Head of Screening and Investigations at the NMC has been looking into this.
default10.13 
default              
defaultWhile we have noted that there is some improved engagement prior to final hearings, in many cases this engagement only takes place at the last minute and hearing time is lost as a result. We would, therefore, like to see engagement prior to final hearings in good time in order to ensure valuable hearing time is not lost unnecessarily.
default10.14 
default              
defaultThe RCN has observed that the NMC can be resistant to obtaining all the documentation requested, demanding details of the defence before seeking those documents. In a recent case, for example, where only partial patient case records had been disclosed, the panel had to adjourn the hearing in order that that the records could be obtained.
default 
defaultThe panel noted that they had been requested by the registrant six months previously.
default10.15
default              
defaultThe NMC has had a recent project to improve the experience of witnesses, a development that the RCN supports.
default 
defaultHowever, we would ask them to look at the treatment of registrants, who are also witnesses, at the same time. For example, there is a shortage of rooms for registrants and their representatives at NMC venues, and we have had experience of where they are unable to find a place to talk in private, even when there is sensitive case information to be discussed, this is unsupportive.
default10.16
default              
defaultThe RCN has also had reports from members that registrants had been summoned by the NMC to appear as witnesses but had not been seen on the day. This is unacceptable and the NMC generally refuses to pay the costs incurred as a result. Registrants should not have to suffer the consequences of poor management of cases by the NMC. 
default10.17
default              
defaultThe RCN has some concerns about the NMC’s handling of sensitive and confidential information. For example, we were deeply concerned by reports from some of our members that in a case involving up to five registrants, each registrant was given the same bundle containing 5000 pages of documents. The bundle contained sensitive information which should not have been shared universally with all five registrants.
default10.18 
default              
defaultUnder the rules, there are minimum periods for registrants to respond to allegations before the investigating committees decide if there is a case to answer. At times, NMC staff can be inflexible about giving extensions to that minimum time period, even when the paperwork is so voluminous that it cannot be read within that time. A recent example of this involved a registrant that had been subject to a five year NMC investigation with 20,000 pages of documents, and the registrant was told that 28 days would be adequate to prepare a response.
default10.19 
default              
defaultThe NMC publishes detailed information on its website about the outcome of interim order hearings. Under the rules it is obliged to publish the outcome, but it publishes the panel’s reasons for making an order which contain a summary of the case. Often these include allegations which are later dropped or not found to be proven. The RCN does not see any justification for publishing information other than the bare details of the interim order made, and there is considerable risk to the registrant’s reputation by publishing any more than that. 
default10.20 
default              
defaultWe understand that the NMC will open a consultation about this issue, and we welcome the opportunity to discuss this with them further in due course.
