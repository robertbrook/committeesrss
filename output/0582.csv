defaultWritten Evidencedefault&#xa0;
default1/default              defaultWhat are the strengths and weaknesses of the funding, organisation, and work of the European Space Agency?default&#xa0;
default1
default.1
default/
default              
defaultT
defaulthe greatest strength of ESA is its 
defaulttechnical 
defaultstaff, whos
defaulte breadth and depth of
default knowledge across the organisation is significant. 
defaultThis expertise, which has brought about
default many successful space 
defaultmissions, s
defaulthould be
default developed as much as possible.
default 
defaultFor example, more opportunities could be provided for the 
defaults
defaultecondment of 
defaultESA 
defaultstaff to industry
default,
default national space agencies
default or
default the EU
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1.
default2/
default              
defaultIn terms of
default organisation, ESA has a rigid
default hierarchical structure 
defaultwhich is similar in many respects to a large civil service department
default. 
defaultA flatter organisation with a matrix management system, if implemented correctly, 
defaultwould
default allow greater flexibility in moving staff 
defaultboth 
defaultwithin 
defaultand outside 
defaultthe organisation
default. 
defaultIt would
default also provide a closer relationship between senior management and the technical staff. 
defaultThis should improve
default upward communication flow of importa
defaultnt advice from technical staff.
default&#xa0;
default1.
default3/
default              
defaultOne
default area requiring attention
default in ESA
default is t
defaulthe 
defaultprocess 
defaultthat industry has to follow when 
defaultbiddi
defaultng for relatively low-value 
defaultcompetitive tenders, 
defaulti.
defaulte. those less than 500k euros. At present t
defaulthe process
default is too costly, time-consuming and complicated. This can act as a barrier 
defaultto SMEs
default bidd
defaulting, since t
defaulthe size of the investment that must be made, and risk taken, may be a substantial proportion of the SME’s overall business.
default Therefore
default, SMEs are 
defaultforced to consider bidding only for 
defaultthose ESA 
defaultcontracts 
defaultthat they have a significant chance of winning. 
defaultBy contrast, large organis
defaultations can absorb the 
defaulthigh 
defaultbidding costs much more readily, and therefore they can afford to 
defaultbe more speculative when
default bidding for work. Thus the complexity and cost of the 
defaultESA bidding 
defaultprocess has an inherent 
defaultbias in favour of large organis
defaultations.  
defaultThis clearly has a couple of
default (perhaps unintended) consequences. First, the 
defaultorganis
defaultation that wins a contract may not necessarily be the best one to undertake the work. Second, 
defaultthe potential 
defaultfor 
defaultSMEs 
defaultto grow 
defaultcould be
default hindered.
default&#xa0;
default1.
default4/
default              
defaultAn
default aspect of the ESA 
defaultbidding process that remains a cause for concern is 
default“
defaultjuste
default retour”
default. The existence of a
default geogra
defaultphical return requirement can force
default a bid consortium to include 
defaultsome weaker partners in order to spread the geographical loading. Therefore, it seems inevitable that bid consortia will be sub-optimal in their make-up. 
defaultAs a consequence, o
defaultne must 
defaultalso presume that some of the resulting contract deliverables from a winning consortium will not be of the highest standard
default achievable
default.
default&#xa0;
default2/default              defaultIn light of the European Commission’s recent Communication on relations between ESA and the EU (COM 2012 671), what relationship between ESA, the EU and the UK would provide the most effective governance regime? Why?default&#xa0;
default2.1
default/
default              
defaultESA has accomplished much since its inception. There have been notable achievements across all of the space acti
defaultvity domains. However, given its
default budgetary cons
defaulttraints, and the emergence of EU
default funding of space-related activities, perhaps now is the time for ESA to focus on certain key areas. There should be a clear demarcation between ESA’s activities and those of the 
defaultEU
default. 
defaultThe greatest
default 
defaulttechnological risk and 
defaultchallenge comes from 
defaultscience missions, 
defaultinterplanetary missions and human spaceflight. 
defaultIt could be argued that 
defaultESA’s undoubted technical expertise would be put to best u
defaultse by concentrating on these particular
default areas. Where synergies and economies of scale exist, 
defaultESA 
defaultprojects 
defaultsh
defaultould be pursued in collaboration with national space agencies within Europe
default, such as the UK Space Agency,
default or 
defaultagencies outside of Europe.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default/
default              
defaultTo complement this approach
default, the 
defaultEU
default could assume respo
defaultnsibility for 
defaultunmanned, Earth orbital missions since these provide the most immediate 
defaultand obvious 
defaultsocietal benefits to European citizens.
default 
defaultIn recent years the 
defaultEU
default 
defaulthas demonstrated its commitment to Earth orbital space, both in terms of use (e.g. GMES) and in terms of preservation of the environment for future generations (e.g. addressing the space debris problem).
default&#xa0;
default3/default              defaultHow effective is the EU’s support for research and innovation in the space sector? What effect have changes to the Multi-Annual Financial Framework had on ESA and support for the space sector from the Horizon 2020 programme?default&#xa0;
default3.1
default/
default              
defaultEU support for research and innovation has provided a significant 
defaultboost to the 
defaultEuropean 
defaultspace sector
default, and
default has filled in some sizeable funding gaps
default. This is particularly evident in an area such as space debris
default research
default. Over the past 
defaultthree years several large debris projects have been funded within FP7 to address a variety of important needs. These include the development of methods to mitigate the growth in 
defaultorbital 
defaultdebris and technologies for 
defaultactively removing
default debris 
defaultfrom the 
defaultenvironment. 
defaultIn the light of concerns about the Kessler syndrome taking hold, i.e. the onset of an irreversible collision cascade in low Earth orbit
default (LEO)
default, the 
defaultEU
default has approached the debris problem with a sense of urgency. This is lauda
defaultble. 
defaultEU
default funding 
defaulthas helped many European companies, especially SMEs, to develop promising ideas and technologies. In so doing, the competitiveness of European industry has also been improved. The upcoming Horizon 2020 programme looks set to continue that trend.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default/
default              
defaultO
defaultne problem that the 
defaultEU
default currently appears to suffer from is a lack of staff to oversee the 
defaultspace-related 
defaultresearch being undertaken. 
defaultAt present the 
defaultEU
default has limited in-house technical expertise
default, and therefore it has to invite outside experts to act as project reviewers. This can work quite well if there is a go
defaultod match between the aims of a project
default and the knowledge of the expert. However, experience shows that this is not always the case.
default Some projects have been
default reviewed by 
defaultexperts who are not sufficiently qualified to provide meaningful inputs. If the 
defaultEU
default is to provide effective oversight of research within Horizon 2020, then it needs to address this problem. One possible solution would be for ESA to provide a number of technical staff to the 
defaultEU
default. This could be on a secondment basis or as a permanent transfer.
default&#xa0;
default4/default              defaultHow effective has the UK Space Agency been and what improvements could be made? Is the UK effectively exploiting opportunities for growth in the space sector or could more be done?default&#xa0;
default4.1
default/
default              
defaultT
defaulthe UK Space Agency’s National Space Technology Programme (NTSP) has 
defaultgiv
defaulten much-needed assistance to
default the development of innovative technologies within the UK space sector. However, the level of investment would seem to fall short of that 
defaultnecessary to satisfy
default the 
defaultaspiration
default of 
defaultcreating a 
default£40 billion
default-
defaultturnover 
defaultspace industry 
defaultwithin the UK 
defaultby 2030.
default 
defaultIn addition, c
defaultalls for proposals need to be more frequent and regular to ensure that promising new ideas can be
default developed quickly and retained by
default the UK
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default/
default              
defaultThe relationship between funding offered by the NTSP and that offered by the Technology Strategy Board
default (TSB)
default is unclear. It is presumed that there is coordina
defaulttion between these funding programme
defaults regarding the technical 
defaultrequirements in
default calls for proposals. However, an outsider to the process can have poor visibility and understanding of this. For example, it is not clear under what circumstances a proposal should be submitted to the NTSP rather than the TSB.
default&#xa0;
default5/default              defaultHow resilient is the UK’s space-based infrastructure? Are threats from space debris or solar activity being appropriately mitigated? What role do, or should, ESA and the UK Space Agency play in addressing these issues?default&#xa0;
default5.1
default/
default              
defaultOne of the leading international organisations for addressing the space debris problem is the Inter Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC). This is 
defaultan international governmental forum for the worldwide coordination of activities related to the issues of man-made and natural debris in space. Recently 
defaultIADC has studied the stability of the debris population in low Earth Orbit and found that the population is likely
default to increase by approximately
default 30% in the next 200 years. This projection assumes 90% implementation of mitigation measures in the design and operation of spacecraft (which is not currently achieved). 
defaultIn view of this result, the IADC observes that t
defaultwo key elements 
defaultare 
defaultrequired for the long-term sustainability o
defaultf the future LEO environment.
default 
defaultThe first defence is to encourage greater compl
defaultiance with mitigation measures (
defaultsuch as those contained in the IADC’s space debris mitigation guidelines or 
defaultthe 
defaultISO 24113
default standard)
default. 
defaultSecondly, active debris rem
defaultoval (ADR) should be considered.
default The IADC study concludes that 
default“
defaultthe international community should initiate an effort to investigate the benefits of environment remediation, explore various options, and support the development of the most cost-effective technologies in preparation for actions to better preserve the near-Earth environment for future generations
default”

default2/
default              
defaultActive debris removal brings with it many challenges. Aside from the technical difficulties in 
defaultsafely 
defaultremoving debris, there are also political, legal and financial hurdles to be overcome.
default The UKSA should make a 
defaultmeaningful contribution towards finding solutions to all of these problems. For example, on the technical side, the UK has 
defaultsignificant 
defaultexpertise in a number of areas, including:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.
default3/
default              
defaultThe UKSA should encourage 
defaultand support 
defaultthe dev
defaultelopment of promising new 
defaultdebris mitigation / remediation 
defaultideas, particularly those emerging from SMEs
default. Otherwise there is
default a risk that other countries will
default benefit from the UK’s innovations. At least one such idea is on t
defaulthe verge of being lost
default from
default the UK because of a lack of
default 
defaultfunding
default opportunities
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default4/
default              
defaultThe
default UK Space Agency
default 
defaultalso 
defaulthas 
defaulta long-standing obligation
default to participate in international forums addressing the space debris problem. It h
defaultas satisfied this obligation
default with the help of a small number of experts who have provided the UKSA with technical support and advice on space debris matters for a number of years. 
defaultAs a result the UKSA has been able to take a leading role in the development of international debris mitigation guidelines and standards, such as those published by the IADC, UN and ISO. This work is on-going, and has now been expanded to include recommendations relating to active debris removal (ADR). To ensure the UK can continue to have a positive influence on these activities, and therefore protect the commercial interests of 
defaultthe 
defaultUK 
defaultspace 
defaultindustry, it is very important that such representat
defaultion is maintained. However
default, budgetary pressures within the UKSA in recent years have reduced funding for the expert support to a point where meanin
defaultgful participation has been
default jeopardized.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default5/
default              
defaultThe UK cannot afford to w
defaultalk away from its obligations in
default 
defaultthese 
defaultinternational debris mitigation forums if it is serious about g
defaultrowing the space sector to achieve a £40 billion turnover by 2030
default. Activities such as monitoring and modelling the debris environment, and standardizing 
defaultspacecraft design and operations to mitigate debris are inseparably bound with this economic aspiration. The UKSA should therefore reaffirm its commitment to international space debris mitigation efforts via the IADC, UN and ISO, and take immediate measures to reverse the decline in funding support for expert participation in these forums.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default6/
default              
defaultESA’s 
defaultfunding of the space debris problem has been variable during the past decade
default. Approximately 10 years ago, a
default 
defaultmanagement 
defaultdecision was made to 
defaultcurtail
default funding of 
defaultspace debris 
defaultresear
defaultch
default. The rationale for the decision is unclear. Since no serious collisions had happened up to that point, perhaps there was a perception that debris was not a significant problem that deserved funding. 
defaultIn contrast,
default 
defaultESA
default debris experts
default at that time were predicting that 
defaultcollisions would be likely to start within a few years (based on 
defaultsimulat
defaultions from long-term debris environment evolution models). As it happened, the first major 
defaultaccidental 
defaultcollis
defaultion took place in February 2009
default and the environment has deteriorated substantially since then. It is worth noting that ESA funding of 
defaultspace debris research has increas
defaulted
default noticeably
default in the past coupl
defaulte of years
default. This is a welcome development. 
defaultHowever, given the level of concern about the debris problem
default now
default, perhaps there is
default 
defaultscope for further improvement
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default7/
default              
defaultFinally, w
defaultithin ESA, technical experts are currently studying options for actively removing the 
defaultEnvisat
default satellite from orbit. 
defaultEnvisat
default,
default one of the la
defaultrgest spacecraft to be launched,
default orbits in a very popular and populous region 
defaultof
default 
defaultlow E
defaultarth orbit
default. After 10 years of operation i
defaultt suffered a 
defaultsudden and irrecoverable
default failure last year
default and, as a result, became 
defaultone of the
default most hazardous debris objects in LEO.
default 
defaultUnfortunately, 
defaultEnvisat
default will now remain in orbit for well over a century unless 
defaultESA can find some method 
defaultto remove it
default safely
default.
default Space debris experts in the UK are also considering possible solutions to this problem.
