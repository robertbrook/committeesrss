[normal]how to improve the
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal] 
[normal]SADPD is pleased to submit the following recommendations. SADPD is a continental technical agency that is run and managed by experts with disabilities. It has created a credible niche in the disability programming and policy implementation process by working in partnership with the African Union
[normal] (AU), G
[normal]overnments, Civil Society and Continental/ Regional and National Disabled People’s Organizations (NDPOs) in Africa. The Secretariat’s vision is an African continent where people with disabilities enjoy their human rights. The three overarching principles underlining the work of SADPD are disability, development and human rights.
[normal]We are submitting this recommendation on behalf of SADPD’s regional office in Addis Ababa. The regional office is currently actively working on 
[normal]the 
[normal]Disability Inclusive Peace and Security Project (DIPS) in collaboration with the African Union Peace and Security Department (AU PSD). The DIPS project aims to improve the lives of persons with disabilities in conflict areas of Africa by mainstreaming disability issues in the prevention, management and resolution of conflict in the context of 
[normal]the 
[normal]AU peace and security framework. We have responded only to those areas 
[normal]where 
[normal] we feel we have somethi
[normal]ng to contribute. Thus, 
[normal]our recommendation focuses on 
[normal]d
[normal]isability i
[normal]nclusive peace and security, 
[normal]disaster risk management
[normal], and disability inclusive development.
