"JHA 05&#xa0;Written evidence from the Ministry of Justice\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Government response to the Justice Select Committee’s call for evidence: Ministry of Justice measures in the JHA opt-out&#xa0;Detailed information on the measures for which the \nM\ninistry of \nJ\nustice is responsible for is of course provided in command paper 8671 and the \nE\nxplanatory \nM\nemorandum contained within. However, I thought it may be helpful to your committee if I provided some additional information on some of the key measures \nthat I am responsible for, and that \nwe are seeking to rejoin\n,\n ahead of that date. As such, please find some additional information which I hope you can take into account in your call for evidence. I apologise for the delay in providing this\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGovernment response to the Justice Select Committee’s call for evidence: Ministry of Justice measures in the JHA opt-out&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe are seeking to rejoin those measures that underpin cooperation in the fight against organised crime and protect the British public. \nWhile detailed analysis of each individual measure is included in the five Explanatory Memoranda contained in Command Paper 8671, I have set out more of the Government’s reasoning for wishing to rejoin a number of the \nkey\n measures where the Ministry of Justice has responsibility: the Prison Transfer Framework Decision (PTFD)\n (number 85 on the list)\n, the European Supervision Order (ESO)\n (number 97)\n, the Data Protection Framework Decision (DPFD)\n (number 90)\n, and the Mutual Recognition of Financial Penalties Framework Decision (MRFP)\n (number 59)\n.   \n&#xa0;&#xa0;Prisoner Transfer Framework Decision (PTFD)&#xa0;Reducing the Foreign National Offender (FNO) population is a top priority for the Government. \nAs a general rule the \nUK\n believes prisoners reintegrate better into society upon their eventual release from prison if they serve their sentence in their country\n. I\nn addition\n,\n returning FNOs to serve sentences in their home countries will free up prison spaces and contribute towards savings\n. \nOver the last ten years the \nUK\n has witnessed an increase in the number of EU nationals detained within prisons in \nEngland\n and \nWales\n. The \nUK\n is already party to a number of international prisoner transfer arrangements; however the \nPTFD\n which came into force on 5 December 2011 is important in mitigating this increase as it permits Member States to transfer prisoners without the consent of the prisoner and restricts the grounds on which receiving Member States may refuse to accept transfers. It will enable non-British EU nationals held in prisons here to be returned to their country of nationality to serve their sentences and for British nationals held in other EU Member States to serve their sentences here.  There are currently around 4,000 EU nationals detained in \nEngland\n and \nWales\n which is 37% of the overall prison population.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nUK\n is beginning to see more EU nationals being removed from \nUK\n prisons. So far we have transferred nine prisoners on a voluntary basis and have just completed the first four compulsory transfers (three of which have been transferred to the Netherlands, an EU Member State which has a large number of their nationals in UK prisons, and one to Malta). A further 22 transfer certificates have been referred to other EU jurisdictions and a further tranche of prisoners are under consideration for deportation by Home Office Immigration Enforcement. The PTFD has also allowed us to secure the return of five British national offenders (two from \nItaly\n, two from \nDenmark\n and one from \nBelgium\n).\n&#xa0;\nThe EU PT\nFD\n, once fully implemented across all Member States, will allow us to more effectively seek the removal of EU FNOs, to serve the remainder of their sentence in their home country with or without their consent. This supports Government policy by enabling FNOs who have no right to remain in the \nUK\n to be removed from the \nUK\n at the earliest opportunity. \nWe are actively encouraging those Member States that have not yet implemented to do so. \n&#xa0;\nThe measure is also an important part of the overall reform package for the \nEuropean Arrest Warrant (\nEAW\n)\n. Where EAWs are issued for convicted \nUK\n nationals to serve sentences abroad, we can make greater use of the PTFD to help ensure that more \nUK\n nationals are able to serve their sentences in the \nUK\n. As the Home Secretary announced on 9 July, this will mean asking the issuing state to withdraw the warrant and use Prisoner Transfer arrangements instead.\n This is clearly a more efficient use of resources and is in the interests of all concerned.\n&#xa0;\nThe use of the PTFD in this way \ncould have prevented the\n&#xa0;\nunnecessary\n extraditions of Michael Binnington and Luke Atkinson – sent to \nCyprus\n, only to be returned to the \nUK\n six months later.\n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;European Supervision Order (ESO)&#xa0;The ESO provides a legal framework which in certain circumstances will enable the court in the State where the crime is alleged to transfer the suspect back to their home Member State to await trial, and for the home \nMember State \nto assume responsibility for supervising compliance with any conditions of that bail\n (e.g\n.\n not contacting \nalleged \nvictims or certain witnesses, not visiting certain places, a curfew, surrender of passport etc).\n&#xa0;\nWhil\ne there is no real experience\n of the impact of the ESO because it has only recently come into force, the potential benefits of the ESO are clear. It will provide a new option for suspects, and the courts dealing with them, to allow those suitable to return home under conditional bail to be supervised there, rather than having to stay and be supervised in the \nMember\n \nState\n where they are accused. It might even allow some suspects who might otherwise be held on remand in the prosecuting \nMember\n \nState\n to be returned home under supervised bail conditions, meaning the prosecuting State can be safe in the knowledge that any bail conditions it considers necessary will be supervised in the suspect’s home \nMember\n \nState\n. The suspect, of course, gets to return home. \n&#xa0;\nIt is also possible that the ESO might go some way to help avoiding\n&#xa0;\nlengthy pre-trial detention for some suspects surrendered under an EAW, as it will allow courts to bail the suspect back to the \nUK\n while they await trial.\n&#xa0;\nThis could benefit requested persons where unconditional bail is considered inappropriate. For example, the case of Andrew Symeou is sometimes cited as one which might have benefited from an ESO if it had been available at the time. In this case Mr Symeou spent 10 months in pre-trial detention and a further nine months under locally supervised bail in \nGreece\n. \nThe ESO would have at least given the prosecuting court an alternative to remand or monitoring the bail of the suspect locally. \nIn his review of \nUK\n extradition, Sir Scott Baker\n \nrecommended that the ESO could \nplay a part in\n help\ning\n reduce lengthy pre\n-\ntrial detention\n for some suspects in some cases who might otherwise be held abroad and the Government agrees with that observation.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nData Protection Framework Decision (DPFD&#xa0;\nThe DPFD\n&#xa0;\nprovides for the protection of personal data in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It only applies to data which \nis\n shared across borders, not domestically (for example it would apply in an exchange of data between UK and French police forces, but it would not apply to an exchange of data between the Metropolitan and Thames Valley police forces).  It applies to “competent authorities”, which in the \nUK\n includes the police, Courts, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and many government departments. \nA fully-functional law enforcement and criminal justice system within the EU needs to share data in an appropriate manner to protect the public and the rights of individuals. \nThe DPFD achieves this well. It provides a flexible framework which is principles based and places minimum burdens on the criminal justice system. It ensures \nUK\n citizens are protected while simultaneously allowing for the necessary data sharing on criminal matters. By participating in this measure the \nUK\n ensures\n that law enforcement can effectively share data with EU partners without unnecessary red tape or costly burdens\n. \nThe measure is considered “vital” by the Association of Chief Police Officers. In their evidence to the inquiry undertaken by the \nHouse of \nLords E\nuropean \nU\nnion\n Committee they said “the \nUK\n needs to remain a part of this measure. The reason is that other states may not agree to share such data with any other state under these provisions unless they remain within it”. \n&#xa0;\nThe DPFD additionally provides the data protection framework for many other \npost-Lisbon \nEU JHA measures. These include the Child Sexual Exploitation Directive\n (2012/92/EU)\n, the Victims Directive\n (2012/29/EU) \nand the \nCybercrime Directive\n (2013\n/\n40/EU\n)\n. Participation in the DPFD therefore means that the \nUK\n will be able to fully compliant with these instruments\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMutual Recognition of Financial Penalties (MRFP)&#xa0;\nThe MRFP ensures that offenders are not able to evade financial penalties\n&#xa0;\nsimply because they do not live in the \nMember\n \nState\n where they offend. The measure maintains\n&#xa0;\nany deterrent effect of a financial penalty even for people who are resident elsewhere in the \nUnion\n. For example, visitors in the \nUK\n from another \nMember\n \nState\n&#xa0;\nmay be less inclined to commit road traffic offences if they know they will likely still have to pay the resulting fine imposed for any offence. \n&#xa0;The Framework Decision applies to fines, fines registered as a result of fixed penalty notices, compensation orders, victims surcharge and court costs.\n&#xa0;\nThe enforcing \nMember\n \nState\n that collects the financial penalty\n&#xa0;\nwill generally\n&#xa0;\nkeep it (other than compensation monies that\n&#xa0;\nwould generally be\n&#xa0;\nremitted back to the victim) as there are often costs associated with enforcement.\n&#xa0;\n The key aim of the measure\n&#xa0;\nis to\n&#xa0;\nbroaden the effectiveness of financial penalties imposed by Member States\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2012\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
