[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; In contrast to other disciplines, STEM is perceived as a route to demonstrating personal achievement, rather than as an endeavour which improves peoples’ lives as a whole.&#xa0;5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Within some STEM fields (for example, chemistry, computational science, theoretical physics, etc.), independent work tends to be valued more than collaborative work which in turn tends to favour male success factors. For example, Universities require senior staff to establish and lead their own independent research groups; individually-authored publications are a major measure of ability.&#xa0;5.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; STEM careers are often portrayed to be both all-consuming and overwhelmingly competitive. There is a strong preconception that one cannot participate in science on anything other than a completely immersive basis.&#xa0;&#xa0;5.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; STEM careers characteristically progress according to the prestige built amongst peers, which is perceived to be in contrast to preferred measures of success favoured by women.&#xa0;5.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; STEM career progression focusses on quantity as the most important measure of productivity (e.g. number of publications, citations, H-index) which militates against career breaks or reduced working hours.&#xa0;5.6.&#xa0;&#xa0; Evaluation of success in STEM jobs typically relies heavily on ‘quantity’ (see above), technical ability and intellectual rigor, but often fails to formally highlight and recognise facets of ability which have a significant impact on actual performance. For example, academic scientists spend a considerable proportion of their time communicating (in articles, at conferences and seminars), networking, writing grant proposals, supervising students, managing staff, teaching and - increasingly - performing public outreach activities and working on the commercial exploitation of their findings. Failure to recognise the importance of these overarching activities potentially reinforces gender bias.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;7.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; “I am not good enough for STEM”. Women come to believe that they do not have the talent, skills, or motivation required to advance in a STEM career. They perceive their male peers as better prepared or more motivated than they are.&#xa0;7.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; “STEM is not for me”.Women perceive that STEM careers do not play to their strengths or motivations.&#xa0;7.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; “In order to succeed in STEM, one has to sacrifice relationships and family”Women fear that a career in STEM cannot be reconciled with their (future) domestic life. In contrast, WiSTEM members are keen to emphasise that their own experiences differ and an academic STEM job often offers greater flexibility than a teaching job when it comes to raising a family.&#xa0;7.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; “A STEM career requires too much commitment and too many sacrifices for a job with little stability in the early stages and relatively low financial returns.”The short term nature and need to be highly geographically mobile, particularly during early-career, is a major obstacle highlighted by women, especially when contrasted with the financial rewards and stability other careers with such demands can bring in the long term.&#xa0;When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?&#xa0;&#xa0;11.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Raise general awareness that STEM has historically been a male dominated field and that both women and men need to work towards reducing any continuing in-built bias. This might include awareness-raising for staff at all levels within STEM organisations, as well as targeted training for individuals involved in recruiting and developing staff.. It may be appropriate for peer-review processes to be reviewed such that any unconscious bias in assessments can be removed from processes and procedures. &#xa0;11.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Instigate dialogue about the STEM culture and diversity and equality issues by holding high visibility lectures followed by discussions. An example of good practice comes from the South African Institute of Physics which always includes in its annual conference a plenary lecture on Women in Physics (this year given by a member of our network).&#xa0;11.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; PhD supervisors, university tutors and people managing STEM personnel should be trained to take into account gender differences, for instance the Royal Society of Chemistry reports that female chemistry PhDs find the experience to be too isolating.&#xa0;&#xa0;11.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Funding bodies should require diversity training on the part of its grant recipients, as well as the training of their own staff managing grant applications.&#xa0;11.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; When sponsoring conferences and other networking events, funding bodies should state that the list of invited speakers is expected to comprise both men and women, and that justification is required when a suitable degree of diversity is not demonstrated. Funding bodies should also review the limitations on number of years since PhD for eligibility for some fellowships. This criterion should be revised to take career breaks into account. For the latter points, an example of such good practice comes from the London Mathematical Society. &#xa0;11.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; PhD courses should include training on skills necessary for career advancement such as writing effective grant proposals and successful networking activities, as well as awareness-raising with regard to gender bias.&#xa0;11.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Senior management and leaders of STEM organisations should endeavour to discourage a long-working-hours culture and promote positive work/life balance for all staff. Flexible working arrangements for both men and women should be promoted wherever it can be seen to have no negative impact on productivity. In general, job descriptions should be created that can be easily divided into part-time “chunks” that can be shared among several people. Ideally, there should be an aspiration for meetings to be only held during core hours of the day, e.g. between 9:30 and 3pm, and attendance at meetings (especially if international) via videolink should be routinely enabled whenever possible.&#xa0;11.8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Senior management and leaders of STEM organisations should endeavour to recognise that both women and men have responsibilities outside of work and make reasonable allowances equally for both genders when this does not impact negatively on productivity over the medium timescale. Initiatives should encourage equality of caring duties. For example, encourage male employees to take their turn picking their children up from school and take time off when a child is sick - too many schemes, such as flexible and part time working, seem to be aimed at helping women juggle and cope, but still assume that the women do more than their share of the domestic and caring duties. Where possible, allow both men and women to work part time on a temporary basis if there is a problem in the family, without losing full-time status. Employers should recognise the increasing need for long term care of elderly relatives will be a significant trend over the coming years and recognise the need for gender equality among carers.&#xa0;11.9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Quantitative measures of staff and job applicants’ productivity such as number of papers published and h-index should be replaced with a comprehensive evaluation of the person’s contribution to the organisation and the field. For example, they should provide acknowledgement and credit for tasks such as organisation of group seminars, engagement with visiting school-children, mentoring junior colleagues, taking on placement students, acting as counsellors, to name just a few.&#xa0;11.10.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; STEM professions should be more effectively marketed to both genders. Whilst leading edge STEM is clearly driven by tackling very difficult intellectual challenges, this does not mean that success is founded solely on playing on personal ambition and individual recognition, which some of our members feel to be the case. An alternative approach might be to better emphasise STEM’s role in bringing changes to society, helping solve global problems and making people’s lives better through collaborative working and co-operation. &#xa0;11.11.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; With regard to recruitment, when preparing adverts for vacancies, the advert content and language used should appeal to both genders. In promotion and internal recruitment procedures, all eligible candidates should be actively encouraged to apply. This should help compensate for the tendency of women not to put themselves forward which some of our members have witnessed. It is the experience of many women in our network that ambition is not considered a trait that women should display or admit to. &#xa0;11.12.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Peer-reviewed STEM journals should not communicate the manuscript’s author’s names to the reviewers.&#xa0;11.13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In order to counteract the lack of job stability, the employment structure of many research groups should be modified. At the moment these consist of one group leader with a permanent position and a number of postdoctoral research associates (referred to as postdocs) on fixed term contracts, in addition to PhD students. We propose that the role of senior postdocs should be professionalized by the creation of the permanent role of “researcher” to be associated with groups. This is the structure of research groups in other Countries such as Italy where the retention of women in STEM careers is much higher.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?&#xa0;&#xa0;14.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Require that universities and other employers of STEM staff choose and set organisational targets on numbers of women at the different career stages and on equal pay. These targets should be made public, together with data on the number of women and pay reviews.&#xa0;14.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Create a national mentoring scheme where women at all career stages are paired with a women or man in a more advanced career stage&#xa0;14.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Offer a career advising service to all PhD students which addresses the issues of work/life balance, including real life testimonials. &#xa0;14.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Offer starter grants specifically aimed at early career women researchers in STEM, and grants for students and post-docs, regardless of gender, returning after a career break.&#xa0;14.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our political leaders should engage in a conversation with the nation about gender issues, in particular on the social and economic advantages of sharing work, domestic commitments, and caring responsibilities (for children, the disabled and the elderly) more equally between men and women. &#xa0;14.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Equalise the rights of women and men with respect to parental leave and make sure that the ratio between pay and childcare costs always makes it more advantageous for both parents to work.&#xa0;14.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Liaise with other governments, the EU and organisations such as the World Economic Forum, which lists the gender issue as one of the key issues to tackle in order to improve the state of the world.&#xa0;14.8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Encourage the Research Councils and other funding bodies to support interdisciplinary research on women in STEM, the STEM culture, and to gather statistics and data especially aimed at quantifying the effects of gender bias in STEM jobs.&#xa0;
