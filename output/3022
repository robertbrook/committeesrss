defaultExceptional funding is no answdefaulterdefault&#xa0;defaultAlthough narrowing the scope of legal aid, we intend to provide a safety net. The exceptional funding scheme established in the Bill will provide funding for an excluded case where failure to do so would amount to a breach of a person's right to legal 
defaultaid under the Human Rights Act or European Union law.

defaultCase A (from meeting with Exceptional Cases Team of 1 July)defaultApplicant lacked capacity in the technical sense. There was no one to instruct t
defaulthe litigation friend. The official solicitor had given instructions for an application for exceptional funding to be made. This was refused. The refusal of funding suggested that the applicant (and official solicitor) read the exceptional funding guidance 
defaultwith care.

defaultCase of NdefaultAppellant is a seven year old child with autism. 
defaultBorn in the UK and has lived all his life here. He is here with mother, neither have any status. Her appeal was dismissed but solicitors managed to pursue his appeal to the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber before the Legal Aid, Sentencing and 
defaultPunishment of Offenders act 2013 came into force (at which point it would not have received funding.  The appeal was dismissed by the Upper Tribunal but permission was granted permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The case was then remitted to the U
defaultpper Tribunal but by then there was no legal aid for the case. The application for exceptional funding was refused. The not for profit organisation dealing with the case applied for a review.  The Tribunal refused an adjournment and suggested that the not 
defaultfor profit represent for free or that he pays privately (his mother is in receipt of asylum support).  On the eve of the hearing, the Home Office granted leave

default&#xa0;defaultTrafficking cases (x two)defaultBoth cases had been referred to the Home Office as the “competent authority” under the National Referral Mechanism to determine 
defaultwhether there were reasonable grounds for thinking that the applicants had been trafficked.  No reasonable grounds decision has been made in either case – delays continue for many months.  Therefore applications for exceptional funding were made as advice 
defaultwould not wait. Both applications were refused.  The reason given was that the case is outside the scope of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.

defaultI am driven to conclude that the claimants’ detention was deliberately planned with a view to what in my judgment was a collateral and improper purpose - the 
defaultspiriting away of the claimants from the jurisdiction before there was likely to be time for them to obtain and act upon legal advice or apply to the court. That purpose was improper. It was unlawful. And in my judgment it renders the detention itself unla
defaultwful.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat the present case and others like it reveal, in my judgment, is at best an unacceptable disregard by the Home Office of the rule of law, at worst an unacceptable disdain by the Home Office for the rule law, which is as depressing as it ought to 
defaultbe concerning.

defaultOOO &amp; orsdefault [2011] EWHC 1246 (QB)defaultThe claimants succeeded in establishing that the police had violated 
defaulttheir Article 4 rights by failing to investigate their allegations. At the time of the proceedings the claimants were a

defaultone (OOO) who had been granted
defaultstatus by the time she applied for funding but who had

defaultWdefaultW was accepted to meet all parts of the definition of 
defaulttrafficking definition, having been exploited for
default 
defaultdomestic servitude and forced prostitution, yet deemed not to be a victim because she had “moved
default 
defaulton” by continuing to
default attend therapy.
default&#xa0;
defaultFdefaultF was trafficked for domestic servitude. Her visa expired in August 2012. Her traffickers (who had control of her passport, and her movements. made an in-time application for an extension of her visa. In November 2012 she escaped her traffickers, who wrote
default then to the Home Office in her name, withdrawing the application and saying that she wanted to return home. In response, the Home Office sent her application papers and her passport to her previous employers' address, in December 2012 - despite having bee
defaultn notified in writing that all correspondence should go to 
defaultKalayaan
default, a charity working 
defaultwith migrant domestic workers. Her Embassy was unable to obtain her passport from the previous employers.    She was now working for a new employer - but unlawfully, sin
defaultce her application had been withdrawn with her knowledge or intention, as 
defaultKalayaan
default discovered when they made enquiries of the Home Office.   A specialised organisation providing legal advice to trafficked persons helped her to pursue a claim against her tr
defaultaffickers in the Employment Tribunal, and an out of time application for further leave as a migrant domestic. This was granted because of compassionate circumstances.  At no stage was F referred to eh National Referral Mechanism for a decision that she was
default a trafficked person.  She preferred to be self-supporting since her family was dependent on her salary.   
default&#xa0;
defaultHad she gone to her lawyers after 1 April 2014, to get legal aid she would have to have been referred to the National Referral Mechanism which would have delayed her application for a visa by possibly several months.  Meanwhile she would have remained unla
defaultwfully in the UK, and lost an opportunity to remain self-supporting by work. Delay would also have prejudiced the visa application. If the residence test were implemented then were she to receive a negative 'reasonable grounds' decision, she would have no 
defaultway of challenging that by way of judicial review, because the residence test would kick in. 
defaultAdefaultA is a trafficked person. He fled his country during a family feud which cost the life of his brother and saw him violently attacked.  The agent who helped him 
defaultto flee in 2009 took his passport and he was made to undertake forced 
defaultlabour
default for the next five years in a restaurant, working seven days a week. He
default slept on a mattress on the floor of the food store room and was never paid more than £60 a week. He was thre
defaultatened that immigration would remove him. He met his partner at a the restaurant and went to live with her.  They have two children and expect a third.  She and the children have recently been granted settlement.  His case is complex because he escaped tra
defaultfficking some time ago.  He needs advice on his options.  Even if he were to claim asylum there is currently no legal aid for his claim based on Article 8. An application for exceptional funding was made to o
defaultbtain evidence in support of his Article 8 claim
default while the decision under the National Referral Mechanism is awaited and make the appropriate applications insofar as these were not asylum cases and thus out of scope.  Exceptional funding was refused and this was upheld on review. An 
defaultapplication for judi
defaultcial review of the Legal Aid Agency was prepared.  The Agency maintains its decision.  
defaultAfter several attempts, emergency legal aid funding to challenge the Legal Aid Agency's refusal of exceptional funding was obtained; the case is pending. It has taken al
defaultmost six months to get his case for access to legal aid before a judge - although Article 12 of Directive 2011/36/EU, the 
defaultDirective of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and pr
defaultotecting its victims
default defaultstates that victims of trafficking are entitled to 'early legal advice'.   The residence test would make it impossible to bring the challenge to the refusal of funding.
default 
default&#xa0;defaultLydiadefaultLydia was referred to her representatives in March 2013 by 
defaultKalayaan
default, a charity assisting migrant domestic workers.  She had been trafficked to the UK from the Philippines for the purposes of domestic servitude and forced to work up to 15 hours a day, 7 day
defaults a week. Lydia’s passport was taken from her and she was not allowed to leave the house unaccompanied. She was paid £139 per month paid into an account in her home country. In late 2011, when the traffickers travelled abroad Lydia escaped. She obtained ne
defaultw employment but her new employer similarly exploited her.  Complaints met with threats of denunciation to the police and other authorities, as an illegal worker.  When she sought to leave she was subjected to both verbal and physical abuse and imprisoned.
default When two days later the door was unlocked so that the employer could go to work Lydia, having taken employers’ children to school, fled.  
defaultLydia issue breach of contracted and protection from harassment proceedings against her second employer, these compl
defaultaints to be heard in mid-2014. Under the post 1 April 2013 funding regime Lydia would not receive legal aid as only complaints raised directly against the trafficker will be funded.  If the proposals were implemented Lydia would thus also not benefit from 
defaultthe exemption from the residence test.

defaultCase of DdefaultD arrived as a child, had Discretionary Leave and applied in-time on form HPDL [Humanitarian Protection/Discretionary Leave, a

defaulton the basis that their own policy said they were roughly five and three quarter years out of time to reject the application as invalid. The Home Office lodged summary grounds asserting that he should still re-apply because they were entitled to be paid a 
defaultfee for the application because it should have been made on FLR (O) [Further Leave to Remain (Other) – form for which a fee is payable].  The case was listed for hearing.  It was argued that back in 2006 when the application was made there was no fee for t

default She wanted support from the Local Authority to start to study again and gain the skills to make her employable.  Her current legal representatives took on the case a year after the deadline for judicial review from t
