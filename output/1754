[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Professor Emma Smith (WSC077)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]This 
[normal]submission
[normal] 
[normal]presents a summary of recent research findings into 
[normal]gendered patterns of participation in post-compulsory 
[normal]STEM 
[normal]education
[normal] in the UK
[normal]. It examines the trajectory of learning which takes students from A-level qualifications, through undergraduate work and into 
[normal]early 
[normal]employment or further study. It also takes a 
[normal]long term view 
[normal]to 
[normal]monitor participation and attainment over an extended period of time.
[normal] The findings suggest that almost three decades of initiatives to increase participation in STEM subjects have had little noticeable impact on the recruitment data and g
[normal]endered patterns of participation persist in several subject areas. 
[normal]This is despite more women entering HE and little gender difference in the entry qualifications for STEM subjects.
[normal] 
[normal]While more women are studying science, as broadly conceived, than ever be
[normal]fore; 
[normal]recruitment to key areas, namely physics and engineering remains stagnant.
[normal] 
[normal]However for those women who do remain in 
[normal]the ‘science stream’, patterns of employment in graduate careers and further study appear relatively equitable
[normal] for most of the main su
[normal]bject groups, however concerns 
[normal]about early employment trajectories
[normal] among the engineering and computer sciences are still apparent.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Data is presented on
[normal] 
[normal]long term
[normal] trends in 
[normal]the 
[normal]participation
[normal] of men and women
[normal] in post-compulsory science
[normal] 
[normal]programmes. The datasets used for this analysis are of the highest quality available and they represent many hundreds of thousands of individuals
[normal] (see appendix for further information on the datasets used)
[normal]. They enable us to take a long term view on how 
[normal]th
[normal]e 
[normal]participation of male and female students in post-compulsory STEM subjects has been shaped by an expanding HE sector and allow us to evaluate the long term impact of policies and initiatives which have aimed to encourage more young women, in particular, 
[normal]to study the sciences. 
[normal]The results presented here span three phases of post-compulsory STEM training: attainment at A-level, uptake of STEM subjects at undergraduate level and the 
[normal]early
[normal] career destinations of recent STEM graduates.
[normal] They address the followi
[normal]ng research questions:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 Participation
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]A consideration of long term trends in participation in 
[normal]A-level
[normal] pure science courses (biology, chemistry and physics) suggests that not one of these subjects appears
[normal] to be thriving. In physics there are now fewer male students studying the subject than in the 1960s, with numbers in decline since the early 1990s (Graph
[normal] 1). The stability in the female participation figures comes despite initiatives (such as 
[normal]GIST and WISE)
[normal] that focus on encouraging girls to study physics after the age of 16. While t
[normal]here is no evidence
[normal] to suggest
[normal] that female candidates are being turned awa
[normal]y from 
[normal]studying A-level physics
[normal] in greater numbers
[normal] 
[normal]than previously,
[normal] there is nothing to suggest that 
[normal]these 
[normal]initiatives have had a notably positive effect on recruitment either.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Until relatively recently A-level chemistry was a male dominated subject (Graph 2). From the early 1990s there has been a gradual narrowing of th
[normal]e participation gap
[normal]. This has
[normal] largely been due to a decline in the number of male candidates
[normal], although numbers are starting to increase. 
[normal]The introduction of compulsory science 
[normal]in the late 1980s
[normal] 
[normal]appears in itself to have 
[normal]had no noticeable impact on A-level recruitment to chemistry, for
[normal] either 
[normal]men or women
[normal]. 
[normal]Although w
[normal]e have seen a steady feminisation of the
[normal] subject to the extent to which, at present, 
[normal]participation in A-level 
[normal]c
[normal]hemistry is 
[normal]largely
[normal] gender neutral.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 
[normal]Attainment 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In order to examine how 
[normal]gendered 
[normal]patterns of attainment 
[normal]have
[normal] varied over the history of the A-level we examined changes in the
[normal] relative attainment of male and female students at A-level grade C or higher
[normal]. What this historical 
[normal]overview
[normal] shows is that the 
[normal]gender achievement gap 
[normal]in the pure sciences has hardly varied over the last five decades providing no evidence that male student
[normal]s have ever outperformed females at this level
[normal].
[normal] For example, in physics 
[normal]there has been some shifting of the achievement gap in favour of female candidates
[normal] s
[normal]ince the 
[normal]mid
[normal]-
[normal]1990s
[normal] (Graph 3).
[normal] 
[normal]However the 
[normal]gap is negligible and overall it can be said that attainme
[normal]nt at the higher grade levels is gender neutral.
[normal] The same is true for chemistry. U
[normal]ntil the late 1990s 
[normal]there was no difference in the proportion of male and female candidates achieving a grade C or higher in A-level chemistry, m
[normal]ore recently the achievement 
[normal]gap has 
[normal]moved to be slightly
[normal] in favour of female candidates. 
[normal]As with physics, t
[normal]his appears to coincide with 
[normal]a 
[normal]decline in the number of men entered for the subject
[normal], which may suggest that c
[normal]hemistry is losing some of its higher attaining male entrants. However, the achievement gap between 
[normal]men and women
[normal] is still relatively small suggesting that 
[normal]attainment in c
[normal]hemistry
[normal] at 
[normal]this level
[normal] is gender neutral.
[normal]A positive value indicates overall higher achievement among female candidates
[normal]. Values of less than 4% are not considered to represent a noticeable gap
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1 
[normal]The expansion of the UK Higher Education system over the last twenty years or so is reflected in a quadrupling of the number of candidates offered places to study
[normal] at undergraduate level
[normal]. 
[normal]This
[normal] increase is particularly apparent among previously under-represented groups: i
[normal]n 1986, 47,696 women accepted places on UCCA and PCAS-administered HND and 
[normal]first 
[normal]degree programmes; b
[normal]y 20
[normal]12
[normal] this had risen to
[normal] over
[normal] 2
[normal]25
[normal],0
[normal]00
[normal]. The early 1990s saw the end of long e
[normal]stablished trends of 
[normal]HE
[normal] courses recruiting more male candidates. Now more female candidates 
[normal]apply and are accepted, a rate of increase since 1994 which has been faster than that for men (Graph 
[normal]4
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]Since 1986, the 
[normal]different 
[normal]STEM 
[normal]subject groups
[normal] have tended to recruit a steady share of female candidates with rates only varying by around 1-2 percentage points. For example, in 1986 5% of 
[normal]all places accepted by female candidates were in the Physical Sciences, this has varied only slightly in the intervening years, although currently the trend is towards a slightly lower share 
[normal](3%) 
[normal]of female candidates who are accepted to study this group of
[normal] subjects. 
[normal]Almost half of all places on STEM undergraduate courses are now taken by women, a proportion which, as Graph 5 shows, has steadily increased since 1986 and is in line with the increasing numbers of women studying at university. 
[normal]While this sugges
[normal]ts that a relatively large and stable proportion of women do wish to study science (as broadly conceived), 
[normal]gender stereotyped patterns of subject choice still persist
[normal] - over 50% of candidates studying 
[normal]the 
[normal]b
[normal]iological and 
[normal]medical s
[normal]ciences 
[normal]are female
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]while 
[normal]the proportion o
[normal]f female students studying the engineering s
[normal]ciences has hardly varied over the period considered
[normal] (Graph 5)
[normal].

[normal]The extent to which certain 
[normal]science 
[normal]subjects continue to divi
[normal]de students according to their 
[normal]sex
[normal] can be seen 
[normal]in Table 1
[normal] below. 
[normal]While trends ha
[normal]ve varied for certain subjects
[normal], indeed higher proportions of women

[normal]m
[normal]athematics, gender ster
[normal]eotyped patterns of participation 
[normal]do still

[normal]T
[normal]he stability of many of these participation figures is quite remarkable. Physics
[normal] for example,
[normal] despite 
[normal]many initiatives
[normal] to increase the numbers who study the subject
[normal],
[normal] continues to recruit around 3000 u
[normal]ndergraduate students (male and female
[normal]) each year
[normal]. T
[normal]he robust

[normal] figures for female p
[normal]hysics and

[normal]ngineering candid
[normal]ates is illustrated in Graph 6 below.

[normal]5.1 General destinations
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1.1 
[normal]Tables 3a and 3b show the 
[normal]main destinations of male and female graduates
[normal] in the computer and engineering sciences
[normal]. The
[normal] majority of students enter some form of employment, with a 
[normal]relatively 
[normal]small
[normal] proportion 
[normal]entering further study
[normal]. This trend differs from the physical, biological and mathematical sciences where higher proportions of students enter further study (around one third
[normal] of physical science graduates, both male and female, u
[normal]ndertake further study
[normal],
[normal] for example)
[normal]. As the tables show, there is some fluctuation in the trends over the period considered but the proportions of m
[normal]en and women at each stage tend
[normal] to be reasonably similar.

[normal].2
[normal] Well over half of engineering science students who enter employment remain in the field, indeed by far the largest recruiter of engineering graduates are the engineering 
[normal]professional occupations (civil engineers, production engineers and so on). However, this is an area where gender stereotypes patterns of participation persist and to some extent they remain when female engineers leave education and enter the workforce, es
[normal]pecially when the proportions who enter professional occupations is considered. Gende
[normal]red recruitment patterns among m
[normal]athematical s
[normal]cience graduates are relatively slight
[normal] with a
[normal] large proportion of these graduates who enter employment work
[normal]ing
[normal] in the 
[normal]business
[normal] and f
[normal]inance 
[normal]sector
[normal]. Having a computer science degree, 
[normal]o
[normal]n the other hand, appears to be more of an advantage for men, in terms of entry to graduate professions – note in particular that almost 30% of female computer science graduates are in relatively unsk
[normal]illed jobs six months after graduation. This later trend is one that exists to a certain degree between men and women in each of the three subject areas considered here.

[normal]g longer term trends in employment participation. Note the difference in

[normal] 
[normal]As Table 
[normal]5
[normal] shows, 
[normal]in the physical sciences, the majority of graduates who enter employment work in managerial, professional or technical fields (SOC1-3). Gender differences are relatively small in terms of occupational
[normal] destinations for chemistry and physics graduates
[normal], who were generally more likely to be working in a field related to their degree subject. Occupations in the business and statistical professional group (namely accountancy and economist jobs) were particul
[normal]arly appealing to recent physics graduates, while relatively high proportions of chemists were employed as science professionals or technicians. There are some differences in the types of employment sought by physics graduates, namely teaching for women an
[normal]d ICT roles for men, but otherwise the types of jobs taken by both groups is fairly similar. Among chemistry graduates a higher proportion of women take jobs as science professionals and or as teachers but otherwise, patterns again are relatively similar f
[normal]or men and women. In contrast to several other subjects examined here, relatively small proportions of physics graduates, of either sex, undertake employment in routine occupations (SOC6-9). However, 
[normal]there is a large difference in the proportions of physic
[normal]al science graduates entering professional fields
[normal] (33% and 23% for men and women respectively). In the biological sciences, the largest recruiter appears to be the associate professional/technical group with relatively few graduates entering professional o
[normal]ccupations within six months of graduation. With the exception of the relatively high proportion of male biological science graduates undertaking managerial type work (13%), gender differences in terms of occupational destination among this group appear li
[normal]mited.

[normal]6.1 
[normal]This 
[normal]submission has presented findings from recent and on-going research projects that have tracked the
[normal] gendered patterns of partic
[normal]i
[normal]pation
[normal] 
[normal]in STEM-related 
[normal]post-compulsory education
[normal] in the UK
[normal]. It has examined the trajectory of learning which takes students from A-level qualifications, through undergraduate work and into employment or further study. As well as looking at how levels of engagemen
[normal]t between men and women var
[normal]y at each stage
[normal], the research reported here has also taken a long term view and considered the best available evidence to monitor participation and attainment over
[normal] an extended period of
[normal] time.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2 D
[normal]espite 
[normal]many years of 
[normal]initiatives 
[normal]to encourage more women into STEM education and careers
[normal], 
[normal]women
[normal] 
[normal]remain under-represented 
[normal]in
[normal] many parts of
[normal] the field 
[normal]and as the
[normal] results presented here show
[normal], levels of unequal participation in key STEM subjects have varied little over the last twe
[normal]nty five years. T
[normal]h
[normal]is is despite more
[normal] women
[normal] entering HE and little 
[normal]gender 
[normal]difference in 
[normal]the entry
[normal] qualifications
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] STEM subjects
[normal]. So i
[normal]f qualification is not a barrier
[normal] to participation, then why ha
[normal]ve
[normal] the 
[normal]increased number of women studying in HE not
[normal] been 
[normal]reflected in
[normal] subjects such as physics and engineering?
[normal] The answer according to much of the literature in this area 
[normal]appears to
[normal] lie in the various socio-cultural barriers 
[normal]to 
[normal]STEM 
[normal]education
[normal] 
[normal]which women experience. 
[normal]Indeed
[normal] t
[normal]he data presented here 
[normal]shows
[normal] that wom
[normal]en are engaged with science and wish to study the subject at t
[normal]he
[normal] highest levels. 
[normal]Rather
[normal], the types of science 
[normal]subjects
[normal] they study, and p
[normal]sychology is a notable example here, are not
[normal] necessarily
[normal] t
[normal]hose
[normal] which policy makers and employers 
[normal]consider to be the ‘
[normal]str
[normal]ategic, important 
[normal]and
[normal] vulnerable
[normal]’ science
[normal] 
[normal]subject
[normal]s.
[normal] 
[normal]Women are 
[normal]also 
[normal]studying 
[normal]many 
[normal]science 
[normal]subject
[normal]s in higher numbers tha
[normal]n previously
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] yet recruitment to
[normal] subjects such as
[normal] physics and engineering remains stagnant.
[normal] This may be a reflection of the critical mass 
[normal]model which suggests that female recruitment to these subjects is still too low to
[normal] 
[normal]be
[normal] 
[normal]self-sustaining
[normal] 
[normal]and generate future growth. However,
[normal] 
[normal]it is 
[normal]importa
[normal]n
[normal]t to remember that numbers of m
[normal]ale participants in 
[normal]physi
[normal]cs
[normal] and engineering subjects
[normal] are 
[normal]also stable.
[normal] 
[normal]In addition,
[normal] f
[normal]or women who do
[normal] remain in the ‘
[normal]STEM
[normal] 
[normal]pipeline
[normal]’, patterns of employment in graduate careers and further study appear relatively equitable: over half of all chemistry and physics
[normal] graduates (male and female) who enter employment remain in the field and similar proportions engage in further study.
[normal] 
[normal]However there are some notable exceptions, especially among the engineering and computer sciences where 
[normal]in the later subject, relatively 
[normal]high proportions of graduates are unemployed or undertaking relatively low skilled jobs.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.3 
[normal]It is very difficult to provide policy recommendations that will easily remedy inequalities in the numbers of women who participate in physics
[normal],
[normal] engineering
[normal] and co
[normal]mputer science
[normal] in HE. Decades of well-funded and well-targeted initiatives have had limited impact and even mak
[normal]ing all young people study the sciences 
[normal]up to the age of 16 had little long term 
[normal]effect 
[normal]on recruitment 
[normal]at the next educational level
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal]As male an
[normal]d female students achieve at similar levels in gateway qualification
[normal]s
[normal], there is limited evidence that attainment is a barrier to participation and 
[normal]for women who do study these shortage subjects evidence suggests that many are likely to remain in the field 
[normal]upon graduation. Whatever socio-cultural barriers 
[normal]are preventing the recent expansion of the HE system being reflected in female participation in physics and engineering, they 
[normal]appear to also apply to men
[normal], to some extent,
[normal] and 
[normal]seem
[normal] largely unaffected by gend
[normal]er
[normal]-
[normal]related widening participation initiatives.

[normal]A1 [bold]Sources of data[bold]A1.1 Post-compulsory schooling: data were obtained electronically and as hard copy from a number of government departments and other official organisations, including the Department for Children, Schools and Families (and its predecessors the Department fo
[normal]r Education and Skills and Department for Education and Science), the former Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, the Joint Council for Qualification, the Institute of Physics and the 
[normal]Assessment and Qualifications Alliance

[normal]A1.2 Higher Education: D
[normal]ata
[normal] retrieved from the Universities Central Admissions Service (UCAS) 
[normal]were used to investigate patterns of participation in STEM first degree and Higher National Diploma programmes at UK universities. 
[normal]A1.3 Graduate destinations: Data on participation in furt
[normal]her study and employment destinations were retrieved from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). Analysis of the UCAS data shows that the majority of STEM graduates are UK-domiciled, full-time students, so the focus here was limited to this group. 
[normal]The HESA first destination survey gathers information on the activities of graduates six months after they leave university. Response rates tend to be relatively high: for the Physical Sciences they are over 80%. It is recognised that this dataset only con
[normal]siders destinations six months after the student has left university and that career trajectories may be very different in the subsequent period. However, it tells us a great deal about the sorts of jobs that are available to science graduates.
