[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Research Councils UK (WSC023)[bold]Research Councils UK (RCUK) believe that investment in attracting, training
[normal] 
[normal]and managing the next generation 
[normal]of world-class researchers makes a major
[normal] 
[normal]contribution to the impact of research and benefits the economic and social
[normal] 
[normal]wellbeing of the UK.
[normal]We will use our position and influence to lead cultural change in the HE sector,
[normal] 
[normal]in particular through our support for
[normal] the Vitae® Programme
[normal] and the Concordat
[normal] to Support the Career Development of Researchers
[normal], and the development of our recently published statement of expectations 
[normal](see below) 
[normal]which describes how we expect those in receipt of our funding to promote and lead
[normal] cultural change in relation to equality and diversity.
[normal]Our vision is:
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]to ensure that the best potential researchers from a diverse 
[normal]population
[normal] are
[normal] attracted into research careers
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]to enhance the quality of research training and the employability of early
[normal] 
[normal]st
[normal]age researchers
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]to enhance the impact of UK researchers by promoting improved career
[normal] 
[normal]development and management of research staff by research organisations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An organization’s success and 
[normal]competitiveness depends on its ability to embrace diversity
[normal]and draw on the skills, understanding and experience of its people. The potential rewards of
[normal]diversity are significant: recruiting staff from the widest possible pool will unlock talent and
[normal]make a
[normal] major contribution to the impact of research and will benefit the economic and social
[normal]wellbeing of the UK. RCUK expects that equality and diversity therefore is embedded at all
[normal]levels and in all aspects of normal research practice.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]RCUK expect those in r
[normal]eceipt of Research Council funding to:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]promote and lead cultural change in relation to equalities and diversity
[normal] 
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]engage staff at all levels with improving the promotion of equality and diversity
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]ensure all members of the research workforce are trained and
[normal] supported to address  disincentives and indirect obstacles to recruitment, retention and progression in research careers
[normal]•
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]provide evidence of ways in which equality and diversity issues are managed at both
[normal] 
[normal]an institutional and department level
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Why do num
[normal]bers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What 
[normal]are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?
[normal]What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?
