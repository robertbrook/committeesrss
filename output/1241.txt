[[[years.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[ ]]]The Royal Mail cost of operations for the UniversalService was £5.65bn in 2005-6. People costs represented68.6% of this figure. (Source Royal Mail Group Regulatory FinancialStatements 2005-6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;7.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One of the founding principles in the introduction of all staff when first joining Royal Mail is that the company remains a social network for isolated communities. By the inevitable introduction of economic value placed on these communities they would become even more isolated and due to the fact nationwide broadband is falling behind schedule we will see the elderly in particular cut off from family and friends.&#xa0;7.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  This has been highlighted in reports from Charities representing the elderly in the UK. Many of the postal staff that is on rural deliveries have been on that delivery for a number of years, and become friends of their customers?&#xa0;7.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; If there is no impact on the USO by the privatisation, how is it possible for the competitors (TNT) to deliver within central London only every other day per household?  With their staff employed on zero hour contracts and minimum wage?&#xa0;7.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; If the Royal Mail were privatised would the VAT exception on items such as PPI be removed?&#xa0;7.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As Postcomm and now Ofcom are unable to make a decision whether or not the Business Collection, be part of the USO, would privatisation impact greater on rural business?&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The Ofcom’s statutory duty reproduced below has limited protection for the USO.]]]

[[[Ofcom’s statutory duty, under section 29 of the Act, is to secure the provision of a universal service (see section 29(2)). In carrying out this duty, Ofcom must have regard to: ]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[The need for the provision of a universal service to be financially sustainab]]]

[[[le. This expressly includes the need for the universal service provider to make a reasonable commercial rate of return on expenditure incurred for the purpose of, or in connection with, the provision of the univ]]]

[[[ersal service (see s29 (4)); and]]]

[[[ The need for]]]

[[[ the provision of a universal service to be efficient before the end of a reasonable period and for its provision to continue to be efficient at all subsequent times. 3.5 Any regulatory conditions imposed by Ofcom must take account of these duties. ]]]

[[[ so the withdrawal of services on a da]]]

[[[The ]]]

[[[condition does not give Ofcom the power to accept or reject an operator’s proposals. It is not akin to an authorisation process but simply a system of advanced notification. Ofcom has the power]]]

[[[5 ]]]

[[[to impose general universal service conditions (“GUSCs”) on o]]]

[[[perators providing a service within the scope of the universal service. Services within the scope of the universal service are defined in section 40 of the Act. General universal ]]]

[[[service conditions are generally applicable and are not specifically attached]]]

[[[ to an individual operator. ]]]7.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As the USO is already at a minimum, and allows Royal Mail competitors to give a minimum service, with the limits place on Ofcom would not the ideal method for the future Royal Mail be to follow TNT’s method and limiting the delivery to every other day over a 6-day period. 7.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Is the protection of the USO, stated by the Secretary of State, limited and open to abuse?7.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; With the removal of licensees and the sale of Royal Mail I feel the privatisation will impact on an increasing unmanageable postal market with a increased drive to the bottom, in both profits and services, as reflected in the Dutch postal system?7.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I believe the Secretary of State has misunderstood the relationship between customers, delivery staff and the history behind centuries of the service given by generations of postal employees.&#xa0;

[[[Share issue and impact on staff]]]&#xa0;

[[[I also have concerns that if the staff accepts the offered shares would they issued under the Growth and infrastructure Act 2013 Para 31, Employee sharehold]]]

[[[Commercial relationship between Royal Mail and Post Office Limited ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]16.              Under the agreement are POL allowed to take Royal Mail competitors mail across their counters.&#xa0;17.              Is the crown office closure plans against the principles as laid out in the Hooper report? Is the threat of crown office closure just another way of privatizing the POL network by individually selling off crown office to sub postmasters or companies such as W H Smiths?&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Executive summary:]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The Secretary of State statement fails to recognize the progress that Royal Mail, CWU and members of staff have made since the Hooper Report. This progress has been seen in both the modernization of the business and i]]]

[[[ncreases in profits since the pension bailout.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[My greatest concern is as indicated the USO is set as a minimum and fails to protect the bulk of the mail that staff deliver on a daily basis 6 days a week. If Royal Mail’s competitors are not faced the same r]]]

[[[estrictions, they will increase in the number of deliveries in urban areas, which will increase the economic pressure on Royal Mail to cut back on uneconomic deliveries and collections.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The Secretary of State fails to take on the concerns of the staff, of all grades within Royal Mail, with the consultative ballots results showing the bulk of staff against privatisation. ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[If privatised my concerns is that we will follow the Dutch Post rou]]]
