"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Judith Curry (IPC0052)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?&#xa0;\nI\n have written a paper entitled ‘No consensus on consensus’\n \nthat argues that\n \nthe\n scientific consensus seeking process used by the IPCC has had the unintended consequence of introducing biases into the both the science and related decision making processes.\n \nC\nognitive biases in the context of an institutionalized consensus building process have arguably resulted in the consensus becoming increasingly confirmed in a self-reinforcing way\n, to the detriment of the scientific process\n. \n&#xa0;\nWhile the IPCC’s consensus approach acknowledges uncertainties, defenders of the IPCC consensus have expended considerable efforts in the \n‘\nboundary work\n’\n of distinguishing those qualified to contribute to the climate change c\nonsensus from those who are not\n.  These efforts have \nattempted to characterize\n \nthose that disagree with the IPCC consensus\n as \nsmall in number\n, extreme\n, and scientifically suspect\n. \n \nThese efforts create temptations to make illegitimate attacks on scientists whose views do not align with \nthe consensus, and to dismiss any disagreement as p\nolitically motivated ‘denialism\n’\n. \n&#xa0;\nA\n large number of climate scientists disagree with the views portrayed by IPCC; many of these scientists are included in desmogblog’s list\n of almost 300 climate change \ndeniers (my name is included on this list).  A reflection of disagreement with the ‘consensus’ is a recent survey\n of the professional members of the American Meteorological Society\n that found \nonly \n52% \nagree\n that most of the warming since 1850 is anthropogenic, which is the principal tenet of the IPCC.  \n              \n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying&#xa0;what is meant by uncertainty in scientific terms? &#xa0;I have been raising concerns\n \nsinc\ne 2003 about how uncertainty surrounding climate change is evaluated and communicated. The IPCC’s efforts to consider uncertainty focus primarily on communicating uncertainty, rather than on characterizing and exploring uncertainty in a way that would be u\nseful for risk managers and resource managers and the institutions that fund science. \nIn a series of three papers\n \nI\n have argued that the characterization of uncertainty by the IPCC is inadequate and leads to overconfidence in the conclusions, particularly with regards to the IPCC statement on attribution. \n&#xa0;\nAnthropogenic climate change is a proposed theory whose basic \nmechanism is well understood, but whose magnitude is highly uncertain owing to feedback processes. We know that climate changes naturally on decadal to century time scales, but we do not have explanations for observed \nhistorical and paleo climate variation\ns, including the warming from 1910-1940 and the mid 20\nth\n century cooling. The competition for the theory of anthropogenic climate change is our recognized ignorance about what we don’t know about natural climate variability. \nThe IPCC’s failure to adequatel\ny characterize uncertainty arises from neglecting to consider indeterminacy and ignorance in their assessments of confidence.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Does the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?&#xa0;The recently released \nIPCC AR5\n \nSummary for Policy Makers (SPM)\n \nof the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5\nth\n Assessment Report makes the following statement:\n&#xa0;\n“\nThere is \nvery high confidence \nthat climate models reproduce the observed large-scale patterns and multi-decadal trends in surface temperature, \nespecially since the mid-20th century\n. (AR5 SPM, p 9)\n \n&#xa0;\nThe IPCC’s own analysis seems to belie this\n statement, as evidenced by Figure 11.25 \nAR5\n. \nThis figure shows that climate models have significantly over-predicted the warming effect of CO2 since 1990, a\n period during which CO2 increased from 335 to over 400 parts per million.  The most recent climate model simulations used in the AR5 indicate \nthat the warming stagnation since 1998 is no longer consistent with model projections even at the 2% confidence l\nevel\n. \n&#xa0;\nUncertainties in climate models and their simulations are associated with incomplete\n understanding of the climate system, inadequacies of numerical solutions employed in computer models, uncertainty in model parameters and parameterizations\n of unresolved processes\n, and also unce\nrtainty in initial conditions. \nModel outcome uncertainty, also referred to as prediction error,\n arises from the propagation of the aforementioned uncertainti\nes through the model simulation\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nThe IPCC AR5 has placed \nhigh confidence on the simulations of climate models, in spite of the fact that climate models have significantly overpredicted the warming for the past two decades.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Has AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?&#xa0;Based upon early (leaked) drafts of the AR5, the IPCC did not even mention \nthis hiatus\n. Apparently the IPCC was pressured by reviewers and its policy maker constituency to address this stagnation specifically.  Here is the r\nelevant text from the final version of the AR5 Summary for Policy Makers:\n&#xa0;\n“\nModels do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10\n \n–15 years.\n” \n(SPM AR5\n)\n&#xa0;\n“\nThere is medium confidence that this difference between models and observations is to a substantial degree caused by unpredictable climate variability, with possible contributions from inadequacies in the solar, volcanic, and aerosol forcings used by the m\nodels and, in some models, from too strong a response to increasing greenhouse-gas forcing.\n”  (SPM AR5)\n&#xa0;\nThe failure of the IPCC to predict this stagnation in warming is raising serious questions about whether climate models are over sensitive to increasin\ng greenhouse gases. The IPCC’s dismissal of the stagnation as being associated with unpredictable climate variability raises the question as to what extent the warming between 1975 and 2000 can also be explained by unpredictable climate variability.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIs the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focused on providing a justification for political commitment?&#xa0;I am increasingly concerned that both the climate change problem and its solution have been vastly oversim\nplified. I am concerned that the consensus seeking process used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has introduced biases and acted to skew the science\n in the direction of self-confirmation\n.\n \n My research on understanding the dynamics of\n uncertainty at the climate science-policy interface has led me to question\n whether these dynamics are operating in a manner that is healthy for \neither \nthe science \nor the policy process\n, acting to hyper-politicize both.\n \nI see a growing\n gap between what sci\nence is currently \nproviding\n in terms of information about \nclimate variability and change \nand the information desired by decision makers\n.\n \n&#xa0;In the 1990’s, the U.S. and other nations\n embarked on a path to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change \nby \nstabilization of the concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases\n, which was codified by the 1992 \nUN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\n treaty\n. The IPCC scientific assessments play a primary role in legitimizing national and international po\nlicies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n \nThis objective has led to the IPCC assessments being framed around identifying anthropogenic influences on climate, \ndangerous \nenvironmental and socio-economic impacts of climate change, and stabilization o\nf CO\n2\n c\noncentrations in the atmosphere.\n&#xa0;\nAt the time of establishment of the UNFCCC, there was as yet no clear signal of anthropogenic warming in the observations, as per the IPCC First Assessment Report (FAR) in 1990.\n It wasn’t until the IPCC’s Second Ass\nessment Report in 1995 that a \n‘discernible’\n human influence on global climate was identified. The scientific support for the UNFCCC treaty was not based on observations, but rather on our theoretical understanding of the greenhouse effect and simulations f\nrom global climate models. \nBy 2006/2007, \nclimate change had soared to the top of the international political agenda\n,\n as a result of Hurricane Katrina, Al Gore’s \nAn Inconvenient Truth\n, publication of the IPCC AR4 in 2007, and award of the Nobel Peace Prize \nto Al Gore and the IPCC.  There was a consensus that the science was settled, and that it clearly demanded radical policy and governmental action to substantially cut CO2 emissions.\n&#xa0;\nNow, at the time of release of the AR5 in 2013,\n we find ourselves between \nthe metaphorical\n rock and a hard place with regards to climate science and policy:\n&#xa0;\nAnd finally:\n&#xa0;\nHow and why did we land between a rock and a hard place on the climate change i\nssue?  There are probably many contributing reasons, but the most fundamental and profound reason is arguably that both the problem and solution were vastly oversimplified back in 1990. This framing was locked in by a self-reinforcing consensus-seeking app\nroach to the science and a ‘speaking consensus to power’ approach for decision making \nthat pointed to only one possible course of policy action – radical emissions reductions. \nThe climate community has worked for more than 20 years to establish a \nscientifi\nc \nconsensus\n on anthropogenic climate change. However, the ongoing scientific consensus seeking process has had the unintended consequence of oversimplifying both the problem and its solution and hyper-politicizing both, introducing biases into the both the\n science and related decision making processes. \n&#xa0;\nT\nhe framing of the \nclimate change \nproblem by the UNFCCC/IPCC and the early articulation of a preferred policy option by the UNFCCC has\n arguably\n marginalized research on broader issues surrounding climate change, and resulted i\nn\n an overconfident assessment of the importance of greenhouse gases in future climate change, and stifled the development of a broader range of policy options.\n \nThe result of\n this simplified framing of a wicked problem is that we lack the kinds of information to more broadly understand climate change and societal vulnerability.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Short Biography&#xa0;\nDr. Judith Curry is Professor and Chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology and President of Climate Forecast Applications Ne\ntwork (CFAN).
