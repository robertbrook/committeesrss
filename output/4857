[normal]Written evidence submitted by[bold] CST[bold] [CT 01][bold]Letter from Richard Benson, Chief Executive, CST, to the Chair of the Committee, 14 June 2013[bold]&#xa0;[bold]In response to your request for information concerning extremist speakers at UK universities for the Home Affairs Committee’s inquiry into international terrorism and crime, please find attached CST’s submission.
[normal]As you will see, we are aware of several incidences of extremist sp
[normal]eakers and antisemitic incident
[normal]s at UK universities that affect the well being of both Jewish students and the wider student community.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]BACKGROUND TRENDS[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]British campuses are generally places where Jewish students feel safe to study and do not 
[normal]suffer 
[normal]antisemitism on a daily basis. However, 
[normal]there are occasions at some Universities and Students’ Unions when Jewish
[normal] students have been exposed to hate preachers, 
[normal]extremist
[normal] groups, radicalised individuals
[normal], disruption of Jewish Society events and even 
[normal]direct incidents of antisemitism.
[normal] Extremist activity can leave students from a range of minorities feeling vulnerable and reluctant to express their identity openly. Antisemitism, when it occurs, often takes place in a context that includes other forms of bigotry and as such targets all minority students, and therefore the student body as a whole. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This academic year (2012-13) has seen an increase in far right activity on campus. Some of this increase
[normal] is part of a cycle of extremism between far right and Islamist extremists
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]ISLAMIST SPEAKERS:[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Al-Haddad is the chairman of 
[normal]London’s 
[normal]Muslim Research and Development Foundation, a
[normal] group 
[normal]that gives Sharia advice on financial matters.
[normal] 
[normal]Al-Haddad has been embroiled in controversy surrounding comments allegedly made in 2001 where it is alleged that he claimed Jews 
[normal]“a
[normal]re the enemies of God and descendants of apes and pigs”.
[normal] 
[normal]He has persistent
[normal]ly denied making those comments.
[normal] An English-language article by Al-Haddad opposes the actions of Al Qaeda but explains that regardless of what Osama bin Laden did, or did not do, “
[normal]it is an established part of our Islamic 
[normal]creed that every Muslim, unlike the disbelievers, will eventually enter paradise
[normal]”. The article also shows various perspectives on what constitutes a “martyr” in combat between Muslims and non-Muslims
[normal].
[normal] Speaking in English, Al-Haddad may be seen on youtube, discussing “why marriages fail”. This includes his saying that no outsider should ask a husband why he is beating his wife, because such matters should be sorted between the couple.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]In February 2010, Tamimi was a speaker at the Federation of Student Islamic Society (FOSIS) Palestine Conference
[normal] held at Manchester University, an Islamic Society event at Cambridge
[normal] and a Palestinian Society event at SOAS.
[normal] During his address to SOAS students, Tamimi called for the destruction of Israel and stated,
[normal]“Today Hamas is considered a terrorist organisation because that’s what the Americans and Israelis and cowardly politicians of Europe want, but what is so terrorist about it? 
[normal]“You shouldn’t be afraid of being labelled extreme, radical or terrorist. If fighting for your home land is terrorism, I take pride in being a terrorist. The Koran tells me if I die for my homeland, I’m a martyr and I long to be a martyr.”
[normal].
[normal]In November 2004, Tamimi told the BBC’s 
[normal]Hardtalk
[normal]: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“If I can go to 
[normal]Palestine
[normal] and sacrifice myself I would do it. Why not?...sacrificing myself for 
[normal]Palestine
[normal] is a noble cause. It is the straight way to pleasing my God and I would
[normal] do it if I had the opportunity
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Uthman Lateef[bold] is a preacher from the Hittin Institute.
[normal] Lateef 
[normal]is alleged to have said, “we don’t accept homosexuality...we hate it because Allan hates it”.
[normal] 
[normal]In January and June 2009, Lateef 
[normal]was an advertised speaker 
[normal]at events where Anwar Al-Awlaki 
[normal](a senior Al-Qaeda figure, later killed by a US drone strike) 
[normal]gave presentations via video link.

[normal]FAR RIGHT [bold]ACTIVITY ON CAMPUS[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Although the disruption of Israel-related events 
[normal]may not be 
[normal]antisemitic
[normal] per se
[normal], it contributes to an environment of tension, hostility and discomfort for Jewish students; often resulting in Jewish students feeling intimidated and 
[normal]unable to express their views or identities
[normal] on their own campus.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Throughout 2012, there were a total of 32 campus-related antisemitic incidents reported to the CST.
[normal] Of these, 18 took place on campus and 14 affected students or academics off campus. Below are some examples:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Hizb ut-Tahrir[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Hizb ut-Tahrir is an Islamist organisation that has a record of offensive and inflammatory statements regarding Jews, non-Muslims, 
[normal]and 
[normal]gay people
[normal], amongst others. 
[normal] 
[normal]They 
[normal]were added to the NUS No Platform policy in 2004, which denies them the ability to be involved with the national union. However
[normal],
[normal] this policy only has an advisory 
[normal]capacity for individual Students’
[normal] Unions. Since then, the organisation has regained 
[normal]some of its p
[normal]resence on campus
[normal] via front-groups
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Muslim Public Affairs Committee:[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Muslim Public Affairs Committee (MPAC) 
[normal]website includes anti-Zionist conspiracy theorising. 
[normal]In 2006
[normal], 
[normal]As
[normal]gh
[normal]ar Bukhari, a found
[normal]er
[normal] of MPAC and its spokesman, 
[normal]was shown to have 
[normal]given money to 
[normal]Holocaust revisionist, 
[normal]David Irving in 2000
[normal];
[normal] and 
[normal]urged others to do likewise
[normal].
[normal] Bukhari stated this was because he had regarded Irving as “anti-Zionist”. In 2004, the National Union of Students described MPAC as antisemitic and banned the group.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following the presence of MPAC at Middlesex University, the Students’ Union held a referendum to reaffirm the Union’s policy of not providing a platform for individuals with racist or fascist views (26
[normal]th
[normal]-27
[normal]th
[normal] February 2013) which received 73% voting yes.
