[[[Plastic bag charge carbon emissions analysis ]]]The Committee has asked if we could provide further information about the carbon emissions analysis which we provided in our written evidence. The Government has not been using a carbon reduction argument as the main basis for the policy to reduce the distribution of single-use plastic carrier bags and increase the number of bags being reused by consumers. The main benefits of this policy are in terms of a reduction in litter on land and at sea. In addition this will also reduce the environmental, resource and economic cost of their production, storage and transport. Until this point in the process, therefore, we had not carried out a thorough review of the relevant carbon data. When we did so an error came to light in an estimate of the benefits carried out in 2012; this over-estimated the carbon impact significantly due to how the original 2006 Environment Agency figures were being used.The analysis set out below therefore differs from that in our original evidence and we would like to take this opportunity to rectify the error.The 2006 Environment Agency’s assessment of the life cycle environmental impacts of different carrier bags presents CO2e figures for each type of bag (single-use plastic bag, paper bag, bag for life, etc) based on a comparable ‘functional unit’, i.e. carrying one month’s shopping (483 items) home. For example 82 single-use bags are required to fulfil this function, with associated emissions of 1.57 kg CO2e, while 61 bags for life fulfil the same function with emissions of 1.39 kg CO2e (if each bag for life is re-used 5 times). The error was to use the CO2e figures associated with one month’s shopping as referring to individual bags (i.e. one single-use plastic bag was assigned emissions of 1.57kg CO2e), thus overstating the carbon impact of the charge by a factor of 82.The estimates are calculated on an embedded emissions approach. This means that much of the emissions reduction occur outside of the UK as most plastic bags are manufactured abroad. I have attached a revised copy of the Defra written evidence and have set out the areas requiring amendment below. If possible we would also like to correct one of the statements given by the Minister, Dan Rogerson, during his oral evidence.

[[[EAC written evidence ]]]“Paragraph 19. The charge in England is also expected to reduce the local environmental and biodiversity impact of littered bags. The indicative reduction in single-use plastic bag usage outlined would cause an associated fall in GHG emissions of around 

[[[97,000-130,000]]] tonnes CO2 equivalent (not taking into account impacts of plastic bags for life or bin liners).”“Footnote 15. EA 2006 estimates 1.57 kg co2e 

[[[per month’s shopping]]] http://a0768b4a8a31e106d8b0-50dc802554eb38a24458b98ff72d550b.r19.cf3.rackcdn.com/scho0711buan-e-e.pdf““Paragraph 26. The Government has calculated that even if customers of large retailers increase their paper bag use by 50% there would still be a negligible environmental impact in terms of carbon emissions (

[[[3,500]]] tonnes CO2 equivalent 

[[[representing less than 4% of the savings from plastic bags]]]) due to the very low current levels of use.”

[[[EAC oral evidence ]]]“We would expect also that we could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 

[[[97,000 -130,000]]] tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to permanently taking 

[[[32,000 – 43,000]]] cars off the road.”I trust this information on our carbon emissions analysis is sufficient and answers any queries the Committee might have had. &#xa0;29 January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
