default&#xa0;
defaultSUMMARYdefault&#xa0;
defaultA summary of my submission is as follows:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1    “What is the Government’s approach to cutting crime? To what extent is the approach taken cross-departmental, and how are resources for such policiesdefault default-default defaultfrom within and outside of the criminal justice systemdefault default-default defaultallocated and targeted?”default&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultThe Government approach is a clear one – all police forces and partner agencies must cut crime. In many areas, the legislation and funding helps achieve that, however, I worry that poor performance and direction from other departments nationally and locall
defaulty divide and hinder the approach.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWestminster v Localism
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultHealth and Education provide a confusing picture in the fight against crime. This is due to the Government localism agenda, which allows some Government departments to escape the main drive f
defaultrom the centre to cut crime. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultI shall give two examples:
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultFirstly, mental health. Policing as a service and crime in general, is fed by incidents caused by people suffering from mental health issues. One in four people will have issues at some sta
defaultge in their life. Research has shown that such people will become victims more easily, and will re-offend more as offenders. The re-offending is because they are not treated, or diverted.
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default              
defaultTackle mental health issues nationally, and we can cut crime, a
defaultnd reduce the amount of people suffering from mental health who will become victims. There are other obvious benefits of a co-ordinated approach to this problem. However the issue of mental health care fails spectacularly because of a disjointed approach b
defaulty numerous departments. 
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default              
defaultThis poor join up of objectives and budgets means that there is a “disconnect” between departments such as NHS England, Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG’s), Local Authority Public Health and Mental Health Teams. 
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default              
defaultThe po
defaultlice service, as an aside, then becomes the “service of last resort”. Police pick up Health Department issues such as people in crisis in public and private places, people in crisis in custody suites, and transportation of such people. All of these issues 
defaultdetract from the police objective of cutting crime. 
default&#xa0;
default1.8
default              
defaultThe Home Secretary has written and spoken many times about this issue, however, the disparate approach taken locally by the numerous Health Departments means that the issue floats between Government
default mantra and local funding agendas.  I watch with interest to see how the Health and Wellbeing Boards (HWBs) impact on this issue in the future. 
default&#xa0;
default1.9
default              
defaultMy second example relates to education. The concept of academies and free schools has allowed such establi
defaultshments to devise their own curriculum. This means that a standard approach to PSHE nationally has been diluted and lost. I see completely different approaches to drug, alcohol, sex and cyber bullying education in 
defaultDorset
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1.10
default              
defaultThis causes inconsistencies in what children are taught, and more importantly, means that young adults are poorly equipped to make life choices. Poor life choices create both an increase in victims of crime and in youth offending. 
default&#xa0;
default1.11
default              
defaultIt is interesting,
default that as I write this, the Deputy Prime Minister has raised the same issue.
default&#xa0;
defaultEarly Intervention
default&#xa0;
default1.12
default              
defaultI endorse the Government approach to Troubled Families.  Notwithstanding that, I would like to see it drive more Early Intervention (EI) through the cultu
defaultre of Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs), HWBs and Safeguarding Boards. 
default&#xa0;
default1.13
default              
defaultWhilst I welcome the Troubled Family agenda, my issue is that to reach the high threshold of a Troubled Family, it is often too late to improve outcomes. I liken it to a house
default fire. By time you are a labelled a Troubled Family, the house is on fire, and all the authorities can do is attend to put the fire out. If you intervene early, and put in a smoke detector, you stop the fire. You stop the chaos taking hold. Pro-active earl
defaulty intervention must be better than reactively putting out a fire. And along the way you can change a generation of children, improving their outcomes for life.
default&#xa0;
default1.14
default              
defaultHere in 
defaultDorset
default, we now have two out of three of our top tier authorities taking part in th
defaulte new Early Intervention Foundation pilots. Notably, these pilots come without funding. The two Authorities made these bids in conjunction with me. And I am now “pooling” budgets with these authorities to address EI.
default&#xa0;
default1.15
default              
defaultThe Government strategy to crime 
defaultreduction fails to recognise the huge link between the 0-5 year olds, and the future. If all 0-5 yr olds went to school being able to read, write and talk properly (in other words, be “school ready”) they would have a different future. Children who are not
default school ready stay in the lower quartile for their whole school career, and leave school with low self esteem, low achievement and are the victims and offenders of the future. 
default&#xa0;
default1.16
default              
defaultWe must be bold and link children’s education and esteem to the offenders
default and victims of the future. 
default  
defaultIn 
defaultDorset
default I am doing that by sharing resources and 
defaultinformation. And the public get it, they understand where the issues lay, and how they can be solved. 
default&#xa0;
default1.17
default              
defaultPooled funding enables the commissioning of joined up services which have tangible outcomes. These services can link into or bolster the initiatives the Committee have identified like 
defaultHomestart
default and the Nurse Family Partnership to help achieve change. 
default&#xa0;
defaultKee
defaultp Catching Criminals / Keep Cutting Crime (KCC)
default&#xa0;
default1.18
default              
defaultAn area of concern for me is the need for the Government to drive catching criminals and detecting crime. This isn’t about introducing more statistics. It is about making sure the police do what the pub
defaultlic expect – detecting crime.  If you embrace Early Intervention as the mantra to changing outcomes in the future, then the Government should be instructing police and partners to catch more criminals. 
default&#xa0;
default1.19
default              
defaultThis is
default 
defaultn
defaulto
defaultt about target setting it is about ac
defaultcepting that most crimes are committed by someone who has already broken the law, or by someone who could go on to commit more crime. If the police and partners are encouraged to catch more criminals, they can engage with the offenders, and change their ou
defaulttlook and lifestyle, to prevent more crime happening in the future. 
default&#xa0;
default1.20
default              
defaultYou can only change offending behaviour if you intervene. Failure to catch criminals fails to tackle the problem. 
default  
defaultThat is why I welcome the transforming rehabilitation (TR) change
defaults that now bring offenders sentenced to less than 12 months into the rehabilitation programme. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.21
default              
defaultOn my election here in 
defaultDorset
default, the police were only catching one in five offenders, in other words, 20% of crime was resolved satisfactorily. 
default  
defaultThe 
defaultpublic were deeply unhappy with this statistic.
default  
defaultI therefore set a target in the Police and Crime Plan – I said I wanted one in three criminals caught instead of one in five by 2016. 
default  
defaultIn response, the police changed their investigative procedures and intr
defaultoduced “Operation Advance”. 
default  
defaultAnd after a year, as well as driving crime down by over 8%, we have raised our resolved crime rate to 25%, in other words one in four. We are getting there. 
default&#xa0;
default1.22
default              
defaultI call this approach KCC
default:
default Keep Catching Criminals as well as K
defaulteep Cutting Crime.  In my view, having the two KCCs is essential. It drives the very essence of why you have a police force – The 
default“prevention and detection of crime”.
default&#xa0;
default1.23
default              
defaultI welcome the Government recognising this crucial aspect of crime management.
default&#xa0;
defaultPart
defaultnership Working
default&#xa0;
default1.24
default              
defaultReduction of crime will always be a joint agency agenda. 
default 
defaultIf we accept that, then this is arguably the most successful angle of the current Government approach. The arrival of PCCs has enabled the concept of shared priorities to be cr
defaultystallised from the Police and Crime Plan. 
default&#xa0;
default1.25
default              
defaultThe legislation has focussed partners on each other’s priorities, and I congratulate the Government on this approach.
default&#xa0;
default1.26
default              
defaultIn Dorset I am leading a drive for change in our partnership structure with a view to moving from three CSPs to one pan Dorset partnership, as indeed Merseyside have already done. This allows one partnership to drive forward key priorities and also makes c
defaultommissioning an easier process. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2default              defaultHow reliable is the evidence on which these policies are based?default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultMainly good. I have huge respect for the Cabinet Office Policy Team. The Troubled Family ethos, EI, and the determination to drive down crime as drive
defaultrs of a better society are well founded by research.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultHowever, Evidence Based Policing is still in many ways in its infancy, and the Government needs to do more to raise its profile to enable Forces such as mine to share best practice. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultI do have 
defaulta concern that some Government Policy is driven by cost rather than research. A good example of this is the Transforming Rehabilitation Programme. I know 
defaultAlun
default Michael has already raised the issue with your committee. Curtailing the payment by results pilot
defaults, before completion, and proper evaluation has concerned people. Time will tell if the Government approach is the correct one. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3default              defaultWhat impact have recent spending reductions had on the implementation of crime reduction policies, and the way in which resdefaultources for crime reduction are channelled at a local level?default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultThis is a huge question. What is a crime reduction policy? Sarah’s Law and Clare’s Law are both fantastic crime preventers, but most people would not consider such initiatives in their “crime
default prevention or reduction toolkit”. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultI support the Anti Social Behaviour (ASB) approach being taken by this Government, and welcome the new community trigger. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultHowev
defaulter, one area does concern me - p
defaultan Dorset there is an issue with long term entrenc
defaulthed neighbour/boundary disputes that the law does not appear to cater for. Current legislation fails to tackle these complicated matters. This is even more the case if one or both parties own their own homes, removing the option of re-housing. I would like
default to see this addressed, by creating an arbitration system that will adjudicate. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultI am happy that the processes to “design out crime” are in place and working.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultI do worry that the traditional face of police crime prevention – the crime prevention officer – has suffered badly due to the cuts.  Most Forces have cut these roles, amalgamated them, or regionalised them, as we are doing in the South West. The best futu
defaultre for this in my view is a collaborative agency approach. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSAIL
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultIn Dorset, we have an initiative called Safe and Independent Living (SAIL) which is where different agencies such as the Fire Service, Police and Project for Older Peoples Partnerships use one form to identify issues in a household, which is then shared. A
defaultt the moment it relates to older people. 
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultWe need to embrace this principle, and get better at it. If one agency is liaising with a family or a household, the opportunity to identify concerns and share the issues is enormous, and could break down barr
defaultiers between agencies. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Late Night Levy
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default              
defaultI am concerned that the localism agenda has resulted in a total rejection nationally of the Late Night Levy (LNL). The LNL is welcomed by senior police officers and me as an important aspect of the crime re
defaultduction toolkit.
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default              
defaultThe LNL is recognition of the role a licensee plays in fuelling the alcohol issue in crime. The levy would achieve corporate responsibility of the issue, and fund policing efforts to tackle it. The LNL has failed universally because o
defaultf devolving the issue to Local Authorities, who are lobbied by local businesses. It is another example of Westminster v Localism. 
default&#xa0;
default“Cloud Based” Case management system
default&#xa0;
default3.10
default              
defaultFinally, we all know that the issue of crime prevention, and detection, could be 
defaultimproved by the introduction of a “cloud based” case management system used by all agencies involved with risk and harm. 
default&#xa0;
default3.11
default              
defaultIn Dorset I am just trying to “pump prime” this principle, by introducing a software system (approved to Government stand IL3) b
defaultetween agencies. The Probation Service, my office and the LRF currently use the system. To have one system that all agencies can use in a “Windows” based environment is the holy grail of all law enforcement agencies.
default&#xa0;defaultQ4default              defaultWhat contribution do existing sentedefaultncing, prison and policies make to the reduction of crime?default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultThe Integrated Offender Management (IOM) system does work, and police and probation are getting better at it. Most forces are seeing improvements in reoffending rates, and that is a good thing
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultThe good thing about the new TR proposals is that it brings forces together, and therefore best practice and common goals can change outcomes. For example, our new Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) is based across Dorset and Devon &amp;
default Cornwall.  Devon &amp; Cornwall IOM practices differ in technique and resourcing to Dorset, and now the Chief Constable and I are aligning our IOM to match theirs. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultAs with cutting crime, the IOM process (and the prison process) fails to have the full su
defaultpport or impact of Health Professionals.   If we accept that a huge amount of offenders are in a “cycle” due to addiction, then their health and wellbeing is crucial to stopping that cycle.  Resourcing of health professionals (outside of nurse/GP provision
default) inside prisons in Dorset is problematic. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultI await with interest to see what “through the gate” services come as part of the Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) that is being set up.  The good news is that the new PCC role can “fill the gap” and c
defaultommission services to bolster and improve those being offered by the new CRC’s. I am heavily committed to mentoring as a way forward, and I applaud the “Circles” mentoring approach to reducing risk and harm in sex offending cases. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default              
defaultI would like to hig
defaulthlight an anomaly in relation to sentencing however. I have already referred to the Westminster v Localism dilemma in relation to cutting crime. A dilemma in the area of sentencing is the Public v The Judiciary in relation to Neighbourhood Justice Panels (
defaultNJP’s). We are trialling two of these in Dorset. They have massive public support. Most victims welcome the chance to meet the offender in their case, and welcome a panel deciding on an appropriate sentence.
default  
defaultThese panels are quicker, and achieve better re
defaultductions in re-offending, than the traditional court based processes. 
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default              
defaultThe dilemma is the role of magistrates. I feel that JP’s should sit on these panels to provide insight, experience and legitimacy to the process. However, the Judiciary are fiercel
defaulty protective over this, and will not allow JP’s to engage. 
default&#xa0;
default4.7
default              
defaultAt a time when lower court sittings are reducing, at a time when most JP’s in Dorset struggle to achieve their “sitting hours” this seems a strange position for us to be in.
default&#xa0;
default4.8
default              
defaultThe Governme
defaultnt needs to intervene and push NJP’s forward as an excellent sentencing tool that is quick, cost effective, and achieves massive positive victim feedback. 
default&#xa0;
default4.9
default              
defaultEqually, we need to see the Restorative Justice approach rolled out to all adult courts. We hav
defaulte seen how well the approach works with our young people.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5default              defaultHow cost effective and sustainable are the Governments strategies for punishment and reform and their proposals for transforming rehabilitation?default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultI applaud the TR proposals, with one exception. I worry that the feature of two different organisations, the National Probation Service, and the CRC in an area will allow an offender who rapidly changes risk category to “slip between the cracks”. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultA cloud based case management system is again the panacea here. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultI also applaud the victim surcharge, although I wonder why some courts convicting for offences without a victim are imposing the levy.
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default              
defaultI think the new Government approach to punishm
defaultent and reform is sustainable, as is the approach to closing cost prohibitive prisons. For example, HMP Dorchester will close soon, because it cost twice as much to keep a prisoner there in comparison to a newer prison. 
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default              
defaultI do have a concern however, o
defaultver the prison estate. My concern was that HMP Dorchester was named as my “local” and “resettlement” prison for Dorset, and then the Government announced its closure.  I am now in a position, like other PCCs, that my County does not have local solutions fo
defaultr “through the gate” services. My nearest “local or resettlement” prison is now in another County. 
default&#xa0;
default5.6
default              
defaultWhilst the logic of this from a cost point of view is obvious, it will hamper the efforts of the PCC and agencies to provide coherent local solutions t
defaulto re-offending. 
default&#xa0;
default5.7
default              
defaultThis is also the case in relation to commissioning. The CRC areas are very large, and small effective intervention organisations will struggle to tender for these services. 
default&#xa0;
default5.8
default              
defaultI also have a concern about the new Government “super” 
defaultprisons. If you accept that a prisoner’s “support network” is crucial to rehabilitation in the long term, then making the family travel 150 miles to see their loved one does raise issues, and could destroy the network. It also damages services that the PCC
default or other agencies want to commission.  
default&#xa0;
default5.9
default              
defaultAnd finally, in closing, I have reservations over the Government drive to separate victim and witness services. I know this has already been raised with you. Most PCCs want to see victim and witness commissioni
defaultng to be local rather than national.
