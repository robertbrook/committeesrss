[[[Cinzia Secha]]], Adviser, European Trade Union Confederation&#xa0;

[[[Q195 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you very much for coming. You know why we are here and why we have invited you to give evidence. The House of Lords report that we intend to make on youth unemployment will be published in April. We have had a range of witnesses, including youth, and today we have had two very good sessions, with the Director-General and then with the Commissioner, which helped us to put the jigsaw together more. You are very important here, because we have had questions about trade unions for most of our witnesses but now we will hear it from the horse’s mouth, as we say—that expression means, “The people who actually know”. We are looking forward to this session. You have met everyone, but I think it would be good idea if we said what our experience is, starting from the Member on your right.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] I am Clive Brooke—Lord Brooke. I have been in the House of Lords for 16 years, prior to which I was in the labour movement as General-Secretary of a union that was affiliated to the TUC, and I was a close friend of John Monks as well.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn: ]]]I am David Wilson. I am what we call a Cross-Bench Peer—an independent Peer. I have been in the House of Lords for 22-odd years. I have had a career mostly in public service, including that unfashionable thing, being a colonial governor—quite an experience.

[[[The Chairman]]]

[[[:]]] I am Detta O’Cathain. I am a Conservative Member of the House of Lords. I have been in the House of Lords for 22 years. I came to the House of Lords through the business route rather than the political route, but I am a Conservative Peer.

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] I am Lord Freeman. I was formerly House of Commons, and now I am in the House of Lords. I have been in the House of Lords now for quite a number of years. I am very grateful from my standpoint that you have come to see us, because some of these questions are really, really important.  

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you. I shall start. There is a general consensus that youth unemployment across Europe is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis, and while things like banking seem to be getting a lot of push and business is beginning to pull up, we are still worried about the effect particularly on the young of the crisis in finding jobs. Could you summarise for us your own view of the exact nature of the current problems and the issues that you are most concerned about?

[[[Cinzia Sechi:]]] I will say just a few words. I thank you for this invitation. It is an honour for us to be able to share our views on youth unemployment in Europe, because that has been one of the biggest concerns of the European trade union movement over the past five years. It is a great opportunity to present you with some of the achievements that we have made with employers’ organisations, because we really believe in the social dialogue at the European level and we will share with you the specific positions of the trade union movement in order to enrich your thinking on this issue.The questions will be addressed mainly by my colleague Ignacio Doreste. I am Cinzia Sechi. I deal mainly with the European social dialogue, general equality issues and precarious work, while Ignacio is our adviser on youth policies. We will try to complement each other as much as possible, and hopefully will answer your questions in a meaningful manner.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I should have said to you that the witnesses receive a transcript of this session to check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. 

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] The nature of youth unemployment is actually not that different from what is happening in the banking system and the financial sector. First, we would like to point out that the youth unemployment rate was already high before the outbreak of the crisis. In Europe, this is due to the lack of investment in the productive sectors, which are sustainable both in terms of respecting the environment and in terms of creating quality jobs. That is our main point. Before the crisis—during the golden years, so to speak—many EU countries were investing a huge percentage of their gross national product in speculative rather than productive sectors. In Spain, for example, the situation is quite dramatic when it comes to unemployment in general but to youth unemployment in particular. I do not want to stick only to my own experience, but Spain is a good example to look at. In Spain, a lot of investment was allocated to the construction sector. It was growing a lot because of the real estate bubble, so with the outbreak of the crisis there was a huge increase in youth unemployment and in unemployment in general. From that moment on, there has been no macroeconomic policy to tackle the origin of the crisis. Even though I have focused on my country, it is applicable to the other 27 EU countries. It might be timely for us to share with you an investment plan, which was approved by the Executive Committee of the European Trade Union Confederation a couple of months ago, through which we are trying to apply pressure to national Governments but especially the European Commission in order to shift from the current situation, in which we are focusing much more on the labour market and the reduction of the public deficit, to a new trend in which we are applying to invest in strategic sectors. We are actually allocating 2% of the European domestic product to this strategy. Maybe Cinzia can complete the presentation of this strategy.

[[[Cinzia Sechi:]]] Yes. It is an investment plan and it is a political document belonging to the ETUC. However, on investments at the European level there are some shared views with employers. We recently addressed a letter to President Barroso and President Van Rompuy on the need for Europe to direct more resources to our industries—this is very much a concern in the business sector and the strategic and public sectors, where it is a specific demand of the ETUC—to boost research into different sectors that could be much more productive, and to boost demand and the number of quality jobs in the near future. We have copies of the document with us and we can provide electronic versions. It is the ETUC’s main campaign and involves 85 confederal organisations across 36 European countries, including of course the TUC in the UK. We also have members beyond Europe, in Turkey.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That would be most helpful. Thank you very much indeed.

[[[Q196 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] To what extent is the crisis that affects most European Union members a function of the lack of industrial and commercial demand? We have just heard evidence about the lack of skills, and in some cases the lack of proper education and experience for young people in the sense that they are not qualified or available in the practical sense for work. What is the balance between the demand from industry and the supply of quality and experience of young people?

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] That is quite a timely question, which I think completes the previous one. We have been talking about the lack of demand and the lack of investment in strategic sectors, but when it comes to the lack of skills we would point out first that it is agreed worldwide that currently, especially at the European level, the young generation are the most trained and well prepared in European history. There has been a lot of focus on the lack of skills among young people that are needed to meet the demands of the private sector, because this is something that we constantly see when we meet our partners and have conversations with them. Even though we understand that there is room for improvement, especially in the vocational system, we wanted to point out that in the crisis we are facing a lack of demand and investment in strategic sectors. As Cinzia said, this also affects domestic demand.Again, on skills, together with employers and many other important stakeholders, we have signed up to the European Alliance for Apprenticeships, since we believe that apprenticeships are a compelling way of tailoring the demands of certain sectors to prepare students when they leave the education sector. We have also signed a European charter of apprenticeships, together with employers. This is actually one of the most important milestones of the past eight years when it comes to youth unemployment. We signed up to a framework for action on youth employment, which was divided into four chapters, one of which was training. We are aware that there is room for improvement, even though we considered that the main problem is the lack of demand and the industrial and macroeconomic problem. It has been said that it is also important to remind ourselves that in the past companies were considered somehow to have an obligation to train their employees. Now, what we hear from our partners is that they are demanding that young people leave the education system with specific skills that are required by these companies. We also think that there should be a balance of responsibilities when it comes to training their employees.

[[[Cinzia Sechi:]]] Briefly, I will complete what Ignacio has just said in answer to Lord Freeman’s question. We have always had mismatches between the supply side and the demand side. What is very concerning in Europe is that the size of this mismatch is increasing. The risk is that we will lose a good proportion of the well educated young if we do not react in a timely manner. The so-called NEET generation is probably one of the main concerns at the moment, because it is as Ignacio said: people have probably never been so well educated at the European level across countries, but we are not fully exploiting their potential. This might also explain why the long-term youth unemployment rate is increasing in a number of member states. That will also mean that more resources will have to be spent in the future if we want to attract and retain these people in the labour market. What is not helping at all is the proliferation of typical contractual arrangements. In a country like Spain, the flexibilisation of the labour market has not shown itself able to attract or retain young people in a direct manner.

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] I have a brief supplementary question. There are so many things that you can do in relation to industrial and commercial demand. Should there be greater direction in the balance of skills that young people need to acquire? We live in a digital age, a computer age, but some jobs are more prosaic and less glamorous and are not being filled or are being filled from outside the European Union. Do you feel that not direction but education of young people at school is a more realistic thing to do in terms of employment?

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] That is included in the framework of action: that we negotiate with employers. We should identify exactly the sectors where there is no demand and the reasons for the lack of attractiveness for young people, because if it is because of bad conditions, instead of encouraging young people to go into these sectors we have to improve their working conditions. That is our position. Any assessment and policy following that assessment should be done in a way that ensures that all citizens are included when launching the policy. This framework of action on youth unemployment is something that we are going to provide.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you very much. This is the European charter on apprentices.

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] It is kind of messy because there are so many different things that we are dealing with, but yes, we have that European charter on apprenticeships and the European Alliance for Apprenticeships. 

[[[Q197 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] We now move on to talk about how trade unions can work with national Governments to reduce unemployment and how you can work with the EU. There is not as much evidence of the social partnership in the UK as you might find in some European countries. Perhaps you might care to comment generally on what the relationships are like in different countries and how that helps or does not help to solve youth unemployment.Back at home, I will be very frank, people would say that the unions may speak about youth unemployment but they do not actually represent the young unemployed. They represent increasingly a group of public sector workers and a diminishing number of private sector employees, and in a sense the unemployed are excluded from them and cannot get into these jobs, particularly as the public sector is declining. Yet the unions wish to speak on behalf of the unemployed. I wonder if you would care to comment on that, because those criticisms are levelled in the UK. I would like you to give us a European view generally of how you see the nature of the relationship between the EU and the unions and how they would solve the problem. I would like an insight into what may be happening elsewhere, and then, if you like, you are free to comment on the specific UK issues. 

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] That is quite interesting. In order to prepare for some of the questions, we contacted our colleagues in the TUC. 

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] We have taken some evidence from them about these issues. They were very good.

[[[The Chairman]]]

[[[:]]] And it was excellent evidence.

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] How can trade unions at the national level interact with Governments to tackle unemployment? This is not only about the trade unions themselves. Of course we can do a lot at company and sectoral levels, and when it comes to negotiating with Governments not only the unions but employers are engaged through social dialogue. That is our point. As I just said, we talk with our colleagues from the TUC, and with them we acknowledge the unfortunate lack of social dialogue in the UK. When it comes to the criticisms of the lack of unions’ representativeness of cash workers, young workers, unemployed people, first of all we would like to point out that a lot has been done over the past year within the trade union movement. Right now we have, I think, youth committees in almost every trade union organisation affiliated to the ETUC. We have 85 trade union organisations from 36 European countries, even though there is room for improvement—that is for sure. We also have a youth committee at the European level. I had the opportunity to attend an assembly of young workers at the TUC headquarters in London a couple of months ago. They tackle the situation from a different perspective, and there are many different things that they are studying—we are studying them also at the European level—in order to improve the affiliation rates of young workers. Ireland is a good example, where they are increasing the affiliation rates of young people. We are studying many different ways, and considering not only campaigning but how to organise the different branches of the unions to better represent precarious workers. There are different systems. Italy, for example, has a confederation that represents all the workers, a federation for the regions and a federation for the sectoral, so they have a federation only for precarious workers. So there are different ways to proceed in order to improve representativeness of these types of workers, and we are constantly examining the different possibilities and interchanging good practices to organise young people better.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Can I interject there? Which EU member states do not have youth committees? Perhaps you need notice of that question, and if you could answer it that would be useful.

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] For sure, the 28 member states have youth committees. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] All of them?

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] Yes.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Then that is okay.

[[[Cinzia Sechi:]]] There might be a difference within the same country. In a country like mine—I am Italian, as you can tell from my accent—there are three confederations. One has a youth structure in place. Others deal with youth issues, not through a specific structure of young trade unionists but through different bodies.

[[[The Chairman:]]] So it is not the trade unions that actually have the other two.

[[[Cinzia Sechi:]]] It really depends on the structures of the confederation. But as Ignacio said, since we have members in all 28 EU member states, you will find at least one confederation with a youth structure in place.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I see. I am sorry to interrupt you, Lord Brooke. Carry on if there is anything else that you want to ask. 

[[[Q198 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] We as a Committee have found it difficult to arrange meetings with unemployed people. We have managed to arrange some, but I suspect that there are some groups that are hard to reach. You probably have the same problems. With the unions you can have youth groups and youth conferences, but I think they are probably mainly conferences of people who are in employment rather than out of employment. Do you have any special means of making connections so that you can speak representatively on their behalf and fend off the criticism that you are defending the interests of people who are already in work and that you are not really able to speak on behalf of those who are not in work?

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] I take your point. Indeed, we represent employed people, but when negotiating better employment benefits with the Government we are defending the rights and interests of unemployed people. It really is a question many times of image and advertising our own actions, but we have to acknowledge that trade unions all over Europe are suffering attacks from certain sectors of the media, which are really not helping us in integrating into society. We are tackling huge problems in many countries. Also, when it comes to organising, we have very good examples of creating platforms with civil society organisations. That is also a very wise way of exchanging views with other stakeholders in society such as NGOs, and even non-organised groups, such as those in my country with all these movements that were created after what happened in Puerta del Sol in May 2011. That is another good example. Actually we are thinking about having a European pathway to deal with civil society organisations.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Just for clarification, would those civil society organisations be NGOs?

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] NGOs, yes. They are talking about creating a new pathway.

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] Actually, it is not a pathway, but it is common ground: a document, a joint strategy—something in that class. 

[[[Q199 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] You mentioned earlier that you have done some work on apprenticeships and on training. Can I just follow up on that, please? As we have gone around talking to people, we have found it a bit difficult to define precisely what different people in different countries mean by apprenticeships. That is question one. The other question is on training. Do you think that the quality, content and type of training across Europe are what is needed? If not, are there things that should be done about that at a European Union level?

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] First of all, it is not only people in general who are finding problems in defining an apprenticeship and an internship but the European Commission itself, because although it launched the proposal for a quality framework for apprenticeships, in that document, which is currently under discussion, it tackles what it referred to before as open market internships. For many years when we were negotiating with employers and talking to the European Commission, we referred to apprenticeships as training schemes within the framework of the education system and to internships as any kind of scheme that is after the education system, more or less. Before negotiating the framework for action on youth unemployment, we set up a joint definition of the different schemes with employers to avoid misunderstandings. At the European level, it is true that there are wide differences in the quantity and the quality of apprenticeship schemes. In countries like Germany, Austria and Denmark, where they have a very well developed training system, the quality and quantity of apprenticeships provided, especially within the vocational training system, are pretty well recognised by society as a whole. They are quite proud. Trade unions and employers’ organisations are also in many cases members of the bodies identifying the companies where students can have apprenticeships. They also assess the quality of the schemes. It is not only a question in many cases of the industrial fabric—what we can find in Germany is completely different from what we can find in, for example, Cyprus—but it is also a question of how these bodies are conformed. 

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Just to clarify, what would the definition of an apprenticeship be now in, let us say, Spain or Italy? What would “apprenticeship” mean?

[[[Cinzia Sechi:]]] We at the ETUC have just finished a project at the European level. We looked at the quality framework for apprenticeships, and it showed that the definition was a common concern. If you want to find a shared definition at the European level, I advise you to look at what Cedefop has provided as a definition of apprenticeships. Cedefop is a tripartite agency of government, trade unions and employers, and we have expressed our agreement on that specific definition. You will find details such as the fact that apprenticeships should be provided at workplace level, that some education should also be given by public institutions and that a contract should be attached to apprenticeship schemes. There is also a reference to payment, which is not the case for apprenticeship schemes in some member states. Cedefop could be a good starting point. However, as Ignacio said, there is proliferation and a lot of political attention on apprenticeship schemes at the European level, so in different documents and publications unfortunately the definition used is not Cedefop’s. There should be a political commitment on the part of member states and social partners to work together towards a shared definition not only at Cedefop level but at a higher level. 

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] I am sorry to interrupt, but what was the name?

[[[Cinzia Sechi:]]]

[[[ ]]]Cedefop.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That sounds very useful. How many other member states would have that and have bought into that, as they say—they have adopted this?

[[[Cinzia Sechi:]]] It has not been formally adopted, but it is common ground, and it is one of the oldest agencies in Europe. It is based, unfortunately, far away in Thessaloniki in Greece. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] And “encourages” employment, which they need. 

[[[Cinzia Sechi:]]] Yes, indeed. Apprenticeship schemes vary too much at the European level, so, again, our political demand is that we should find a common meaning.

[[[The Chairman:]]] This is what we really believe. I am just interested to know how wide the acceptance has been of the 28 member states. How many people know of its existence and how many of them have agreed that it is a good thing?

[[[Cinzia Sechi:]]] I will turn your question around. First of all, the definition of apprenticeships is not codified in all member states.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, we know that.

[[[Cinzia Sechi:]]] Sometimes it is in law, sometimes it is in regulations or collective agreements. It would be interesting to see how many definitions match the Cedefop definition, which matches what they have in Denmark and Germany but not what they have in a number of eastern European countries, for example, where the schemes have not been developed very much. The other main issues with apprenticeship schemes are their quality and their increased attractiveness to young people. We hear a lot from our members that there is a lack of places for apprentices in a number of member states, including member states with a very strong dual system, such as Germany and Denmark. That, again, could have an impact on the schemes in the long term but especially in the short term. 

[[[Q200 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] I really do not want to hog the conversation, but I am very interested in what you have said. You have said that the definition of apprenticeships probably differed from the definition of apprenticeships that other member states have. Is there such a thing as a document that shows the definition of the word “apprenticeship” in each of the 28 member states? We cannot get our heads around that.

[[[Cinzia Sechi:]]] Could you repeat the question, please?

[[[The Chairman:]]] We would like a definition of an apprenticeship. Is there a definition of what an apprenticeship is in each of the 28 member states?

[[[Cinzia Sechi:]]] We surveyed 10 member states and we found that almost all of them had a definition. I was not directly involved, but we found a definition in most of them. This definition is made either under the labour code or by collective agreements. The nature of the instrument codifying the definition differs from member state to member state.

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] We worked on this in the final conference that we had in November, so we will provide you with the final document, which is quite handy when it comes to apprenticeships.I would like to complete this question on apprenticeships, because we may have focused too much on good practice in Germany and Denmark. There are also very good examples in Italy, for example, where employers signed an agreement with three trade union confederations, I think three years ago. I can also provide you with a brief explanation of this scheme, because it was presented as evidence of good practice for the negotiation on the framework for action at the European level. They defined in a very clear way three different apprenticeship schemes. The national framework was completed six months ago, with another agreement reached between employers and the unions on a basic salary of €400 for every apprenticeship, which can be improved at regional level. The €400 is the minimum floor for the company. In some regions, it even reaches €600 or something like that. We will provide you with more information on that. In order to tackle the wide variety of apprenticeship schemes and internships all over Europe, the European Commission launched the quality framework for apprenticeships. It was presented last December, on the 5th I believe. We can also provide you with the statement that we launched the day after. We agree with the European Commission’s evaluation on the quality and quantity of apprenticeships all over Europe, but we were really disappointed with the measure that it was recommending, because it is a recommendation to the Council. 

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] What was their recommendation?

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] Actually their recommendation is as basic as saying that any training apprenticeship will do. The only thing they are asking for is for employers to provide a contract, so they are definitely not tackling the quality. Regardless of the conditions of the apprenticeship, they should be registered in a written contract where all these conditions should be known by trainees before they start the apprenticeship. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Lord Brooke, did you want to ask question 5?

[[[Lord ]]]

[[[Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] I think it has been covered.

[[[Q201 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] You touched on the question of best practice, which has interested us quite a lot. How could, and how should, the Commission publicise best practice? One example that has come to us is the various bids for the employment initiative. We are told that every country, except one, which we happen to represent, has put in their bids, but these are not public documents yet, so the question is: do you think that the Commission could do more to publicise best practice? Would you support that, or is it being done enough already?

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] First of all, the European Trade Union Confederation firmly believes that the European Commission should go far beyond exchanging practices in member states when it comes to promoting policies. We firmly believe that a common background that is obligatory for 28 member states is necessary. We are not talking about direct implementation. The best way to tailor a European initiative is through social dialogue. We have identified many interesting instances of good practice, which were used, for example, in the negotiations on the framework for action and in the negotiations with the European Commission on the implementation plans of the Youth Guarantee. Many member states are supposed to have already sent their implementation plan to the European Commission. All that documentation is private so far. The European Commission is not discussing those plans even with the member states, as far as we know, or with the European social partners. We can provide you with some examples of good practice, which were used as common ground to negotiate the four different chapters of the framework for action on youth employment. We can give you some good examples of current good practice on the Youth Guarantee, for example, in Finland and in Denmark, Austria and Sweden. That is a great example because it has been transposed to other European countries. The same applies to the dual training system, which was initially created in Austria and in Germany. We also gave you the example of the Italian agreement for apprenticeships. We have an annexe with something like 20 good practices listed in it, which were presented in the negotiations on the framework for action. I always say that five examples should be selected for evidence sessions, but if it is possible I can send you the whole document. 

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Let me get this right. When I ask whether the Commission should be doing more, you are doing it. Where are you getting all the information from?

[[[The Chairman:]]] And who is paying you to do it?

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] Actually we obtain all this information from our affiliates. During the negotiations on the framework for action on youth employment, the European Commission functioned as a vehicle. It was the employers and the unions themselves that wanted to negotiate the different courses of action, which are included in the agreement.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Should there be more collection of data by member states? Should member states be doing this? Are you really doing this job, and is everyone else aware that you are doing it? Does it get out?

[[[Cinzia Sechi:]]] This is very much part of the European social dialogue. In order to reach that agreement with employers, we first collected evidence that social partners at the national level and at the sectoral level were active in addressing youth concerns. We collected that evidence first, and then negotiated a framework for action consisting of five priorities which we committed ourselves to looking at in the next three years and to continuing to monitor our members and see what they are doing, either together or unilaterally, to address youth unemployment. So to answer your question, we will indeed continue to look at good practice, and at the end of the process we will make an assessment. Hopefully we will also be confronted with a better situation.The Commission and the institutions are looking at good practice on youth unemployment from a different angle. Of course, they are very much involving Governments, whereas our focus is more on social partners. Yes, we should continue to look at good practice, but we should make sure that this is not only a top-down approach. I agree very much with what you said: member states themselves should start not only putting these good practices into practice but sharing them at the local and the national level. Otherwise this European feeling will be lost. In a top-down approach, the impact of what we were doing would be limited.

[[[Q202 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is very interesting. We have asked about your view as to how the EU initiatives are being used in different states. How do you see the UK’s response in comparison to others? You talked about the youth employment programme, the Youth Guarantee and the youth employment initiative.

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] To answer this question we contacted the TUC and asked for ideas. The TUC is not happy at all with the fact that UK has decided that the Youth Guarantee will not be implemented in the United Kingdom as the Youth Contract initiative already covers the same objectives. The TUC produced a very interesting statement on its position on the Youth Contract. During the negotiations on the framework for action, the Youth Contract was presented by representatives of the UK employers’ organisations as a good practice. The TUC had a sound argument against that proposal, because all the different good practices included in the framework for action on youth employment at the European level did not necessarily have to be agreed between the social partners at the national level. The TUC disagreed with implementing the Youth Contract as a good example. Correct me if I am wrong but I think the Youth Contract was launched two years ago, so the TUC has already been able to assess its outcomes. It has not generated youth employment at all. There is no way of assessing the extent to which companies are using the Youth Contract to replace other formal jobs. Even though it is stated in the political proposal at company level, since it is very difficult to guarantee that formal jobs are not going to be replaced by the Youth Contract, there is no statistical evidence of how net employment is going to be created solely by investing money in the private sector in order to subsidise jobs rather than by investing in economic activity itself. The TUC was also quite critical about the fact that the Youth Contract also makes it possible for companies to have young people in unpaid positions. It also related the fact that the scheme meant that the Future Jobs Fund was set aside when the Youth Contract was launched by the Government.

[[[Q203 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] You have been extremely helpful. Over the last two days we have heard a great deal and had some helpful advice about the supply side coming from the European Commission and from companies. I would like to ask you about trying to understand better the demand side from young people. In your judgment, are there any initiatives that could be taken by member states to understand attitudes to work and how much knowledge there is about employment opportunities or lack of them? Can you think of any initiatives that would help both to educate and to understand the predicament that many young people find themselves in?

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] We identified the good practice in the Czech Republic of both employers and trade unions visiting schools at a very basic level in order to share with the students the different prospects that they might expect in their working lives. They tackled the different youth opportunities, mainly in sectors that were identified as being particularly unattractive, such as the energy sector in the Czech Republic. At least, that is what they presented in the papers. They also presented the union side on completing training schemes for students. The unions talked about the specific conditions of those sectors, the collective agreements covering those sectors, health and safety issues, the work/life balance in general, and the sectors that were strong for the students in particular. The European social partners agreed on the importance of that, even though they do not think it is going to be a magic solution for the crisis that we are facing. That is why it was included as a good example in the framework for action.

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Is that information readily available to us?

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] I have it here.

[[[The Chairman:]]] You are absolutely brilliant. 

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] I forgot to add the annexes, but I will send them to you if it is possible, because you will find all the examples of good practice in them.

[[[The Chairman:]]] You are absolutely brilliant. Thank you so much. Lord Brooke, your question is the final one but I want to ask one afterwards.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe]]]

[[[:]]] You can ask yours now, if you want.

[[[Q204 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Right. I am going back to the money. Do you think that the ESF and the additional youth initiative money will be used in the right way? A lot of money is involved and we do not want to throw money at things and find that that has been such a waste, because we will never recover from the opportunity that we have now. 

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] First of all, when it comes to the money, you are talking about the Youth Guarantee scheme, so I will focus on that. The International Labour Organisation carried out deep research on the funding necessities at the European level of the effective implementation of the Youth Guarantee. It found that more than €20 billion would be needed. It is important to say that Eurofound states in research, which it launched in 2011 on the NEETs situation, that the cost of NEETs at the national and European level is actually the cost of not acting. If you have people who are neither working nor attending any kind of training, that is the cost to the Government and the European Commission of not acting, which amounts to €160 billion a year, but I still think there is room for improvement in investment. The European Commission has allocated €6 billion for the youth employment initiative, which is a lot and we firmly consider that that money should be spent in a very effective way. From what we have heard from Manuel Hubert from the European Commission, the Commission is going to revisit that aspect when it assesses all the implementation plans and allocates the money to the member states to implement the Youth Guarantee. But it is a question not only of the European Commission auditing the money sent to the member states but of the importance of social partners designing, together with the Governments, the different schemes that are implemented at the national level. That is also going to be a very effective way of ensuring that the money is well spent.

[[[Q205 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] You raised the issue of zero-hours contracts earlier in one of your replies. You indicated that you were not happy about them. Certainly the trade union movement back in the UK has been unhappy about them. We have also had evidence from some quarters that, while people may not be enthusiastic about them, they are sometimes a means whereby people can find an entry into the labour market who would otherwise remain unemployed. We heard this morning from the Commissioner that they wanted a meeting with you to discuss their ideas about how they might produce a framework that could be suggested across Europe and that should form a basis for embracing zero hours to some degree. You prefer to have a wider discussion on youth unemployment, rather than focus simply on that topic. Could we come back to it, and could you give us the strongest argument you can that we should in principle be totally opposed to it when some have been advocating them, albeit not with enthusiasm, given the right conditions surrounding them, as a means of getting people into employment? I got the impression that you were saying, “No, we just do not want to embrace them”—unless I am being unfair to you.

[[[Ignacio Doreste:]]] First of all, a framework agreement was signed by the European employers’ organisation and the ETUC, which was later converted into a Directive on temporary contracts. In that legal statement, we both agreed that indefinite contracts should be the rule rather than the exception. Both parties acknowledged that certain forms of temporary contract could be a stepping stone towards entering the labour market. That is something on which there is an agreement between employers and the ETUC. Having said that, examples of zero-hour contracts are practices that are not the outcome of social dialogue. It is our opinion that whenever we investigate whether a practice might be good or bad for helping workers to enter the labour market, the first thing we should look at is whether that practice was the outcome of social dialogue and whether there was an agreement between the social partners at the national or European level. Fundamentally, in the two cases in the UK that you mentioned, there was no agreement. A traineeship or internship, which is a scheme for when you leave the education system, is definitely not going to be the most qualified job experience of a young person’s life. The trade unions are supporting the schemes, but in order to ensure that they are stepping stones and to ensure that people are not stuck in a vicious circle it is important to define the floor conditions to ensure that it is not going to be possible for companies to make use of that kind of formula, with the same person in that position for a long period. It is also important that these kinds of contracts are covered by the social security system and many other standards.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Let me say a very big thank you to both of you on behalf of us all. I am sure you will all agree that it has been very informative. It certainly makes me realise that we were absolutely right to come here and seek your co-operation, which has been very graciously and generously given. We will send you a copy of the report once we publish it. You will have the transcript to correct or whatever you want to do. Also, thank you in advance for your co-operation in sending us a lot of background data, which will help us to give some measure of solidity to parts of the report that we might not have been able to do without them. Thank you very much. &#xa0;
