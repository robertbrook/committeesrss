"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by David \nBlunkett\n MP\n&#xa0;\nI am very happy to respond all be it briefly (because of the timescale) to the request for evidence.\n&#xa0;\nCan I say how pleased I am that the select committee are addressing this critical issue that has so often been sidelined.\n&#xa0;\nIt was a great pity that \nthe first Millennium Development Goals did not explicitly recognise the enormous and additional challenge faced by those with disabilities in the developing world.\n&#xa0;\nThe simple points that I wish to make are that where disadvantage exists (because of pover\nty, gender, ill health and geographic circumstance), the situation for those with disability is materially and significantly worse. That is why in addressing issues relating to the provision of education for children (and transport to and access into the s\nervice) children with disabilities need substantial additional help as well as investment in cultural change and work with families.\n&#xa0;\nIt is why the facilitation of new technology is so critical in such circumstances as a liberator for youngsters with disa\nbility.\n&#xa0;\nIt is why with relation to the transition from whatever level of schooling has been made available, work needs to be intensive with youngsters if they are to have any chance of earning a living, becoming independent and providing them with the ki\nnd of dignity and self determination which others take for granted.\n&#xa0;\nLinking investment in health and immunisation programmes with positive action in not only preventing but urgent remedial action in relation to disability is also critical.\n&#xa0;\nFor many dis\nabled children (I found this in relation to blindness when visiting East Africa with Sight Servers International) it was evident that with the right measures, disability could either have been prevented or in some circumstances cured.\n&#xa0;\nThis was not simply\n a matter of medical intervention or surgery but also the social measures that needed to go with it to ensure that regular immunisation (and follow up drug provision) was accessed. The work with children in and out of school and families was coordinated ac\nross agencies and, those working on such programmes, actually had some \nidea as to what they were doing. My experience was that with all the best intentions in the world, there were a large number of people who were intermediaries, who had no experience wha\ntsoever and had never been trained in dealing with disability issues.\n&#xa0;\nI am pleased that internationally, there is now mention of disability in the revised programmes but turning good intentions and the right words into action will take something more tha\nn gestures.\n&#xa0;\nWe need practical measures for training, for added value interventions, for follow up and above \nall \nfor coordination between programmes.\n&#xa0;\nEmbedding action to prevent and to support those with disability into programmes will take time. Above \nall, it will take strong and determined will to do so.\n&#xa0;\nIs that will evident?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
