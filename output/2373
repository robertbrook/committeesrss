[normal]Linda Lee â€“ Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I believe strongly that Parliament should include the following clauses:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have had personal experience of the huge improvement to a beautiful track from Halton Gill, over Horse Head Moor to Langstrothdale, which had been completely laid waste by motorbikes, and was fully restored to allow re-vegetation after a few years of motorbike prohibition.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The beautiful areas of our natural countryside must be preserved for present and future generations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I fully support the formal submission made by the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance
[normal](YDGLA) and others.
