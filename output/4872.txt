[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;While the Draft Wales Bill (2013) covers many important matters, here I will concentrate on the proposed reform to National Assembly for Wales (NAW) elections regarding ‘dual candidacy’. I will address two areas: the substance of the proposed reform, and the process of reform.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Dual Candidacy: Substantive Considerations]]]&#xa0;The Government of Wales Act 2006 (GOWA) made a change to the electoral system used for NAW elections, introducing a provision to prevent individuals from standing as candidates both in a constituency and for a regional party list. The justification offered for this change in the Government White Paper preceding the 2006 Act was that “voters are confused and concerned by the way the Assembly’s electoral system permits candidates who lose in a first past the post constituency ballot still to become Assembly Members representing the same area through the regional list system and competing with Assembly Members who defeated them” (Better Governance for Wales, 2005, p.3). The White paper later also argued that “For losing candidates to become Assembly Members regardless of their constituency election results both devalues the integrity of the electoral system in the eyes of the public and acts as a disincentive to vote in constituency elections” (Better Governance for Wales, 2005, pp.28-29).&#xa0;In evidence given to this committee during consideration of the 2006 Act, I argued against the ban on dual candidacy. I believe that the main arguments I developed then remain intact:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;However, while the arguments used to support the 2006 ban do not stand up to any serious scrutiny, the ban is now in place. The question is whether it should remain.&#xa0;Neither AMS with dual candidacy nor AMS without dual candidacy would be my most preferred system for electing the NAW. (I am personally a supporter of the Single Transferrable Vote, as advocated by the Richard Commission). However, of these two versions of AMS, I think that one with dual candidacy is clearly preferable.&#xa0;I find it very difficult to see any strong principled arguments against dual candidacy. Opponents of dual candidacy have argued that it is inappropriate for those who have already been rejected by the electorate in a particular constituency to nonetheless end up being elected. This, I believe, represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the AMS electoral system – at least in its MMP variant. Defeated constituency candidates have, of course, been rejected for that particular constituency. But list seats are a wholly different type of mandate, and under MMP these seats are allocated in a way that specifically allows for the representation of parties who have not been very successful in constituency contests – parties who have, in a sense, been rejected at the constituency level. If parties that are defeated at constituency level can still win representation through the list, then it is difficult to see why that should not also apply to individuals.&#xa0;Banning dual candidacy under the MMM variant of AMS makes a little more sense. Under MMM, the constituency and list elections are wholly separate, with the allocation of list seats unrelated to success in the constituencies. In this context, requiring parties to offer separate groups of candidates for these separate contests perhaps makes some sense. For MMP, it makes no sense whatsoever. This is probably why no countries or regions other than Wales who have implemented the MMP version of AMS have seen any compelling reasons to ban dual candidacy.&#xa0;There are also some good practical reasons for favouring dual candidacy. First, banning dual candidacy helps to create some perverse incentives. In particular, banning dual candidacy makes it electorally advantageous for a party’s list candidates to see their constituency candidates lose. Similarly, voters wishing to see a particular list candidate elected may have an incentive to vote against that candidate’s party in the constituency election.&#xa0;Second (and I think, far more importantly), there is a compelling need to ensure that the electoral system does not inhibit the quality of elected representation within the NAW. The Assembly has only 60 members – as many have argued, a wholly inadequate number. Given the paucity of AMs, we should certainly not impose restrictions on the ability of the parties to ensure that their best people (or at least those whom the parties believe are their best people) are elected to the Assembly. This was a principal conclusion of the recent detailed investigation of AMS conducted in New Zealand, where the system was introduced to replace First Past the Post in the 1990s. As the final report of this commission stated, “It is both proper and desirable under MMP that political parties can protect good candidates contesting marginal or unwinnable electorates [constituencies] by positioning them high enough on their list to be elected.” (Report of the Electoral Commission on the Review of the MMP Voting System, 2012, p.38)&#xa0;Thirdly, there are better ways than a ban on dual candidacy to remove the problems that have occasionally been reported with constituency representatives being concerned that list AMs are encroaching on ‘their turf’. One way would be to implement the Richard Commission recommendation of STV. STV would remove the problem of there being two categories of elected representative (constituency and list), and place all AMs on the same footing. A second way of addressing the problem might be to elect list AMs from a national list (with a 5% minimum threshold imposed to prevent the system fragmenting excessively). This would remove any sense of local representation from list members, and might well therefore reduce the scope for friction between constituency and list members.&#xa0;By far the most detailed examination of AMS conducted in recent times is that produced in New Zealand. The report of this Commission, which drew on substantial evidence from numerous sources, is an impressive piece of work. On dual candidacy, the report’s conclusion was unambiguous: “Candidates should continue to be able to stand both for an electorate [constituency] seat and be on a party list” (Report of the Electoral Commission on the Review of the MMP Voting System, 2012, p.37).&#xa0;I see no reason to disagree with this conclusion.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Reforming ]]]

[[[the NAW Electoral System]]]

[[[: Improving the Process]]]&#xa0;Debates about dual candidacy, both in 2006 and now, raise questions of process as well as substance. The following statements are so obvious as to border on the banal, but they have, I think, important implications for when and how electoral systems are reformed:&#xa0;&#xa0;From these statements, it follows fairly directly that political parties should be inhibited from changing electoral rules to their own benefit. It also follows that any changes to the rules that are implemented should command widespread, cross-party support.&#xa0;Evaluated in relation to these standards, the 2006 dual candidacy ban fell a long way short of the ideal. The ban was mentioned in the 2005 Labour manifesto, so there was in some sense an electoral mandate for the change. However, as described above, the ban was introduced on the basis of very dubious arguments, and underpinned by little or no obviously principled conduct. The ban was also introduced by one party against widespread opposition: not only that of all the other major parties, but also against the views of most other relevant non-partisan actors (the Electoral Commission, the Electoral Reform Society, and most academic commentators). This is surely an example, in terms of the process of electoral reform, that we in Wales should seek never to repeat.&#xa0;One could also question the procedural legitimacy of Westminster continuing, over the long-term, to legislate over electoral arrangements for the NAW, given that the Assembly is a body with its own democratic mandate. Such questions may become particularly stark in the future if one sees UK governments elected with very limited electoral support from Wales.&#xa0;I therefore propose that the Wales Bill should be amended to transfer powers over the conduct of NAW elections to the National Assembly. However, to prevent any possibility of manipulation of the electoral rules by any one party, the Bill should also provide for a ‘super-majority’ requirement for any change to the current law, with a three-quarters majority of all NAW members needed to approve any changes. This would prevent any single party from changing the electoral system to suit its own interests; indeed, a three-quarters majority would also have prevented the 2007-11 Labour-Plaid coalition from changing the electoral system without the support of at least one other party.&#xa0;6 January 2014&#xa0; I thank Prof David Farrell (University College Dublin), Dr Thomas Lundberg (University of Glasgow), Prof Louis Massicote (Laval University, Quebec) and Dr Alan Renwick (University of Reading) for assistance and advice in drafting this evidence. See evidence by Prof David Farrell of University College Dublin to the Irish Convention on the Constitution, in Fourth Report of the Convention on the Constitution, August 2013 (https://www.constitution.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=fdf70670-030f-e311-a203-005056a32ee4). Bavaria offers an interesting variant of MMP: it uses open-list MMP, where Bavarians vote for individual party list candidates, not closed party lists. It does not allow for the dual listing of candidate names in the particular single-member constituency in which a candidate stands, because the constituency candidates' names would be on the ballot papers twice. These candidates, however, must be dual candidates and are on their parties' ballot paper lists everywhere else in the electoral region. It should be pointed out, for the sake of accuracy that Hungary’s system, and Italy’s between 1993-2005, are/were only semi-proportional. The ban on dual candidacy in Ukraine was introduced prior to the 2002 parliamentary elections – by the same party that not long afterwards attempted to fix the result of the presidential election and poison the main opposition candidate. In debates preceding the 2006 GOWA, particular attention focused on the example of the 2003 constituency contest in Clwyd West, where three defeated constituency candidates all ended up being elected as list AMs.  Report of the Electoral Commission on the Review of the MMP Voting System, 2012; available at:http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/have-your-say/final-report. One might reasonably question the extent to which voters had been informed about, never mind endorsed, the dual candidacy ban in the 2005 general election. The issue was barely discussed in the main Labour manifesto, which stated only that “In Wales we will develop democratic devolution by creating a stronger Assembly with enhanced legislative powers and a reformed structure and electoral system to make the exercise of Assembly responsibilities clearer and more accountable to the public” (p.108, Britain Forward not Back). The dual candidacy ban was only mentioned explicitly on pp.108-110 of the Welsh Labour manifesto, Wales Forward not Back.
