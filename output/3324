defaultI feel a basic organisational flaw is 
defaultinherant
default in the organisation called the IPCC..
defaultThe IPCC is 100% AGW lobbyists/scientists
defaultThere are many other climate groups/ scientists that are 100% the opposite. 
defaultTHey
default are 100% AGW sceptics
defaultThe supposed AGW consensus is a fallacy
defaultA true outlook on future
default climate cannot be achieved until the reports incorporate both sides of the debate
defaultYou must recognise that the IPCC is 100% biased and committed to 
defaultAGWscience
default alone and pays little to no attention to natural variability
defaultTHe
default 100% reliance on computer climat
defaulte simulations is worrying.. 
defaultTHey
default are beta products 
defaultuntrialled
default and unproven
defaultTHe
default IPCC research is selected and chosen with an affirmative position ONLY!!
defaultYou need to 
defaultincorportae
default some of the oppositions science to get a balance of the true body of knowledge o
defaultf climate science
defaultThe climate journals are controlled by AGW 
defaultprotaganists
default and alternative science is squashed or hidden is so called sub standard journals
defaultTHank
default goodness this input/submission  is a start to governments thinking about the alternative views 
defaultof many climate scientists who are not AGW advocates
defaultIf the UK met office wants to lead world climate research . 
defaultTHey
default will not shun and demoralise alternative research.!. 
defaultEmply
default some AGW 
defaultskeptics
