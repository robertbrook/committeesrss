[normal]Written evidence submitted by Susan Morrow (IPC0003)[bold]My name is Susan Morrow . I am a retired science teacher and an  amateur

[normal]As a follower of climate issues

[normal]I feel a basic organisational flaw is 
[normal]inherant
[normal] in the organisation called the IPCC..
[normal]The IPCC is 100% AGW lobbyists/scientists
[normal]There are many other climate groups/ scientists that are 100% the opposite. 
[normal]THey
[normal] are 100% AGW sceptics
[normal]The supposed AGW consensus is a fallacy
[normal]A true outlook on future
[normal] climate cannot be achieved until the reports incorporate both sides of the debate
[normal]You must recognise that the IPCC is 100% biased and committed to 
[normal]AGWscience
[normal] alone and pays little to no attention to natural variability
[normal]THe
[normal] 100% reliance on computer climat
[normal]e simulations is worrying.. 
[normal]THey
[normal] are beta products 
[normal]untrialled
[normal] and unproven
[normal]THe
[normal] IPCC research is selected and chosen with an affirmative position ONLY!!
[normal]You need to 
[normal]incorportae
[normal] some of the oppositions science to get a balance of the true body of knowledge o
[normal]f climate science
[normal]The climate journals are controlled by AGW 
[normal]protaganists
[normal] and alternative science is squashed or hidden is so called sub standard journals
[normal]THank
[normal] goodness this input/submission  is a start to governments thinking about the alternative views 
[normal]of many climate scientists who are not AGW advocates
[normal]If the UK met office wants to lead world climate research . 
[normal]THey
[normal] will not shun and demoralise alternative research.!. 
[normal]Emply
[normal] some AGW 
[normal]skeptics
[normal] on an  equal basis!!
[normal]Climate models should NOT be the main so
[normal]urce of climate prediction this early in their developmen
