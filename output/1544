defaultBy their very nature MSLs assessments are seen to be prejudicial to 
defaultmeeting the
default needs of 
defaultthese vulnerable groups 
defaultwho are already at higher risk of isolation, less able to access health and retail services [often including Post Offices and Banks] 
defaultand there is little, if any, evidence that the
defaultir
default needs influence 
defaultthese decisions.
default&#xa0;
default2.2. 
defaultHowever 
defaultfeedback 
defaultfrom
default 
defaultsome
default resident
defaults 
defaultshows 
defaultthat there is a ‘cultivated resilience’ based on cycling; walking; ‘cadging a lift’ and ‘friendly taxi services. The qualification is that ‘no pavements’ and ‘no street lighting
default’
default impose restrictions on times of day. It has been pointed out that it 
defaultalso affects visitors.
default&#xa0;
default2.2. 
defaultFor those reasons
default [2.1.]
default it is imperative that Community Transport 
default[CT] 
defaultinitiatives [e.g. encouraging very local ‘Book –A-Ride schemes] are 
defaultprovided
default and
default that
default every opportunity is used to ensure that residents are aware of such services.
default Local Community Transport ‘not – for – profit’ operators should be encouraged to apply for Section 19 &amp; Section 22 permits. The use of concessionary fare 
defaultpasses should be exten
defaultded to CT in ‘off route’ localities.
default&#xa0;
default2.3. 
defaultEarly indications are that t
defaulthe use of 
defaultDemand Responsive Transport [
defaultDRT
default]
default facilities to link with conventional services, effectively linking small settlements to the ‘Normal Routes’ which serve the bigger villages 
defaultin the same area
default, could be a positive step
default – i.e. judgements on Routes 
defaultrather than location
default.
default&#xa0;
default3
default default. defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services defaultto isolated communities? How can these challenges be odefaultvercome?default3.1. The Challenges.
defaultThe main challenges are seen to be ensuring that services:
default-  Satisfy residents’ needs;
default-  Are co-ordinated, integrated, and affordable;
default-  Reduce car usage, road congestion; and
default a
defaults a consequence decrease in the carbon 
defaultfootprint.
default&#xa0;
default3.2. The County Council has focused on two primary 
defaultgoals:default• to tackle the growth in car use and consequential increase in congestion; and
default• to improve accessibility to the four key service/amenities of health, employment, education and food sho
defaultpping for identified socially excluded groups.
defaultWe would prefer the wider definition:- ‘residents in rural areas, especially socially excluded groups’.
defaultWe also see it as essential that 
defaultthere is a 
defaultcommitment to use new technology to provide easily accessible
default ‘Real Time’ reliable, accurate
default travel information covering, and available in, rural areas.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.3. From our members’ feedback the personal reasons for using a car are pointedly related to 
defaultstaged journeysdefault 
default[i.e. changes for various parts of the journey]
default   wi
defaultth dis-satisfaction focused on the inconveniences:
default- the journey, it’s stages / distances 
defaultt
defaultimes
default and ticketing
default and, above all reliability
default; 
default- the weather; 
default- having to carry (heavy) items;
default- 
defaultT
defaulthe walking environment
default /
default 
defaultavailability of 
defaultsafe
default cycling routes
default to bus stops or train stations; and 
default- parking facilities/costs at railway stations.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default4
default. Tackling the problems.
defaultFrom our review of various Government and other reports dealing with rural services it is seen as essential to:
default- Address the perceived p
defaultract
defaultical barriers to using public transport;
default              
default- 
defaultQuestion the relative costs
default 
defaultof using the car
default; 
default              
default- Adopt a 
defaultDoor – to- Door defaultstrategy
default based on sustainable transport and integration of services.
defaultSuccessful integration is seen to require direct ‘fast’ [express] routes - Rail and Road- that are reliable, 
defaultand 
defaultsupported by flexible demand responsive services.
default&#xa0;default3.
default5
default. Marketing.

default.1 Levels of interest.
defaultLocal feedback indicates that people plan and make
default their travel decisions based on:
default- Needs, options and experience [level of satisfaction and /or prejudice]; 
default- Information available; information provided including advertising; but
default- Above all on ‘trust’ – i
default.e.
default certainty /reliability of delivery and
default easy
default access to real time information
default 
default 
defaultwhen   problems occur e.g. delays, breakdowns and re-routing through road closures / events.
default              
default&#xa0;
default3.

default.2. Generally speaking we have found that the level of knowledge about services is greater for ‘
defaultcaptive passengers’
default i.e. 
defaultpeople with 
defaultno practical alternative. For this group they have their 
defaultown 
defaultexperience
defaults
default and share knowledge /enquiry points with and through fellow passengers – the value from “word of mouth”.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
default‘choice passengers’
default tend not to consider the alternative to t
defaulthe car, or if they do, find difficulty in accessing relevant information, particularly on links and ticketing. 
defaultTo win them over it will be necessary to design/ publish routes 
defaultas seamless and as easy as ‘getting in the car’.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default5
default.3. A fundamental need is a
default series of coordinated, proactive advertising campaigns with clear definition of routes, links and ticketing arrangements. Part of which has to be ready access to ‘ door-to-door’ information including the ‘park &amp; ride’ options with specific attention to st
defaultation car parks!
default&#xa0;
default3.
default5
default.4. The other side of the ‘campaigning’ is to target the car user by presenting real evidence of the cost of using a car and for individuals recognising the time their journeys by car actually take. Other factors are the ability to ‘wo
defaultrk’ on the journey.
defaultThe downside is the effect on the local economy; Servicing and fuel sales. 
defaultCompromise
default? Car sharing!
default&#xa0;
default3.
default5
default.5. 
defaultTo 
defaultdevelop
default 
defaultthe local economy the potential for targeting / encouraging 
defaultvisitors defaultwarrants active consideration, not only for
default the 
defaultsocial contact from 
default visiting relatives b
defaultut particularly ‘tourists’ for local 
defaultattractions
default e.g. scenery and waterways, country walks/ cycle rides and wildlife/ bird sanctuaries. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.default Howdefault effectively defaultddefaulto community transport services address the needs of passdefaultengers in isolated communities? How can community transport be improved?default4.1. Maldon District Community Transport [‘Viking’] is largely funded by Essex County Council in partnership with Maldon District Council. It is a registered charity and therefore pos
defaultsible for the Trustee Board to apply for additional grants from other funding sources. Viking runs its services 
defaultunder
default two main headings;
default4.1.1.  Book – A - ride Schemedefault.
defaultAn annual 
defaultmembership 
defaultsubscription is charged.
default 
defaultThe scheme 
defaultprovides
default a pre-booked, chargea
defaultble service that collects a member from their home and takes them t
defaulto the required destination. Used
default for such things as shopping, visiting friends, social outings, learning opportunities 
defaultand
default to visit people in hospital. The services are carried out by
default volunteer drivers using their
default own vehicles or by wheelchair accessible minibus.
defaultThe charges are based on a cost per mile with a minimum charge per one-way trip when using volunteers and their vehicles. Where there is no volunteer driver available within a
default reasonable distance of the passengers ‘pick up’ community transport can subsidise each journey. Due to the higher costs of running an accessible minibus a subsidised sliding scale of charges is available on application.
defaultEvery journey must be booked with a
default minimum two working days’ notice and can be block booked for regular journeys - all bookings are dependent on a volunteer driver being available.
defaultThe Scheme is 
defaultwholly
default dependent on volunteer drivers. 
default4.1.2. Minibus hire scheme.defaultThe scheme enables any bona
default fide non-profit making
default member
default group within the district to hire a minibus. The minibuses have up to 15 passenger seats which can be configured to accommodate wheelchairs.
default 
defaultBookings are made on a first-come first-served basis and must be made at least five 
defaultworking days in advance.
default 
defaultGroups using the service pay an annual subscription. The hiring of a minibus is on a unit cost per mile for the total journey. There is a minimum charge per hire.
defaultCurrently 
default‘
defaultViking
default’
default ha
defaults
default about 
default90 fully trained MIDAS drivers. All dri
defaultvers are CRB checked. Some groups have their own 
defaultregistered qualified 
defaultdriver which allows easier planned excursions.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.2. 
defaultImprovements looked for are:
default- Better publicity and proactive community engagement especially for 
defaultvolunteer 
defaultdriver recruitment;
default- 
defaultMore decentralised location of minibuses to reduce dead mileage and improve convenience for drivers;
default- 
default 
defaultConsideration of service / operational advantages that Section 
default2
default2 Permits bring;
default-  Campaign for concessionary bus passes to be used
default for CT services
default in 
default‘deep rural’ / 
defaultMSL 
defaultareas to link with
default   
defaultMain
default 
defaultroutes [Bus and Rail].
default&#xa0;
default5. defaultTo what extendefaulttdefault defaultshould defaultpassengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxdefaultidefaults and other demand responsive transport services?default5.1. Taxis are often not a real option due to costs. Service providers tend to be based in the ‘busier areas’ with their focus on higher numbers of customers for shorter /regular journeys. Travel vouchers for meeting part of the 
defaultjourney 
defaultcost where a conces
defaultsionary fare pass is held are a possible answer to taxi fares but are seen as an ‘administrative nightmare’.
default&#xa0;
default5.2. 
defaultIntegration of services by 
defaultDRT links
default [commercial and subsidised]
default to bus and train 
defaultroutes are seen to be the 
defaulteffective 
defaultway forward.
default 
default&#xa0;default6. What defaultare the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated community? How can these services be made more affordable?default6.1. We are in a ‘guess and fear’ stage. To date, for a lay group such as ourselves, information on the cuts, and thei
defaultr timing, is being released in general terms only. Attempts to get assessment from both local councils and service operators have essentially been dead batted. Everyone it seems is waiting for details. The first challenge is to provide details of subsidy b
defaultudget changes i.e. for both subsidised commercial services and Community Transport services. At the same time it is essential that the proposals for changes to commercial services are the subject of discussion at the same time.
default&#xa0;
default6.2. The broadly held assum
defaultption is that we are entering into a less [possibly non-] subsidised era. In some quarters there is a belief that, over and above the CSR, overall bus subsidies could be reduced by up to 50%. The expectation is that the impact from BSOG changes /reductions
default will be heavier in rural areas which are unlikely to be developed as 
default‘
defaultBetter Bus Areas
default’
default. Then there are fuel price rises. 
defaultThe fear in some quarters is that there is also the prospect that the reimbursement for concessionary fare passengers will not be ‘i
defaultnflation proofed’.  If this were to be true it will almost inevitably mean that there will be a freezing of, if not reduction in, mainstream bus services. 
default&#xa0;
default6.3. 
defaultThere is general, if reluctant, a
defaultccept
defaultance
default that the budget changes driven by the need to reduc
defaulte public expenditure will inevitably mean that funding will decline and reinforce the need for efficiency in the design/delivery of services. 
defaultThat
default should also mean 
defaultall
default services/budgets are reviewed to ensure they 
defaulteach
default provide the best match against social 
defaultneeds. In turn that requires a move from ‘Post graduate mathematics’ to meaningful communication; paying less attention to 
defaultwhatdefault we spend, rather put the emphasis on 
defaulthowdefault we spend it.
default&#xa0;
default6.4. Our
default experiences
default lead us to believe that even without the budget redu
defaultctions the ‘Big Society’ proposals provide th
defaulte
default opportunity to think laterally– to focus on local transport needs and tailor facilities to match those needs in the context of both the economy and the environment. With meaningful community engagement i.e. In
defaultvolvement* allowing agreement on local priorities
default,
default these strategies ar
defaulte seen as a sound framework for 
defaultactiondefault.
default* I.e. 
defaultthe step 
defaultbeyond consultation [This is what we are going to do –what do you think?]; past partic
defaultipation [
defaultthis is what we are going to do how
default can it be done?] 
default&#xa0;
default6.5. Fares versus public funding.

defaultment
default ‘in kind’ i.e. 
defaulttheir 
defaulttime
default and skills
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.5.2. 
defaultIt is seen as essential in planning public transport that education
default and
default health
default authorities think about transport beyond the statutory deliverables. Local partnerships will need to include
default 
defaultin the
defaultir
default deliberations 
defaulteducation planning and hospital transport
default, including moving staff and patients
default between hospitals
default. This also covers the need
default to ensure fair and equitable access to extending school provision – breakfast and after-school club events. This planning is seen to be particularly important with the reduction/withdrawal of education maintenance allowance
default and the features attached to th
defaulte extension of school leaving age
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.5.3. 
defaultSignificantly the 
defaultlargely (
default85% by mileage
default) commercially operated bus network will, by its 
defaultvery 
defaultnature, be
default 
defaultsubject to commercial pressures and changes.
default 
defaultWith any level of service reduction the impact is likely to be
default serious at this time when both customers [passengers] and contractors need usage to rise in order to maintain, let alone improve, service levels.
default Our view is that there is an urgent need for voluntary and community sector groups working in partnership wi
defaultth the local contractors, to design and provide more rational, integrated and relevant facilities. However, without access to facts it is impossible to even start pulling together a meaningful business plan. 
default&#xa0;
default6.6. Policies.
default6.6.1. A basic rule of Manageme
defaultnt is that “
defaultPlans should be Strategy led and Resource disciplined
default” and therein lies a [the] major challenge. Both Essex County Council and Maldon District Council have published detailed Strategic Plans in the past but both expired in 2011 and have yet to 
defaultbe updated / replaced. Whilst the content gave a clear view of what was looked for, the steps to achieve them were not always clear. The reality check for plans made by all levels of Government is that although budgets have been set, the spending will be s
defaultubject to political choice – possibly well illustrated by current debate over HS2. 
default&#xa0;
default6.6.2. Again in Management terms it is not only necessary to decide 
defaultWhatdefault it is you want to happen but decide 
defaultHow defaultto make it happen. This presents a further challenge 
defaultwhen
default 
defaultdeciding authority / accountability. All too often the bureaucracy gets in the way to delay action/ delivery and increase costs – should it really take over two years to put in place a bus stop to reduce risk of injury to people alighting from a bus? It ha
defaults in Burnham! 
default&#xa0;
default6.7. Looking Forward.
default6.7.1. Central Government has given a clear lead with the Strategies ‘
defaultMaking transport more accessible to all’
default and 
default‘
defaultDoor to door’
default , 
defaultrecommending
default activity concentrating on 4 core areas:
default&#xa0;
default6.8. “Liaison is the Key”default6.8.1. Provided the ‘Localism’ [
defaultsee para 6.4.]
default approach is adopted then we have 
defaultevery reason to think that the challenges can be met through active community engagement. This will require ‘
defaultPartnership Working’
default with the 
default‘Policy People’
default debating the practicalities of delivery with 
default‘Operational Managers’
default as part of their planning process
default and involve service managers and staff in setting standards and measuring them.
defaultECC already work closely with bus service users, as ’critical friends’, and service providers to improve transport services –that will need to be the platform for making best 
defaultuse of available resources. 
default&#xa0;
default6.9. Options.
default6.9.1. Commercial bus operators have several options, they can: 
default- 
defaultRaise fares - 
defaultin rural areas such as ours it is felt that current competitive pressures are insufficient to 
default   establish
default a meaningful ‘best value’ test; 
default- 
defaultReduce service levels – local experience is that it is all too easy to simply cut out part of the route 
default   effectively to choo
defaultse the most rewarding locations;
default- Tactical reductions in service frequency, operating hours 
defaultor days can create savings for operators.
default&#xa0;
default6.9.2. Overall our expectation is that low utilisation bus services will be cut and the number of subsidised routes reduced.
default We see it as essential that priority is given to the needs of most vulnerable groups wh
defaultere service reductions are proposed and the expectation would be that ECC would find a contractor
default 
defaultto provide supported journeys
default – in doing so there is the opportunity to adopt DRT links to main services
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.9.
default3
default. Railway Companies’ fares are inflation rela
defaultted so the issues for rail travel are somewhat different i.e. tend to be geared to/aligned with customer demand. If a 
defaultrail 
defaultcompany were to hit financial problems they could hand back the franchise and the Government would 
defaultbe likely to 
defaultstep in to ensure 
defaultcontinuity of the service before re-letting the franchise with much the same
default 
defaultservice specification as before [e.g. East Coast mainline].
default&#xa0;
default6.
default9.
default4
default.
default A probable consequence of LA budget cuts [including Community Transport funding] will be that
default Publicly Supporte
defaultd Bus services
default 
defaultare removed, reduced, or the network altered.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default9.
default5
default. To avoid some ‘no 
defaultcommercial 
defaultservice’ situation
defaults
default, customer expectation of fares may well need to change. So that affordable fares can be offered, the emphasis will need to be on 
defaultencouragidefaultng more paying customersdefault [“greater passenger contribution”] and that will require more convenient services i.e. fit for purpose.
default&#xa0;

default County Councils 
defaultneed to 
defaultplan on the basis of:
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEncouraging/incentivising the Community Transport sector including

default-

defaultThrough Community engagement encourage more volunteers and Group memberships;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUsing the authority’s central role/leverage to bring private services to passengers more cheaply e.g. 
defaultdiscounted taxi services; or, supporting the infrastructure for car share schemes, etc.

default 
defaultReview 
defaultConcessionary fares
default.
default a] This has been a live issue since our Group was formed and as a consequence opinions have been canvassed. The original concern, a
defaultnd campaign goal was for the ‘early start time’ [i.e. 9 AM rather than the strategy guide of 9.30]. The local case for the adjustment is based on the infrequency of service and to avoid unfairness where people further along the route could use the bus whil
defaultst others were ’departure time excluded’.
defaultFeedback at members’ meetings to the question –“would you be prepared to pay a reduced fare [as distinct to free passage]?” brings a strong response; “yes – provided it was a good service”. The general finding is t
defaulthat the potential to travel countrywide is not jealously guarded. The discussions are almost always centred on the convenience of the service rather than the cost.
default&#xa0;
defaultb] 
defaultFor people currently using buses to travel to work there is concern that fares will increase or services will be lost as the number of pensioners increases [the progressive increase in retirement age is largely being overlooked]. This is not only because n
defaultational concessionary funding does not increase in line with the network coverage, but also from the strong suggestions that the payments to contractors for concessionary fares are to be frozen or reduced and rural services will therefore be the first to s
defaultuffer. 
defaultNeedless to say if there is no service, the pass is meaningless, already the case in some localities in this area.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnd finallydefault our bottom linedefault:defaultIt is our Group members’ firm belief that there is a need for a thorough review of services on the basidefaults of integrating passenger transport – using DRT services to feed ‘express routes’default [analogy between raildefault infrastructure adefaultnd bus routing] defaultanddefault including ‘Park and Ride’ facilities defaultusingdefault railway station car parks.default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultAppendixdefault&#xa0;defaultDengie Hundred Bus Users Group.defaultBackground: What We Do.defaultThe Group was originally set up
default,
default 
defaultin 2010, 
defaultto combat the withdrawal of service through a local village [Althorne]. However that exercise coincided with the consultation review of concessionary fares 
defaultwhich
default led to more members and a wi
defaultder review. It soon became apparent that the problems being encountered in Althorne are also the experience across the whole of the Dengie and in all probability will be representative of problems in other rural areas. It is for that reason that we feel it
default is appropriate to make this submission and share ideas on
default  “what needs to be done”
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultDHBUG’s Purpose is to:
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRepresent the interests of bus users in the Dengie Peninsula;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAct as a focal point between bus users, bus service providers and local authorities; 
defaultand

defaultCampaign on behalf of bus users 
defaultfor continued and improved bus services and travel facilities in the Dengie Hundred area as part of an overall public transport system that:
defaultWe see it as essential to develop strategies that:
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecognise that ‘accessibility’ needs to be measured and addressed on a 
default‘whole journey’ basis;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultE
defaultnsure that the focus at all levels of government is on facilitating the 
defaultintegrationdefault of public transport i.e.  Commercial bus/trains with and between other servic
defaultes such as school buses, hospital/community transport – with increased use of ‘tailored’ Demand Responsive Transport [DRT] as a means of sustaining / improving passenger take up across all public transport services; and
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultActively encourage and support publi
defaultc engagement in both Strategic and Operational Management Plans
default.
defaultParticipation.defaultA number of the Committee /members have been involved in an Essex County Council Task and Finish Group involved in the design and introduction the Dengie
default Dart 99 a ‘Dial and Ride’ service from the Dengie to Hospitals and preparing the ground for renewal of local contracts for supported services.  As a result of which some now include DRT elements. Several of our members also serve as Parish Council Transpo
defaultrt Representatives.
defaultOur Area: The Dengie.defaultThe Dengie Peninsula is part of the Maldon District in ‘Central Essex’. The peninsula covers an area of about 140 square miles. It is surrounded by water; to the east by the North Sea; to the north by the River Bla
defaultckwater; to the south by the River Crouch. There are no bridges across the estuaries, the lowest crossing points on Maldon [Blackwater] and Battlesbridge [Crouch]. The three main centres of population are Burnham on Crouch, Southminster, and Mayland. The p
defaulteninsula has two of the least densely occupied electoral wards in Essex – Tillingham and St Lawrence.
defaultThe ‘Pensioner Population’ is projected to continue to grow. Against an overall population growth of 5% between 2010 and 2015 the prediction is that the ‘
defaultover 65s’ will increase by 23% and account for 22% of the population: whilst the ‘over 80s’ will show a 17% increase to about 5% of the total. Feedback shows that generally as they get older people look to drive less, but with infrequent ‘unreliable’ 
defaultpubli
defaultc transport 
defaultservices find they still need to drive themselves even 
defaultthough 
defaultthey feel unhappy about doing so!
default&#xa0;
defaultFor the District as a whole it is reported that 93% of the 25,000 households have at least one car and 15% of these have two or more [3348 househol
defaultds]. When a car is used for work the remainder of the house
defaulthold
default will often be dependent on other means of transport. 69% of economically active residents use 
defaulta car
default to travel to work, either as drivers or passengers. 9% use public transport [7% train; 2% bu
defaults]. 13% cycle or walk. About half the workforce travel out of the district by train or bus and 78% 
defaultof those 
defaultby car
default for at least part of the journey
default. These figures illustrate dependence
default of people
default in the area on private transport
default and the potential for change
default.
defaultWith migration into the district and increased housing as a result of the 
defaultL
defaultocal 
defaultD
defaultevelopment 
defaultP
defaultlan the probability is that the number of commuters will increase. Extra traffic and increased congestion is anticipated on the already inadequate road infrastru
defaultcture because of these 
defaultand related
