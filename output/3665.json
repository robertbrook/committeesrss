"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from the Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime [CST0019]&#xa0;&#xa0;I have \nbeen made aware of an allegat\ni\non ma\nd\ne today by James Patrick about the challenge set by the Mayor's Office for Po\nli\ncing And Crime (MOPAC) to the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) to reduce 7 key neighbourhood crimes (the MOPAC 7) by 20 per cent over the pe\nriod 2012/13-2016/17. I understand tha\nt \nyour comm\ni\nttee heard an 'anecdote' that th\ni\ns target emerged following an error by a speechwr\ni\nter. This is categor\nic\nally untrue.\n&#xa0;\nFollowing consultat\ni\non with the MPS a high-level target for a reduction in victim-based\n offences was defined in 2012 and was consulted on as part of our draft Police and Crime Plan in early 2013\n. \nOur final plan was published in March. The plan, which includes further details about this challenge, can be found on the GLA webs\ni\nte (\nwww.london.gov.uk\n)\n. \nI would be happy to write to your committee \ni\nn more detail about the process for developing the MOPAC 7 \nif \nthis would be helpful.\n&#xa0;\nI also understand that allegations were made that the creation of the MOPAC \n7 will lead to manipulation of crime figures, or victims being ignored, with crimes that fall with\ni\nn the 7 be\ni\nng categorised as different crime types- so called 'cuffing'\n. \nThere \nis \nno evidence to support th\ni\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\nYour w\ni\ntnesses specifically referred to offic\ners re-categorising robbery offences as theft from the person and burglary offences as criminal damage\n. \nAs \nboth theft from the per\ns\non and criminal damage are included in the MOPAC 7, along with \nrobbery \nan\nd \nburglary, this would be entirely \ncounterproductive. Cons\ni\nderation was given to this when the MOPAC 7 were developed.\n&#xa0;\nWith regard to sexual offences, we have set no targets on these and so it is \ni\nncorrect to suggest that MOPAC targets are driving inappropriate behaviour. In fact, we have \ncelebrated \nincreased \nreporting of these offences \nin \nthe light of significant levels of underreporting.\n&#xa0;\nFinally, I entirely reject the suggestion that the only way the MPS can meet the challenge we \nhave set them \nis \nby 'fudging' the figures. The ambition is\n a challenging one, but it \ni\ns manageable, and good progress is be\ni\nng made as we seek to ensure that Lon\nd\non \nis \nthe safest big city in the world.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
