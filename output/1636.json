"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by WOMENSTEC Belfast (WSC031)Introduction - WOMENSTEC\n1.\n              \nThe WOMEN'STEC is an innovative organisation in Northern Ireland which aims to provide facilities to \nadvance women's involvement in sectors of training and employment in areas dominated by men, such as construction and IT, and specifically women who are socially and economically disadvantaged.\n2.\n              \nThe WOMEN'STEC was born of a recognised need for non tradit\nional training for women in Northern Ireland. \"Non Traditional Training\" refers to training for jobs in industry sectors with historically low female representation.\n3.\n              \nTraditionally women have not opted for or been trained in construction and IT jobs, and\n even today they represent a minuscule percentage of trainee places across the North and South of Ireland as a whole.\n4.\n              \nThe WOMEN'STEC is unique in that we support women to address the barriers that prevent them from embarking on a career in industry. Whe\nther this is lack of childcare, problems with travel, financial implications or lack of confidence to go into a male dominated industry, we will support them in overcoming these issues.\nBackground to the Underrepresentation of Women in STEM Careers\n5.\n              \nIn t\nhe experience of WOMENSTEC, women face multiple barriers to entry into occupations traditionally regarded as male, such as STEM careers and manual trades, as follows:\na.\n              \nSocietal expectations and attitudes about what constitutes ‘women’s’ and ‘men’s’ \njobs\nb.\n              \nUpbringing that assumes ‘male’ and ‘female’ stereotypes, such as what toys male and \nfemale children are given, parental and family role models, household tasks, etc.\nc.\n              \nStreaming towards ‘male’ and ‘female’ subjects in education\nd.\n              \nCareers advice that a\nssumes ‘male’ and ‘female’ stereotypes for future employment\ne.\n              \n‘Male’ environments in further education establishments for STEM and manual \ntrades subjects\nf.\n              \nReluctance of companies to take female apprentices\ng.\n              \n‘Male’ working environments in majority mal\ne workplaces\nh.\n              \nWorkplace discrimination and harassment\ni.\n              \nIsolation of small numbers of women in ‘male’ occupations\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.\n              \nThese social and physical barriers can be summarised in the following table\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.\n              \nThese issues have been traced in the past by variou\ns reports, such as that of the Women and Work Commission report of 2006\n, and these influences are still being noted today.  Past research has shown that men in majority female occupations do not suffer the same disadvantage, indeed are more likely to pros\nper than in other occupations\n.\nInitiatives to Encourage Women into STEM Careers\n8.\n              \nBearing in mind the barriers, WOMENSTEC has developed practices to encourage \nwomen in entering non-traditional occupations\n.  These include the following:\na.\n              \nAwareness \nraising\n – Stereotypical attitudes are challenged through public advertising, participation in events and outreach in community organisations.\nb.\n              \nNon-traditional training\n – Initial training in all-women environments provide opportunities for women to acquir\ne non-traditional skills in areas such as joinery, plumbing, horticulture, ICT, electrics and decorating in a supportive environment with a view to transition to more advanced training in male-dominated environments.\nc.\n              \nCapacity building\n – Alongside non-tr\naditional training, women receive support in areas such as personal development and discrimination awareness to build confidence to enter environments that can be exclusive or even hostile to women.\nd.\n              \nSupport and mentoring\n – During and after non-tradition\nal training, women receive personal support and follow-up to provide help in addressing barriers to participation.\ne.\n              \nRole models\n – Female tutors in non-traditional skills provide training and demonstrate that stereotypes can be broken.\nf.\n              \nPractical experi\nence\n – A social economy business\n brings together women with non-traditional skills providing services to the public and to organisations, particularly those where male providers may present an issue, for example, in women’s refuges, etc.\ng.\n              \nAdvice and \nguidance\n – Non-stereotypical assistance and signposting is provided for women and for other organisations and establishments to demonstrate options for career development beyond sex stereotypes.\nh.\n              \nBusiness start-up\n – Many non-traditional skills, such as m\nanual trades, are relevant to self-employment, where again, women are under-represented.  In this case, women are supported to undertake a trade dominated by men in a sector dominated by men.\n9.\n              \nA model to promote non-traditional occupations for women, sup\nported by EU funding, was the Women into Non-Traditional Sectors (WINS) project, led by Belfast City Council in partnership with other employers (Translink, Northern Ireland Housing Executive and the Construction Industry Training Board) and other organisa\ntions (WOMENSTEC, Training for Women Network, Belfast GEMS, Helm Corporation, Queen’s University Belfast and the Irish Congress of Trades Unions).  The resulting model is represented in the diagram below.\n10.\n              \nThe model worked through the following phases\n:\na.\n              \nAwareness raising and recruitment\n – Through advertising, road shows and direct connection with key organisations, women were encouraged to participate in the project, as well as promoting the idea of non-traditional employment.\nb.\n              \nAssessment\n – The nee\nds and aspirations of participants were discussed in one to one consultations, where those for whom participation in the project were recruited and others referred to other employment opportunities or offered alternative non-traditional training.\nc.\n              \nSoft s\nkills training\n – Participants were engaged in personal development, discrimination awareness and non-traditional taster courses to build confidence and foster the development of non-traditional skills.\nd.\n              \nEmployment-specific training\n – Courses more directe\nd towards the chosen areas of employment were undertaken, including the acquisition of accredited qualifications.\ne.\n              \nWork placement\n – Where applicable, participants undertook work experience in one of the areas of employment on offer from the employers inv\nolved in the project.  Where this experience proved not to be a match with participant aspirations and interests, further referral to other employment opportunities was offered.\nf.\n              \nEmployment training\n – Where applicable, more formal skills training with a \nview to recruitment was undertaken.\ng.\n              \nOnward progression\n – Where matched with a recruitment process, participants applied for work in non-traditional areas with the project employers, progressed to further training, or were referred to other opportunities\n.\nh.\n              \nMentoring and support\n – A key element to the project was ongoing mentoring of participants to provide advice and guidance and to identify and address problems.  Practical support, such as childcare and transport, where appropriate, were provided as in\nterim measures, in view of the needs of the participants and multiple barriers they faced.\n11.\n              \nThe WINS model was tested as a comprehensive approach to encouraging and assisting more women into non-traditional sectors of employment.  It should be seen as a\n set of ingredients that have the potential to address some of the barriers to women entering male-dominated areas of the economy.  Adapting to circumstances, elements of the model can be taken and used in a variety of contexts to tackle the same or simila\nr barriers to participation many women face.  Ultimately, however, the model prepares women for environments shaped for men.  Ideally, environments should be shaped for participation by both women and men\n.\n12.\n              \nIn the interim, an important part of developi\nng the capacity to assist women in entering traditionally male fields is the provision of an environment for the development of skills and confidence in a more supportive environment.  This is where women-only spaces are important as incubation or nurturin\ng environments, so that women can develop non-traditional skills, at least initially, without the pressure or sometimes the hostility that learning spaces oriented towards men can present.  WOMENSTEC is one model where specialised  provisions of training a\nnd support for women considering non-traditional employment can take place, but other women-only spaces, such as in women’s centres or through women-only classes at training establishments, can provide similar or elements of such provision.\n13.\n              \nIf the Comm\nittee would like further information on the models mentioned above,
