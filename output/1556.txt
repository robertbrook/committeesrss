[[[ Problems Caused by Vehicular Use of Green Lanes]]]&#xa0;

[[[Physical Damage]]]&#xa0;Damage to the Route Itself&#xa0;Lanes which have no surface are particularly vulnerable. &#xa0;    &#xa0;&#xa0;Minninglow Lane Feb 2013                                     Moscar Cross Road March 2013&#xa0;Even routes with some sort of surface are subject to water erosion if any gradient is involved. Vehicles exacerbate this by causing ruts which channel water causing scouring and increasing the erosive effect in a vicious cycle.&#xa0;              &#xa0;Left Limer Rake Feb 2013. The original surface was at the base of the walls. There were apertures which allowed water to drain into the fields. The surface is too low for this to work now. Latest scouring is on the left of the path.&#xa0;Right Long Causeway May 2012. Erosion has washed away smaller stones leaving larger rocks exposed.&#xa0;In extreme cases, erosion down to bedrock occurs and “bad steps” are often formed.&#xa0;          &#xa0;Left Brushfield Jan 2013. The limestone becomes polished with wear. When wet the surface is extremely slick and dangerous for all users.&#xa0;Right Swan Rake Hollinsclough Feb 2013. Some steps are 18-24 inches high. Progress for even specially adapted 4x4s may only be possible by self-winching using adjacent telegraph poles.&#xa0;Damage to Adjacent Walls and Verges&#xa0;Drystone walls are a characteristic feature of the landscape and are listed as one of the special qualities of the Peak District National Park. They are easily damaged by off-road vehicles. &#xa0;       &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Picture of Leys Lane April 2011 on left (before resurfacing by DCC). Wall razed to ground by off-road vehicles. The farmer has had to put an unsightly wire fence inside the true boundary to keep his stock from straying.&#xa0;Right Monksdale road, Tideswell March 2011. These walls have now been repaired by the farmer.&#xa0;Verges host delightful (and sometimes rare) flora and provide migration routes for some animals, amphibians and reptiles. The NPA has designated a number of Road Verge Reserves. Although technically part of the right of way, verges are vulnerable to damage when vehicles need to pass each other and PDNPA are concerned about this damage to the environment.&#xa0;             &#xa0;Left Chertpit Lane July 2012. The verges of Chertpit Lane are home to the locally rare Melancholy Thistle.&#xa0;Right Slancote Lane, Tideswell, June 2012&#xa0;Sometimes verges are used deliberately by vehicle users to create additional excitement.&#xa0;&#xa0;      &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Macclesfield Old Road Feb 2013. There is a wide, surfaced track (on RHS in both pictures) but the ROW extends across to the flanking walls/fences. Unnecessary deviations have been made off the surfaced track to create more exciting bumps. This increases the scar on the landscape.

[[[Encroachment on Surrounding Land]]]&#xa0;Many routes pass through or are adjacent to sensitive areas eg Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Deviations from the track (eg to avoid boggy areas) cause damage. The Highway Authority may have to incur additional expenditure fencing-off areas to protect them.&#xa0;       &#xa0;Left  unfenced moorland at top of Chapel Gate August 2013. Main path is on left but the gulley on right has been used by vehicles in spite of being on a SSSI site.&#xa0;Right Ramsden Lane March 2013. Vehicles had left the track to play in adjacent woodland.&#xa0;Damage to Historical Features              Historical features may be damaged on routes themselves or through deviations .&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Pin Dale June 2011. The track up the dale runs at the bottom of the picture. The HA have installed a boulder barrier to stop deviations. In spite of this trail bikes still leave the track to play on the slopes above which are a scheduled ancient monument “the Pin Dale lead side veins are believed to be a nationally unique feature, demonstrating the response of miners to local geology” (English Heritage).&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;            &#xa0;Left Washgate Mar 2013. An attractive cobbled section on the descent to the river Dove breaking up due to vehicle use. The bridge at the bottom is early 18th century but the old packhorse way is much older. The original cobbles were in good condition in 1972 but have had to have been replaced at least once by PDNPA volunteers.&#xa0;Right Putwell Hill lead mine, Brushfield Jan 2013. Vehicle have left the track to play on the undulations marking the site, which is a scheduled monument dating from the 16th century.&#xa0;

[[[Conflict ]]]

[[[With]]]

[[[ Non-Vehicle Users]]]&#xa0;Potential Danger&#xa0;Many lanes are constrained by high banks or hedgerows - providing no escape routes or refuges to avoid vehicles. Horses, the less mobile and families with children are especially vulnerable.&#xa0;      &#xa0;Charity Lane, Cheshire Feb 2013                           Washgate March 2013&#xa0;Others have limited visibility and blind bends – horses are frightened of sound whose source they cannot identify and of the sudden appearance of vehicles around bends. A frightened horse may fall if the surface has also been rutted.&#xa0;       Picture on left Hurstclough Lane August 2013. Hazards include poor visibility, banks, degraded surface and a blind bend at the top.&#xa0;Right Blind bend on Jacob’s Ladder, Stoney Middleton March 2013. Again banks prevent horse riders from seeking refuge from vehicles.&#xa0;Inconvenience&#xa0;Some routes are so narrow that passing is extremely difficult.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;      &#xa0;Left Clough Lane, Birchover, Jan 2013. 4x4 filling the lane.&#xa0;Right Moorlands Lane, Bonsall Jan 2013. Very narrow section of lane bounded by a bank and a stone wall.&#xa0;Anti-social Behaviour

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Bad Driving Practices]]]&#xa0;A strong thread permeating much (but not all off-roading) is a sort of “macho” culture rooted in the challenge of difficult conditions and mastering nature. This can lead to a number of behaviours which may be different from those exhibited when driving on conventional roads. These include travelling in large groups, excessive speed for the conditions and aggressive revving of engines.&#xa0; &#xa0;Picture on left is of a group of a dozen 4x4s on Chapel Gate August 2013. Although this was part of a demonstration against PDNPA’s use of TROs to protect the Park, similar and larger groups have been observed previously on other green lanes.&#xa0;Right  Part of a group of 7 or 8 trail bikes on Abney RB5 April 2011. The bikes have used the RB across open moorland to connect two BOATs. The sound of their circuit could be heard over a large area.&#xa0;

[[[Verbal and Physical Assaults]]]&#xa0;In extreme cases this macho behaviour extends to verbal abuse of members of the public who query their behaviour or physical assault of anyone taking photographs. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Limer Rake Hollinsclough Feb 2013. A wall destroyed by 4x4s is being repaired. A member of the public who tried to photograph the incident had the memory card of his camera stolen by the perpetrators. The wall was damaged by a vehicle slewing out of control whilst being winched by a fellow enthusiast because it had become stuck. Sometimes “self-winching” is used by passing the cable around an adjacent tree or telegraph pole.Loss of Amenity&#xa0;Some green lanes are nationally important amenities (eg The Roych forms part of the Pennine Bridleway, the first and only&#xa0;National Trail for horse riders and mountain-bikers). Others provide local amenities for dog-walkers or families with toddlers or young pony riders. Many horse riders need access to unsealed routes near their stabling – unlike vehicle users they may not be able to go elsewhere. Increasingly, non-vehicle users are being driven off these lanes or their use of them spoilt by anxiety, noise or unwelcome evidence of vehicle passage striking a discordant and incongruous note in otherwise peaceful countryside.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;             &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Left The Roych  June 2011. A 4x4 descends the proper track. A former off-piste track is now partially blocked by the post with the blue sign but the unattractive braiding of the surface remains. Trail bikes continue to use both tracks.&#xa0;Right The Roych June 2011. The bottom of the stretch shown above. The true track is on the left, off-piste in the middle and off-off-piste at the right. Note  also the damaged fence. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;        &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Picture on left Mill Lane, Eyam March 2011 showing deep waterlogged ruts. Before this damage, the lane had made part of a convenient short loop used by mothers with pushchairs.&#xa0;Right Different section of Mill Lane May 2013 after sympathetic repairs by DCC. However, local residents are still avoiding use of the lane because blind bends and the faster speeds, made possible by the better surface, still make the lane dangerous.&#xa0;This discouragement of other users is to be deplored. It risks undermining government attempts to get people to take more exercise and if it becomes more widespread could threaten a local economy very dependent on tourism.&#xa0;&#xa0;View from Long Causeway February 2011. This fine stretch of open country cannot be truly appreciated by ordinary users now because of the likely discordant presence of vehicles and the sound of revving engines. The revetment to the left of the track in the middle of the picture is old but of uncertain date. Its strengthening  to support vehicles is a major contributor to the £235k budgeted by DCC for repairs to Long Causeway in 2013/14.

[[[Problems]]]

[[[ With Off-]]]

[[[Roading]]]

[[[ in Selected National Parks &amp; Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.]]]&#xa0;Our knowledge is mainly about the Peak District. Nevertheless, we are aware of problems in other areas which are described below. This is not attempting to be a comprehensive report on the rest of the country but key messages coming from environmental groups in a selection of obvious areas.&#xa0;Our feeling is that the problem particularly affects the main upland areas of the country, with the possible exception of Dartmoor (for reasons which are unclear but possibly because it is remote from large urban areas). In the words of DEFRA “Partly because of their often challenging terrain, some National Parks have seemed to attract considerable numbers of recreational vehicle users. The Government considers that in many cases a level of recreational vehicular use that may be acceptable in other areas will be inappropriate within National Parks and incompatible with their purposes.”&#xa0;The area where there has been the most success in dealing with the problem is the Yorkshire Dales. However we believe the increasing militancy of off-roading groups would not see that success repeated there now.&#xa0;

[[[Peak District]]]&#xa0;The area has an acute problem aggravated by its central location within the UK and ready accessibility to a huge urban catchment area. It provides a magnet for off-roaders not only from other areas in the country but also from Europe. It suffers too from the operations of both local and outside commercial companies offering off-roading guided tours.&#xa0;The NPA started taking matter seriously about two years ago. Thirty six Priority Routes were identified but TROs are only being pursued in piecemeal fashion. Work is on-going on a mere five and progress on these is pitifully slow. Vehicle user groups seem determined to fight tooth and nail probably because of the success of Yorkshire Dales NPA. The consultation process is being abused by orchestrating mass objections on trivial grounds, which nevertheless have to be answered individually. Only one TRO has finally been approved by members after two years.&#xa0;The situation is complicated by the existence of seven highway authorities none of which seem interested in actively helping the NPA, in spite of their statutory duty to do this. Derbyshire County Council has been the most active but seems to be concentrating on repairs rather than using TROs. They seem immune to arguments that the expenditure will be wasted in the absence of regulation. Other HAs seem to be doing nothing – we believe that Staffordshire is not even processing DMMO claims.&#xa0;

[[[Lake District]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;This was the first National Park to recognise the problem. At the instigation of one of the off-roading organisations (the Land Access and Recreation Association), it adopted an approach to managing off-roading through establishing a hierarchy of routes - classifying them according to the seriousness of the problem. The methodology was flawed because it concentrated only on surface conditions and ignored environmental and conflict issues. However off-roading organisations continue to extol the virtues of this approach – possibly because its limitation to surface conditions encourages HAs and NPAs to put the emphasis on repairs.&#xa0;The NPA has mainly tried to use various partial measures short of full TROs. These have proved unsatisfactory because of the administrative burden and circumventions by vehicle users eg circulation of keys for combination locks.&#xa0;There is a continuing problem in some areas particularly through the activities of commercial companies offering “off-roading experiences”.&#xa0;

[[[Yorkshire]]]

[[[ Dales]]]&#xa0;The NPA was sceptical about the Lake District’s approach and carried out its own lane by lane survey incorporating the missing environmental and conflict factors. Similar methodologies are now being used by the NPAs in the Peak District and North York Moors&#xa0;It had the advantages that it was responsible for the DMS and only has to liaise with two HAs –thus reducing the co-ordination problem so evident in the Peak District.&#xa0;The NPA grasped the nettle and imposed 13 TROs in 2008. Four of these were quashed in the High Court but one was successfully implemented subsequently. The other three routes were found not to have through public motor vehicle rights.&#xa0;The NPA was also fortunate in that the levels of public response in the TRO consultation processes were an order of magnitude less than those experienced in the Peak District. Off-roading groups at that time were not misusing the TRO regulations to overload the process and thus discourage HAs and NPAs from using them. We would expect attempts to impose further TROs would generate the same abuse of the consultative process seen in the Peak District.&#xa0;The NPA feels that the worst of the problem has been addressed. In 2012/3 it reports encouraging compliance with TROs, a low level of complaints, limited reports of illegal off-roading and a slight decrease in legal off-roading. It seems to us that this is probably because of displacement activity to other areas – particularly the Peak District. This is why, in our opinion, it is important to have action on a national scale.&#xa0;In addition, although there are far fewer UCRs than in the Peak District, plenty of vulnerable green lanes remain in the Yorkshire Dales. However the NPA is short of money and staff resources and is having to hand back delegated ROW powers to North Yorkshire County Council, who are likely be far less effective in tackling off-roading. We understand there are further problems in the Nidderdale AONB.&#xa0;

[[[North York]]]

[[[ Moors]]]&#xa0;Off-roading is a significant problem and the damage is very bad in some areas.&#xa0;The area has 173 UCRs totalling 253km but only 4 BOATs totalling 12 km. 201 routes have been assessed under the NPA’s methodology of which 165 (280km) have been classified as highly vulnerable. The highly vulnerable routes have been prioritised according to vulnerability on the most number of criteria. Seven of these fell into the top category.&#xa0;In 2012 one of the HAs (North Yorkshire County Council) consulted on a policy to rank UCRs according to their ability to support vehicle use and to implement TROs on those which were unsustainable. The NPA welcomed this approach but NYCC  decided not to proceed with the policy.&#xa0;Subsequently, as in the Peak District, the NPA is finding it has to bear the burden of combating off-roading on its own. Currently there are 7 TROs covering 6 UCRs and 1 BOAT totalling 25km which NYCC implemented some years ago.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[South Downs]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;The South Downs Society say that off-roading is not in their top 10 problems which is surprising since a study by the Council for National Parks found it of serious concern in 2005. The NPA has been in existence for only 2 years and is reported to be adopting a hands-off approach and relying on local councils for action. However, in its state of the park report for 2012, the NPA says that “conflicts of interest occur in some places, for example, where 4x4 vehicles have caused significant damage to some BOATs making them inaccessible to other users.”&#xa0;

[[[Exmoor]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;The Council for National Parks recorded marked problems in 2005 but we have been unable to contact the Exmoor Society to ascertain the current position. &#xa0;

[[[Norfolk]]]

[[[ Coast AONB]]]&#xa0;Off-roading is reported to be a problem on cliff-top paths.&#xa0;

[[[Wales]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;We have largely ignored Wales because of devolution but are aware of significant problems in the Brecon Beacons. Periodically, there are also well publicised incidents in Snowdonia, with 4x4s being driven up and abandoned on Snowdon itself.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Appendix ]]]

[[[4  Details]]]

[[[ of Proposed New Legislation to Prevent Use of Unsealed Lanes and BOATs by Motor Vehicles]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Objectives of the Peak District Green Lanes ]]]

[[[Alliance]]]&#xa0;1.1 Unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UUCRs) not on the definitive map and statement to be added as Restricted Byways to the definitive map and statement on the date of commencement. The only exceptions are identified in 5 and 8 below.&#xa0;1.2 Unsealed Byways Open to all Traffic (BOATs) to be regraded as Restricted Byways on the definitive map and statement on the date of commencement. The only exceptions are identified in 5 below.&#xa0;2. This legislation would apply to England and, where appropriate, Wales.&#xa0;3. Landowners and occupiers who access their property by a way which is added or regraded as a restricted byway by these measures to have the right to use the restricted byway to access their property in a mechanically propelled vehicle and to give legal authority to their visitors to do the same.&#xa0;4. The emergency services, including the Coastguard and recognised mountain rescue teams, would be able to use restricted byways created by this measure in mechanically propelled vehicles.&#xa0;5. Where a right of way for mechanically propelled vehicles was created by an enactment or instrument or otherwise which specifically provided for it to be a right of way for mechanically propelled vehicles or it was constructed in exercise of powers conferred by virtue of any enactment with the intention from the outset that it should be a right of way for mechanically propelled vehicles the way will continue to be a public right of way for mechanically propelled vehicles. [As now]&#xa0;6. With respect to unsealed ways (and only unsealed ways) the exceptions in NERCA 2006 subsection 67 (2) (a), (b) and (e) would no longer apply.&#xa0;7. Only applicable if 1.2 above is not accepted. Where an application to add a UUCR to the definitive map has not been confirmed as footpath, bridleway or byway open to all traffic by the commencement date, the UUCR is to be added as a Restricted Byway to the definitive map and statement on the date of commencement.&#xa0;8. A Surveying Authority (SA) would be able as a matter of judgement to designate within a period of 1 year, in a way similar to clause 13 of the Draft Deregulation Bill:              8.1 UUCRs which are part of the ordinary road network              8.2 UUCRs which are patently bridleways or footpaths.The process thereafter would follow clause 13. &#xa0;

[[[Definitions]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]County road means a way shown on the relevant (whether county or unitary) Highway Authority’s list of streets (the list of highways maintainable at the public expense described in subsections 36(6) and 36(7) Highways Act 1980.&#xa0;Unclassified means not classified by the relevant highway Authority as an A, B or C road.&#xa0;An “unsealed way” is defined by reference to s22BB(1)(b)(ii) Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 as a way whose ‘surface, or most of whose surface, does not consist of concrete, tarmacadam, coated roadstone or other prescribed material’.   The term “way” is used to include Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) and Unclassified County Roads.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Eventuality of the Legislation ]]]

[[[Above]]]

[[[ only Applying in some Areas]]]&#xa0;If it is considered that such blanket coverage should only be applied to a subset of unsealed ways, we regard it as imperative that the PDGLA proposals should apply at least to those in National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.&#xa0;Should Parliament reject either proposal (as to UUCRs or unsealed BOATs) then the improvement to the TRO system proposed by GLEAM becomes essential. In essence, that proposal is to amend the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to provide for an appeal system against inaction or unreasonable refusal by highway authorities or national park authorities to impose Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) prohibiting mechanically propelled vehicles from using a particular way. Such appeals would be heard by magistrates. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ in the Peak District]]]&#xa0;

[[[Number of Routes Affected]]]&#xa0;We have inspected 153 routes which looked from the map as if they could be of interest to off-roading groups. Eight of these turned out to be sealed leaving 145 unsealed (of which 36 are BOATs and 109 UCRs).&#xa0;PDNPA have been seriously addressing the problems caused by off-roading for about 2 years. They have assigned 36 routes to a Priority List (16 BOATs and 20 UCRs). Five of these have been initially ranked as probable candidates for TROs and are at various stages in the consultation process. Only 1 has completed the process, and Members have agreed to go ahead with implementation. &#xa0;Because the other 4 TROs are at different stages of completion, it is difficult to assign a completion rate to PDNPA but it appears to us that one per year is a realistic expectation. Even if only half the Priority Routes were eventually selected for TROs (which seems to us a most conservative estimate), this would imply another 16 years to deal with the current situation.&#xa0;However the situation will not remain static – we find routes which we had previously believed free from off-roading suddenly to show signs of this. Where these routes are unsurfaced, deterioration occurs very quickly. We expect most of the Priority Routes will eventually need TROs to protect them.&#xa0;Of the routes we have inspected, we ranked 42 as being vulnerable if vehicle use increased. Seventeen of these were already on the Priority List leaving 25 which we would expect to see added to the list in the future.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Indicative Costs]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Surveying Authority&#xa0;DCC has recruited 2 temporary and 1 permanent additional members of staff to its Definitive Map team to meet its commitment to add UCRs to the Definitive Map.&#xa0;Determination of UCR status is controversial – local communities challenge BOAT determinations and off-roading groups challenge FP/BW determinations.  It seems unlikely these extra resources will clear the backlog of UCRs waiting to be added, whether by application or duty to review.&#xa0; 17 routes were added&#xa0;in just&#xa0;under 6 years, between&#xa0;Nov 2007 and Aug 2013,&#xa0;21 are determined but not yet confirmed, and 80 applications have yet to be determined.&#xa0;Figures for other SAs in the Peak District are not available but we believe Staffordshire County Council does not feel it has the resources to discharge its duties in this area and is not processing DMMO claims.&#xa0;DEFRA has made some estimates of the cost of adding routes to the DMS under the current procedures for contested claims. This indicates a maximum of £12k for cases settled by written representation and £15k for those which go to public inquiry. These figures include both local and central government costs (PINS). We find it difficult to believe these estimates comprise fully allocated costs and from our experience they look low even if they are restricted only to direct labour costs. A typical public inquiry takes 3 days and there is significant preparation work by SA staff beforehand. DCC has typically had 3 legal people present at the inquiry and an archivist to look after the historical documents. The planning inspector needs preparation time too and also needs to write up conclusions. There are administrative staff supporting inspectors. The inspector is probably travelling and staying overnight since it is policy to use inspectors from outside the area. There would also be hire costs for the venue. No account is taken of the time of claimants and objectors and of their witnesses.&#xa0;&#xa0;Highway Authority&#xa0;In 2012/13 DCC budgeted £143.5k for their Green Lanes Action Plan (of which (£3.5k came from Natural England). This covered just 6 routes of which 5 are on the PDNPA Priority List. Of these Long Causeway took £20k.&#xa0;In 2013/14 £375k was budgeted - £140k to unspecified green lanes and £235k to Long Causeway.&#xa0;It seems to us that DCC are adopting repair rather than the imposition of TROs to address the problems affecting PDNPA’s Priority Routes. On current progress, this repair programme has many years to run. The scale of the work sometimes necessary can be seen in the amount budgeted already for Long Causeway - £255k. Similarly, it should be noted that DCC’s planned expenditure in 2012/13 included a further £24k on the Roych. Prior to the opening of the Pennine Bridleway, something in excess of £500k was spent in repairing the Roych section of the route.&#xa0;Peak District National Park Authority&#xa0;PDNPA has 2 full time and 1 part time staff working on surveying/monitoring routes and progressing their TRO Initiatives. Our feeling is that this equates to 2 full time equivalents. &#xa0;An unknown amount of Ranger time is devoted to the initial assessment of potential Priority Routes. There is no regular systematic survey of all routes in the National Park. In our opinion this would be essential if the rapidly changing situation on the ground were to be monitored effectively.&#xa0;PDNPA have had to fight a High Court case arising from their attempt to put an Experimental TRO on Chapel Gate. We have no figures on this but are aware they consulted external lawyers as well as their own staff and would have employed barristers to present their case in the Court.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Picture not published here.
