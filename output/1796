[normal]Introduction
[normal] –
[normal] Andrew McCloy
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]From 2009-13 I was the Business Development Manager for Bakewell &amp; Eyam Community Transport 
[normal](BECT) in Derbyshire, a post funded through the Rur
[normal]al Social Enterprise Programme
[normal]. The aim of this DfT-
[normal]support
[normal]ed project was to help 
[normal]rural C
[normal]ommunity 
[normal]T
[normal]ransport operators adopt a more enterprise-led approach, win more contracts and generate more income. Sinc
[normal]e leaving BECT I have undertaken some consultancy work for the Community Transport Association
[normal]. I am a parish councillor 
[normal]and an elected Parish 
[normal]M
[normal]ember on the Peak District National Park Authority. I also write walking guidebooks and run a website promoting 
[normal]cycling in the Peak District. The following submission is from mysel
[normal]f as an individual and not on behalf of any organisation.

[normal]Bus transport in rural areas
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]To what [bold]extent are the needs of different groups of passengers taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]From my experience of rural Derbyshire and in particular the villages of the Peak District (not the valley 
[normal]arteries
[normal] connecting the towns), publicly subsidised service buses are routinely running round 
[normal]empty
[normal] 
[normal]or near empty 
[normal]in the middle of the day. 
[normal]This is even the case at weekends, when visitors and recreational users should be using them. It is a ludicrous situ
[normal]ation that points to a funda
[normal]mental lack of understanding of their customers’ needs 
[normal]in terms of 
[normal]where 
[normal]they 
[normal]actually want to go and when
[normal]. It also suggests
[normal] a lack of political will to explore new and imaginative solutions for rural public transport delivery.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The problem is being compounded by the local authority (as elsewhere) cutting back services, in particular those deemed fringe or unprofitable 
[normal]that hit the vulnerable users even harder. In my own village the late evening bus back from Bakewell has been a
[normal]xed so that the teenagers now have to rely on lifts or taxis and have stopped using the bus for even the 
[normal]earlier 
[normal]outward journey. We are in danger of developing a rural generation for whom bus transport is an altogether alien concept!
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Quite apart from pro
[normal]vision, the marketing and promotion of rural bus services is often poor or lacklustre, especially towards a younger age group. There is little or no regard for the customer profile and what publicity there is tends to be formulaic and unimaginative.
[normal] 
[normal]The po
[normal]rtrayal of b
[normal]us transport in rural areas is 
[normal]staid and comes across as 
[normal]the preserve of the elderly or poor, which is wholly wrong.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be ma[bold]de more affordable?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There has to be 
[normal]an 
[normal]acceptance that delivering bus transport for remote rural communities is not and never will 
[normal]be 
[normal]as cost effective as it is in urban areas, or even clusters of market towns; but that inhabitants of rural communities sh
[normal]ould not be penalised for this. Indeed, it is arguable that people from deep rural areas are more in need of effective and efficient transport solutions, as transport poverty can lead to real 
[normal]and not just relative 
[normal]social isolation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]More imaginative approa
[normal]ches to rural bus transport have to be trialled that seek to integrate services and so reduce unit costs
[normal] (see below)
[normal]; encourage local providers like 
[normal]C
[normal]ommunity 
[normal]T
[normal]ransport operators to play a more proactive role; and explore new ways of working like demand 
[normal]responsive minibuses instead of old and inflexible 50-seater coaches (see below).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In my own area (the Derbyshire Peak District) any subsidised bus service deemed visitor-orient
[normal]ed is being cut – but this is an entirely 
[normal]backward-looking 
[normal]step
[normal]! In a popular N
[normal]ational Park visitors should be using buses to get around and reach the remote villages and walks that they are seeking
[normal], just
[normal] as long as they 
[normal]can
[normal] get to 
[normal]the location, 
[normal]the timetable
[normal] meets their needs and the service is reliable
[normal]. And if they were doing this 
[normal]in sufficient number
[normal]s
[normal] the
[normal] routes
[normal] wouldn’t need so much subsidy and the services could 
[normal]in turn 
[normal]be more affordable to local people. Local tourism businesses and attractions 
[normal]might then
[normal] sponsor or advertise on the buses more and thus 
[normal]help drive down costs furt
[normal]her.
[normal] 
[normal]Rural buses must be marketed to all users so that all users benefit.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One of the obvious first steps is to understand the rural communities 
[normal]themselves –
[normal] where people
[normal] want to go, when, how, etc? Parish Councils and community groups can help with accessibility audits to plot work/shopping/health/leisure transport movements of local residents, so that gaps and opportunities can be identified, pilot service ideas can be w
[normal]orked up and even more creative solutions such as local travel clubs explored.
[normal] In this way transport should be made a key plank of emerging Neighbourhood Plans
[normal] so that local communities take more ownership of transport matters and themselves identify possi
[normal]ble solutions
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Transport operators, social enterprises, local authorities – whoever! – should work hand in hand with these local representatives to explore new delivery models that connect village to village, village to town, etc, and seek to integrate as
[normal] many types of journey as possible
[normal]. For example, a 
[normal]shopping
[normal] 
[normal]service from a cluster of villages to a town that is also timed to coincide with the 
[normal]health centre’s
[normal] opening hours; 
[normal]an early morning work/training 
[normal]bus
[normal] that goes on to 
[normal]do 
[normal]a
[normal] school
[normal] run
[normal]; an 
[normal]evening 
[normal]s
[normal]ervice 
[normal]from villages 
[normal]to an adult education centre 
[normal]in a nearby town 
[normal]that also visits the local cinema/skate park, etc
[normal]. The aim is to reduce unit costs, create a single market and optimise the operator’s resources. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]hink bold, think imaginatively! Instead 
[normal]of rigid timetabled services that don’t necessarily correspond with people’s desired journey times and patterns, perhaps a demand responsive approach 
[normal]might
[normal] work best
[normal] in some rural locations
[normal]? Moorlands Connect 
[normal]bus 
[normal]service (run by Ashbourne Community Transpo
[normal]rt) is one such example, combining shopping services and even school runs for remote villages on the Staffordshire Moorlands with 
[normal]income
[normal] from visiting walkers and cyclists
[normal], since 
[normal]the
[normal] buses have bike racks attached
[normal] (
[normal]www.staffordshire.gov.uk/transport/public
[normal]transport/buses/connect/
[normal] 
[normal]MoorlandsConnect.aspx
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]d
[normal]emand responsive transport (DRT) 
[normal]concept 
[normal]can take some understand
[normal]ing
[normal], but essentially only sending a vehicle where it’s needed and when makes perfect sense
[normal] in the rural context where passenger patterns can alter
[normal] (and if 
[normal]the bus i
[normal]s idle for too long there’s something wrong with its coverage, promotion or pricing). 
[normal]However,
[normal] DRT can also operate very well on a semi-flexible 
[normal]or semi-timetabled 
[normal]basis, so that the
[normal] drive
[normal]r can deviate from a set route to collect passengers
[normal]. I
[normal]t’s ideal for a rural bus route that connects a string of villages and hamlets 
[normal](
[normal]with 
[normal]fluctuating passenger numbers) to 
[normal]a town.
[normal] Although DRT can be expensive to set up, if it’s designed so that it
[normal] incorporates other services (eg 
[normal]a 
[normal]daily run to a rural primary 
[normal]school, a regular adult social care run, a weekly luncheon club run for elderly villagers, etc) and also marketed to other users like visitors, then it can be cost effective and viable for rur
[normal]al situations. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There needs to be more joined-up thinking from transport authorities and operators, so that, for instance, bus routes from remoter rural locations 
[normal]clearly 
[normal]act as feeders to main bus routes
[normal] and the 
[normal]wider rural 
[normal]bus
[normal] network is presented more 
[normal]logically and 
[normal]coherently. As an example, see the Interconnect and Call Connect rur
[normal]al bus networks in Lincolnshire that all feed into each other and are presented as such
[normal] (www.lincsinterconnect.com).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How effectively do Community Transport services address[bold] the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Community 
[normal]T
[normal]ransport 
[normal]operators (CTOs) 
[normal]ha
[normal]ve
[normal] the potential to 
[normal]deliver effective local solutions for rural people, not least because of their social commitment, 
[normal]energ
[normal]y and enthusiasm, 
[normal]local knowledge, 
[normal]as well as 
[normal]capacity and expertise
[normal] in
[normal] deal
[normal]ing
[normal] with elderly a
[normal]nd disabled passengers
[normal]. 
[normal]In fact, there are numerous examples where CTOs are already a lifeline for people with access issues from remote or hard-to-reach rural co
[normal]mmunities. Furthermore
[normal], many 
[normal]CTOs
[normal] 
[normal]are already and successfully 
[normal]running contracted services for local authorities, NHS trusts, and so on. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, t
[normal]oo many service commissioners still appear to regard CTOs as amateurish and voluntary, fringe transport 
[normal]for
[normal] older people 
[normal]on the 
[normal]cheap
[normal]. 
[normal]Many l
[normal]ocal authorities in particular need to start embracing Community Transport as part of the solution for delivering rural public transport in deep rural areas and work with them
[normal] on a more level playing field, rather than tur
[normal]ning to the commercial operators first every time. Procurement processes still tend to be geared up towards the big operators and it can be a frustrating and difficult nut for CTOs to crack.
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t’s
[normal] 
[normal]hope
[normal]d
[normal] that the Public Services (Social Value) Act may gradua
[normal]lly begin to change procurement attitudes – but 
[normal]there
[normal] doesn’t seem to be 
[normal]much evidence of this
[normal] yet.
[normal] 
[normal]Perceptions of
[normal] Community Transport must change if CTOs are to play a more fulfilling role.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With some notable exceptions, CTOs themselves are mostly small social enterprises and organisations that are at various stages of 
[normal]relatively
[normal] early 
[normal]growth. Some will probably choose to stay small and local, but those others that seek to grow need more assis
[normal]tance in terms of business advice and development, 
[normal]so that they can 
[normal]build 
[normal]capacity and 
[normal]resilience, 
[normal]improve their 
[normal]financial know-how and so on. (This is evidenced with the recent sad demise of Little Red Bus and Nene &amp; Ouse Community Transport.)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Without lo
[normal]sing sight of their social goals, these CTOs also need to be encouraged to think more enterprisingly and so overcome 
[normal]internal 
[normal]cultural barriers as well as physical 
[normal]challenges
[normal] like cash flow, 
[normal]regulations, contract law, accreditation, 
[normal]etc. 
[normal]There’s a need for
[normal] training for board members/trustees and not just key staff in terms of strategic development and risk taking, for example. Although most CTOs may be young and relatively small, those that I have come across certainly have the drive and commitment to deliv
[normal]er effective transport solutions for rural communities – they just need the right 
[normal]social enterprise 
[normal]tools and opportunities.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.16
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In most instances CTOs will simply be part of the rural transport mix and transport authorities and service commissioners must 
[normal]understand this a little better, recognising both the strengths and limitations
[normal] of Community Transport
[normal]. While the big commercial 
[normal]operators will
[normal] no doubt carry on
[normal] cover
[normal]ing
[normal] the main through routes, busy school runs, etc, CTOs are ideally placed to supply the
[normal] feeder services, link the remoter and hard to reach villages, not least because of the composition of their fleets (accessible small minibuses) and expert knowledge 
[normal]in terms o
[normal]f both local geography and running demand responsive services. Th
[normal]ere are
[normal] already
[normal] work
[normal]able examples
[normal] in some locations, but elsewhere 
[normal]national operators are still paid to trundle 
[normal]empty service buses 
[normal]around villages
[normal] 
[normal]based on
[normal] inflexible timetables.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.17
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite 
[normal]the shortcomings and barriers
[normal], where Community Transport is well run 
[normal]– 
[normal]and in particular works with a progressive local authority 
[normal]to address 
[normal]particular 
[normal]issue
[normal]s – 
[normal]it is quite clear that it can deliver lasting results for rural communities. For instance, see bus routes operated by Third Sector Services and CCVS Trading
[normal] 
[normal]in the Co
[normal]tswolds, or the Suffolk Links DRT routes run by 
[normal]Coastal Accessible Transport Services
