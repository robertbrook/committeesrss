default&#xa0;
defaultFrom 2009-13 I was the Business Development Manager for Bakewell &amp; Eyam Community Transport 
default(BECT) in Derbyshire, a post funded through the Rur
defaultal Social Enterprise Programme
default. The aim of this DfT-
defaultsupport
defaulted project was to help 
defaultrural C
defaultommunity 
defaultT
defaultransport operators adopt a more enterprise-led approach, win more contracts and generate more income. Sinc
defaulte leaving BECT I have undertaken some consultancy work for the Community Transport Association
default. I am a parish councillor 
defaultand an elected Parish 
defaultM
defaultember on the Peak District National Park Authority. I also write walking guidebooks and run a website promoting 
defaultcycling in the Peak District. The following submission is from mysel
defaultf as an individual and not on behalf of any organisation.

defaultBus transport in rural areas
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultTo what defaultextent are the needs of different groups of passengers taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?default&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFrom my experience of rural Derbyshire and in particular the villages of the Peak District (not the valley 
defaultarteries
default connecting the towns), publicly subsidised service buses are routinely running round 
defaultempty
default 
defaultor near empty 
defaultin the middle of the day. 
defaultThis is even the case at weekends, when visitors and recreational users should be using them. It is a ludicrous situ
defaultation that points to a funda
defaultmental lack of understanding of their customers’ needs 
defaultin terms of 
defaultwhere 
defaultthey 
defaultactually want to go and when
default. It also suggests
default a lack of political will to explore new and imaginative solutions for rural public transport delivery.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe problem is being compounded by the local authority (as elsewhere) cutting back services, in particular those deemed fringe or unprofitable 
defaultthat hit the vulnerable users even harder. In my own village the late evening bus back from Bakewell has been a
defaultxed so that the teenagers now have to rely on lifts or taxis and have stopped using the bus for even the 
defaultearlier 
defaultoutward journey. We are in danger of developing a rural generation for whom bus transport is an altogether alien concept!
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultQuite apart from pro
defaultvision, the marketing and promotion of rural bus services is often poor or lacklustre, especially towards a younger age group. There is little or no regard for the customer profile and what publicity there is tends to be formulaic and unimaginative.
default 
defaultThe po
defaultrtrayal of b
defaultus transport in rural areas is 
defaultstaid and comes across as 
defaultthe preserve of the elderly or poor, which is wholly wrong.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be madefaultde more affordable?default&#xa0;
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere has to be 
defaultan 
defaultacceptance that delivering bus transport for remote rural communities is not and never will 
defaultbe 
defaultas cost effective as it is in urban areas, or even clusters of market towns; but that inhabitants of rural communities sh
defaultould not be penalised for this. Indeed, it is arguable that people from deep rural areas are more in need of effective and efficient transport solutions, as transport poverty can lead to real 
defaultand not just relative 
defaultsocial isolation.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMore imaginative approa
defaultches to rural bus transport have to be trialled that seek to integrate services and so reduce unit costs
default (see below)
default; encourage local providers like 
defaultC
defaultommunity 
defaultT
defaultransport operators to play a more proactive role; and explore new ways of working like demand 
defaultresponsive minibuses instead of old and inflexible 50-seater coaches (see below).
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn my own area (the Derbyshire Peak District) any subsidised bus service deemed visitor-orient
defaulted is being cut – but this is an entirely 
defaultbackward-looking 
defaultstep
default! In a popular N
defaultational Park visitors should be using buses to get around and reach the remote villages and walks that they are seeking
default, just
default as long as they 
defaultcan
default get to 
defaultthe location, 
defaultthe timetable
default meets their needs and the service is reliable
default. And if they were doing this 
defaultin sufficient number
defaults
default the
default routes
default wouldn’t need so much subsidy and the services could 
defaultin turn 
defaultbe more affordable to local people. Local tourism businesses and attractions 
defaultmight then
default sponsor or advertise on the buses more and thus 
defaulthelp drive down costs furt
defaulther.
default 
defaultRural buses must be marketed to all users so that all users benefit.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHow do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities?default&#xa0;
default3.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the obvious first steps is to understand the rural communities 
defaultthemselves –
default where people
default want to go, when, how, etc? Parish Councils and community groups can help with accessibility audits to plot work/shopping/health/leisure transport movements of local residents, so that gaps and opportunities can be identified, pilot service ideas can be w
defaultorked up and even more creative solutions such as local travel clubs explored.
default In this way transport should be made a key plank of emerging Neighbourhood Plans
default so that local communities take more ownership of transport matters and themselves identify possi
defaultble solutions
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTransport operators, social enterprises, local authorities – whoever! – should work hand in hand with these local representatives to explore new delivery models that connect village to village, village to town, etc, and seek to integrate as
default many types of journey as possible
default. For example, a 
defaultshopping
default 
defaultservice from a cluster of villages to a town that is also timed to coincide with the 
defaulthealth centre’s
default opening hours; 
defaultan early morning work/training 
defaultbus
default that goes on to 
defaultdo 
defaulta
default school
default run
default; an 
defaultevening 
defaults
defaultervice 
defaultfrom villages 
defaultto an adult education centre 
defaultin a nearby town 
defaultthat also visits the local cinema/skate park, etc
default. The aim is to reduce unit costs, create a single market and optimise the operator’s resources. 
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthink bold, think imaginatively! Instead 
defaultof rigid timetabled services that don’t necessarily correspond with people’s desired journey times and patterns, perhaps a demand responsive approach 
defaultmight
default work best
default in some rural locations
default? Moorlands Connect 
defaultbus 
defaultservice (run by Ashbourne Community Transpo
defaultrt) is one such example, combining shopping services and even school runs for remote villages on the Staffordshire Moorlands with 
defaultincome
default from visiting walkers and cyclists
default, since 
defaultthe
default buses have bike racks attached
default (
defaultwww.staffordshire.gov.uk/transport/public
defaulttransport/buses/connect/
default 
defaultMoorlandsConnect.aspx
default).
default&#xa0;
default3.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultd
defaultemand responsive transport (DRT) 
defaultconcept 
defaultcan take some understand
defaulting
default, but essentially only sending a vehicle where it’s needed and when makes perfect sense
default in the rural context where passenger patterns can alter
default (and if 
defaultthe bus i
defaults idle for too long there’s something wrong with its coverage, promotion or pricing). 
defaultHowever,
default DRT can also operate very well on a semi-flexible 
defaultor semi-timetabled 
defaultbasis, so that the
default drive
defaultr can deviate from a set route to collect passengers
default. I
defaultt’s ideal for a rural bus route that connects a string of villages and hamlets 
default(
defaultwith 
defaultfluctuating passenger numbers) to 
defaulta town.
default Although DRT can be expensive to set up, if it’s designed so that it
default incorporates other services (eg 
defaulta 
defaultdaily run to a rural primary 
defaultschool, a regular adult social care run, a weekly luncheon club run for elderly villagers, etc) and also marketed to other users like visitors, then it can be cost effective and viable for rur
defaultal situations. 
default&#xa0;
default3.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere needs to be more joined-up thinking from transport authorities and operators, so that, for instance, bus routes from remoter rural locations 
defaultclearly 
defaultact as feeders to main bus routes
default and the 
defaultwider rural 
defaultbus
default network is presented more 
defaultlogically and 
defaultcoherently. As an example, see the Interconnect and Call Connect rur
defaultal bus networks in Lincolnshire that all feed into each other and are presented as such
default (www.lincsinterconnect.com).

defaultHow effectively do Community Transport services addressdefault the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommunity

defaultransport 
defaultoperators (CTOs) 
defaultha
defaultve
default the potential to 
defaultdeliver effective local solutions for rural people, not least because of their social commitment, 
defaultenerg
defaulty and enthusiasm, 
defaultlocal knowledge, 
defaultas well as 
defaultcapacity and expertise
default in
default deal
defaulting
default with elderly a
defaultnd disabled passengers
default. 
defaultIn fact, there are numerous examples where CTOs are already a lifeline for people with access issues from remote or hard-to-reach rural co
defaultmmunities. Furthermore
default, many 
defaultCTOs
default 
defaultare already and successfully 
defaultrunning contracted services for local authorities, NHS trusts, and so on. 
default&#xa0;
default3.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, t
defaultoo many service commissioners still appear to regard CTOs as amateurish and voluntary, fringe transport 
defaultfor
default older people 
defaulton the 
defaultcheap
default. 
defaultMany l
defaultocal authorities in particular need to start embracing Community Transport as part of the solution for delivering rural public transport in deep rural areas and work with them
default on a more level playing field, rather than tur
defaultning to the commercial operators first every time. Procurement processes still tend to be geared up towards the big operators and it can be a frustrating and difficult nut for CTOs to crack.
default 
defaultI
defaultt’s
default 
defaulthope
defaultd
default that the Public Services (Social Value) Act may gradua
defaultlly begin to change procurement attitudes – but 
defaultthere
default doesn’t seem to be 
defaultmuch evidence of this
default yet.
default 
defaultPerceptions of
default Community Transport must change if CTOs are to play a more fulfilling role.
default&#xa0;
default3.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith some notable exceptions, CTOs themselves are mostly small social enterprises and organisations that are at various stages of 
defaultrelatively
default early 
defaultgrowth. Some will probably choose to stay small and local, but those others that seek to grow need more assis
defaulttance in terms of business advice and development, 
defaultso that they can 
defaultbuild 
defaultcapacity and 
defaultresilience, 
defaultimprove their 
defaultfinancial know-how and so on. (This is evidenced with the recent sad demise of Little Red Bus and Nene &amp; Ouse Community Transport.)
default&#xa0;
default3.15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWithout lo
defaultsing sight of their social goals, these CTOs also need to be encouraged to think more enterprisingly and so overcome 
defaultinternal 
defaultcultural barriers as well as physical 
defaultchallenges
default like cash flow, 
defaultregulations, contract law, accreditation, 
defaultetc. 
defaultThere’s a need for
default training for board members/trustees and not just key staff in terms of strategic development and risk taking, for example. Although most CTOs may be young and relatively small, those that I have come across certainly have the drive and commitment to deliv
defaulter effective transport solutions for rural communities – they just need the right 
defaultsocial enterprise 
defaulttools and opportunities.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn most instances CTOs will simply be part of the rural transport mix and transport authorities and service commissioners must 
defaultunderstand this a little better, recognising both the strengths and limitations
default of Community Transport
default. While the big commercial 
defaultoperators will
default no doubt carry on
default cover
defaulting
default the main through routes, busy school runs, etc, CTOs are ideally placed to supply the
default feeder services, link the remoter and hard to reach villages, not least because of the composition of their fleets (accessible small minibuses) and expert knowledge 
defaultin terms o
defaultf both local geography and running demand responsive services. Th
defaultere are
default already
default work
defaultable examples
default in some locations, but elsewhere 
defaultnational operators are still paid to trundle 
defaultempty service buses 
defaultaround villages
default 
defaultbased on
default inflexible timetables.

defaultand in particular works with a progressive local authority

defaultissue
