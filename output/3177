defaultWitness
defaulte
defaults: 
defaultDavid Prior, Chair, and David Behan, Chief defaultEdefaultxecutivedefault,
default 
defaultCare Quality Commission
default,
default gave evidence.  
defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYou are welcome. On 
defaultthese
default occasions I normally ask witnesses to introduce themselves. You might feel you have been here sufficiently often for that to be unnecessary. You come on an occasion where we are at least in calmer water
default. W
defaulte would like to examine not just the specifics of the cases that we have discussed on previous occasions but where the CQC is on the path of improvement that was acknowledged to be necessary following both of you taking up your roles over the last 12 months. 
defaultI would like to open by asking you this. It is an acknowledged fact
default—
defaultand you have both acknowledged it in public many times
default—
defaultthat the CQC, until recently, has not been delivering the service that the public looked to it to deliver. You have both committed the organisation to a process of renewal and raising 
defaultof 
defaultstandards. The core question I am interested in is
default,
default what do you think we should be looking for to assess how successful you are being in delivering that objective? 
defaultW
defaulthat does good look like and how do we recognise it when we see it?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultIt is very much work in progress
default at the moment.
default As to the new hospital inspections we have started, we will have done 18 by Christmas and we will have published a shadow rating for three of them. An assessment of those 18 inspections will be very important. The question is, 
defaulth
defaultave we got underneath the skin of these hospitals? Can we actually do an inspection 
defaultthat
default can determine whether or not that hospital is safe, well led, 
defaultof 
defaulthigh quality and providing compassionate care?
default 
defaultI guess the jury is still out on that. 
defaultI should say that
default,
default as to the ones we have done so far
default,
default we have had between 25 and 30 people on the inspection team, a large preponderance of clinicians and experts by experience as well as inspectors
default, and 
defaultMike Richards
default’
default view is that we are getting underneath the skin of those 
defaulthospitals, finding out what is happening and getting a real understanding of what is going on in them. If we can do that and hold it up as an accurate mirror to the public, commissioners and to other hospitals, that will be one marker in the ground in the hospital sector of what is good. It will not pick up everything. We are not going to pick up everything in a hospital. 
defaultTo give you an idea of the size of it, 
defaultBarts
default has revenues of £1 billion, employs 15,000 people and is on five different big hospital sites. We are not going to pick up everything in every ward, department and specialty, but we do feel that we will pick up systemic problems in those hospitals. So
default,
default 
defaulti
defaultn the hospital sector
default,
default the honest answer to the question is that it is too early to say, but 
defaultthat
default is critical to me
default. A
defaultre we getting under the skin of those hospitals?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultMr Behan
default, do you
default wish to 
defaultenlarge
default on that?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultNo, but I think it is an important question, Chair, and, just to build on what David 
defaulthas 
defaultsaid, public, political and professional confi
defaultdence has been shaky in the CQC, s
defaulto one of my measures will be a restoration of public, political and professional confidence. 
defaultThe way w
defaulte will do that 
defaultis 
defaultby doing what we have been set up to do
default. Y
defaultou personally have challenged us about clarity of purpose on numerous occasions and we have tried to settle that issue
default about our purpose and clarity of purpose. N
defaultow 
defaultwhat we are doing is
default building an organisation 
defaultthat
default will deliver that purpose. We have
default reorganised at a senior level. 
defaultAndrea is 
defaulthere 
defaultbehind
default me;
default Mike Richards is off to a flying start, if I may say
default so.
default 
defaultWe are
default six inspections into the 18 b
defaulty Christmas. I did the Barking, 
defaultHavering 
defaultand Redbridge 
defaultinspection
default for a couple of days last week and
default will join the 
defaultBournemouth
default inspection on Friday this week
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte a
defaultre using that wave 1 group to think our 
defaultway into and challenge ourselves in the way that we are taking that forward
default,
default learning from every one and tweaking the way we approach the learning we extract from each of those inspections. I am confident that
default,
default by the time we get to the end of these 18 and into the second wave beginning in January
default,
default we will have extracted the learning and will be building on that.
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWhen will these reports start to 
defaultreach
default the public domain?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultWe are doing 16 inspections
default;
default 
defaultwe
default will release them in batches of four. The first will come out in November, then December, January and February, which 
defaultmeans they 
defaultwill be coming out approximately eight weeks after we have completed the inspection. That will be the schedule coming through. T
defaulthere
defaultafter, we will release them as we go. We are doing that with these first batches so 
defaultthat 
defaultwe can extract the learning and make sure we have the calibration across all of them so that the rating and the judgment we arrive at 
defaultin the first will
default be similar in the 16th one
default—which is why we are doing that
default.
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultDo you have any public process for 
defaultassessing your own assessments—
defaultin other words
default,
default public feedback either from the hospitals themselves or from other people who may be able to provide a user
default’
defaults view of your reports?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultOn our current methodologies, Chair, we survey those that we have inspected about how they have found us and we use that information in the way that we move forward. The returns we get on that survey work show that most people are satisfied. This links to and correlates with
default—
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultBut they cannot know that because they have not seen the report yet.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThat
default is
default on these new ones, but on the current ones we ask people and we will continue that practice. We have also recruited 
defaultKeiran
default 
defaultWalshe
default of 
defaultManchester
default 
defaultBusiness
default 
defaultS
defaultchool
default to do an evaluation of wave 1 and wave 2 inspections
default,
default and we will do that along with our own internal evaluation capacity. We have built that up over the past few weeks to make sure we have the capability to do 
defaultit. Certainly 
defaultin 
defaultBarking, Havering and Redbridge, 
defaultthe chief executive was keen to point out both to myself and Mike 
defaultat the feedback meeting 
defaultthat staff had 
defaultvalued 
defaultthe way 
defaultthat 
defaultwe had conducted 
defaultourselves and conducted 
defaultthe interviews
default with them; they
default 
defaultfelt 
defaultthat it had been a proper process and one that they could give 
defaultto
default.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultCan I add to that? When the inspection report 
defaulthas been
default written
default,
default there is then a quality summit held where the commissioners, local patient groups or anyone can come to discuss the report, which is again an important part of the process.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultWe think we are writing these reports, Chair, for people that use services, so they will be written in a style 
defaultthat
default is acc
defaultessible to patients, relatives and 
defaultresidents
default—your family members or 
defaultmy family members
default—
defaultso it is accessible to people. We do not see these as being written essentially for the providers of care. We see them being written for people who are using care. 
defaultW
defaulte are keen to adopt a style 
defaultthat
default is less bureaucratic, less legalistic in a sense
default,
default and much more about answering these five key questions around safety, effectiveness, caring, responsiveness and how well led a service is. That is the challenge. I was looking yesterday evening at one of the ones we are doing out of the first four inspections and will continue to work at that so that we are couching these reports in a language 
defaultthat
default is accessible to ordinary people and is not written for the boards of the chief executives and executive teams.
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThe implication of my line of questioning is to ensure that it is not just your opinion of the work that you are doing but that you are seen, real time, to be subject to assessment by precisely the kind of user groups that you 
defaultare
default targeting
default,
default to ensure that they believe that you are speaking truth unto power
default,
default because if they do not believe that then we have not made the progress we need to make. 
defaultDavid Behandefault: Quite so, and o
defaultne of the things we have done is this. Every inspection 
defaulthas
default people that use services as part of the inspection teams. They are not 
defaultjust
default speaking to other users of the service
default but 
defaultto the executive teams and non
default&#x2011;
defaultexecutive
default directors as well, so they are making a contribution to that. We use a people
default’
defaults panel to test our language. Our strategy and consultation documents will frequently use a people
default’
defaults panel to check that the language we are using is accessible and the right language to be using. 
defaultW
defaulte are constantly trying and testing our approach. You and Robert Francis have said that any of our work needs to be understandable to ordinary people, so we have taken that literally and seriously to make sure we are testing our language as we go. 
defaultLast Tuesday evening at Barking was a session with people who are using services in that hospital, so we are not just testing our method
defaultologies—
defaultwe are conducting our inspections based on the experiences of people 
defaultwho
default are using services and making sure we are testing those as well.
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI have a 
defaultquick question on the report. 
defaultEffectively, the report is a final report, is it, and no one can challenge what is in it, including the hospitals? Is that right?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultWe provide the first draft of the report back to the hospital for them to check for factual accuracy, but it is our report
default—
defaultit is a final report
default—
defaultand it will be published. 
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultOf course, a key issue is that we are committed to introducing a rating scheme. We will produce three ratings by December, so three of the 18 inspections will drive a rating. We will publish those ratings, so it is absolutely essential that the judgments that we arrive at in these inspections are our judgments because it will then drive the rating.
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWill the rating apply to 
defaultBarts
default and its 15,000 employees as a single rating or to dif
defaultferent departments within 
defaultBarts
default if 
defaultBarts
default is one of the
defaultm?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultThere will be an overall rating
default,
default but there will also be a rating of the eight core services, which are identified as A and E
default,
default maternity, paediatrics and the like. There will also be a rat
defaulting for whether it is well led and 
defaultwhether there is compassionate, safe, effective care and responsiveness. So there will be a number of ratings. Ultimately, we want to be able to rate ev
defaultery department in the hospital—
defaultdiabetes, radiology and the 
defaultlike—
defaultand we think we will be able to get there 
defaultby 
defaultworkin
defaultg very closely with the r
defaultoyal colleges
default,
default using the peer reviews and clinical audits that they do already. 
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultInitially, the rating will be of a trust, but our ambition is that we will rate services within a trust. The key point here is that
default,
default if I have just had a stroke
default,
default I may be more interested in how the str
defaultoke service is going to operate; 
defaultif I am pregn
defaultant and about to give birth, I 
defaultmight be more interested in how the maternity service is. 
defaultI
defaultt is that 
defaultdegree of 
defaultgranularity that we 
defaultthink we 
defaultneed to serve, hence David
default’
defaults point about the work
default we are doing with the medical r
defaultoyal colleges in relation to what potential use we can make of th
defaulteir clinical audits and how that
default can inform service level judgments as well as overall organisational judgments. But the background work that Jennifer Dixon did when she was at the Nuffield was saying that the degree of granularity we need about ratings needs to be about the quality and safety of services rather than overall organisations because that is ultimat
defaultely what members of the public—patients—
defaultare interested in knowing about
default.
default That is our ambition, but it will take us time to get to that.
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThere is a final question and then I will move to others. The danger in this conversation so far is that we are making the old mistake of focusing on big acute hospitals. How does that methodology translate into inspections at primary care and small care homes and so forth?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultAbsolutely. The approach we will take will extend across all of our services. Indeed, when Jennifer Dixon was carrying out the tasks that the Secretary of State asked 
defaulther 
defaultto, the appetite within the adult social care sector for what they saw as a return of ratings was huge because they had seen it having two advantages: first, it provided people who were choosing care services with a guide to what they 
defaultchose
default; second
defaultly
default, they argued that it led to services being able to drive improvements because they all aspired to be good or better. That is the way that the adult social care sector has received this. Andrea
default 
defaultonly 
defaultstarted 
defaulttwo weeks ago
default,
default 
defaultbut she 
defaulthas got off to a flying start in relation to that work
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultn the document that we published last week on 
default“
defaultA Fresh Start
default”—
defaultI think that was the title we gave it
default—
defaultwe set out how we would work with the sector to develop those ratings. We have used the phrase 
default“
defaultco
default&#x2011;
defaultproduction
default.”
default We are committed to that and that is what we will see through. 
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWhen will the first batch of those reports reach the public domain?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultWe are saying we will begin our wave 1 inspections in relation to adult social care in 2014. We will begin to make our changes from spring 2014 in relation to producing our reports in a narrative style against 
defaultthe five questions of safety, effectiveness and caring 
defaultand so on.
default We will begin formal consultation on the standards. We are waiting for the regulations from the Department and we expect those in the next few 
defaultweeks. We will then consult on 
defaultour guidance so that guidance and regulations are available from April and begin to use those through 2014
default&#x2011;
default15. 
defaultO
defaultur new model will be fully rolled out to all providers on adult social care from October 2014. Our ratings initially will come 
defaultin 
defaultfrom October 2014 for adult social care and we will have completed our inspection and rating of every adult social care provider by March 2016. 
defaultWe are on 
defaulta three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear journey to make sure we can get through all 
defaultof 
defaultwhat is effectively 25,000 services
default—
default17,000 residential and 8,500 domiciliary care. 
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYou have not mentioned primary care.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultPrimary care has a similar time line. 
defaultTo be 
defaultbrutally honest, we need to do more work on developing that methodology and m
defaultodel. We will publish a sign
defaultposting document at the end of November
default,
default similar to 
default“
defaultA Fresh Start
default”
default that we published last week, which will set out some of our ambitions. We will be bringing in our changes in relation to inspection of out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthours
default services from April 2014 and will be piloting our new approach to general practice from January 2014. 
defaultT
defaulthat is the approach we are taking
default,
default with ratings to follow as we build that methodology. 
defaultW
defaulte have pretty much nailed in quite firm detail how we will go through the period between now and 2016 to complete the transformation of the way that we operate across all three sectors over that three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear period.
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultMoving on to th
defaulte issue of the chief inspectors—
default the thre
defaulte that have now been appointed—
defaultwhat was the fundamental weakness of the CQC for which the appointment of chief inspectors was the solution?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultThe fundamental weakness was that we had a generic inspection model so that the same inspector would go into a dentist, an ac
defaultute hospital and
default a care home. Now we are organising ourselves in, if you like, three separate units, so there will be a much greater degree of specialisatio
defaultn than we had in the past. T
defaulthat is not to say that we do not recognise fully that the trend of health and social care is towards greater integration. 
defaultWit
defaulthin the capacity of each inspector
default,
default at least 20% of their time will be set aside to work across the patient pathway from social care into health
default 
defaultcare and primary care. We have gone for a much more specialist inspection model.
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultIn relation to the status of each of those three inspectors, I notice that the chief inspector of hospitals is a board member but th
defaulte other two inspectors are not—
defaultor at least not so far as we are aware 
defaultfrom
default your submission to us. Has that position now changed?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultYes. All three are board members.
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultIn terms of the function and oversight 
defaultrole 
defaultof the chief inspectors and the chief executive
default’
defaults role in relation to the chief inspector, how would you describe that relationship and in what way can the chief executive, if you like, negotiate priority or indeed even direct those priorities of the chief inspectors?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultThe three chief inspectors report directly to the chief executive
default,
default who is accountable to the board. That is the management accounting structure within the CQC.
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default C
defaultan the chief executive, the board or the chairman challenge the judgment
defaults
default or conclusions of the chief inspectors?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultYes. There will be a very robust discussion at times about what they want to do and how they want to do it. What is critical is that the judgment is independent of the NHS system and independent of the
default Secretary of State for health.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThe thing that I would emphasise, Andrew, is that, in a legal sense, Parliament has given the CQC as a body the power to inspect and regulate. The 2008 Act sets out our duties and responsibilities and they will be amended by the Bill that is currently in the Lords
default,
default which will be coming into this House soon
default. When that Bill secures Royal A
defaultssent
default,
default it will introduce new powers and amend some of the powers that were in the Act. 
defaultI
defaultt is through the delegations document from the board to me
default,
default from me to the chief inspectors and from the chief inspectors through the organisation that we carry out our responsibilities. I see my job as to support the chief inspectors to do their job. I am the accounting officer and the chief executive of the organisation. That is how I see the difference. I do not see myself making operational decisions, but
default,
default if an internal appeal is required 
defaulton
default a decision made 
defaultby 
defaulta chief inspector, it may well be
default 
defaultthat I would consider an appeal
default,
default 
defaultin the way that that operates 
defaultinternally
default. Of course
default people can go externally to tribunals and other places, but I think it is clear. I know there has been a lot of discussion about the nature of the role
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultresponsibility
default and so on
default, but I see the power and authority to act 
defaultas
default 
defaultbeing 
defaultwith the 
defaultc
defaultommission
default,
default and 
defaultthen 
defaultthrough our system of delegations to me
default,
default and then, through me, to the chief inspectors
default,
default and through the organisation to others as well. There is no way, with 25,000 inspections, that Andrea is going to do every inspection in adult social care. So you need a system of delegations that is clear about who is delegated to do what, when, where, why and how
default,
default and that is the work that we will do as we continue the transformation and change within the organisation
default,
default to set out a
defaultn organisational structure that
default can deliver our purpose with a set of systems and processes 
defaultthat 
defaultallow us to do that. I do not wish to be boring and bureaucratic about this, but process has its place and we need to make sure it has its proper place in the way that we set up the organisation to move forward.
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultIf we as a Select Committee, for example, undertook an inquiry in the adult social care sector and felt we needed to look at the quality or 
defaultthe 
defaultoutcomes of in
defaultspections within that sector,
default would 
defaultit 
defaultbe you, Mr Behan, as the chief executive of the CQC, who would come and take overall responsibility for the actions of the CQC in that respect, 
defaultand not the chief inspector?
default 
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultI think this is a good question
default.
default 
defaultJ
defaultust to pick a
default way carefully through the
default difference between accountability and responsibility
default,
default I would see myself as being accountable for the work that goes on in adult social care and Andrea 
defaultas 
defaultbeing responsible f
defaultor the way that is taken forward
default. But I would account to the board for that work. This is my point about the power that we have under the legislation, which is 
defaultfor
default the organisation as a body
default,
default not 
defaultfor us as individuals. P
defaultutting the chief inspectors on a statutory footing preserves their role in statute so that it cannot be done away with, in a sense. It does not invest in them special powers
default. The powers that exist are for
default the Commission. 
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultSo they are accountable to you in the sense that you take an oversight of their work
default,
default but at board level you are accountable to them. How does that work?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultI do not think that is
default—
defaultDavid Behandefault: We have got a 
defaultunitary board
default—
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultLet us take a case in point. Andrea is in the room. If we felt that she was not performing, that she was not up to the job
default—
defaultI am 
defaultsure that is not the case, so this
default is highly hypothetical
default—
defaultthe board would say, 
default“S
defaultorry, Andrea, you
default’
defaultre not making it, so we
default’
defaultre going to recruit somebody else.
default”
default 
defaultT
defaulto that extent she is accountable to us.
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultThat is helpful. The Department of Health in its evidence to us says that establishing the position of the chief inspector
defaults
default on a permanent statutory 
defaultfooting will “ensure that individuals who are appointed to the roles are able to speak up for patients and provide clear judgments about quality of care.”
default In relation to that role, will they be sufficiently independent to be advocates and champions within their sector?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultThey will be
default,
default and so will the CQC. The whole thrust of
default 
defaultthis change to
default 
defaultthe Care Bill
default, and what lies behind it,
default is to make us demonstrably more independent.
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultFinally, on inspections of hospitals, there has been a lot sai
defaultd, both in the Mid Staffs
default report
default—
defaultthe Francis inquiry
default—
defaultand elsewhere 
defaultabout 
defaulthow one objectively measures the quality of care at hospital ward level. Given that there is now 
defaulta lot of professional pressure, 
defaultand some political pressure, I should admit, in
defaultcluding from myself and others, 
defaultto address the issue of adequate registered nurse staffing levels
default on the hospital ward, and s
defaultince you are going into much more specialised inspections
default—
defaultin this case, of hospitals
default—
defaultwill 
defaultyou establish, 
defaultbefore you even go in and see what it is like on the ground, in terms of the inputs going into the service itself,
default 
defaultany objective measures or new objective tools 
defaultthat
default you will use to assess how the hospital is doing?
default 
default              
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultWe are working with NICE and NHS England on exactly this issue
default,
default about a tool that can assess the adequacy of staffing. The fundamental standards will also address this issue, so the regulations will need to address the appropriateness of staffing. 
defaultW
defaulte continue to work with, as I say, NHS England, NICE and the Departme
defaultnt of Health on exactly this. For
default our new inspections, one of the key issues that we are exploring is the adequacy and appropriateness of staffing to ensure that people 
defaultreceive safe 
defaulthigh
default-
defaultquality care. 
defaultJ
defaultust this week
default Mike
default has met with colleagues in NHS England and had conversations with them about exactly these issues. 
defaultSo w
defaulte continue to make good prog
defaultress on this—and, yes, we will. 
defaultThe issue is really 
defaultwhether we 
defaultwill just assess against a particular 
defaultratio, and whether the ratio will be set.
default That presents more difficulties because I do not think all services, hospitals, care homes or primary medical services are homogenous in the way you can set the ratio. The geography, the physical 
defaultenvironment, is different and the ratio
default needs to be appropriate to the particular set of circumstances at the time. 
defaultBut 
defaultwe 
defaultalso 
defaultknow from our experience that the quality of care that people receive is related to the number of staff on duty
default,
default and actually making sure that there are sufficient staff on duty is an essential assessment, an essential judgment
default,
default that we need to make around the quality and safety of care that we are assessing.
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default Yes, o
defaultkay. You recognise that obviously
default,
default in the acute setting
default—although 
defaultI know there is no standard acute ward
default—
defaultthat is quite different
default,
default because in 
defaulty
defaultour answer you provided a whole range of different scenarios as to where staffing levels might vary, and quite rightly so. But in t
defaulterms of the acute hospital ward,
default you would at least acknowledge the fact that adequate staffing
default—
defaultthis is very important
default,
default because you use the word 
default“
defaultstaff
default”—includes 
defaultthe clinically
default 
defaulttrained registered nurse levels on those wards
default. That
default is very much the focus of where the professions are pushing both the inspectors as well as the hospital providers.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultAbsolutely. We see it as being an absolutely fundamental issue that we need 
defaultto 
defaultlook at, so the
defaultre is the
default skill mix, 
defaultand ensuring that 
defaultthe number of qualified staff 
defaultis 
defaultsufficient to 
defaultmeet the 
defaultacuity
default of the people that are in those services
default,
default but 
defaultthere is 
defaultalso the geography of those services.
default The physical geography of the
default wards can be very different
default. I
defaultf you have single room occupancy as distinct from more open wards
default,
default that is going to have a very direct impact on the number of people and the skill mix that you are going to need on duty to make sure that people are adequately assessed. The
defaultre is also the
default difference between intensive care units and acute admissio
defaultn wards
default. So, yes, we do think that is an important issue
default,
default and
default we are looking carefully at i
defaultt. 
defaultThe other thing that we want to see is not what the establishment is
default,
default but how many people are actually there. 
defaultT
defaulthis last week at Barking I was with a qualified nurse looking at A and E and that is what we were exploring: what was the difference between the establishment and the number of staff that were on duty
default?
default That is exactly the conversation we had. So it is also about being granular in the questions we are asking as we go through and do our inspections to make sure 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have an accurate understanding
default,
default not 
defaultof 
defaultwhat people
default’
defaults plans are but 
defaultof 
defaultthe actuality of the delivery.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultWe
default need to know that the hospital
default knows that 
defaultit
default has done a proper assessment of the right levels of staffing in their wards. If we know they have done that work
default—that 
defaultthey have 
defaultdone a proper dependency audit, 
defaultan 
defaultacuity
default audit
default—
defaultwe take a lot of confidence from that.
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThis is on the same point. I am 
defaultrather 
defaultastonished that we ke
defaultep going round and round and round this issue, and i
defaultt gets 
defaultterr
defaultibly frustrating for us here that you are 
defaultstill 
defaulttalking to people in NHS England and NICE
default about this
default. 
defaultO
defaultur latest report included an example of how it is done in one hospital, which is one of the s
defaultafest hospitals in the country—
defaulthow they use a safe staffing tool and h
defaultow they publish both the numbers of
default how many staff there should be
default on duty, and how many there are.
default 
defaultThey
default have bee
defaultn doing that since the summer, s
defaulto why on earth you have to keep going round and round this, I do not know. 
defaultQ
defaultuestions 
defaulthave been raised here today. 
default              
defaultThis
default is an incredibly important time
default,
default as the chief inspectors
default’
default roles are established, and I understand it was reported that Robert Francis called a meeting with yo
defaultu recently for a rethink on safe staffing levels,
default and said that minimum staffing levels should be an alarm bell for questions about safety. It seems, to a certain extent, that people fall back on the fact that the original Francis report did not recommend minimum 
defaultlevels. But he has had a rethink.
default 
defaultH
defaulte has looked at the evidence from the Safe Staffing Alliance and
default 
defaultit 
defaulti
defaults reported that 
defaulthe 
defaultsays 
defaultthat 
defaulthe is convinced
default that this 
defaultshould be the alarm bell for questions about 
defaultsafety—
defaultthe level below which you cannot be safe. But we understood from reports of that same meeting
default—
defaultit was your meeting
default—
defaultthat Sir Mike Richards was not planning to include staffing levels in his surveillance model
default,
default but will look at things like unanswered ca
defaultre bells. Unanswered care bells come
default from 
defaultnot 
defaulthaving enough staff
default,
default and I am still talking to and getting information from people working in ho
defaultspitals where the ratio falls to 2:28 and 2:23. 
defaultI was talking to somebody at the weekend 
defaultwho
default was saying that on nights they are expected to look after 
defaultpeople on a ratio of 
default2:23
default. L
defaultots of patients
default,
default or people visiting older family members, for instance
default,
default will tell you
default that 
defaulton a ward it is not uncommon to see the nurses totally stretched and running round. 
default              
defaultThe Secretary of State today
default, 
defaultanswering 
defaultq
defaultuestions in this House on the troubled hospitals that have been in special measures, was reporting how one of them had recruited 257 nurses. 
defaultIt is absolutely obvious—
defaultobvious from 
defaultwhat 
defaultRobert Francis said and obvi
defaultous from where the level is right—
defaultthat this is the answer. So why are you still talking to NHS England
default,
default and why is it all so 
defaultagonised? Why can you 
defaultnot 
defaultjust do it? Look at our Committee
default’
defaults recent report and adopt what it says.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultWe are in huge agreement on this. Mike was slightly misquoted. He absolutely believes that staffing levels are critically important. He was saying that just having a minimum 
defaultof 
default8:1, for example, on its own was probably not the right way to go. He absolutely is looking at staffing levels and
default,
default 
defaultas for the hospital that you referred to—
defaultI think it is the Salford Royal
default—
defaultwe will be looking to see whether or not hospitals have made an assessment of what the right staffing level is for ward
defaults. W
defaulte will be looki
defaultng exactly at that. So we are on
default the same page as you on this. 
defaultThe difficulty
default 
defaultis
default whether or not there should be a minimum level of 8:1 across the piece.
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultI need to correct you. The Safe Staffing Alliance are very clear that that is the fundamental standard
default,
default and that if you are at that level the alarm bell is already ringing
default—
defaultbearing in mind that the nurse in charge is supernumerary to that assessment. In other words, that is the fundamental standard
default,
default 
defaultand
default once you are at that level you need to start asking questions about the safety of patients on that ward. But 
defaultthey are
default not saying that that is the target. That is the fundamental standard, which is a different concept to that of a mandated minimum, as it were.
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThe second part of what we included in our report was about t
defaultransparency
default. It is okay for you to check
default,
default but y
defaultou would not have to check if that information
default was 
defaultpublished on wards, would you—i
defaultf that information was available to the public
default? Y
defaultou have talked a
default lot about your reports making 
defaultsense to the public
default,
default so why not let us all push for having that information out there?
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can I 
defaultre
defaultcommend 
defaultthat 
defaultyou look, as we suggested in our last report, at the Salford Royal precedent
default,
default where information is publicly available to clinicians, 
defaultto 
defaultpeople on the wards and to patients
default’
default families
default,
default so that they can make their own assessment a
defaultnd contribute to the discussion?
default But let us not take over the session with nursing numbers.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultCan I just add
default something—
defaultnot to extend it, Chair, 
defaultbut just 
defaultto pick up on Barbara
default’s point?
default We are 
defaultnot
default 
defaultjust 
defaulttalking about this. We are building 
defaultit
default into the six inspections we have done
default. I
defaultndeed
default,
default today we started our inspection of Salford Royal. We chose the 18 so that there were six low
default-
defaultrisk
default hospitals
default, six medium and six high
default-
defaultrisk
default,
default so 
defaultthat we can
default learn not just where these things are not done well but where they are done well
default,
default an
defaultd we can publicise where they are
default done well. So today, as I have said, we have begun
default 
defaultat Salford Royal
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte will be there over the next three days
default,
default and we will be able to pull these out. 
defaultW
defaulthen we publish our reports, if this is what we find, we will be able to demonstrate that as being good practice. Salford Royal is held up as an example by many
default,
default and we will be given the opportunity to do the same in our inspection. I do not want to give 
defaultthe
default 
defaultimpression
default that we are just going round
default and round having conversations. W
defaulte are actively building an assessment of the adequacy of staffing in
defaultto
default our new inspection model. We are doing that from now
default,
default and wh
defaulten
default we write our reports we will comment on how that contributes to the safety and quality of services.
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThat is good.
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultCan I push you on that? Do you have an end date for your chats? Have you 
defaultsaid
default to Mike, for instance, 
default“
defaultRep
defaultort back to me before Christmas”?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultYes. 
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWhat is the end date then?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultI have already given you a sense of what the end date is. We have said that we will complete our wave 1 pilot inspections by December.
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default O
defaultn this issue.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultWe will learn from those and build that into wave 2, which will get carried out between January and March next year
default,
default and then from March next year we will begin wave 3
default,
default and they will be the inspections that we intend to run through that next wave.
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI was talking specifically about the safe staffing issue. You said 
defaultthat 
defaultMike is looking at it
default,
default so I was ask
defaulting basically to pin you down. 
defaultHave you given him an end date to report on this particular issue?
defaultDavid Behandefault: On that particular issue
default there is an end date that we have agreed between us as a senior group of colleagues
default—
defaultthat we will have a new inspection methodology up and running and finalised from 1 April next year.
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default Will y
defaultou let us have it and publish it on your website?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultAbsolutely. We will start to publish our wave 1 reports, which will give you an indication of how we are dealing with this, from November. Those four will be in November. The next four will be in December, the next four in January and the next four in February.
defaultChair:default 
defaultBarbara, you were half way through.
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultGoing back to a further question around the introduction of the chief inspectors for hospitals, primary care and social care, the Foundation Trust Network have said that they believe this introduction may delay the development of new regulatory approaches in other areas, 
defaultsuch as 
defaultambulance services, community services and mental health services. How do you guard against your regulatory work 
defaultjust
default focusing on the core remits of the three chief inspectors and other things becoming less important or not attended to?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThey are not less important. We have a good relationship with the Foundation Trust Network and we have a good and robust conversation with them about what is going well and what they would like us to move more quickly on. You as a Committee have challenged us historically about being all things to all people and not being clear. If everything is a priority, nothing is. The only thing we have said, Barbara, is 
defaultthat 
defaultour focus, for very obvious reasons
default—
defaultyou have mentioned Robert Francis on three occasion
defaults
default now
default—
defaultis to sort out what we are doing around acute hospitals. We will then begin to tackle what we are doing around independent healthcare, mental health, community trusts and ambulance services. We have accelerated the work we have been doing. 
defaultWe have had a number of accelerated solution events
default—
defaultif I can use that jargon
default—
defaultduring October in relation to how we will inspect mental health and community health
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default services
default,
default and we will begin to pilot our mental health and community health substance misuse out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthours
default service from January next year. The only thing we are saying is that we cannot do everything at the same time. We do not want to build in delay. We are acut
defaultely conscious that there is a 
defaultfoundation trust pipeline that people are keen to get through and we have given commitments
default,
default working with Monitor and the TDA
default,
default about how we will do that. 
defaultI
defaultn answer to Valerie
default’
defaults question about time lines and 
defaultwhether we 
defaultcan guarantee th
defaultem
default, we have set those time lines out. They are a plan, but we do not intend them to slip
default—
defaultwe are worki
defaultng very hard to deliver on them—
defaultand we know that others are dependent on us. 
defaultW
defaulte are trying not 
defaultto 
defaultpromise to do everything at the same time and fail
default,
default but to be absolutely clear what we are going to do and when. Our strategy was a three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear strategy of reform. The bigger issue, quite frankly
default,
default is not
default,
default 
default“
defaultCan we hit these dates?
default”, but,
default 
default“
defaultCan we change the attitudes and behaviours within the organisation so that we can move from a system of compliance and generic inspection to one which is about assessment and judgment led by professionals?
default”
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultMoving on to a different point, you recently announced 
defaultthat 
defaultan internal disciplinary inquiry had cleared Anna Jefferson of any wrongdoing in relation to the instruction to delete the report on the registration of Morecambe Bay 
defaultNHS Foundation 
defaultTrust. Clearly that announcement, which was very brief that day, contradicts the findings of the Grant Thornton report
default,
default which said otherwise. Can you explain the basis for the disciplinary inquiry
default’
defaults conclusions?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultWhen we were here last time we were asked if we would consider any action against either past or current employees. We said we would take that away. We reported publicly in the summer
default,
default in a letter to the Secretary of State about past employees
default,
default 
defaultthat 
defaultwe 
defaultdid
default not think there 
defaultwa
defaults anything that we 
defaultcould 
defaultdo in relation to those individuals
default,
default and said we would carry out disciplinary investigations into 
defaultthe
default two employees who were still employed by us. We have carried out a proper investigation. We took external legal advice and found that there was no case for Anna Jefferson to answer. She has returned to the organisation and commenced a period of training. We 
defaultdo not think this
default contradicts the major findings and substance of the Grant Thornton report. We have also advised that we have updated our website in relation to a formal complaint that we have had from solicitors acting 
defaultfor 
defaultone of the previous employees of the CQC
default,
default 
defaultbut that 
defaultwe will continue to move forward in the work that we are doing to change the way that we operate. We do not think there is anything that is contradictory at all.
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultCan I ask 
defaultyou 
defaultanother question about that? That is a peculiar conclusion to come to. 
defaultW
defaulthen that was a key element in that part of the report
default—as we said 
defaultin a previous hearing here, that is an important issue because it was about a situation in a hospital where babies and mothers had died
default;
default that is why it was serious
default,
default and I drew y
defaultour attention to that before—it is hard to see 
defaulthow members of the public affected by what was in that report 
defaultcan 
defaulthave confidence in it when, effectively, you have now said you have looked into a part of it 
defaultand it 
defaultwas 
defaultnot true. Apparently 
defaultit was not true that she issued the 
default“
defaultdelete
default”
default instruction
default,
default and you have cleared her of any wrongdoing. 
defaultT
defaulthat part, w
defaulthich seemed quite clear in the
default report, did accuse people of wrongdoing. There were all kinds of accusations and things said around that report. It does not stack up. 
default              
defaultThe
default question that people outside
default here will want to ask is, 
default“
defaultHow about the rest of it?
default”
default There were questions that were asked 
defaultabout
default how Grant Thornton went about their investigation, the fact that they did not feed back to people, did not allow notes of meetings, 
defaultthat notes 
defaultwere not taken contemporaneously and 
defaultpeople
default were not allowed to correct notes that were written when they were submitted afterwards. There were all kinds of issues like that. If you have looked into this and found it was not true in the case of one particular person, how can you say that the substance of the investigation and the report is not queried in any way and you have confidence in it? 
defaultTo me, t
defaulthat does not stack up.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultYou need to 
defaultlook
default with precision 
defaultat
default Anna Jefferson
default’
defaults involvement in that
default—
defaultthat is exactly what we looked at
default,
default and we did not look at what other people were said to have done or did not do in relation to it
default—
defaultan
defaultd go back to what we said at your
default last hearing specifically on this
default,
default which is that we commissioned Grant Thornton as a reputable independent body to carry out their review of what happened in relation to Morecambe Bay. 
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default And y
defaultou found part of what they investigated and what they reported to be wrong
default,
default and you cleared the person that they had accused of doing something of any wrongdoing. 
defaultY
defaultou have effectively, through what you announced, contradicted what they said in their report.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultNo. They raised issues about the behaviour of certain individuals
default,
default which we looked at very carefully. They raised issues but did not come to a conclusion that anyone was guilty of this, that or 
defaultthe other. They raised issues. 
defaultWe checked those issues out very thoroughly through a disciplinary process and found that, in the case of Anna Jefferson, the allegations raised were not valid. It does not in any way undermine the major thrust of the Grant Thornton report
default,
default which was that the 
defaultwhole organisation, and the 
defaultregulatory system that we were implementing
default,
default was completely unfit for purpose. The two are very separate. 
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default But this
default does call into question the way that they investigated
default—
defaultpresumably the way that they spoke to people, the way they did not keep contemporaneous notes, 
defaultand 
defaultthe way that they did not offer the people that they were making conclusions about an opportunity to correct the note of a meeting, for instance. All of that was submitted to us as evidence
default,
default from people mentioned in that report, that there were great concerns about it. It seems to me that you have agreed with at least certain aspects of that in the case of Anna Jefferson. You were saying that there was no wrongdoing and there was not a 
default“
defaultdelete
default”
default instruction. If you will excuse me saying this, it does not stack up that part of it is wrong and the rest of it is okay.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThere are two different issues, Chair: one is a report into the events and the circumstances that we
defaultnt on,
default and the other 
defaultis that 
defaultwe were asked
default—
defaultand we agreed
default,
default and it was the right thing
default—
defaultto consider whether there was an employment case to be answered. That is what we have done.
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default T
defaulto be clear, you are saying that when there was an allegation that Anna Jefferson was involved with a decision to cover up a criti
defaultcal internal report claiming, “
defaultThis can never be in 
defaultthe public domain or subject to 
defaultFo
defaultI
default,
default”
default that allegation stands but it is not a disciplinary issue.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultThat allegation was not proven, Stephen.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThe issue is where the contemporaneous evidence sat in relation to what went on in Grant Thornton
default,
default and we have contemporaneous evidence in relation to other things that took place and that were set out in the Grant Thornton report and set out in relation to Louise 
defaultDineley
default. In relation specifically 
defaultto
default Anna Jefferson, in the disciplinary investigation we did not see any contemporaneous evidence in relation to the allegation against 
defaulther
default. In relation to the others, there was contemporaneous evidence
default,
default and that is the 
defaultbasis on which 
defaultthis difference has actually taken place.
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultIndeed. We can leave this point here because there are lots of other questions to be answered, but I think we questioned 
defaultthe 
defaultappoint
defaultment of 
defaultGrant Thornton 
defaultlast time
default when we covered this in
default more depth
default. There was a fair amount of evidence given to this Committee about the way they went about it being very defective, the 
defaultway that they ran the 
defaultmeetings—
defaultth
defaultey were hostile and aggressive—and 
defaultvery many 
defaultother 
defaultissues. Given that, it might be something th
defaultat really needs thinking about 
defaultif there were
default 
defaultanything similar
default to that report to commission in future, because
default it does seem to have been a faulty decision to appoint them
default,
default and they do not appear to have carried out the work in the way that they should
default. I
defaultt really does not s
defaulttack up for you to say you can find 
defaultfault with part of it 
defaultbut
default the rest is okay
default.
default I would not be surprised if questions about this ran on and on, but that is probably
default enough for today
defaultCa
defaultn we go back to the way that
default hospitals are categorised
default,
default because there is a question that flows on from 
defaultthe point 
defaultDavid Behan 
defaultmade
default about inspecting hospitals that are at different leve
defaultls of performance at the moment?
default It is perhaps a concern that
default,
default even if a hospita
defaultl is categorised as outstanding,
default there are questions sometimes about individual departm
defaultents, about individual services. T
defaulthings go wrong even in hospitals 
defaultthat
default are overall very safe and providing very good service. There is a concern that a hospital that becomes categorised as outstanding 
defaultmight start
default to think, 
default“
defaultWell, we
default’
defaultre not going to be inspected for three to five years,
default”
default and they could easily become complacent. How can that 
defaultconcern 
defaultbe squared up? How can you keep the good and outstanding hospitals where they are
default,
default and not let them become complacent? This used to happen in 
defaultschools with 
defaultOfsted
default, did it not? I
defaultf you knew you were not going to be inspected, did you really keep on your toes and keep up to the standard you were at?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultWe have developed
default not a perfect 
defaultbut
default 
defaultquite a sophisticated surveillance model 
defaultthat
default comprises 150
default&#x2011;
defaultodd indicators, largely around mortality, complications, safety issues, patient surveys, staff surveys and the like, which enables us to monitor hospitals in between inspections. We will be publishing the results of the first cut of that model on Thursday
default—
defaultI think we have sent a copy of it to the Chairman today
default. That
default will help us keep an eye on all hospitals in between inspections
default,
default and
default,
default if there is a risk ind
defaulticator that goes off in between,
default that will trigger an inspection. So just because you have an outstanding rating, it does not mean that you will not get inspected in between times.
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultWould that apply to individual services? Can you see a situation where there might be an outstanding hospital
default—
defaultin an overall sense, outstanding
default—that 
defaulthad problems in one department or
default—
default 
defaultDavid Priordefault: Or in 
defaulta ward
default. Yes,
default I can see that. 
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThat would be triggered to you. How would that happen?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultNo. The critical thing for us is that we do not expect hospitals to be perfect. I do not think there is any hospital in the world which is perfect, but we will expect the managers to know where the issues are. They will know they have a problem in urology, for example, or know they have a problem on a certain ward
default,
default and they are aware of that and 
defaultwill be 
defaultdoing something about it. But we certainly do not expect hospitals to be perfect.
defaultChair:default 
defaultDavid.
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default Thank you very much, Chair. 
defaultI thought you were going to say I had been 
default“
defaultvery patient
default”
default.
defaultChair:default 
defaultIndeed. Since you have put words into my mouth, I am happy to speak them for you.
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultThank you, Chair. I want to return to standards
default—
defaultI say 
default“
defaultreturn
default”
default because 
defaultthey have 
defaultbeen fairly comprehensively covered in many respects
default—
defaultand ask a few questions. How do you react to the English Community Care Association
default’
defaults criticism that detaching expected standards from fundamental standards will confuse the general public?
defaultDavid Behandefault: This
default goes back to what I said earlier about work
defaulting
default with the adult social care sector to make sure that that confusion does not arise. We are working on the fundamental standards. We will inspect all services against the five key questions that will drive a rating on that four
default&#x2011;
defaultpoint
default scale of outstanding, good, requires improvement or inadequate. The fundamental standards will be set in law so 
defaultthat 
defaultthey are enforceable
default. S
defaulto if we need to take action we will take action against those fundamental standards. 
defaultT
defaulthat is how we will do it.
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default Earlier
default you were talking about setting up
default—
defaultI forget what they were called
default—
defaultsomething along the lines of 
default“
defaultclarity panels
default”
default with the general public
default,
default to make sure
default—
default 
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultPeople
default’
defaults panels.
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default —
defaultthat what you were saying was understandable. Will you apply that standard in this case
default,
default to mak
defaulte
default sure that the general public thoroughly understand this change?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultYes, we will, in short.
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default So it will be 
defaultscoping groups. You will go out and ask people, 
default“
defaultDo you understand what is going on?
default”
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultGood, thank you very much. 
defaultI think you
default touched on this earlier, but just for clarity
default I will ask again: w
defaultill your fundamental and essential standards apply to all providers
default 
defaultacross all sectors
default,
default or do you expect to tailor them for different parts of the health and social care system?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThe fundamental standards are going to be set out in regulations. They will apply to everything that we regulate, but the way we inspect and the questions we ask
default—
defaultthis comes back to Andrew George
default’
defaults question about the rationale for differentiation
default—
defaultin a three
default&#x2011;
defaultbedded
default home for somebody with autism are likely to be different 
defaultfrom
default the questions we will ask in an international teaching hospital on numerous sites, for pretty obvious reasons. But, ultimately, what we can enforce in law will be set out in the regulations and they will apply acros
defaults all 
defaultthe services that we register and regulate.
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault: defaultT
defaultalking about the law, 
defaulty
defaultou have said that tough action will be taken against social care providers that fail to meet acceptable standards. What sort of sanctions will you be able to apply?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultOur ultimate sanction is 
defaultthat 
defaultwe can close a service and they can fail to operate. Indeed, just this week in 
defaultNottingham
default we are taking action to remove from operation a care home 
defaultthat
default we think has consistently failed to meet standards. We can also take a range of actions, from issuing warning notices to issuing fixed penalty notices.
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultSo in this particular case you were going to take criminal action. Do you think criminal prosecutions might be suitable in certain circumstances?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultYes. A fixed penalty notice is indeed a criminal prosecution.
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default Yes
default it is, but
default,
default if I get a fixed penalty notice for parking badly round the corner, that is at a different level to being t
defaultaken to a magistrates court or a C
defaultrown court. 
defaultW
defaulthen I talk about prosecution I am not thinking about a fi
defaultxed penalty notice particularly;
default I am thinking about prosecutions of members of the staff for failing to comply with the law.
defaultDavid Behandefault: W
defaulte can take action where a service is failing and we can take action against the boards
default—
defaultthis will be one of the changes that comes through when the Care Bill is introduced
default—
defaultbut any criminal prosecutions, as in the case of the staff in Winterbourne View, for instance, are taken by the police and not by the CQC. Rober
defaultt Francis raised the issue of Health and Safety Executive prosecutions—
defaultindeed
default,
default I think they have taken a prosecutio
defaultn in relation to Mid Staffs—
defaultand w
defaulte have been working with the Health and Safety E
defaultxecutive and the Department of Health as to how that recommendation from Robert Francis is going to be taken forward.
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultThank you. I have no further questions. 
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan I pursue the question of one of the five fundamental standards, which is safety
default? Y
defaultou will know that this Committee on more than one occasion in the past has disagreed with the Go
defaultvernment on the moving of the 
defaultNPSA responsibility into the Commissioning Board
default. I
default seek your view on 
defaultwhether 
defaultthe most effective way to follow up this fundamental standard of patient safety 
defaultis 
defaultfor 
defaultit
default to be divided, essenti
defaultally, between the CQC and the Commissioning Board.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThe important thing here, Chair, is that the intelligence collected through th
defaultese incidents being reported 
defaultto the national patient reporting system, which is currently held by NHS England, is passed to us
default on a regular basis and we use i
defaultt as the basis of our inspections. Indeed
default—
defaultnothing to do with today
default’
defaults hearing
default—
defaultMike met NHS England on this very point yesterday evening. It was genuinely nothing to do with this; we are not that clever at the minute, I have to say.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default You are 
defaultworking to be clever.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThis is 
defaultall 
defaultjust moving too quickly, to be honest, to schedule meetings to coincide
default—
defaultas important as this meeting is, he hastens to add. We are also going to agree with NHS England what the safety dashboard and its content 
defaultwill be
default. I am meeting Imperial in a couple of weeks
default’
default time because they act in a capacity to carry out some of the analysis of this. So we do understand why you are making your recommendation
default and
default why that should not be separated and split. If we were to be asked to take on that responsibility, we would take it on. At the minute
default—
default 
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIf this Committe
defaulte
default were to commend to the House an ame
defaultndment to one of the
default bits of legislation coming through 
defaultthat would have 
defaultthat effect, would you be supportive of it?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultIn principle, it is something that we feel ought to be with us, not with NHS England.
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultPatient safety responsibility should be with you.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultChair:default Thank you.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultBut in making that recommendation, Chair, there is a broader set of issues around sending out alerts. A lot of these alerts relate to machinery and equipment, not just critical incidents about where patients have b
defaulteen badly cared for. There is an 
defaultimportant judgment to arrive at ultimate
defaultly
default, as you push this to a conclusion and then 
defaultto 
defaulta decision, about our range of responsibilities. That is a point that needs teasing out
default,
default in a way. You may well have questions on this later on other issues.
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYou know 
defaultthat 
defaulta specific case 
defaulthas been 
defaultraised with the clerk and with me on behalf of the Committee by Professor Toft around 
defaultneuraxial
default connectors
default—that
default is the technical term
default. A
default patient
default 
defaultsafety
default-
defaultorientated recommendation now 10 years old 
defaulthas 
defaultstill not 
defaultbeen 
defaultimplemented. The question is, first, is this something that the CQC should follow up on during its inspections
default,
default and, second
defaultly
default, would not a national patient safety reporting system reporting to the CQC be an effective means of delivering something that was first recommended 10 years ago and has been endorsed repeatedly since then
default,
default but still not implemented? 
defaultDavid Behandefault: Yes, 
defaultI think that is absolutely right
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultf you take away the ownership
default—
defaultwho is owning that
default, and 
defaultwhere that function sit
defaults—
defaultthe important issue is that information 
defaultis
default com
defaulting
default to us and
default being built into our inspections.
default 
defaultI
defaultndeed
default, on Friday 
defaultMike, who knows about this because of his own clinical background in cancer services, did ask about 
defaultthis 
defaultand 
defaultfound 
defaultthat 
defaultthat 
defaultneuraxial
default system is not yet in 
defaultplace in Surrey
default. So we are able to build 
defaultthat aspect 
defaultin. 
defaultOne of the challenges for us, Chair, is 
defaultthat 
defaulteverybody wants us to build things into our inspection. We were criticised for having a rules
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default system which generated a tick
default&#x2011;
defaultbox
default approach to inspection and we have said we will cease to do that
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthere is a balance to be struck here about how far we build things 
defaultin
defaultto our inspection. I am n
defaultot saying this is not important.
default 
defaultI
defaultndeed
default, we did ask about this,
default and how we avoid creating another approach where every 
defaultinspection has to run through a
default list of things we need to check
default,
default 
defaultwhich
default then drives us into a tick
default&#x2011;
defaultbox
default culture yet again rather than judging the quality of the experience of people using these services and ensuring that the service they get is safe and of high quality. So there is a balance and 
defaulta 
defaultjudgment to be struck here.
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I do not want to prolong this,
default because I think you are agreeing with us, but this specific case should surely simply be a safety requirement
default,
default where
defaultby
default a green box means there is nothing for anybody to discuss and 
defaulta 
defaultred box means there is something for somebody to do as a matter of urgency.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultYes. I think NHS England are going to issue something on this. That is my advice in relation to making sure that this is picked up.
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultDon
default’t get us wrong,
default 
defaultas 
defaultwe do not underestimate the task that you have
default and we 
defaultappreciate that you are putting all your best efforts into it
default, 
defaultbut I am just go
defaulting to focus on another slight
default overlap now. In your 
default“
defaultA Fresh Start for the Regulation and Inspection of Adult Social Care
default”
default you mention that you are going to carry out financial checks on a small number of providers. Could you explain what sort of financial checks those are
default,
default and whether you see some sort of overlap with Monitor in that?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThere is no overlap. This is specifically a responsibility we have been asked to take forward in relation to adult social care, not in relation to the NHS. This is as a result of quite a considered consultation by the Department of Health following Southern Cross 
defaultand its 
defaultfinancial collapse. Southern Cross exposed 
defaultthe fact 
defaultthat for national organisations there is no oversight of service continuity and financial resilience. For single homes and small care 
defaultgroups, loc
defaultal authorities deal with the 70 or so
default services that go bust each year quite successfully
default,
default and have done for the past 30 years. 
defaultF
defaultinancial failure at a local level is picked up by local authorities and 
defaultis 
defaultmanaged quite successfully. Southern Cross raised a challenge 
defaultin 
defaultthat when you have a national organisation which goes across
default—
defaultI think, from memory
default—
defaultover 70 local authorities, there is an issue about who takes responsibility and acts to ensure there is a continuity regime in the interests of people who are in those services. As a result of that consultation the CQC was asked if it would take on this responsibility
default,
default and the Care Bill is pr
defaultoviding some responsibilities for
default local authorities in relation to continuity of care at the local level
default,
default and will also ask us to take some financial oversight over between 50 and 60 large
default&#x2011;
defaultscale national groups of adult social care providers. That will be a responsibility that we will take on from April 2015
default,
default so we will spend the period between now and 2015 building both our capacity and 
defaultour 
defaultcapability to take on that responsibility. We do not have those skills in the CQC at the moment.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default That was my next question
default.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultTherefore, either we will 
defaultneed to 
defaultmake some arrangement to buy those skills in from organis
defaultations that do insolvency work—t
defaulthis is not about economics
default but
default about business continuity
default—
defaultor we will need to recruit them. 
defaultT
defaulthe first judgment we need to make is
default:
default what 
defaultare 
defaultthe skills 
defaultthat 
defaultwe need to discharge this responsibility
default? Then we need to ask:
default where are they, do we have them as part of our permanent establishment or do we go to some of the organisations that specialise in this work and have a specific contract with them to act with us and on our behalf?
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYou mentioned Southern Cross, which I was going to mention. There was a complex financial arrangement of selling off their homes and then a leaseback. Are you satisfied that, with the new skills that you have, you would be able to pick up that sort of financial arrangement, given
default—
default 
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultAt the moment, the a
defaultnswer is no. We do not have th
defaulte financial skills that are required and it is highly unlikely that we would want to have them in
default&#x2011;
defaulthouse. These tend to be private equity companies with very complex capital structures. We will require external help to do that.
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default W
defaultill you ever be able to?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultI am not sure we would want to. It is something we will need to debate more in
default&#x2011;
defaulthouse but my gut feel is that we would want to outsource that.
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYes, but you have been given these powers to try and prevent the situation 
defaultfrom 
defaulthappening. My point is that it is a commercial arrangement. How are you ever going to know that people who are in the financial management of care homes are ever going to do this kind of thing
default?
default You will not be able to do that, will you? You would not be able to avoid another Southern Cross
default,
default because you would not be able to look behind their accounts to see that they are doing lease and leaseback procedures
default,
default or that they are in trouble. You are not going to be doing that, are you?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultIt is possible to review some of these companies in terms of those th
defaultat are publicly listed, and so on
default, in terms of their accounts and the robustness of the arrangements.
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultIs that what you will be doing?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThe Sunday newspapers have had three or four stories this year of these big groups that were in some financial difficulty 
defaulteither 
defaultbecause they are overleveraged or 
defaultbecause 
defaulttheir income is insufficient to pay back the loan.
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI am trying to go a bit further and 
defaultbe 
defaultmore robust. You are not going to rely on newspapers.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultNo.
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultHave you got some system in place? I know 
defaultyou are getting it up until 2015
default, but
default—
default 
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultWe will establish a financial monitoring system and the issue is whether we
default—
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default T
defaulto monitor these companies.
defaultDavid Behandefault: —
defaultbuy that in as a return from a specialist company
default,
default or whether we recruit, as David has said. 
defaultA
defaultt the minute 
defaultw
defaulte favour buying this in, but we need to work through the arguments for and against that
default,
default and plot with precision exactly what it is we are asking people to do.
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWould it 
defaultnot 
defaultbe better to put that into 
defaultMonitor? 
defaultIs that really something that you also need to get expertise in?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultCan I answer that in two 
defaultways
default? First, there is a close correlation between a company
default or
default business that has financial problems and poor quality, as we have seen with Southern Cross. 
defaultMa
defaultking the distinction between finance and quality is a false distinction. They are two sides of the same
default—
default 
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultBut the trouble is that is built
default into the regulatory structure. 
defaultWhy is this case an exception?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultIt is built in for health
default 
defaultcare. It is not built in to adult social care. My own personal view is that Monitor and the TDA are very much in the improvement space. We are very much in the 
default“
defaultholding
default&#x2011;
defaultup
default a mirror
default”
default space. That is the way our two organisations will go over time, but I do believe that monitoring quality and financial health are two sides of the same coin.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultIf you look at the history of Southern Cross, what began to happen was they were not able to pay back 
defaulton 
defaultthis complicated loan structure and operating structure that they had. Quality was falling because they could not pay that back so they started skimping on support staff, training and managerial staff. Quality fell even further. 
defaultThere
default was effectively a race to the bottom as the revenues could not 
defaultpay 
defaultback and the quality was suffering. 
defaultThe
default relationship between quality and finance was quite apparent in Southern Cross. 
defaultWhen I did the job in the Department, the question I kept asking myself was, 
default“
defaultWas it possible to predict Southern Cross?
default”
default and then, 
default“
defaultWas it possible to prevent Southern Cross?
default”
default On the basis of the intelligence that people were gathering at that particular point in time, I do not think any one agency would have been able to gather the intelligence together and assemble it in such a way 
defaultas 
defaultto predict that there would have been a failure at Southern Cross. 
defaultW
defaulte need to see whether it is possible
default,
default in a sense
default,
default to put together surveillance metrics which will be about quantity and quality in the way that that market operates
default,
default because the 
defaultrelationship between financial resilience and the quality of services was pretty much established in the way that Southern Cross collapsed. So it is possible, I think, for us, as we have done on healthcare, not to be definitive 
defaultabout 
defaultwhere failure will take place but to ha
defaultve some smoke alarms that cause
default us to ask questions about whether there is sufficient resilience. 
defaultI
defaultf you looked at the external management
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaulthomes
default ratio in somewhere like Southern Cross, they had got very large managers
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaulthomes
default ratios, whereas the better large groups
default—the 
defaultBarchesters
default of this world—have
default very small 
defaultratios of 
defaultexternal
default managers 
defaultto
default 
defaulthomes
default; that means that 
defaultmanagers are there to supervise and support those homes. That was one of the financial compromises in Southern Cross. 
defaultI learned
default from that to ask the question of the large groups, 
default“
defaultWhat 
defaultis your manager
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaulthomes
default ratio? 
defaultIf a home gets into difficulty, do you have sufficient managerial support to get it out of difficulty and support it to provide quality care?
default”
default 
defaultSo there is learning to be extracted from Southern Cross and we need to set up 
defaultthe
default capability and capacity to do it. Whether we own it or buy it, we need to establish that capability 
defaultand 
defaultcapacity
default,
default because we do know that there 
defaultare
default a number of these large groups that are still financially fragile, some of them because they were overleveraged from 2008 but some because they were just fragile.
defaultChair:default 
defaultCharlotte
default wants to ask a question and then Barbara. 
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultThank you. I have a couple of things. First, there have been concerns raised with me that CQC staff are using personal e
default&#x2011;
defaultmail accounts to engage with patients. Is this something that you are aware of
default,
default and what is your policy on such engagement?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultBlimey!
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultGive us the names.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultI think there i
defaults a more specific bit to this—but, n
defaulto, people should not be engaging directly with people from personal e
default&#x2011;
defaultmail accounts. It g
defaultoes back to the accountability of chief inspectors—a point raised
default before you arrived, 
defaultCharlotte
default. The powers that we have as on organisation come from Parliament to the board through the health and social care legislation and the Care Bill
default, and people do not act o
defaultn their own account. They act on behalf of the CQC. T
defaulthat is what their warrant says—
defaultso, no, people should not be e
default&#x2011;
defaultmailing
default patients from their personal e
default&#x2011;
defaultmail accounts. A number of our staff are home workers. In fa
defaultct, all 
defaultour inspectors are home workers, but they should be e
default&#x2011;
defaultmailing
default through a CQC address, not through a personal e
default&#x2011;
defaultmail.
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultThank you. I will see if I can provide you with some more information on that as I get it.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultYes, please.
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultThe second issue is that one of the things holding back the CQC in its mission to
default—
defaultI would not think 
defaultthis
default is too strong a term
default—
defaultreinvent itself from the misdemeanours of the past is the legacy mist
defaultakes that still hang over it, such as n
defaultorth Linco
defaultl
defaultnshire and Morecambe Bay. Is there any move 
defaulttowards, 
defaultor do you think there is any benefit in
default,
default setting up a special investigations unit to look at some of the bigger legacy cases where the CQC did get it dramatically wrong and over which questions still hang?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultYou are talking about a truth and reconcil
defaultiation commission or something. 
defaultWe can learn from the past. For example, when we were doing the new surveillance model we applied that to Morecambe Bay a
defaultnd applied it to Mid Staffs,
default to see whether or not it would pick up those hospitals early enough. We are going to be doing a root
default&#x2011;
defaultcause
default analysis of the problems at the home that was reported 
defaulton 
defaultin the papers on Friday and Saturday, for example. 
defaultT
defaulthat methodology is something that we are very keen to use.
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultBefore I move on, the concerns about personal e
default&#x2011;
defaultmail addresses were raised with me by a member of the public
default,
default who is hoping to provide me with 
defaultsome 
defaultmore information, so I am not in a position to affirm 
defaultwhether 
defaultor not 
defaultthis is actually the case.
default I just wanted to hear your view on the situation 
defaultbefore we
default get more information 
defaulton 
defaultit, if indeed there is any.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultTo add to David
default’
defaults point, 
defaultCharlotte
default—
defaultth
defaultis
default was an earlier question
default—
defaultwe have built some evaluation capacity into the CQC so we can learn from what has gone wrong in the past and from what we are doing now to make sure we are learning these lessons in real time, not historically because something has gone wrong. We have asked 
defaultKeiran
default 
defaultWalshe
default of 
defaultManchester
default business school to do an evaluation of our hospitals inspections wave
defaults
default 1 and 2
default,
default and we know that the Secretary of State has asked that there be an investigation into maternity 
defaultservices at 
defaultMorecambe
default 
defaultBay
default. Of course we will co
default&#x2011;
defaultoperate with that investigation. Dr Bill 
defaultKirkup
default has
default been asked to lead 
defaultthe investigation,
default and as he looks at maternity services in Morecambe Bay, because we have in the past looked at maternity services in Morecam
defaultb
defaulte Bay
default—
defaultthere was an investigation
default—
defaultwe would expect to co
default&#x2011;
defaultoperate with that.  
defaultWe w
defaultill do that both to assi
defaultst in the investigation and
default to continue to be open to any learning that can come to us as well.
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultBut, very briefly, the trouble is that there are victims of exactl
defaulty the practice you want to see—
defaultwhistleblowing
default—
defaultwho are still out of a job
default and
default watching people who they perceive as responsible for some of the problems which they alerted
default us to, who are still very happily in a job
default. What can the CQC do to help these people who have 
defaultbeen shown to have 
defaultwhistleblown
default with good merit
default 
defaultbut 
defaultwho still cannot find a job
default?
default I would like to know who the whistleblowers who have been proven to have saved lives in alerting 
defaultus to 
defaultdangerous practice are applying to for jobs
default,
default and why, if they do not get
default those jobs, they are rejected—
defaulton what grounds
default. T
defaulthen I would like to know what those organisation
defaults
default have to hide
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte have all said 
defaultthat 
defaultif an o
defaultrganisation wants to make sure it does not have mission drift and is serving patient safety—if it is 
defaultan or
defaultganisation with nothing to hide—it 
defaultwould want to employ whistleblowers so that they know exactly what is going on 
defaultat 
defaultthe coal face. What can the CQC do to help 
defaulthere
default?
defaultDavid Priordefault: T
defaulthe culture is changing, 
defaultCharlotte
default, on this. We have taken on 
defaultJames 
defaultTitcombe
default and we have re
default&#x2011;
defaultengaged
default Kay Sheldon on our board, for example. Helene Donnelly,
default who was a nurse at Mid Staffordshire, is now working as an ambassador in another hospital. There is a similar person
default,
default Delilah
default—
defaultI can
default’
defaultt remember her name
default—
defaultwho is a safety ombudsman working at 
defaultBrighton
default. It is starting to happen. One of the things I have learned over the last six months is that, to be a whistleblower, you have to be very brave. I have spoken to a couple of surgeons, for example, alpha male types, whose careers have been severely limited because they expressed concerns about what was going on in their hospitals. How we enable people to raise concerns with us at a much earlier stage, in confidence, is incredibly important
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte have set up a new committee of our board 
defaultto look precisely at this issue. 
defaultI hope that next time we meet we will have done a full audit of our own 
defaultwhistleblowing
default activities 
defaultand
default also 
defaultof 
defaulthow we can encourage other people. We go in to inspect for a day
default,
default or three 
defaultdays, 
defaultonce a year or once 
defaultevery two years sometimes. We need to get continuous flow of information from staff, patients
default,
default residents and carers in between times. That is our best source of information. How we can lower the threshold to enable that information to come to us is critically important.
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default W
defaulte would all welcome the employment of James 
defaultTitcombe
default.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultWe have made a public commitment as well
default,
default in relation to making an assessment of how robust complaints handling is in services as part of our inspection methodology. We have also made 
defaulta 
defaultcommitment to look at how organisations deal with and handle whistleblowers. This week in 
defaultSurrey
default we did have a discussion with a hospital about 
defaultwhistleblowing
default and how they handled it. They provided two examples of 
defaultwhistleblowing
default action that they had received and went on to describe what they had done with it. We came away with a sense of, 
default“
defaultThis is an open organisation that is prepared to talk about these issues and deal with it.
default”
default Without giving our assessment away, we were positive about the way they had dealt with that. We will build into our wave 2 hospital inspections
default—
defaultthe work we will do from January onwards
default—
defaulthow we undertake this. 
defaultAs David said, we have made a real effort at the most senior level to reach out to whistleblowers, whether that is 
defaultthe group in Mid Staffs—
defaultWill Powell, Helene Donnelly and Kim Holt
default—
defaultor a whole range of others that had made contact with us. We have met with them to discuss and try and learn from them about their experiences. We have been fortunate to have the ability to appoint James to come and work with us
default,
default and
default,
default although he is not a whistleblower, 
defaultto 
defaultbuild in 
defaultthe
default dimension that he brings from his work in the nuclear industry
default,
default as well as 
defaultfrom being the
default father of a child who died while receiving services. 
defaultW
defaulte are trying 
defaultnot 
defaultto walk away from the issues about 
defaultwhistleblowing
default but 
defaultto 
defaultbuild 
defaultthem
default into the way that we are developing our inspection. 
defaultW
defaulte are trying 
defaultto 
defaulttake a lead in this and demonstrate why this is important in the way that we move forward. 
defaultW
defaulte will continue to do that
default—
defaultto test and 
defaultto 
defaulttake that forward.
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default I
defaultf you ever feel leant on by a Minister, please can you come and tell us
default?
defaultDavid Priordefault: I do not think that
default Ministers at the moment want to lean on us. They are going the other way
default,
default actually. I think they genuinely want us to be independent
default,
default and that is shared across most people in the House of Commons. 
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default Just on this point about
default whistleblowers, David Prior, you mentioned two alpha male surgeons whose careers have been severely limited. Do you think you have a duty to monitor these two alpha male
defaults—
defaultnot that 
default“
defaultalpha male
default”
default has anything to do with it
default,
default so let us take that out of it
default—these two 
defaultsurgeons whose careers have been severely limited? 
defaultI
defaultt seems that unless we track effectively what has happened to thos
defaulte concerned—
defaultand these are surgeons rather tha
defaultn nurses working in a hospital—
defaultwe will be failing 
defaultin 
defaultour duty of care. What do you say to that?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultIn these cases they have retired and time has gone
default on
default.
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultI did not know that. You did not say that. 
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultThey have retired now
default,
default and this relates back to issues that happened two, three or four years ago. The most chilling phrase that came to my notice after the Franc
defaultis report into Mid Staffs
default was 
defaultfrom 
defaulta very distinguished clinician saying
default,
default 
default“
defaultWhere were the doctors?
default”
default 
defaultW
defaulthere were the doctors? For years this dreadful care went on and no doctor put his head 
defaultabove the parapet. Why is that? In part
default,
default the answer is, I am afraid, that they are frightened. Even if you are an alpha male surgeon, you are frightened. We might well say that is not good enough, but that is the situation. 
defaultW
defaulte have to be absolutely sure when we do an inspection that hospi
defaulttals have proper 
defaultwhistleblowing
default—raising concern—
defaultprocedures within the hospital, that the culture in that hospital is open and that there is good clinical engagement. But we also have to have that safety net, which is that we need to be available to people like that at a much earlier stage
default,
default so that they can ring us up, get in touch with us and that can precipitate an inspection.
defaultDavid Behandefault: Could I add that 
defaultI think 
defaultthat 
defaultwhat Francis said was about the im
defaultportance of listening to people?
default The big issue about 
defaultwhistleblowing
default is that 
defaultthere
default is a failure to listen. The fact that people feel they need to 
defaultwhistleblow
default means that the system internally is not listening, so part of our inspections and the assessment tha
defaultt
default we make is 
defaultabout 
defaulthow open the hospital
default—or the service or care home—is 
defaultto listening to the concerns that people are raising internally
default,
default as well as 
defaultabout 
defaulthow whistleblowers 
defaultare 
defaulthandled. That will be part of what we do. So it is not just about 
defaultwhistleblowing
default: it is about how concerns are raised, listened to and dealt with.
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultIt is, but
default,
default since you have come back to it, it is also about organisations closing ranks so tightly that if anybody steps out of line they are finished
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthis is a kind of Mafia code
default—
defaultOmertà
default comes to mind
default—
defaultwhere
default,
default if you do anything against the status quo of the organisation, you are finished. That surely is something that has to be broken.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultIt is. You have to recognise that we are tribal people. We all have our tribes
default—
defaultclinicians, hospitals, the CQC and the House of Commons 
defaultall 
defaulthave their tribes
default—
defaultand one tends to be quite defensive about one
default’
defaults tribe, but we need to break those walls down. I completely agree with you.
defaultChair:default 
defaultRather than going into the metaphysics of tribalism, we will go on to Barbara.
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultIndeed, but I feel a need to express an alternative view to that we have just heard
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthere is a view on our side of the House that Health Ministers just want to hold the whole of the NHS at 
defaultsuch 
defaulta distance 
defaultthat
default nothing would be their responsibility at all
default.
default I think there is a happy medium. So
default there are two views of that. 
defaultCan we move on to specialist inspection teams? Your inspectors were recruited
default,
default largely
default,
default years ago to service a generic model of inspection, but in their evidence to us the Relatives &amp; Residents Association say that they remain concerned that recruitment of expertise in the care of older people in residential and nursing care is still thin on the ground. They would like to see you publish data on the number and range of experts and specialists that you have recruited or that you intend to recruit. They say
default—
defaultI do not know where they get this from
default—
defaultthat their intelligence is that specialist teams for care homes are not yet fully in place. You might want to comment on your recent skil
defaultls audit about work force 
defaultchallenges and what training is still needed to transfer inspectors into those specialist teams.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultSince last year we have not been recruiting any inspecto
defaultrs unless they have a health or a 
defaultcare background. 
defaultW
defaulte have not been recruiting generic inspectors for a good period of time. We are committed to introducing our restructured organisation where people will be organised on a specialist basis by 1 April next year, so we will begin that process of restructuring and moving from the current model we have of people being organised geographically and generically into our specialist model. That is a huge change. 
defaultA
defaultll 2,000 people in this organisation will change their role. 
defaultWe are also committed in our hospital, adult social care and primary medical services inspections that inspections will not be carried out by single inspectors. Inspection has ceased to become an individual pursuit and has become a team pursuit. The team will have our inspectors
default,
default who will come from 
defaulta 
defaulthealth or 
defaulta 
defaultcare background
default,
default and people from the field. 
defaultI
defaultf it is in adult social care and we are going in to look at a service for people with autism, I would expect that that team would have somebody who has some experience and knowledge of autism, whether they are employed by the CQC or 
defaultwhether 
defaultwe need to br
defaulting somebody in from outside 
defaultthe service to make sure that they have that specialist background. That is what we are committed to and have set 
defaultout. “
defaultA Fresh Start
default”—
defaultthe document we published last week
default—went in and
default explained this
default,
default 
defaultand began to set i
defaultt out. I hope that the 
defaultissues that  the 
defaultRelatives &amp; Residents Association have put in their evidence to you 
defaulthave been
default 
defaultaddressed by what we have set out in
default 
default“
defaultA Fresh Start
default” as to 
defaulthow we intend to take that forward
default.
default 
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultDo you still need an extensive recruitment programme, or how extensive would it be, to make sure that you have enough experienced and even senior specialist inspectors? A secondary point is
default:
default will it be necessary to replace people and will there be redundancies as part of that process? Do you still have 
defaulta fair amount to do? That 
default2,000 is a lot of people to change roles. 
defaultTo what extent 
defaultwill you have to recruit people specifically into certain senior or very specialist roles?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThere will be a mixture. We have a significant proportion of our staff 
defaultthat
default have a health and care background. The issue, though, is not what the background
default is—
defaultjust to play on this point that David was making about tribalism
default. J
defaultust as important a question is, 
default“
defaultHow long is it since you practised?
default”
default I hold my social work registration but actually it is 30
default&#x2011;
defaultodd years since I practised as a social worker, so I would not claim that I can actually go in and assess, with the detail, the practice of today
default’
defaults social workers in the same way
default as I once could
default. 
defaultT
defaulthe issue is about how 
defaultwe
default get contemporary knowledge. This is why we are building inspection teams in both health and care where we have inspectors that come from a professional background
default,
default but they will be accompanied by people who are currently active in their practice. 
defaultL
defaultast week at 
defaultBarking, Havering and Redbridge
default, as part of my time there
default,
default I went round the accident and emergency service with a nurse who is currently in practice
default,
default and her contemporary knowledge about what current practice should be assisted in us arriving at 
defaulta judgment 
defaultabout the quality of that service. So it is not just about what your background 
defaultis, 
defaultbut how contemporary your knowledge is as well.
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultWill 
defaultthat mean you will still have an
default 
defaultextensive recruitment programme? People’s
default concern
default—this has been raised 
defaultin earlier hearings that we have had with you and 
defaultin 
defaultthis one, and it might be out of date
default,
default but they expressed it
default—
defaultwas about care homes and nursing homes. I understand that you 
defaulthave 
defaultprobably picked up for your hospital inspections
default,
default but that is not going to help when it comes to inspecting nursing homes, is it?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultIt is
default,
default because I want nurses going into nursing homes 
defaultwho
default have contemporary experience, not people who were nurses 15 years ago. People
default’
defaults registration is an important part of their professional identity. That is why I think over 90% of the nurses we employ in the CQC have maintained their professional registration
default—
defaultbecause they draw their professional identity 
defaultfrom
default it. They have invested their time and energy in maintaining their registration. In future I want us to support those individuals to continue to keep their registration live. But if you were a nurse 12 years ago, 
defaultit
default becomes an issue about whether that is sufficiently contemporary knowledge in terms of current nursing practices. 
defaultW
defaulte want to ensure
default—
defaultthis is my point about inspection ceas
defaulting
default to be an individual pursuit and becom
defaulting
default a 
defaultteam pursuit
default—
defaultthat we have a mixture of people who know inspection and regulation
default,
default so if enforcement action is required they know how to do that. But they will do their inspections with experts by experience
default—
defaultpeople who have used services
default, 
defaultand clinical and professional experts. Those clinical and professional experts will bring contemporary knowledge of current standards of practice.
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultI still do not quite get the sense of how far through the process you are, though. You are targeting 1 April. Are you 30% or 50% through the recruitment?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultWhat we have said, Barbara, is that we will begin to make our changes in relation to adult social care
default—
defaultto stick on this
default aspect—
defaultfrom April next year. 
defaultW
defaulte are now beginning the restructuring of the CQC so that from 1 April next year we have specialist teams
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte will have managers and inspectors working 
defaultto
default Mike Richards in relation to h
defaultealth care 
defaultinspection
default—
defaulthospitals, m
defaultental health, community health and 
defaultambulances
default—
defaultand inspectors 
defaultand managers 
defaultworking to Andrea who will undertake the 25,000 inspections of residential and domiciliary care. Those inspectors will go out
default—
default 
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default I am fine on the process,
default but it is a question about numbers. Is it that you have not started yet because you have
default—
default 
defaultDavid Behandefault: No,
default because we are going to begin that from April next year, so we are planning to deliver that. But on our residential and domiciliary care inspections we do have professional experts going out. 
defaultT
defaulto answer specifically, if there is a medicines management issue within a care home, we would ask a pharmacist to be part of the inspection team in a care home.
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultBut they are not full
default&#x2011;
defaulttime staff of the CQC. They are additional
default—
default 
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultSome are. We have pharmacists. We employ over 30 pharmacists 
defaultwho
default will go out on pharmacy inspections.
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultPerhaps you could send us an answer later, but the question is how far you have gone through this? What is the scale of the challenge? How extensive a recruitment programme is going to be required? Perhaps if it is difficult to formulate
default—
default 
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThis is in process. I am not being evasive here. We are not going round and round, to use one of your earlier phrases. We are moving an organisation from where it was to where it needs to be
default,
default and that will take time.
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultCould you send us a note of how far through you are
default,
default because that is all I am asking? 
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultI will send you a note on our milestones and where we expect to be on health
default 
defaultcare, adult social care and general practice.
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultI am fine with the process, but I do not have a feel for where you are on the path.
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI want t
defaulto follow up on what Barbara is saying,
default because I cannot hold in my
default hand exactly how many you need.
default 
defaultY
defaultou must have done a cost analysis of how many extra staff you need. You have all these teams going round, so you must have an idea of how many you are going to recruit.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultYes, we do have that. We have a model of, taking our inspection programme
default—
default 
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultHow many is that?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultWe currently have 955 inspectors and we calculate we will need about 1
default,
default100 inspectors.
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultSo have you asked for more money from the Department?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThis year, 2013
default&#x2011;
default14, we have an additional £20 million that has been made available to us.
defaultQ80 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultJust for these
default inspections
default.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultIt is partly on a recurrent and some on a non
default&#x2011;
defaultrecurrent
default basis
default,
default and there is a commitment that next year we will get £29 million available to us as we build towards this new inspection process.
defaultQ81 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultSo what is
default t
defaulthe balance between the two
default—
defaultthe 
defaultre
defaultcurrent and the non
default&#x2011;
defaultrecurrent
default? Presumably you mean you buy in the experts
default,
default like the pharmacist or the nurse that you do not have.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThat is right.
defaultQ82 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultSo they are on an agency or consultancy basis.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ83 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultHow much would they charge you for doing an inspection
default,
default or how much would you pay them?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultAt the minute
default—for 
defaultthe 
default18
default that we are doing on wave 1
default—
defaultthere are no charges being levied: people are giving their time and assisting us without any charges.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultCan I add
default,
default in answer to Barbara
default’
defaults point
default,
default that we are now recruiting, for example, in adult social ca
defaultre, four deputy chief inspectors?
default We hope they will be in place by January. We then will need to recruit, as David said, probably between 150 and 200 more inspectors
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat new recruitment campaign will start early in the new year.
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultPerhaps we need you to send us a note, if it is clear. It is just that I was not getting a sense of it
default,
default apart from the process. I was hearing the process but not the numbers. 
defaultWe need the break
defaultdown of the numbers as well.
defaultQ84 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI am staggered that in an organisation of your size you do not know how much it is going to cost. You have asked for more money.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultWe do know what it is going to cost. We have a three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear pla
defaultn. We have only just recruited 
defaultAndrea Sutcliffe and Steve Field
default, who have
default been with us for two weeks. We want them to be part of developing the detail of this plan, but we do have a three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear indicative plan
default,
default and we have the financials and the numbers of people that we think we will need, but we are just nailing down the details with the new chief inspectors. 
defaultQ85 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYes. You must have had that
default,
default because otherwise you would not have been able to ask for more money. But I am just trying to work out on what basis you are going to buy in the expertise.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultA lot of the inspectors will be employed inspectors
default,
default but we will have a big bank of people
default—
defaultclinicians, experts
default—
defaultwho we will draw down as and when we require them.
defaultQ86 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default One final detail, so as 
defaultnot to lose it, is that I did ask whether there would be redundancies. From your generalist staff, do you think there are people that you will have to let go?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultThere may be some people who do not make the move.
defaultQ87 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultBut 
defaultsome 
defaultpeople are 
defaultthere 
defaultalready, are they
default not?
default 
defaultYo
defaultu have made some redundancy payments, have you not?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultOn the senior team, yes. The previous senior team have gone, some on redundancies and some because they went to do other things.
defaultQ88 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWhat is the total cost of the redundancy payments? 
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThere were various redundancies. I think in total it was about £800,000 over a two or three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear period.
defaultQ89 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI want to go back to the inspectors. I think you had already been moving towards the specialist inspectors before the chief inspectors came in
default,
default and I was not sure from our last accountability hearing, Mr Behan, whether you were in favour of this. I do not think you were in place, Mr Prior. Could you set out what your view is, please? I know you have to work within the system, but it seems to me
default 
defaultthat you now have another
default, additional,
default layer of deputy chief inspectors
default.
default 
defaultA
defaultre there then going to be the deputies to the deputies? How much further down are you going to go in these bureaucratic layers?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultI was absolutely clear on coming into this job that the generic model did not work and we needed to move away from it and to specialist inspections.
defaultQ90 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default Y
defaultou were working towards that, I think, yes.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThat is what I set out a
defaultt the interview for the job. I 
defaultwanted to be absolutely clear that if they gave me the job they knew exactly how I was going to do it, and that was to reintroduce specialism. It is not tenable
default,
default for me
default,
default that you can go round A and E with somebody who is not clinically qualified to judge it. It is just not tenable. My dad would not understand that, quite frankly, and therefore we needed to change it.
defaultQ91 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI think you have misunderstood what I a
defaultm trying to say, as to initially
default when you first came to the job. Nobody thinks you are going round to individual organisations asking them about it. Obviously you are going to have inspectors doing it, however 
defaultyou organise it.
default 
defaultThis 
defaultprocess has been going on for a while anyway, so I am just saying that at our last accountability hearing none of us had the idea that chief inspectors were going to be put in place
default,
default and now we hear that there are deputy chief inspectors. I am 
defaultjust 
defaultwondering when the process is going to stop.
default 
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultTo come to your question, 
default“H
defaultave we been modelling the numbers we have
default got
default?
default”—y
defaultes, we have. 
defaultTaking
default adult social care, we have been planning that each adult social care inspection will probably have one or two inspectors. They will have an expert by experience and a specialist. That specialist might be a pharmacist or somebody with knowledge of dementia services, 
defaultdepending on what the service i
defaults. The numbers will depend on the size of the home. There are some homes that have 180 beds and some 
defaultthat 
defaulthave 16 beds. 
defaultT
defaulthe size of the team, 
defaultand so on
default, will need to flex. We think a typical inspection, from preparation and inspection to report writing, should take between three and five days. We have taken those assumptions, multiplied by 17,500 residential, 8,000 domiciliary
default—
defaultwe have done exactly the same on hospital inspections in terms of the numbers, the amount of time that we will spend
default—
defaultand that is what we are using as our financial model to drive the numbers of the inspectors 
defaultand 
defaultmanagers that we will need to support and oversee that work
default.
default 
defaultWe have done 
defaultexactly the same on primary medical services. So we think we will need about 2,700 staff in the future to discharge our responsibilities. If you just move by a fraction whether we visit once every two years or once a year, that changes those numbers quite dramatically. 
defaultW
defaulte have a model which we can flex based on that, so arriving at the cost is literally the work we are doing in real time now
default—
defaultbut we worked with the Department last year about our changing model and they made an additional £20 million available to us for this year
default,
default which is sufficient for us for this year. 
defaultT
defaulthe assumptions that we made this time last year
default—
defaultto come back to what has changed between now and the last time we were here
default—is that 
defaultwe thought we 
defaultwould 
defaultdo intensive inspections of only 70 hospitals when we planned the resource
default,
default and we are now going to do intensive inspections of all hospitals
default.
default That means the resource requirement is larger rather than smaller. That is why the numbers have changed since last year. 
defaultI am fully supportive of having specialist teams under the chief inspectors to take this forward. Steve Field
default—
defaultI think David has already alluded to this
default—
defaultwill have a deputy chief inspector who will be responsible for looking at integrated services, looking at people
default’
defaults care careers, particularly for those people who are using health and care services
default,
default so we are not just looking at the individual services but at people
default’
defaults experiences. 
defaultQ92 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultDon
default’t get me wrong—
defaultI think you need people to do the job
default—
defaultbut I was 
defaultjust 
defaultwondering why there is another layer of management. It is really the people on the ground that you need, the people who are going round doing the inspections. But obviously you have not built in, if 
defaultsomeone gets 
defaulta good rating, anything for additional inspections.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultYes, we have.
defaultQ93 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYou have, okay. So why do you think th
defaultat
default frequency o
defaultf inspection will not add value?
default I think you have said that, haven
default’
defaultt you
default—
defaultthat if you do it more f
defaultrequently it will not add value?
default Or do you not think that?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultWe will be visiting
default and
default inspecting the homes that are not good more frequently than the ones that are good
default,
default because we feel they need to be inspected more often. So they do add value, we think, yes.
defaultQ94 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultSo I suppose the feeling is, 
default“What happens in between?”
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultBetween inspections, 
defaultdo 
defaultyou mean
default?
defaultQ95 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultIf you have a 
default“
defaultgood
default”
default and then there are five years before you go back and
default—
default 
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultNo. We got a very clear message from our consultation that five years is out
default.
default 
defaultN
defaultobody is interested in anything being on a five
default&#x2011;
defaultyear frequency. The support was for three years or less
default—b
defaultut David referred earlier to our intelligent monitoring function. This is the announcement that will be made on the 24th in relation to the next wave of inspections. In order to 
defaultmake sure we are inspecting th
defaulte places that have the highest risk, we have deve
defaultloped a surveillance scheme—“
defaultintelligent monitoring
default”
default is 
defaulthow we are describing it—of 150 
defaultquantitative indicators
default:
default mortality rates, hospital readmission rates
default and other indicators
default, alongside qualitative information
default such as
default staff satisfactio
defaultn, patient satisfaction surveys and the number of complaints.
default 
defaultW
defaulte will use that intelligent monitoring tool continually through the period between inspections
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultf we think there is an increase in, say, patient dissatisfaction, that might be a smoke alarm that causes us to ask questions of the service such as, 
default“
defaultAre things deteriorating here? Do we need to come back?
default”
default There may be a critical incident
default—
defaulta never event or an untoward incident
default—
defaultthat means we need to go back and do a reactive inspection because there is a worry in that alert, in that nomination. I think this is behind the Chair
default’
defaults point about patient safety alerts
default—
defaultmaking sure that they are coming through in real time and that we assess whether there is any risk
default,
default and perhaps 
defaultgo 
defaultand do further inspections 
defaultas a
default result of that. 
defaultO
defaultur assumptions about
default inspection frequencies of, say, two years
default 
defaultare on the basis that people
default continue to improve and maintain the quality and standards of care. I
defaultf we saw 
defaultdeterioration through the monitoring of those hospitals, one of our reactions could be to trigger a reactive inspection to go back and look at that, whether that is of the whole organisation or just of a particular service.  
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThank you.
defaultChair:default 
defaultDavid 
defaultTredinnick
default has been very patient once again.
defaultQ96 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultMay I return to the ratings system, which has already had some 
defaultthought applied to it earlier
default? Are yo
defaultu not trying to square a circle—
defaultthat might be im
defaultpossible to do—
defaultin providing a ratings system which has an appeal to the general public but at the same time has to be used by health commissioners who must make detailed decisions about various aspects of service provision?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultAre you talking about the hospitals?
defaultQ97 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultYes. You are really trying to address two audiences, are you not? You are trying to give confidence to the general public and also trying to provide enough information for commissioners and people who are in authority in the health service to make proper decisions based on your inspections.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultI do not think it is a circle that needs squaring. I think it is a circle. It is true that commissioners might want more detailed information than members of the public, but wait till you have seen some of our inspection reports, David, and see what you think of them. I think they will address both issues.
defaultQ98 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultWe have seen, in looking at food standards and other standards generally, that the easiest system for the public to understand is the traffic light: you have a green light for 
default“
defaultgood
default”
default and 
default“
defaultoutstanding
default”
default, then, using your proposed hospital ratings, obviously you would have an amber light for 
default“
defaultrequires improvement
default”
default and a red light for 
default“
defaultinadequate
default”
default. Have 
defaultyou thought about putting a traffic
default&#x2011;
defaultlight
default symbol on the front of your reports to make it crystal clear what you feel at first sight?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultFor hospitals, we have adopted the 
defaultOfsted
default terminology, if you like, of 
default“
defaultoutstanding
default”
default, 
default“
defaultgood
default”
default, 
default“
defaultrequires improvement
default”
default and 
default“
defaultinadequate
default”
default, which are pretty well understood by people. That is where we are with hospitals.
defaultQ99 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultYou misunderstand me, if I may say so. I am saying use the 
defaultOfsted
default ratings but put colour coding on
default, so that people
default can look at it and see
default: if it is “
defaultinadequate
default” it has a red lamp, if it “requires improvement” it has an
default amber 
defaultlamp, 
defaultand 
defaultif it is “
defaultgood
default”
default 
defaultit has 
defaulta green 
defaultlight
default. 
defaultT
defaulthat is very understandable
default.
default 
defaultC
defaultoming many years ago from an advertising background, we would always try to encapsulate what we were trying to 
defaultsay in not more than a sentence—hopefully in a phrase—or 
defaultwith a symbol.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultIf it helps, Ch
defaultair, in our literature to date—our consultation documents—
defaultoutstanding was blue, good was green, requires improvement was amber and inadequate was red
default,
default in the way that we have actually described this, so that pl
defaultays exactly to your point about
default aligning a colour to the descriptor
default,
default and that is what we will do. But on a four
default&#x2011;
defaultrate
default scheme we needed to bring blue in.
defaultQ100 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultThank you for that. Have you started to think about how the rating system can meet the Government
default’
defaults objective of one that can quickly 
default“
defaultrespond and reflect new information about a provider
default’s performance”
default?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultWe do think that the rating system will be an assessment of a provider
default’
defaults performance across a range of services. So ratings will follow an inspection. They will be made on a four
default&#x2011;
defaultpoint
default scale. We will give them a level that is meaningful to t
defaulthe public, at trust—and at service—
defaultlevel. We will rate
default—
defaultthis is where a lot of our effort is going at the minute
default—
defaultsafety, effectiveness, how caring 
defaultand 
defaultresponsive 
defaulta service
default is and how well led it is. We think the primary audience for ratings 
defaultis
default indeed the public. We would expect hospitals to be looking at more data in more detail than we will look at
default,
default because we expect them to know their own story about their effectiveness. We also think that ratings are something that providers can appeal against: people need the right to come back to us in relation to the ratings
default,
default and that is how we are setting up the approach that we are making to ratings.
defaultQ101 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultHave you identified any services where you believe 
defaultthat 
defaultit would be inappropriate to provide a rating?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultI am not aware of that, no.
defaultQ102 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultFinally, the CQC plans to introduce the same ratings scale for hospitals and social care providers, but 
defaultProfessor Nigel Sparrow
default has said 
defaultthat 
defaultGP practices will not be given a single overall rating. Won
default’
defaultt this inconsistency ultimately prove confusing to patients and the public? So could not having two different systems sow the seeds of confusion in the future? Is that something you should address?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultI am not aware of where Nigel has said that.
defaultQ103 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultWould you agree that it would be sensible to go and have a look at what he said there? 
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultOf course. Nigel works for us, so we will think about what he is saying and we have brought Steve Field in to lead this work. I am not wanting to deflect this in any way, but there was
default—
default 
defaultQ104 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultI am trying to be helpful. I am in a sense throwing you 
defaultan
default opt
default&#x2011;
defaultout
default clause right now for you to say, 
default“
defaultI will go away and look at it.
default”
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultI will take it 
defaultaway 
defaultthen
default, and beat a retreat. 
defaultWe know broadly how we are going to approach ratings in relatio
defaultn to hospitals. We will issue something
default before December in relation to this. Andrea is leading the work on the design of the ratings around adult social care
default,
default and the framework we will use will keep these four descriptors, the four categories. Steve will lead that work on how we rate primary medical services as well
default—
defaultso again, at the risk of saying that we are still in a process, I come back to the point that we will do these in an order. We cannot do everything at the same time. I make no apology for that, but we will build our approach to it and our endeavour is to have a consistent approach to ratings.
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultThank you.
defaultChair:default 
defaultAndrew, you have been even more patient.
defaultQ105 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultYes, I have been patient. 
defaultOn the subject 
defaultof ratings
default—
defaultand then I have another question as well
default—
defaultI know the 
defaultOfsted
default regime quite well, being a school teacher, and when we have an 
defaultOfsted
default inspection the school is required to write to all parents. It got a bit silly at one point and we had to write to
default the pupils, which was a bit odd—
defaultwriting to six
default&#x2011;
defaultyear
default&#x2011;
defaultolds
default. Is
default that going to be a requirement?
default 
defaultO
defaultbviously for a hospital it is a bit more complicated, but for a care home is that going to be a requirement, explaining what the inspection has said, what it means for
default 
defaultresidents and what the improvement plan is going to be?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultWe had a meeting with 
defaultOfsted
default on this very subject last week. I like the idea of doing that
default,
default and I think we are going to consider writing to residents of a care home, for example, telling them in words of plain English, 
default“
defaultThis is what we have found.
default”
defaultQ106 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultFollowing on from that, schools got very good at predicting
default—
defaultand perhaps even fiddling
default—
defaulttheir way through 
defaultOfsted
default inspections and doing certain things when 
defaultthey were 
defaultbeing inspected that would not ordinarily occur in our schools. Certainly I saw that in
default my old school. When we were “
defaultOfsteded
default” things were very different—the entire regime was different—from
default how I ever recognised the school. Sure enough, the day after the inspectors left hell was let loose yet again and everything returned to normal. How are you going to ensure that we do not have people acting up, as it were, predicting the regime and then responding, accordingly, to, in some cases
default—
defaultand it is a minority of cases, I would hope
default—fiddle
default their way through?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultThe best way of answering that is that we are going to a professional judgment
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default system, not a compliance
default,
default tick
default&#x2011;
defaultbox
default system. The people making the judgment will be experienced clinicians when they go into a hospital, for example. It is much more difficult to game those sorts of people. Also the surveillance model that we have used has over 150 indicators in it. They are not capab
defaultle of being gamed in a way that 
defaultfive or six 
defaultmay be
default. But I recognise exactly what you 
defaultare 
defaultsay
defaulting
default. 
defaultY
defaultou do raise a good point, though, and it is worth saying to this Committee that inspection is not the whole game on this. If you think that we are the guarantor and deliver
defaulter of high
default&#x2011;
defaultquality
default standards, that just
default is not the case. We 
defaulthave to rely upon clinicians, 
defaultboards and 
defaultcommissioners as well as 
defaulton ourselves.
default If you are looking to us solely to deliver high
default-
defaultquality care in 
defaultBritain
default, you will be disappointed.
defaultQ107 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultWhen you identify failure
default 
defaultin the school context you have a governing body which has parent representatives on it
default,
default who are charged with running the school. Obviously in a private care home you do not have that
default,
default so I think it is important that you 
defaulthave 
defaultsome system of engaging families and residents
default,
default where possible
default,
default whenever there is an inadequacy found
default,
default to ensure that there is regular communication with them as to how that is being addressed. 
defaultT
defaulthat is not really a question but more of a comment, unless I add, 
default“
defaultDon
default’
defaultt you agree?
default”
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultI do agree. 
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThis is why in this document we set out that one of the things we want to do is put the views and experience of people using services at the heart of what we do. That raises an issue about unannounced inspections, 
defaultabout 
defaulthow you can get relatives
default’
default comments in before an unannounced inspection. Therefore, one of the things we are looking at is how 
defaultwe 
defaultcan give short notice of an inspection, 
defaultwhich I think is what 
defaultOfsted
default do—
defaultthat was per
defaulthaps your experience—
defaultand/or how 
defaultwe 
defaultmight return after an initial inspection
default,
default where we do the unannounced bit and look at what it was like, and 
defaultthen go back and 
defaultcreate an opportunity to meet with families, carers and people who might not have been available during an inspection
default,
default to ask them how they have experienced care. 
defaultW
defaulte are thinking about how we can flex our approach to do that. 
defaultThinking about t
defaulthe last care home I was in
default—this is
default going back to your question, Valerie, about why we need more than one inspector in a care home
default—
defaultit is not possible to be a single inspector in 
defaulta 
defaultcare home. Somebody needs to be speaking to the staff and looking at the systems and processes. 
defaultR
defaultelatives and residents will be in
default,
default and it is important that somebody spends time speaking to 
defaultthem
default about how they experience it, not just when they are visiting, but we need to create the opportunity to speak to them outside of an inspection. This is particularly the issue about domiciliary care
default,
default where we are not attending somebody
default’
defaults own home when they are receiving personal intimate care. 
defaultW
defaulte need to think creatively and laterally about how we are going to look at that. 
defaultThere
default 
defaultare
default the same issues in relation to community healthcare
default.
default 
defaultA
default lot of our methodologies are built on being able to observe care, which is where 
defaultOfsted
default are, but of course a lot of care is not delivered in an observable set of circumstances and situations. 
defaultP
defaultersonal care 
defaulttakes place 
defaultin somebody
default’
defaults own home
default,
default and how we assess the quality of that is something that we need to work through. Remember, there are 8,000 domiciliary care agencies delivering care to individuals in their own home
defaults
default. 
defaultB
defaulty definition, it is not in an organisation like a hospital, a care home or a school
default,
default 
defaultso it
default requires different approaches. 
defaultQ108 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYou are not considering cameras.
defaultDavid Priordefault: That is
default part of the consultation. There are circumstances where, for example, we had real concerns 
defaultabout
default abuse going on. There are, of course, human rights, confidentiality and dignity issues, but there may be some circumstances where we would wish to use covert cameras.
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultI should say, for the record, having accused schools of gaming the system to pass 
defaultOfsted
default,
default that when I was rated 
default“
defaultgood
default”
default it was thoroughly deserved
default—
default just to make that clear. 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultAnd you will never work there again.
defaultQ109 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultI did get a 
default“
defaultsatisfactory
default”
default for geography but that was not my subject anyway
default—“W
defaultasn
default’t my fault, governor.”  
defaultOn registration, obviously there is going to be 
defaultjoint registration or joint licensing with Monitor. W
defaulthat are the practical implications for you and your registration process 
defaultin 
defaultimplementing this joint licensing arrangement with Monitor?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultDo you want to answer this
default, David
default? I think the issue is that Monitor will not enable somebody to become a foundation trust unless they have had a proper inspection from us. So it is not a joint licensing situation. They are licensed by Monitor but they only get the licence if they have had a good inspection from us.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultBut we are setting a tougher test around registration m
defaultore generally. This is post-
defaultWinterbourne 
defaultView, 
defaultas well. 
defaultW
defaulte are looking, as David has said, 
defaultat
default how
default,
default for foundation trust status
default,
default Monitor can take our assessments of the quality of the service, and we have said we will do
default that through a full inspection.
default 
defaultT
defaulthey will not award foundation trust status to any organisation unless it has a good
default,
default or better
default,
default rating from the CQC. 
defaultI
defaultf a hospital gets an inadequate or poor rating, it will not proceed through to foundation trust status. That is how we have set that up.
defaultQ110 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultIn terms of registration for the system and the fit and proper person test, there is not going to be an application or an approval process through 
defaultthe 
defaultCQC, is there, for somebody to be designated as a fit and proper person?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultI am sorry, 
defaultbut 
defaultwill you ask that again to make sure I have 
defaultgot the question
default? 
defaultQ111 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultThe fit and proper person test which is coming in
default means that 
defaultan individual who sits on a board or who is a respo
defaultnsible person in an institution
default has to comply with 
defaultthat 
defaulttest
default—b
defaultut I am thinking of other examples. For example, I was chair of licensing in our local authority for 10 years
default,
default and people were designated premises supervisors
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe only way they could hold a licence for the premises to operate 
defaultwas
default if 
defaultthey
default were a designated premises supervisor
default,
default and 
defaultthey 
defaulthad to apply to receive 
defaulttheir
default designated premises supervisor authorisation
default.
default 
defaultW
defaultithout that, obviously, the licensed premise
defaults
default could not operate. For this fit and proper person test, there is not an application 
defaultprocess
default for somebody to be deemed to be a fit and proper person, so how do you test the test? Are you relying on somebody coming forward and raising concerns about a trust board chairman
default,
default or a private health
default 
defaultcare
default organisation’
defaults board membership? Are you relying on people to come forward in that situation?
defaultDavid Behandefault: Regulations will be 
defaultrequire
defaultd
default 
defaultfor this 
defaultto be taken forward
default, and as
default I understand the way the regulations
default 
defaultare being established
default,
default in terms of 
defaulta
default hospital trust, it will be for the chair of the trust to determine that the people being appointed to that board are fit and proper people. They 
defaultmust 
defaultpass that test.
defaultQ112 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultWho regulates the regulator? Who ensures that the chairman fulfils that test? Presumably they have to fu
defaultlfil the fit and proper person 
defaulttest
default as well
default.
default 
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThey will be appointed by the Secretary of State.
defaultQ113 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultBut if there is a concern
default, then,
default you are not directly responsible, or you do not think you will be, because there is no approvals process. 
defaultDavid Behandefault: T
defaulthe regulations govern
defaulting
default this will need to be 
defaultrevised to ensure that specific 
defaultchecks are undertaken prior to directors being appointed to the board. That information needs to be made available to us. 
defaultW
defaulthen we inspect we need to assess that the appointments are of fit and proper people.
defaultQ114 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultBut if there is a concern raised
default,
default and that comes directly to you as opposed to, say, a trust board, will you have the power to remove somebody?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultI do not know. I will need to come back to you on that. The legislation and the regulations are just being drafted.
defaultQ115 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultI am thinking 
defaultabout 
defaulthow that work
defaults out
default practically. It i
defaults a great test to have in place,
default but there 
defaulthas to be
default proper monitoring of it
default.
default I am guessing 
defaultthat 
defaultin a hospital trust situation you would not expect there to be a problem
default,
default because there is so much transparency in terms of
default who are the accountable people and
default what is 
defaultthe accountable body, 
defaultbut 
defaultwith 
defaulta privately
default&#x2011;
defaultrun
default care home, is it clear who the fit and proper person test needs to apply to
default?
default 
defaultH
defaultow do you, as a lot of these people may not necessarily be well known
default, either to
default users of the service or to yourselves
default—
default 
defaultDavid Priordefault: L
defaultying behind the purpose of this is that there have been a number of care homes w
defaulthere we found problems, they have
default been deregistered
default,
default and 
defaultthen 
defaultthe same people have cropped up again
default,
default setting up a new home. That is why, when they come up for new registration, we can apply the fit and proper test.
defaultQ116 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default But how do you know, though, i
defaultf they do it through somebody else
default?
default 
defaultW
defaulte know there are various mechanisms by which people can shade their involvement, particularly in a private company
default. 
defaultIt is the robustness of that test in those circums
defaulttances that I do not understand—
defaultunless someone comes forward and alerts 
defaultyou—
defaultbecause there is not a required application process.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultYes. We are not a licensing authority in the way that you would have experienced in a local authority
default,
default where the local authority does act as a licensor.
defaultQ117 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThey would be directors of the limited company, would they not, so yo
defaultu could get them under directors’
default disqualification
default?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultWhere they are directors, yes.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultPerhaps we need to come back to you on that.
defaultQ118 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default A
default negative approvals process is what you envisage.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultYou have 
defaultgot it, Stephen. Yes,
default it is.
defaultQ119 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThe assumption will be that somebody is fit and proper unless it can be demonstrated that they are not. There will not be a register of fit and 
defaultproper people from which
default directors can be drawn. Is that correct?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultCan we come back to you on this
default,
default to ma
defaultke sure we are absolutely right? 
defaultThis is tied up in the drafting of the Care Bill
default,
default the amendments that are being made and the 
defaultregulations that need to be laid
default. 
defaultWe will send you a note, Chair, setting
default out our understanding of this. In addition to the fit and proper person test, we have committed to having a more rigorous approach to registration, particularly for care homes and private health
default 
defaultcare services. Winterbourne View was a private hospital; it was not a care home. The issue there was ensuring that we have a rigorous test of those peo
defaultple who
default sat behind Winterbourne View
default,
default to make sure that they were taking their responsibilities around quality seriously. If you remember, the staff of Winterbourne View were convicted and a number were imprisoned
default, but the 
defaultpeople 
defaultwho
default sat behind the organisation were not
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthis strengthening of registration allows us to hold people 
defaultwho
default sit behind the service provision to account for the way that they are promoting quality within those services.
defaultQ120 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultExactly that thought invites a series of further questions, does it not, about who is in control of care
default,
default particularly in a large organisation
default?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultThat is absolutely right.
defaultQ121 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWhat 
defaultis the name on the writing paper
default,
default and who are the people in control
default?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultAnd
default,
default where equity finance is involved, how far can you go back in relation to all of those things
default?
defaultQ122 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultMoving on, we have this new duty of candour. Do you think it is the right vehicle to develop a broader culture of openness among health and social care providers? Do you t
defaulthink it is the right vehicle?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultIt is not the only solution
default,
default but it is an appropriate solution. People have campaigned for this for a long time. I think Robert Francis considered it, weighed it and came out with his recommendation. We have been asked by the Department to, in a sense, ensure that our regulations have the duty of candour as something that we inspect against
default,
default and we think it is one of the contributions to making the system more open and transparent.
defaultQ123 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultWhat are you going to do to make people apply the duty of candour in spirit rather than just going through the motions?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultWe are going to inspect. That is what we will do. The issue about the duty of candour, going back to the previous conversation and David
default’
defaults point, is 
defaultthat 
defaultit is the providers that have a responsibility to make sure that they are being candid. I
defaultt is the commissioners, and so on
default. 
defaultTha
defaultt does not just sit with 
defaultthe 
defaultCQC, but we will inspect against the duty of candour, so a part of our inspections will be to assess that organisations are indeed carrying forward their responsibility in that respect.
defaultQ124 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan I ask you two questions
default,
default in conclusion
default,
default that we went over in earlier sta
defaultges about internal housekeeping?
default First relating to finance, in 2012 it was said to be an objective of the CQC to wean itself off grant in aid by, I think, 2015, at which 
defaultstage
default you were planning that you 
defaultwould be
default financed entirely by charges on registrants. Is that still your objective?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultNo.
defaultQ125 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIf it is not, what is your objective?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultAt the moment we spend about £153 million, of which £100 million comes from fees. In three years
default’ time 
defaultwe will be spending between £200 million and £210 million. I do not think our fees are going to go up by very much, but we will see. That will be up for consultation. So I think the grant in aid that we will require
default—
default 
defaultQ126 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Presumably one of the 
defaultconsultees
default 
defaultin that case is Her Majesty
default’s Government.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultIt will be, but Her Majesty
default’
defaults Government have wished us to become an effective strong regulator
default,
default and there is a cost attached to that.
defaultQ127 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYes. Going beyond facetious
default comments on my part, if all 
defaultthis description of 
defaultthe
default process that we have been discussing this afternoon depends upon resources yet to be agreed with the Treasury, 
defaulttha
defaultt is a significant issue, is it not?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultThey have been substantially agreed with the Department of Health. I am not sure how far they have agreed it with the Treasury.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultWe have had constructive conversations. I think this was behind Valerie
default’
defaults question. We have been doing our numbers, we
default have been working them out—and when 
defaultyou change the assumptions the numbers change. 
defaultW
defaulte are honing those down so we can be absolutely confident. We are committed to changing the organisation from April next year and we need to know that the changes we 
defaultmake are going to be sustained. We need to know that the income—the revenue
default that we need to do the job we are being asked to
default do—
defaultis going to be forthcoming. We think we have that 
defaultunderstanding 
defaultfrom the Department
default,
default but we want to secure and confirm 
defaulttha
defaultt
default,
default because, from the original business plan for 2013
default&#x2011;
default14
default—
defaultthis year
default—
defaultwe have changed some of our assumptions. We think we have agreed those changed assumptions with the Department
default,
default but we need to lock that down so 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have a three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear strategy and a three
default&#x2011;
defaultyear financial plan to support the delivery of that strategy. We will need more staff to do the job we are being asked to do
default,
default and therefore we will need the resources to buy those staff. 
defaultComing back to Valerie
default’
defaults and Barbara
default’
defaults point, if we are buying in experts from services, they will need to be replaced so we are not taking them away from the front line, and 
defaultas for 
defaultpe
defaultople who are giving their time—experts by experience—
defaultwe will need to buy their time back as well. So there will be a cost to a new model.
defaultQ128 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultBut the precise financing of this model is still work in progress
default,
default you are saying.
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultT
defaulthis year it is fully financed. 
defaultThereafter, 
defaultfor 
defaultthe next two years, the details are still being nailed down, but in principle we have full support from the Department.
defaultQ129 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default This is t
defaulthe final question. We have talked a lot this afternoon about culture in your registrant community. One of the criticisms of the CQC in the recent past has been not only the culture in the registrant community but in your own organisation. What steps have you taken within your own organisation to address staff culture
default,
default and what is the visibility? How do we test what you say is happening? What is the external evidence?
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultOur governance structure has been completely changed. Do you want me to go into that now?
defaultChair:default 
defaultA written note might be the simpler way of doing it.
defaultDavid Priordefault: 
defaultI will drop you a note on 
defaultthat;
default 
defaultit
default has been fundamentally changed. The
defaultre has been the
default change in the sen
defaultior leadership team, with David and 
defaultthe three chief inspectors, 
defaultand 
defaultour direct
defaultor of intelligence and strategy; all 
defaulthave been changed. So in the top management the
defaultr
defaulte has been 100% change. That is making a very big difference. 
defaultW
defaulthat is really interesting
default—
defaultthis is a tribu
defaultte to David, not to me or to
default anybody else
default—is that if you look at our
default staff survey this year, despite the change that we are 
defaultmak
defaulting, it is markedly more positive, upbeat and supportive than 
defaultwas the case 
defaultthe year before. So I think there is some strong evidence that we are making good progress.
defaultQ130 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultBut even accepting that it is improving, there are, no doubt, parts of the organisation 
defaultthat
default are not as good as you would want them to be. Can you demonstrate that there is a culture within the organisation that encourages your employees to raise concerns
default,
default as you are encouraging people within the registrant community to allow concerns to be raised?
defaultDavid Behandefault: 
defaultRobert Francis, when he attended our board meeting, talked about the way that we had handled some of the challenges to us as an exemplar
default,
default and 
defaultsaid 
defaultthat perhaps we could demonstrate
default,
default by the way we were dealing with some of our challenges
default,
default how 
defaultthings could 
defaultbe taken forward. We did a sta
defaultff survey in July this year in which 
default83% of our staff participated
default.
default That is very high compared to any staff survey. 
defaultOf those, 
default82% said that they were positive about the CQC changing for the better. Staff satisfaction went up to 61% and they calculate
defaultd an engagement index at

default. T
defaulthe public sector average is 56. I am not happy to be average and I am certainly not happy just to beat the best of the public sector. We need to have more ambition than that and benchmark ourselves
default—
defaultand that is what we will
default do. Our lowest scores in the survey—
defaultit is not appropriat
defaulte 
defaultjust 
defaultto look at the high scores—
defaultwere about whether people feel valued in the CQC, 
defaultwhether 
defaulttheir morale is high
default,
default and 
defaultwhether 
defaultthey have confidence 
defaultthat 
defaultthe senior leadership 
defaultwill
default effectively mak
defaulte
default the changes that we have to make. 
defaultT
defaulthey are good challenge
defaults, and we are mindful of that. 
defaultI was worried by the numbe
defaultr of e
default&#x2011;
defaultmails I was getting from
default people 
defaultwho 
defaultwanted, in confidence, to talk about their concer
defaultns about the culture in the CQC, s
defaulto we commissioned a
default completely independent person—
defaults
defaultomebody I had never met before—
defaultto do a report 
defaulton
default bullying and harassment. We received that report
default and
default published 
defaultit
default. This week at the leadership team we will spend time for a second period looking at what we are going to do to take forward the issues that were raised from that. I currently
default have a number of concerns that
default have been raised with me by staff
default, which we are pursuing
default both within the organisation 
defaultand
default 
defaultby people who 
defaultwe have brought in to look at those specifically. 
defaultJust last week, Chair, we h
defaultad the 300 managers in the CQC—
defaultwhether they manage one person or
default 300 people—
defaultall together 
defaultto discuss
default the changes that I was speaking to Barbara
default 
defaultabout
default:
default the fact that we need to change everybody
default’
defaults job. The feedback from that conference was incredibly positive about the direction of travel
default, about
default specialisation and about what we are doing. People are incredibly anxious about having to change their job
default. W
defaulte have this classic paradox of people being very supportive of the changes, as demonstrated through the staff survey, but very anxious
default,
default because 
defaultfor some people 
defaultthis will be abou
defaultt the fifth or sixth change
default they have been through in 10 years. That 
defaultgenerates anxiety. We are t
defaultrying not 
defaultto 
defaultbe closed about that, but 
defaultto 
defaulttalk about 
defaulti
defaultt and support people through the change
default,
default because we need to take the energy that people have about wanting to change and harness 
defaultthat 
defaultand carry 
defaulti
defaultt forward
default,
default as well as acknowledging the anxiety. 
defaultWe will do a 
defaultpulse survey in December.
default 
defaultThrough 
defaultGfK
default, an external survey company, 
defaultwe will do 
defaulta staff survey every July and a pulse survey every December. 
defaultW
defaulte will use 
defaultt
defaulthe organ
defaultisation that did the report on
default bullying and harassment to speak to staff teams
default and
default staff groups, and I will invite 
defaultit
default back 
defaultnext spring 
defaultto do a review of whether we ha
defaultve made progress or otherwise. Tha
defaultt will coincide with the height of the changes, but we need constantly 
defaultto 
defaultensure 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are testing the robustness and resilience of the culture that we are creating within the CQC. My belief is 
defaultthat 
defaultit is moving
default—
defaultbut is ever
defaultybody happy all of the time? No
default they are not
default,
default and we need to do more.
defaultChair:default Tha
defaultt is a comment on the human condition. Thank you very much for your contributions this afternoon. We will publish a report in due course. Thank you.
