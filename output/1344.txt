[[[Centre for Mental Health]]]

[[[Introduction]]]Centre for Mental Health is an independent charity working to improve the life chances of people facing or living with mental ill health. We have carried out extensive work on mental health and criminal justice, including examining the support offered to offenders and ways of preventing offending by promoting better mental health and life chances early in life. Our evidence is drawn from that work and demonstrates the importance of investing in mental health promotion and support to reduce offending and reoffending.Our evidence looks at three areas in which a better response to mental health at different stages of life and contact with the criminal justice system could help to reduce crime and improve community safety. It builds on evidence provided to the previous Justice Select Committee’s inquiry into Justice Reinvestment.

[[[Mental health treatment requirement]]]In 2005, the Mental Health Treatment Requirement (MHTR) was introduced as one of 12 options for a community sentence in England and Wales. The MHTR provides sentencers with an option  to deal with the situation where individuals have committed offences that do not require a prison sentence but who need mental health treatment as part of their rehabilitation. Recent research has found that the MHTR offers stability in the lives of people who receive them as part of a community sentence (Scott and Moffatt, 2012).At least 39% of offenders supervised by probation services have mental health problems (Brooker et al., 2012). By contrast just 1% of community sentences include an MHTR. We believe that the MHTR has unfulfilled potential to enable more people to be diverted from short prison sentences. It can be used on its own or in combination with other requirements. Recently introduced flexibilities in the operation of the MHTR, for example in the production of court psychiatric reports, should help to increase uptake but knowledge and confidence about MHTR is low among sentencers, probation services and health and social care. Further guidance and support from the Ministry of Justice and Department of Health could help to encourage greater and more effective use of the MHTR.

[[[Liaison and diversion]]]Mental health diversion schemes operate at the interface between criminal justice and mental health. They seek to ensure that people with mental health problems who come into contact with the police and courts are identified and directed towards appropriate mental health care, particularly as an alternative to imprisonment. The Centre collected evidence that showed well-designed arrangements for diversion have the potential to yield multiple benefits, including:The Government has committed to expanding availability of liaison and diversion services to police stations and courts across England, subject to business case approval. This is a welcome development. It is vital that this is completed successfully and sustainably to screen offenders for mental health needs and offer advice and support to criminal justice agencies. It is also crucial that liaison and diversion services provide tailored support to children and young people as well as adults as well as gender-specific responses to female offenders and appropriate support for people from Black and minority ethnic communities.

[[[Prevention and early ]]]

[[[intervention]]]About five per cent of children in England have severe and persistent behavioural problems, while a further 15% have less serious but still marked behavioural difficulties. These children go on to commit 80% of all crime over their lifetimes. People who had the most serious behavioural problems from a young age are 20 times more likely than their peers to end up in prison by their mid-twenties. Severe behavioural problems have many causes but in many cases they can be prevented or managed by positive parenting (Centre for Mental Health, 2009b).Parenting programmes that strengthen families and help parents to manage children’s behaviour can reduce the risk of a child getting involved in offending later in life. They also improve the mental health of parents and children alike.The total cost of crime attributable to people who had conduct problems in childhood is estimated at about £60 billion a year in England and Wales, equivalent to about £225,000 per person (Centre for Mental Health, 2009b). Evidence-based parenting programmes, by contrast, cost about £1,200 per child. Targeted provision of effective parenting programmes thus represents excellent value for public money. At present, however, it remains patchy and in many areas inadequate to meet the needs of the local population. The Centre recently examined ways in which the provision of effective parenting programmes could be improved. These include:Further research from the Centre has found that young women involved in gang activity had very high rates of early starting behavioural problems as well as multiple vulnerabilities from a young age, including neglect and maltreatment (Khan et al, 2013). This research concluded that all services working with families and children (including adult mental health services, prisons and substance misuse services) need to be alert to the risk factors for gang involvement among girls and young women in order to prevent risks accumulating.August 2013
