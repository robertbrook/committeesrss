default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default"
defaultThere is an institutional bias against mental health within the NHS
default."
default&#xa0;
defaultMonitor has a vital role in promoting the NHS Constitution in mental health care and reducing the bias against and stigma attached to mental illness within Foundation Trusts (“Trusts”). 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultBackgrounddefault&#xa0;
default1.    
default              
defaultThe Committee does not consider individual cases but I believe my knowledge and experience from what started as a misdiagnosis put me in an excellent position to comment constructively on the NHS. I believe my experience makes me, ‘
defaultan expert by experience
default’ in medical law and the problems, structure and operation of the NHS. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example, I found a flaw in the statutory Directions for approval of doctors to carry out assessments under the Mental Health Act 1983 (“MHA”). I contacted the DoH and, as a result, the Secretary of State exercised his powers to revoke the Directions and issue new statutory Instructions for approving s.12-clinicians.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn a different subject (extradition), I gave evidence to The Joint Committee on Human Rights, as a victim of a crime in which the suspect absconded, which I know was well received. 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultI collapsed in September 2011 and an ambulance took me to A &amp; E, where doctors diagnosed a grand mal seizure. However, they confused the after-effects of a seizure (a post-
defaultictal
default state) with mental illness and sectioned me under the MHA. 
default&#xa0;
default3.    
default              
defaultThis had grave implications. I was due to be principle witness in a Crown Court trial in 2012 so the police and I were concerned that 5½ years police work might be jeopardised by the stigma attached to detention under the MHA and potential loss of credibility. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultEfforts to ‘clear my name’ have been met throughout by the prejudice and stigma I believed would affect a jury, along with dishonesty and unfair complaints processes of Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust (“SHNFT”) and Southampton City Council (“SCC”) and unfair processes of certain Regulators and Ombudsmen. 
default&#xa0;
defaultExceptions include the Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”) and General Medical Council (“GMC”) but SHNFT/SCC are obstructing even GMC inquiries into professional misconduct by the doctors.  
default&#xa0;
default4.    
default              
defaultSHNFT/SCC act as if they are above the law. Their so-called independent investigator found it: 
default&#xa0;
default“Undisputed that Mr GH was ... in a post-
defaultictal
default state at the time of the mental health assessment [without] post-
defaultictal
default psychosis or a manic/
defaulthypomanic
default state.” 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn short, I was not mentally ill so there was no lawful justification to detain me under the MHA or Article 5 of The European Convention on Human Rights. Despite the, “
defaultUndisputed
default” finding, expert opinion and unambiguous legal precedents that confirm unlawful detention is a tort of strict liability, SHNFT/SCC stubbornly refuse to accept the law. 
default&#xa0;
default5.    
default              
defaultTo illustrate the gravity of my case, officials at the DoH and NHS England have expressed their concern to the GMC, SHNFT and SCC. They are mystified and unable to explain some of the positions taken by SHNFT/SCC, Regulators and Ombudsmen. 
default&#xa0;defaultAntecedentsdefault&#xa0;
default6.
default              
defaultI share my experience and research with the Committee because mine is not an isolated case. For example: 
default&#xa0;
default6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere have been several incidents of potentially avoidable suicides.
default&#xa0;
default6.2   
default              
defaultOn an inspection in 2011, the CQC found three patients unlawfully detained and serious issues relating to recordkeeping.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn SHNFT Consultant admitted shredding a suicide patient’s notes before the inquest. 
defaultThe Coroner said he was open to accusations of a cover-up because his record-keeping was so bad: 
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultThe documentation... leading to [name] being allowed to leave hospital is sloppy and inadequate
default.... 
defaultIf he was so concerned about her going, his failure to record these matters is significantly blameworthy
default.”
default&#xa0;
default6.4   
default              
defaultRecently, SHNFT gave leave to a gravely mentally ill convicted murderer: he absconded. The police warned the public he was highly 
defaultdangerous and launched an urgent manhunt
default: SHNFT called him, 
default"
defaultExtremely low risk.
default"
default&#xa0;
default6.5 
default              
defaultDr Julian Lewis MP referred to: SHNFT directors’ 
default“
defaultSlippery methods
default”; 
default“
defaultA 
defaultso-called independent report
default”; acting, “
defaultOut of order
default”; and,
default “A trust that could not be trusted.
default” This mirrors my experience: I recommend the Committee read Dr Lewis’s speech
default. 
default&#xa0;
default6.6  
default              
defaultOn 9 September 2013, BBC’s Panorama, “
defaultLocked up for being ill
default” concerned problems in mental health care in Hampshire and its negative impact on patients and police
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt featured 
defaultSHNFT. 
defaultPolice are concerned by substantial resources they are committing to safeguard mental patients found in public places and the implications for patients (who have not offended) of being kept in police cells for long periods because of shortages of acute mental health beds and appropriate assessors. The police are minded to take such persons to A &amp; E instead.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC interviewed the SHNFT director, who Dr Lewis named. 
defaultShe stated impertinently that SHNFT always tries to treat people at home, which from my experience is untrue. She implied it preferable to hold the mentally ill in cells rather than A &amp; E – a bizarre and (to patients) damaging proposal, especially as most physical health Trusts are registered with the CQC to assess and treat mental patients.
default&#xa0;
defaultShredding records (6.3), unlawful detention (6.2), poor recordkeeping (6.2) &amp; (6.3) and the conduct Dr Lewis describes (6.5) are common to my case. Despite the evidence that the local mental health care is not fit for purpose, Monitor appears not to deem SHNFT a priority.

default&#xa0;
defaultMonitor’s Performancedefault&#xa0;
default8.   
default              
defaultI have tried energetically to persuade Monitor to investigate governance failings at SHNFT. Its response renders meaningless pledges in ‘
defaultThe Statement of Common Purpose
default.’ 
default&#xa0;
defaultMonitor is reluctant to engage with patients or other Regulators: it does not regard protection of patient interests as its primary duty: its procedures are innately biased in favour of Trusts: it operates in a way that renders rooting out poor care impossible. It fails to put patients first. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a case study, my experience illustrates these points but I believe there are other mental health trusts failing patients. Lists of ‘
defaultfailing
default’ Trusts are notable for the absence of specialist mental health Trusts. In comparison with the number of failing physical health trusts, it is statistically improbable that there are no failing mental health Trusts.  
default&#xa0;
default9.    
default              
defaultMonitor summarised the concerns about SHNFT, which I believe affect its governance. I detail them here with my observations. 
default&#xa0;
default9.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn June 2013, SHNFT’s Chairman threatened me: the ‘
defaultinvestigation
default’ of this was farcical. 
default&#xa0;
default9.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt Monitor’s suggestion, I addressed SHNFT’s Lead Governor and another governor. They failed to
default honour
default promises to respond about the June 2013 incident or the original event. Months later, SHNFT asserted that an 
defaultunnamed
default director investigated the former incident – although he did not seek evidence from me or contact me. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Governors have no notion of independence or fair, open and transparent complaints processes. This is unsurprising – 
defaultthe Board Chairman is Chairman of Governors
default. 
default&#xa0;
default   
default              
defaultIt is vital for Chairmen of Governors not to act in a dual capacity as Chairmen of the Board: Governors should be wholly independent of the Board. I understand Monitor’s 2011 Annual Accountability Hearing Report stated of the
default practise
default: 
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultThis bizarre and unsatisfactory arrangement is a clear conflict of interest, especially when governors are asked to investigate public concerns about the conduct of a Board Chair.”
default&#xa0;
defaultSHNFT’s Governors knew my concerns directly from me but failed to investigate the Chairman’s conduct. The Board investigated ‘
defaultin-house’
default by asking an (unknown) director to investigate, presumably with the Governors’ agreement. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFacilitated by Monitor’s weak scrutiny, the Governors apparently allow the Board to treat SHNFT as their personal fiefdom, thereby allowing directors to escape sanction. 
default&#xa0;
default9.3  
default              
defaultIn violation of The Medical Act 1983, SHNFT delayed providing information sought by the GMC for its inquiries: papers provided belatedly were inaccurate and incomplete. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI proved that SHNFT tampered with my medical records (to an extent that NHS Protect believes might constitute fraud) before sending them to the GMC, thereby concealing the removal of key evidence and protecting its and the doctors’ interests. 
default&#xa0;
default9.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI believe SHNFT’s Chairman is not a ‘
defaultfit and proper person
default’ given his career history.
default&#xa0;
default9.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMy experience in the context of critical findings by Coroners and the CQC. 
default&#xa0;
default9.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAnti-competitive 
defaultbehaviour;
default failure to act in patients’ best interests and failure to ensure the most efficient use of public money. This arose when doctors informed me (wrongly) that I needed to be admitted for mental health assessment.  
default&#xa0;
defaultI offered admission to a private psychiatric hospital (to which the NHS refers patients at its cost) but at my expense. The doctors denied me this right (which a nurse recorded and my sister witnessed) and to justify detention, lied about it on the section forms. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis cost the NHS four days’ 
defaulthospitalisation
default and two-years’ ongoing complaints process, estimated to have cost £500,000 already – all unnecessarily. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMonitor appears unconcerned about most of this conduct, including waste of public money.
default&#xa0;
defaultPursuant to (3), SHNFT/SCC’s complaints process bears no resemblance to DoH guidance. It is weighted heavily in their favour. They and their investigator routinely broke written promises. I was minded to ask Monitor to consider this as a governance issue too but have no confidence now that it would be effective use of my time. 
default&#xa0;
default10.   
default              
defaultMonitor agreed to consider the incident at (9.1) and the governors’ conduct (9.2). Its refusal to address the wider implications of (9.2) and the issues at (9.3) to (9.6) is inconsistent with its statement in the same letter:
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultIt is not our role to adjudicate on your complaint or to resolve it.... Our primary duty is to protect and promote the interests of all patients, and we have to ensure we can regulate effectively to do that
default.”
default&#xa0;
defaultYet Monitor agrees to consider two issues relating directly to my complaint but not those that are based on a pattern of events with wider implications for patients. This is self-contradictory.    
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the circumstances, if Monitor truly wished to regulate effectively and put patients’ interests first, it is untenable to claim they have insufficient suspicion of SHNFT to involve patients fully.  
default&#xa0;
default11.   
default              
defaultMonitor’s failings include:
default&#xa0;
default11.1
default              
defaultWorking on a default position of trust with Trusts, leaving a perception that it works on a default position of suspicion towards patients. To root out poor care and put patients first, it should work on a default position of suspicion with Trusts. 
default&#xa0;
default11.2 
default              
defaultDespite knowing DoH and NHS England are sufficiently concerned to meet and express concern to the GMC, Monitor refuses to meet me. Monitor knows NHS England expressed concerns direct to SHNFT/SCC too. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultI hoped to convince Monitor it had serious issues to address. However, Monitor refused to be pro-active in contacting the GMC, DoH and NHS England, who may know of other cases. Monitor’s stated position is that others should always report to them.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultThis is the antithesis of Dr Bennett’s pledge (7.8) to work together, collaborate on patients’ behalf and be unfailing in rooting out poor care. 
default&#xa0;
default11.3 
default              
defaultMonitor gives Trusts access to its Regional Managers but patients must to go through a Complaints Manager. Unequal access to investigators is innately biased in Trusts’ favour. 
default&#xa0;
default11.4 
default              
defaultMonitor shares patients’ papers with Trusts but not 
defaultvice versa
default on the basis that it might jeopardise its working relationship with Trusts. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultIn a case where there is evidence of institutionalised dishonesty, Monitor’s failure to give patients equal access to evidence is innately favourable to Trusts, rendering it impossible for Monitor to establish the truth. 
default&#xa0;
default11.5 
default              
defaultMonitor is disinterested in failures in recordkeeping even when it is proved that a Trust is obfuscating a GMC inquiry (delaying disclosure of evidence); is perverting due process (tampering with medical records) and has perverted the course of justice by shredding evidence required by the Court and police.  
default11.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMonitor takes advantage of patients’ perceived lack of legal knowledge to disenfranchise them. For example, Monitor used The Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOI”) as an excuse not to disclose the Trust’s response, (ref. (11.4) above). 
default&#xa0;
defaultProbably intentionally, Monitor overlooked my right to access personal data under The Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”): the FOI is immaterial. 
default&#xa0;
default11.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMonitor acted ungraciously when I debunked its argument (11.7): it demanded £10 for a subject access request. This is petty, pedantic and bureaucratic - it probably costs more than £10 to process.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe DPA permits charging but it is rank bad practice for Regulators to charge patients for evidence of their case. Monitor does not charge Trusts £10 to access patients’ views. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMonitor is the 
defaultonly
default health and social care body to attempt to charge me to be involved in my own complaint. I have 
defaultnever
default known a Regulator, Ombudsman or party to a complaint 
defaultin any sector
default charge for being involved in an investigation.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt (7.1) above Dr Bennett pledged to fully involve patients. I suspect he did not expect his staff to interpret this as, ‘
defaultFully involve patients in return for a fee
default.’
default&#xa0;
default11.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNHS England hopes to facilitate a meeting with SHNFT/SCC, a DoH official and me to bring closure; avoid further waste of public money; and learn from my experience. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe agreed to invite Monitor’s Regional Manager but, when a DoH official spoke to them, he gained the impression it would serve no useful purpose. Pursuant to (11.2), Monitor appears reluctant to engage with others even at the request of the DoH. 
default11.10 It must be near impossible for acute mental patients to approach Monitor. Its disinterest in scrutinising SHNFT demonstrates it does not adequately represent those whose voices are weakest. 
default12.  
default              
defaultI believe the current situation at Monitor is damaging to patient interests because of potential for confusion, buck passing and regulatory failure.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default              
defaultThe Chairman of Monitor must be ruthless in ensuring his colleagues comply with the spirit and letter of ‘
defaultThe Statement of Common Purpose
default.’ If necessary, Monitor should strain the meaning of words in its constitution to do so. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTheir first thought should be, ‘
defaultWhat can we do?
default’ 
defaultnot
default, ‘
defaultHow do we avoid doing anything?” 
default&#xa0;
default14.
default              
defaultMonitor’s attitude to mental health patients is discriminatory: it is difficult to ascertain if this is an unforeseen consequence of its statutory remit or results from its officers’ attitude. Even if the former, its officers should be more empathetic and helpful. 
default&#xa0;
default15.
default              
defaultThere is substantial room for improvement in Monitor’s collaboration with other Regulators and patients. It cannot fulfil its primary role of protecting patients’ interests without pro-active information exchange with regulators of medical professionals.
default&#xa0;
default16.   I see no evidence of rigour in Monitor’s processes. The facts speak for themselves:
default&#xa0;
default16.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMonitor admits to working with Trusts on the basis of trust.
default&#xa0;
default16.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt does not fully involve patients in its investigations, in particular to corroborate what Trusts say to Monitor – even if there is evidence of dishonesty by a Trust.  
default&#xa0;
default16.3 
default              
defaultMonitor may (or may not) investigate individual cases but there is no evidence that it has investigated the ongoing, serious and unresolved shortcomings at SHNFT, identified at (6) and by my experience.
default&#xa0;
defaultSHNFT’s Board, its Governors and Monitor seem to regard themselves as superior to patients and, in SHNFT’s case, superior to the law.
default&#xa0;
default17.  
default              
defaultOn 24 October 2013, in denying access to SHNFT’s response, Monitor unwittingly summed up the principle cause of its failings: 
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultDisclosure of this information would, or would be like to be, prejudicial to its ability to investigate complaints made about a foundation trust if those third parties it corresponds with in the course of such investigation, including but not limited to a foundation trust itself, have cause to believe that Monitor either would or would be likely to disclose such correspondence to other parties, including those that have made the complaint
default.”
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultWe believe this approach strikes the correct balance between keeping a complainant informed of the progress of their complaint and maintaining the trust and confidence between us and the third parties with whom we correspond in respect of the complaint, third parties on whose trust and confidence we rely in order to address and resolve complaints expeditiously
default.”
default&#xa0;
defaultIn short, Monitor works with Trusts on the basis of trust and confidence: it accepts 
defaultverbatim
default what they say without corroborating the facts or passing information to patients and relevant third parties. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTherefore, it was contemptuous of Dr Bennett to pledge Monitor to 
defaultinter alia
default put patients first: fully involve them: take what they say seriously: encourage and welcome feedback: work together and collaborate with other
default organisations
default: be unfailing in routing out poor care: and serve patients with a spirit of
default candour
default and culture of humility, openness and honesty. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMonitor’s 
defaultmodus operandi
default is the antithesis of these pledges. The veil of secrecy it throws over the scrutiny of Trusts shows Monitor learned nothing from the events at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMonitor’s conduct calls into serious question its position as an, “
defaultIndependent
default” regulator
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Committee is welcome to contact me for further information.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 14 November 2013, Monitor responded to the issues at (9.1) and (9.2):
default              
default 
default              
default“
defaultWe do not intend to look into these matters further based on the information we have received. We do not think there is enough evidence of governance concerns to indicate a potential breach of the provider licence
default.”
default&#xa0;
defaultMonitor refused to disclose the information on which it bases this decision and went on to state: 
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultWe will consider any new information we receive about the Trust, including any adverse findings from the General Medical Council, Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, NHS Protect or other regulatory bodies. If we think their findings provide evidence of potential breaches of the provider licence, we will consider whether to take regulatory action
default.” 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis re-enforces my evidence to the Committee: 
defaultinter alia
default, using the same section numbers:
default&#xa0;
default7.
default              
defaultDr Bennett did not make the pledges in ‘
defaultThe Statement of Common Purpose
default’ in good faith or he failed to ensure that his officials and/or procedures comply. 
default&#xa0;
default9.2 
default              
defaultMonitor has no concerns about a complaints process that allows an anonymous Board director to investigate the Board Chairman’s conduct without involving the patient, thereby excluding from the process the independent governors who promised to respond, despite that it was Monitor itself who originally suggested I address the Lead Governor. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMonitor has no concept of what constitutes independent scrutiny of directors by governors.  
default&#xa0;
default11.1
default              
defaultMonitor is wrong to work on a default position of trust with Trusts. Even where there is 
defaultprima facie
default proof of dishonesty, Monitor does not check Trusts’ response with the patient concerned. 
default&#xa0;
default11.2 
default              
defaultMonitor confirms its position that other Regulators should always report to it. Even when it has 
defaultprima facie
default evidence that the GMC, PHSO, NHS Protect and other regulatory bodies have information of relevance its work, it refuses to be pro-active in contacting them. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI refer also to section 15 of my evidence. It is precisely this attitude, which led to the appalling events at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. 
default&#xa0;
default17.   Monitor cannot be considered an, “
defaultIndependent
default” regulator.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is not without irony that, having reached a firm conclusion, Monitor closes its letter by offering to meet me. If Monitor truly wishes to involve patients, it should meet during an investigation, not as a futile gesture when it is too late – after it has reached a conclusion.
