Is it fair to make the point that an employer which appears before a tribunal for a case where they had been found against before [is] at risk of a more severe sanction?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;b) Are the number of cases for discrimination against protected characteristics which are likely to be taken forward to an Employment Tribunal limited by pre-trial mediation such as ACAS’s early reconciliation services?&#xa0;&#xa0;c) Is it necessary for cases where an employer is brought before a Tribunal for unlawful discrimination [that the Claimant are] … individuals who have been discriminated against. Is it plausible for indirect victims such as those unhappy about working in environments where discrimination is prevalent to also be heard by the Tribunal.&#xa0;&#xa0;d) The Government has indicated that the recommendations of the Tribunal are actually non-binding. Does that mean that there is no sanction for failing to implement the Tribunal’s recommendation in a timely manner? Is it likely to be the case that an employer may find it easier to take action to tacklediscrimination if recommended by the Tribunal (e.g. the prod of external pressure) rather than act through their internal management chain?&#xa0;
