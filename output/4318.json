"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by RCUK Energy Strategy Fellowship (LCI0018)&#xa0;&#xa0;Executive summary&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;The RCUK Energy Strategy Fellowship\n \nhas \nrecently launched \na Prospectus\n \nexploring research, skills and training needs across the energy landscape. \nThe Prospectus was commissioned by Research Councils UK \n(RCUK)\n \nwho \nconstitute\n the primary audience for the report. \nThe \nProspectus contributes to the evidence base upon which the RCUK Energy Programme can plan research \nand training \nactivities\n.\n \nHowever\n,\n \na number of the findings \nand recommendations \nconcern\n \nthe \nwider \nUK energy innovation system\n.\n \n \nThe \nFellowship \nTeam acted independently in producing the \nProspectus\n, drawing on\n \nan extensive series of workshops, stakeholder \ninterviews and literature reviews\n. The recommendations\n are\n grouped \naccording to their main focu\ns:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis evidence draws on both the Prospectus and the judgements of the Fellowship team,\n \nfocussing on the question posed in the Call for Evidence.\n \nWe have raised wider issues where we believe these to be relevant to the question being posed.\n&#xa0;\nWhile \nthere \nis a very large overlap between \nlow-carbon\n \ninnovation\n (the subject of this Inquiry)\n \nand \nenergy\n innovation\n (the subject of our work)\n, there are differences\n. \nLow-carbon\n innovation \ncould cover \nland-use change, as well as materials and manufacturing development\n. \nEnergy\n innovation includes advances in technologies in the fossil fuel industri\nes, which \nwould not typically\n be \nviewed \nas low-carbon.  \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 1: Will the Government’s current approach towards low carbon innovation help to achieve the UK’s legally binding targets at the lowest possible cost? &#xa0;\nQuestion 2: Does the Government have the right balance of focus between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies?&#xa0;Question 3: What outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely to achieve? How should its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success?&#xa0;\nQuestion 4: Are the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the innovation process, including over the long-term?&#xa0;Question 5: What is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment?&#xa0;\nQuestion 6: How should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low carbon innovation will be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?&#xa0;Question 7: How is the Government maximising opportunities to learn from and partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?&#xa0; \nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n ‘Towards a Brighter Energy Future: Energy Research and Training Prospectus’, \nRCUK Energy Strategy Fellowship, \n2013, \nhttps://workspace.imperial.ac.uk/rcukenergystrategy/Public/reports/Final%20Reports/RCUK%20Brighter%20energy.pdf\n International Energy Agency, \nEnergy Policies of IEA Countries: 2012 Review of the UK, \n2012\n \nCommittee on Climate Change,\n \nBuilding a low-carbon economy – the UK’s innovation challenge\n.
