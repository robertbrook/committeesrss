[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The UK Insurance Industry [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The UK insurance industry is the third largest in the world and the largest in Europe. It is a 
[normal]vital part of the UK economy, managing investments amounting to 26% of the UK’s total net worth and contributing £10.4 billion in taxes to the Government. Employing over 290,000 people in the UK alone, the insurance industry is also one of this country’s m
[normal]ajor exporters, with 28% of its net premium income coming from overseas business.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Insurance helps individuals and businesses protect themselves against the everyday risks they face, enabling people to own homes, travel overseas, provide for a financially 
[normal]secure future and run businesses. Insurance underpins a healthy and prosperous society, enabling businesses and individuals to thrive, safe in the knowledge that problems can be handled and risks carefully managed. Every day, our members pay out £147 milli
[normal]on in benefits to pensioners and long-term savers as well as £60 million in general insurance claims.

[normal]The ABI[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Association of British Insurers (ABI) is the voice of insurance, representing the general insurance, protection, investment and long-term sa
[normal]vings industry. It was formed in 1985 to represent the whole of the industry and today has over 300 members, accounting for some 90% of premiums in the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The ABI’s role is to:
[normal]• Be the voice of the UK insurance industry, leading debate and speaking up f
[normal]or insurers.
[normal]• Represent the UK insurance industry to government, regulators and policy makers in the 
[normal]  
[normal]UK, EU and internationally, driving effective public policy and regulation.
[normal]• Advocate high standards of customer service within the industry and 
[normal]provide useful information to the public about insurance.
[normal]• Promote the benefits of insurance to the government, regulators, policy makers and the public.

[normal]In the ABI’s experience the new approach has distinct advantages over the previous process. It is materially reducing the chances of business being inadvertently impacted by policy proposals and 
[normal]is 
[normal]contr
[normal]ibuting to an improvement in the quality of legislation and to the building of trust between Government and business
[normal].
