default2. Introduction
defaultPHE
default was established on 1 April 2013 to bring together public health specialists from more than 70 organisations into a single public health service.
default 
defaultWithin the organisation several departments, which were formerly part of the Health Protection Agency (HPA), contribute expertise to increase understanding of the epidemiology of Creutzfeld-Jakob disease
default default(C
defaultJD) and abnormal prio
defaultn disease and to prevent person-to-
defaultperson spread.
default 
defaultThese include:
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, 
defaultthe HPA provided medical and scientific secretariat support for the CJD Incidents Panel between 2003 and its dissolution in 2013.
default 
defaultPHE continues to support the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) TSE subgroup
default,
default which provides expert advice on the risk assessment and risk management of potential person
default-to-
defaultpers
defaulton spread of CJD through healthcare. 
defaultPHE also has expert representation on the UK Blood services prion working group and The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO), which has developed and published guidance relating to the prevention of CJD transmission, among other infections.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis submission focuse
defaults on aspects of risks of person-to-
defaultperson spread of vCJD and abnormal prions, and provides written evidence in respect of questions 2 and 3 of the Parliamentary Science and Technology Select Committee:
default&#xa0;
default3. 
defaultQuestion 2
default 
defaultIs the Government and its scientific advisory structure sufficiently responsive to the threat posed by emerging diseases being transmitted through blood and blood products, tissues and organs?default&#xa0;
defaultThe expert groups, for which PHE provides or has provided scientific secretariat support and/or expert contribution, bring together national expertise and experience to help interpret limited evidence and scientific uncertainty regarding vCJD.
default 
defaultThey commission, consider and interpret risk assessments of the potential for vCJD transmission through blood components and other aspects of healthcare. New evidence is regularly reviewed in order to formulate strategies and recommendations for risk management and risk reduction.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe number, format and specific functions of these expert groups have changed over the years.
default 
defaultThe ACDP TSE group, and its predecessors (the ACDP TSE Risk Management group and the TSE Working Group) own and oversee the national guidance on TSE infection prevention and control, and these documents are maintained and updated regularly to reflect new evidence and policies (such as decontamination policies) as they arise.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4. 
defaultQuestion 3
defaultHas the threat of ongoing transmission of vCJD through the blood and blood product supply been adequately mitigated?default&#xa0;defaultMeasures currently being taken to limit known risks
defaultA number of safety measures ar
defaulte in place to prevent person-to-
defaultperson spread of vCJD, both through blood and blood products and through surgical procedures.
default 
defaultThese measures concern transmission risks both from patients who have been diagnosed with clinical vCJD, and those who are healthy but who have been exposed to an increased risk of vCJD through their healthcare.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis second group of patients may never develop the disease but because there is no in-life test to detect asymptomatic infection, there is a potential for transmission of infection to occur before symptoms become apparent during a possibly prolonged incubation period to vCJD.
default 
defaultTherefore, a precautionary approach is taken with the
default 
defaultformulation of infection prevention and control advice, given the many uncertainties in this area, and the serious consequences of hidden transmission.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIdentification and follow-up of individuals at increased risk of vCJD
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are around 3,500 individuals
default in the UK who have been informed that they have an increased risk of vCJD (see Annex A).
default 
defaultThis figure comprises a mix of:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAll people who are “at increased risk” of vCJD are as
defaultked to help prevent any further 
defaultpossible transmission to other patients by following the advice beneath, published by the ACDP TSE group (see box).
default&#xa0;
defaultBox: Public health advice on how to stop CJD spreading to other peopledefault&#xa0;
defaultThis advice is for people who have been identified as being at increased risk of CJD. To reduce the risk of spreading CJD to other people please follow this advice:
default&#xa0;
defaultThrough its past work with the CJD Incidents Panel, PHE has had a role in identifying and informing individuals of their increased risk of vCJD.
default 
defaultThis was done in collaboration with the National Blood service (now NHS BT) and the UK Haemophilia Centre Doctors organisation.
default 
defaultLong
default-
defaultterm public health follow-up is in place to detect any new diagnoses of vCJD in these individuals.
default 
defaultThis systematic co
default-
defaultordinated follow-up was put in place after the identification of three transfusion-associated cases of vCJD and the detection, post mortem, of prion protein deposition in tissues from two individuals (one with a history of blood transfusion, and the other of plasma product treatment) neither of whom had symptoms of 
defaultv
defaultCJD.
default 
defaultAny further detection of iatrogenic transmission of vCJD via blood, tissues, organs or surgery, would be immediately notified and would lead to a re-assessment of current guidance and precautions.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMeasures being taken to limit unknown risks
defaultRelated to blood transfusion and surgery
default&#xa0;
defaultThe public health actions described above apply to individuals who have been identified and informed about their vCJD risk status or transfusion history.
default 
defaultIn addition, there are a number of universal precautions in place to protect public health from the unknown but potential risk of undiagnosed vCJD infection within the general population.
default 
defaultThese include donor deferral of any person who has received a UK blood transfusion since 1980 and universal leucocyte depletion of blood used for transfusion [1].
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, public health guidelines from NICE protect the general population from surgical risk by recommending, among other things, the use of segregated sets of neurosurgical instruments on patients born after 1996, who are presumed not to have been exposed to the dietary risks of vCJD [2]. This is to prevent accidental transmission following neurosurgery on an individual in the population exposed to dietary BSE who could theoretically be carrying an undiagnosed vCJD infection which could be passed on.
default&#xa0;
defaultRelated to decontamination and sterilisation of surgical instruments
default&#xa0;
defaultA further general approach to reducing the risk from vCJD to the general population is the improvement of decontamination techniques to remove prion protein from surgical instruments.
default 
defaultPHE hosts the national expert 
defaultRRP, 
defaultwhich provides a prompt assessment of new and novel equipment, materials, and other products or protocols that may be of value to the NHS in improving hospital infection control and reducing hospital acquired infections.
default 
defaultFor a full description of the RRP, its role, remit and procedures, see A
defaultnnex
default B.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe RRP reviewed the applicatio
defaultn from DuPont for the product “
defaultRel
defaultyOn Prion Inactivator” 
default(RelyOn-PI) on two occasions.
default 
defaultRelyOn-PI is DuPont’s patented solution claimed to “very substantially reduce the risk of transmission of prions bound to surgical instruments”.
default 
defaultThe modus operandi of RelyOn-PI can be found in A
defaultnnex
default C, Section 2.5.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe first application concerning RelyOn-PI was reviewed by the RRP in June 2007, awarded a level 3 recommendation (“A potentially useful new concept but insufficiently validated; more research and development is required before it is ready for evaluation in practice”), and the applicants provided with detailed feedback concerning gaps and weaknesses within the evidence base.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultAt a second review in December 2008, the RRP awarded a level 2 recommendation (“Basic research and development has been completed and the product may have potential value; in use evaluations/trials are now needed in an NHS clinical setting” – see Annex D).
default 
defaultThis second commentary to the company outlined concerns with the product which DuPont had yet to address.
default 
defaultThese were communicated to DuPont after both applications in 2007 and 2008 (Annex E for the full 2008 commentary).
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultSpecifically in the RRP feedback followi
defaultng the 2008 review, DuPont was “
defaultagain advised to engage with the Department of Health’s Engineering &amp; Science Advisory Committee for the decontamination of surgical instruments including Prion Removal regarding compatibility with existing procedures and how the
default product will fit into practice”
default.
default 
defaultThe RRP secretariat is aware that in April 2010 DuPont approached Infection Control Product 
defaultSpecialist Dr Beryl Oppenheim (consultant m
defaulticrobiologist, City Hospital Birmingham) who convened an expert group to work with and advise DuPont.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultPrion prevalence surveys of appendix tissue to further inform risk assessments
defaultPHE undertakes anonymised population prevalence surveys to increase understanding of the epidemiology and scale of background undiagnosed abnormal prion infections.
default 
defaultThe results have helped to inform public health guidance.
default 
defaultThe most recent survey, which tested tissue archived following routine surgery, demonstrated a 1:2000 prevalence of abnormal prion deposition in appendices of individuals born between 1941 and 1985 [3].
default 
defaultAlthough it is not known whether this finding equates to infectivity in tissues or in the blood of those with prion deposition, on a precautionary basis it supports the maintenance of the current public health safety measures, until a practical and reliable screening test for asymptomatic infection becomes available.
default&#xa0;
defaultA further anonymised appendix study in UK populations assumed 
defaultnon-exposed
default to dietary BSE is under
default 
defaultway (again PHE co-ordinated and in collaboration with a range of partners).
default 
defaultAppendices removed from patients (of any age) prior to 1979 and from those born after 1996, when full safety measures to protect the food chain were in place are being tested.
default 
defaultThis will provide a comparison population result to help interpret the findings from the earlier survey.
default 
defaultThe latest survey will conclude in 2015.
default 
defaultPHE will present any interim findings from the appendix study on an ongoing basis to the relevant expert groups.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultEstablishing the prevalence of abnormal prions in blood:
defaultIf the current appendix study demonstrates that the deposition of abnormal prion protein is confined to the population that was exposed to the BSE epidemic, the case for an anonymised population blood prevalence survey would be further increased – although there are a number of associated issues which would have to be considered very carefully.
default 
defaultIf there is no difference the priorities for further research and the implications for current public health protection measures would have to be re-evaluated.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultSince 2006/7 the advice of HPA (now PHE) experts and others has been that it is a priority to establish the prevalence of TSE reactivity in UK blood donations.
default 
defaultFive years ago a protocol for an unlinked anonymous survey of 50,000 UK blood donors was developed jointly by the HPA and NHS-BT, and Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained,
default in anticipation of a suitable “
defaultmed
defaultium to high throughput”
default blood test becoming available, the results of which could be usefully interpreted [4].
default 
defaultAlthough this protocol needs updating to take account of new developments, it remains an important expression of HPA/PHE thinking with respect to a blood survey of abnormal prion prevalence.
default 
defaultAll technical experts who have considered the matter are aware that the blood test requirements for an unlinked anonymous prevalence survey need not be as rigorous as a blood test for strengthening blood safety (i.e. screening and excluding blood donations).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultresults of the second appendix survey [3] (in the absence of furth
defaulter appendix prevalence results –
default paras 18-19) strengthens arguments for 
defaultestablishing the prevalence of “prionaemia”
default in UK blood.
default 
defaultThe assessment by the current relevant national UK advisory committee
default 
default(The ACDP TSE RA Sub-Group) of the second appendix survey results (
defaulthttp://transparency.dh.gov.uk/2012/08/13/tse-risk-assessment-july-2012/
default) was that “
defaultgaining further information on prevalence of infection also remains a key area, especially through the investigation of tissues from groups unexposed to BSE and of the feasibility of surveying the prevalence of 
defaultabnormal prion protein in blood”
default.
default 
defaultThe full results of the second appendix surve
defaulty included the conclusion that “
defaultit would be prudent to measure the prevalence of abnormal PrP in human blood. As soon as a satisfactory human blood screening test becomes available in a scalable format, such an unlinked anonym
defaultous survey should be undertaken”
default. [3]
default&#xa0;
defaultSince 2011, HPA/PHE experts have had exploratory meetings to develop ideas as to how a blood prevalence survey could be progressed.
default 
defaultIssues discussed include a) uncertainty about the specificity of available blood tests (since addressed through additional work)
default 
defaultb) the need fo
defaultr at least a “medium-throughput”
default format test for a survey on the scale required, and c) challenges in confir
defaultming and interpreting “positive”
default results. On this latter point, however, there is appreciation that further investigation of reactive specimens would be facilitated by i) the likely availability o
defaultf surplus suitable specimens (ie
default the remainder 
defaultof any reactive blood specimen –
default unlike the situation with appendices), ii) the field of possible confirmatory tests has been progressing steadily, and iii)
default 
defaultthe unlinked-anonymous design would avoid the difficulty of having to convey uncertain results directly to subjects from whom blood specimens are obtained (as is the case for the positive appendix specimens).
default 
defaultThe critical aspect was identified as having the primary test in a format that could be used relatively efficiently and consistently when testing approximately 50,000 specimens.
