default However

defaultidentify the 
defaultkey challenges and potential solutions to meeting the UK
default’s
default 2020 and 2050 targets at the lowest cost to the UK, and (2) investing in major engineering and technology demonst

defaultThe ETI 
defaultis investing

defaultThe 
defaultETI believes that the future approach to practical, cost-effective and sustainable domestic heat supply will vary from location to location across the UK.
default  For example, district heat networks in dense, urban areas and electric heating in rural areas.  Further

defaultmum of both supply-side and demand-
defaultside measures
default (i

defaultDetailed Responses to Questions 1 - 12default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe G
defaultovernment has recently launched the Green Deal and Energy Company Obligation mechanisms to address 
defaultenergy efficiency in the building stock.  We see the aim of the combination of these to stimulate innovation and capacity building in the supply chain for cost
default-effective building retrofits.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe made detailed comments in response to the pre-launch consultat
defaultion.  We reiterate three key points:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWith these qualificatio
defaultns we believe that these policies have an important contribution to developing a better approach to energy efficiency in buildings.

default&#xa0;
defaultBiomass is attractive for heat production from a cost, 
defaultflexibility and GHG perspective. 
default 
defaultH
defaultowever for the latter to be truly optimised, good accounting 
defaultmethodology is required in order to facilitate informed choices about biomass feedstock type
default, agricultural practices
default, transportation choice
defaults, and conversion technologies.  Increasing the amount of sustainably produced biomass removes carbon dioxide from th
defaulte atmosphere.  Incentivising the use of biomass for energy production does not necessarily lead to an overall increase in 
defaultsustainable
default production.
default&#xa0;
defaultAny methodology needs to strike an appropriate b
defaultalance between robustness
default, tractability and auditability. 
defaultThe
default effects of direct land use c
defaulthange are not fully supported by sufficient scientific evidence and 
defaultindirect land use c
defaulthange effects add further complexity
default. 
default 
defaultCurrent methodology for accou
defaultnting for lifecycle GHGs does not
default take account of the length of time tak
defaulten for carbon emissions released from biomass combustion to be removed from
default the atmosphere (carbon debt).  
defaultIt also allows generators to use default values instead of actual values for many of the GHG sustainability criteria calculations, without verificati
defaulton. Therefore these 
defaultare
default na
defaulttural improvements, which we understand are receiving attention.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ETI E
defaultcosystem Land Use Modelling (E
defaultLUM
default)
default project is collecting detailed 
defaultexperimental 
defaultdata on the changes to soil carbon and GHG emissions associated with land us
defaulte transitions to bioenergy 
defaultcrops 
defaultin the UK, and will generate significant evidence to inform the debate on carbon accounting of biomass production and associated land use change.  For UK biomass production it is much easier to understand the counterfactual
default – what would have happened if biomass had not been grown and used for energy production.  Nevertheless there may well be opportunities for 
defaultGHG
default reduction by using imported bioenergy
default, provided confidence can be es
defaulttablished in the counterfactual and the cred
defaultit is not claimed under agriculture by the producer and 
defaultunder 
defaultenergy by the UK consumer.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe understand that these guidelines are currently under review
default.  Current cr
defaultiteria cover
default 
defaultland use change and GHG emissions. 
defaultWe note
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHe
defaultat is currently generated mainly by the combustion of gas, oil, wood and coal.  All of these generate nitrogen oxides (Nox) and all but gas generate some level of particulates.  Large central generation plant addresses these emissions more effectively than
default smaller CHP generators.  Road traffic is a very signif
defaulticant source of these emissions, especially in terms of individual exposure.
default&#xa0;
defaultTypically we would expect well-designed biomass CHP schemes to produce lower levels of emissions than existing 
defaultoil-fired or
default coal heating systems
default.  The overall production of Nox from a CHP scheme compared to domestic boilers and central generation is unlikely to be problematic in terms of air quality in urban areas, although this should be considered in planning and siting.
default&#xa0;
defaultA
defaultdvanced technology for g
defaultasification of biomass and wastes enables clean-up of emissions and may be attractive for this reason in addition to its likely cost and efficiency benefits.  
defaultThe ETI Waste Gasification project is currently investigating the overall
default efficiency and carbon balance of th
defaultree
default technolog
defaulties
default, at a scale suitable for deployment at the ‘town’ level. The evidence generated from this project will accelerate the ability to provide 
defaultvery 
defaultclean CHP in more challenging air quality locations.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have estimated the costs of providing comfort and cleanliness in a typical dwelling using either a modern condensing combi-boiler or a very high efficiency air-source heat pump, such as 
defaultthose
default now being launched in
default the UK market.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe annualised cost of 
defaultthe combi-boiler is £930, of which £645 is gas costs at retail prices and the rest is maintenance and boiler capital charges.  The annualised cost of the heat pum
defaultp is £1265, of which £205 is fuel cost
default at wholesale prices and the rest is the capital and ope
defaultrating costs, including the heat-pump, but also electricity generation 
defaultby a modern Combined Cycle Gas-Turbine 
default(CCGT) 
defaultand

default.  This calculation 
defaultincludes an allowance for upgrading the electricity distribution system.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultcombi-boiler produc

default/year and the heat-pump 1.8.  Whereas the heat-pump can be made nearly zero-carbon by using a low carbon source, the gas-boiler emissions can only be reduced by some combination of increased insulation, reduced comfort and cleanliness and redu

default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOur response 
defaultrecently 
defaultto the 
defaultEnergy and Climate 
defaultChange Committee’s c
defaultonsultation on Local Energy 
defaultdescribed several barriers
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultCommunity he
defaultating via CHP has to compete with 
defaultdomestic 
defaultgas.  
defaultCommunity heating via CHP
default can achieve a 30% primary fuel use reduction.  
defaultHowever t
defaulthe lower
default operating costs a
defaultre offset by
default higher capital costs.  The technology is 
defaultgenerally 
defaultwell known and well established, 
defaultwith some potential for improvements, but the main barriers are 
defaultmostly 
defaultfinancial and commercial:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe note that 
defaultt
defaulthere is 
defaultno framework 
defaultcurrently 
defaultto support
default integrated local future planning to utilise waste heat from existing 
defaultindustrial 
defaultplants and 
defaultlarge thermal
default generating stations for community heat.
default&#xa0;
defaultTypically infrastructure projects of a similar nature (such as water supply,
default waste treatment and electricity) have been originally developed by governments at very low 
defaultcosts of capital and or discount rates, making these projects more attractive. This is also comparable 
defaultto other
default infrastructure projects such as railways, roads and 
defaultair
defaultports.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe only heating solution which has strategic flexibility is District Heating, which ETI analysis suggest
defaults
default could apply to up to 40% of buildings in the UK, although dense inner city areas would be the best location for in
defaultitial investment.  
default&#xa0;
defaultUntil we are confident of the timing of decarbonisation of electricity generation in the UK, the
default high cost of heat-pumps
default 
defaultmakes them a problematic investment at a mass-scale.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultcombination of a small heat-pump with a gas boiler is potentially attractive in terms of maximising the return on the system efficiency benefits of the heat-pump and the ability of the gas boiler t
defaulto meet the relatively infrequent peak heat loading requirements at low capital cost.
default  Units designed for this application are starting to be launched in the UK.
default We note these hybrids are not supported by the domestic RHI.
default&#xa0;
defaultUntil Smart Meters are widespread
default and we can see how variable electricity pricing works in practice, there are significant risks in projecting demand and supply side responses to this new relationship.  While consumers are used to complex tariffs for wholly private services such as hotel 
defaultrooms and air travel, there is a tendency to simplify the tariffs for regulated services.  Clearly this can drive very significant cost increases 
defaultthrough under-use of the expensive assets involved.  These will be borne ultimately by consumers.
default&#xa0;
defaultHeating sys
defaulttems design and control will have to develop significantly in the UK if the benefits of new technologies are to be exploited.  
defaultBad publicity
default stories attached to new heating technologies provide evidence of the risks.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is a very important question in terms of longer term strategy.  We are not aware of any authoritative analysis for the UK that covers the complex social, technological, economic and climate change issues 
defaultinvolved.  We anticipate that activities already planned by the Research Councils UK Energy Programme will provide better evidence for policy development over the next few years.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultn/a
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThe answer to this depends on many factors which are beyond the remit of the ETI and we therefore cannot answer the question directly.  We note however that:
default&#xa0;
defaultWe also note that DECC has
default included detailed monitoring within the implementation which will enable the scheme performance to be accurately assessed.  We understand the initial objec
defaulttives of this scheme are to drive supply-side innovation and capacity building and gain valuable learning as a basis for future policy development.  We cannot see any significant opportunities for improvement.
default&#xa0;
defaultNo doubt the level of tariffs will be much de
defaultbated.  In our view it is difficult to discover the appropriate market level of tariffs prior to launching a scheme and prudent use of social resources would argue for a moderate but realistic start point.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe assume this question refers to thermal storage within buildings, since there are already market
default mechanisms to reward thermal storage in commercial settings, such as heating networks.  
defaultWhere district heating is likely to be the long-term best heating option for a group of dwellings, then providing financial support for retaining or installing storage
default in individual buildings would be an unproductive use of social resources, with distribution-scale storage more appropriate.  
defaultGiven the current limited coverage of 
defaultdomestic 
defaultheating networks, we will not make f
defaulturther comments, although large-
defaultscale geologica
defaultl 
defaultheat 
defaultstorage has been the subject of
default preliminary
default ETI r
defaultesearch
default, along with geo
defaultlogical storage of hydrogen 
defaultas the lowest cost seasonal low carbon energy store.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is limited value in thermal storage for buildings heated by gas or oil and much 
defaultof
default this is being removed because of the very high 
defaultutility
default of space in the UK, modest efficiency gains and industry practise
default (wall mounted combi-boilers)
default.  Electrically heated buildings typically include significant storage in the form of storage radiators or
default large structural thermal mass (such as underfloor heating).
default  There are already tariff structures, such as Economy 7 that reward storage associated with electrical heating, either resistive or heat-pump based.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis question is really about preparing for the future in buildings where heat-pumps are likely to be the best solution.  
defaultCurrent key government actions in this area include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultUnder 
defaultour 
defaultSSH
default 
defaultProgramme 
defaultwe are launching a wide range of projects which examine the role of storage technologies as part of an integrated systems solution for different types of location across the UK
default, working closely with selected local authorities.
default&#xa0;
defaultUntil there is a compelling evidence base to support policy development and an overall strategy for the development of the UK energy system
default the only area of additional activity we would recommend is to en
defaultsure that new build properties include sufficient hot water storage to avoid demand peaking for domestic water heating.  This is on the grounds that it will be hard to retrofit these properties with heat stores later, once the requirements are clear.  New 
defaultbuild properties should have relatively low space heating demands and good design practise would include sufficient thermal mass to avoid temperature swings.
