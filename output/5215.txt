[[[Written evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire [CST0070]]]]&#xa0;Thank you very much for your letter regarding your inquiry into crime statistics. I hope the below will assist your Committee in forming an overview of the recording and use of crime statistics in North Yorkshire.&#xa0;My Police and Crime Plan contains no specific targets for crime. Currently, our only objectives are broad, but are the focus of our work in North Yorkshire. We have one specific overarching goal, which is to maintain North Yorkshire as the safest county in England.&#xa0;More generally, I am reviewing my Police and Crime Plan at the moment, and am developing a more thorough system for measuring performance. This will be based on outcomes rather than fulfilling targets, and I hope to publish the renewed plan in the summer.&#xa0;At this stage, it is hard to disaggregate police performance to know what effect the wholesale removal of targets has had in North Yorkshire. It is also important to bear in mind that other police agencies, such as HMIC, and to a large extent the general public, still judge police forces by targets, and one target in particular- crime coming down. This has had an impact on police culture generally, but as explained above, I hope to be able to implement a new series of outcomes measures rather than a reliance on targets.&#xa0;It is also important to note that we would welcome the increase in the reporting of some crimes. We know anecdotally that domestic abuse, sexual abuse, rural crime and hate crime (amongst others) are all historically under-reported. The opening of a new Sexual Assault Referral Centre in York has led to an increase in crimes being reported, but this is welcome as we are now able to support more victims of this terrible crime.&#xa0;On the accuracy and assuredness of crime figures more generally, we have a robust system of checks and balances in North Yorkshire.&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
