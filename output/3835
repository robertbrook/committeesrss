default“It is also plain that so serious a sanction taken against a professional individual as erasure from the medical record is of such a nature that, if injustice was done, however long ago, it is time that it was remedied. Delay cannot be an excuse for failing to do that. None of the delay, it seems has arisen as a result of the fault of the applicant.”

default    “The Criminal Records Review will examine whether the criminal records regime strikes the 
default    right balance between respecting civil liberties and protecting the public. It is expected to make   
default            proposals to scale back the use of systems involving criminal records to common sense levels.”
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a result of the review there have been changes which enable rehabilitated persons to 
defaultre-establish their lives, in a way that doctors are unable to.
