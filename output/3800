defaultThe PLA welcome a focus on learning

defaultthat only 35 per cent of prisons were judged good and he added “
defaultIf these figures related to our schools, there would be a national outcry

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1 
default‘Offender learning’ is the responsibility of the De
defaultpartment for Business, Innovation
default and Skills, however it is clearly impacted by policies from other departments including Ministry of Justice, NOMS, Department of Education for under 18s,
default the Home Office,
default the Department for Work and Pensions, Department for Communities and Local Governmen
defaultt and the Treasury.
default  There are also a wide range of education providers and voluntary sector organisations working in this sector.
default&#xa0;
default2.2 
defaultTo bring together some of these key stakeholders, Prisoners Education Trust established the Prisoner Learning Alliance (
defaultPLA) in November 2012.  The aim of the PLA is:  
default&#xa0;
default'To bring together diverse non-statutory stakeholders with senior cross-departmental officials, to provide expertise and strategic vision to inform future priorities, policies and practices relating to pris
defaulton education, learning and skills'.
default&#xa0;
default2.3 
defaultParliament should consider how best it can ensure that there is scrutiny of these different government departments and how effectively they work together to achieve overall rehabilitation outcomes.  
defaultWe therefore welcome the Justice Select Committee inquiry on the issue of a co-ordinated approach crime reduction, including reducing reoffending.    
default2.4
default 
defaultIn our meetings and roundtable focus groups, we have been grappling with some fundamental strategic i
defaultssues including the purpose of education in prison, how to develop a learning culture and how to improve the learning journey in custody and through the gat
defaulte.  
defaultIt is vital that we address these questions now
default,
default when so much is changing so rapidly in the Crim
defaultinal Justice environment. For example, 2012/13 saw the introduction of phase four of the Offender Learning and Skills contracts which
default 
defaultare still

defaultwe will shortly see the introduction of resettlement and non-resettlement prisons, Secure Colleges a
defaultnd Community Rehabilitation Companies; and, alongside all of this,

default 
defaultIn our first

default ‘

default,

default the 
defaultPLA 
defaulttackles strategic questions about using limited 
defaultand reducing
default 
defaultresources to help secure the best outcome
defaults,
default so that prisoners can desist from crime and make a positive contribution to their families and society.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default 
defaultIn this time of unprecedented change, it is 
defaultcrucial
default that the role of learning in achieving rehabilitation outcomes is championed at the highest levels. The increas
defaultingly
default complex 
defaultmatrix
default 
defaultof providers and commissioners means that improved co-ordination is key
default,
default 
defaultfrom a government departmental level down to a local level. Aligning outcomes would help ensure that different stakeholders’ policies do not conflict with each othe
defaultr,
default and that cutting costs in one area does not inadvertently damage opportunities for makin
defaultg greater cost savings elsewhere through reducing reoffending. 
default&#xa0;
default2.7
default 
defaultWe believe 
defaultthat
default 
defaulta more joined-up, outcome-focused and value-driven approach should 
defaultlead
default 
defaultto 
defaultimprovements
default,
default and shape how the Offender Learning and Skills contracts evolve to fit the new criminal justice l
defaultandscape (see A
defaultnnex B for the Executive Summary
default)
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.8 Improved mechanisms to share data between stakeholders and government departments is essential for a mo
defaultre co-ordinated approach.
default&#xa0;
default2.9 
defaultThe current narrow focus on employability
default can potentially exclude potential learners, including older prisoners, carers (including single mothers), high risk/lifer prisoners, prisoners from BAME backgrounds and prisoners with addictions or mental health problems and learners with learning difficu
defaultlties or disabilities.  
defaultThere
defaultfore there
default should be a broad vision of successful rehabilitation outcomes for learning.
default defaultLearning outcomes in prison should focus on giving prisoners the ability to cope with life in and out of prison (resilience), the ability t
defaulto desist from offending (desistance) and the ability to make a positive contribution to their family and community. These outcomes may encompass
default,
default but go far beyond
default,
default helping a prisoner have a job on release.
default 
default3.1 T
defaulthe MoJ are implementing significant cost savings as part of the ‘fair and sustainable’ agenda.  The PLA heard evidence 
defaultthat this policy was making it harder on the ground to achieve rehabilitation outcomes in custody.  Although the MoJ may be making initial savings in the prison estate, if this makes it harder to ac
defaulthieve rehabilitation and desista
defaultnce outcomes, then the pre
defaultdicted savings as a result of reduced reoffending will not be achieved.  Therefore a balance needs to be struck between the two competing policy agendas in order for the economics to add up.      
default&#xa0;
default3.2 O
defaultne Governor who spoke to the PLA said;
default 
default“The challenges are 
defaultcuts in funding, staffing cuts, low staff morale and being expected to do more with less. It is the most difficult time I have experienced in 25 years.  
defaultI would like a ‘utopia’ where a high level of education, training and work are avai
defaultlable to prisoners, but in reality all we can do is teach prisoners about doing an honest day
default’
defaults work and sticking to a job which involves doing the same tasks each day.  With another 5 million being taken out of the budget this year, partnerships are key. 
defaultWe have a contract to repair bed sheets and iron dressing downs. I realise this is low level work, but the contract has an output that can make us a profit”.
default3.3 
defaultA prison officer who attended the expert roundtable said
default “One of the biggest problems is cutti
defaultng staff numbers, so it will be difficult to get people to education.  If you’ve got someone on an education course but you can’t get them out they will loose interest.  It worries me as education is important.  With education behind them it’s more likely 
defaultthey won’t re-offend.  If they are serious about reducing reoffending them they can’t cut more staff”.
default  
default&#xa0;
default3.4 
defaultThe PLA were also told about specialist prison officer staff, for example those who provide sports courses in the gym, being moved back onto the w
defaultings for generic duties as staff are cut.  This reduces the amount of embedded learning and makes learning more siloed to just the education department, reducing the number of potential ‘hooks’ for learning
default that are so important to engage ‘hard to reach’ l
defaultearners
default.  
default&#xa0;
default3.5 
defaultAnother participant from the voluntary sector said they had noticed staff cuts making it harder for charities providing learning activities to gain access
default and be escorted;
default sometimes they would arrive but not be allowed in.
default So even when organisations offer to resource activity from charitable funds, prisons find it difficult to use them.
default One recommendation was to increase the ability of such organisations to carry keys.  One participant prison educator said they relied on in
defaultput from the voluntary sector to liven up her curriculum “
defaultprojects in prisons need to continue so that is the norm.  Prison education is really dry – we didn’t have their input it would be dire.  We need hooks.  They shouldn’t just come in once a year, it 
defaultshould be regular”.
default  
default&#xa0;
default3.6 
defaultA prison teacher told the PLA that due to staffing cuts, association time was being severely restricted, so prisoners were telling her they now had to decide between coming to education or taking a shower.  She had learners who v
defaultalued education and so came to class, but apologised for smelling as they had not washed for several days.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1 In a nutshell, the impact of transforming rehabilitation on improving outcomes will depend crucially on how the changes are implemented and the relationships between the new and existing structures.  Uncoordinated or poorly thought through 
defaultimplementation would risk deterioration in outcomes.
default4.2 
defaultThe department with responsibility for ‘offender learning’ is Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS).  Through BIS the Offender Learning and Skills Service (OLASS) contracts are commissioned.  OLASS i
defaults currently in phase four, with three year contracts having been commissioned starting in summer 2012 to four educat
defaultion providers covering ten
default OLASS regions.  As these contracts will come to an end in summer 2015, a decision will need to be made by BIS whe
defaultther to extend the contracts or to re-tender.  This decision is however impacted by the Transforming Rehabilitation (TR) policies of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ).   TR and OLASS policies need to be joined-up if they are to lead to desistance outcomes.  Wi
defaultthout sufficient co-ordinat
defaultion there is a risk of conflict
default.
default4.
default3 
defaultTR has divided up England and Wales into 21 Contract Package Areas (CPAs)
default, which do not directly match the ten OLASS areas
default.  This add
defaults
default an additional layer of complexity to the regional systems
default and may therefore lead to reduced accountability.  This could ultimately lead to detrimental outcomes
default for the prisoner learners. 
defaultThis is exacerbated by the mismatch in time periods between the different contracts.
default4.
default4
default defaultUnder TR prisons will be divided into
default two types; resettlement and non-resettlement prisons.  Resettlement prisons are 
defaultintended
default 
defaultto be local to where the prisoner will be released.  The MoJ state that “
defaultIt is envisaged that the creation of resettlement prisons will present opportunities to creat
defaulte better continuity of service for offenders, in relation to wider mainstream and co-commissioned services. For instance, MoJ is testing, with the Department of Health, an ’end-to-end’ approach to tackling addiction from custody into the community”.
default  This 
default‘end to end’ approach should also be applied to education and training between the two departments for the benefit of the learner.  
default4.
default5 
defaultIt appears that prisoners will start their sentence in a resettlement prison, but if they are serving longer than six m
defaultonths in custody, they will be transferred to a non-resettlement prison, but will return to their resettlement prison three months prior to release.  This would mean a shift in curriculum focus for different prisons. OLASS contracts will need to be suffici
defaultently flexible to respond to the differing needs of the two types of prison populations.   
default4.
default6
default defaultResettlement prisons, being the first port of call for a prisoner, will also need to take a greater role in ensuring there is sufficient induction and assessmen
defaultt processes and to developing a learning plan, as this should then determine which non-resettlement prison a prisoner attends that would best meet their learning needs.    
default4.
default7 
defaultIn resettlement prisons education providers will be working with short sentence
defaultd prisoners with limited time for learning and competing priorities to sort out other resettlement issues such as accommodation, benefits, children and support for addictions if relevant.  However there will also need to be a focus on planning for transiti
defaulton to education, training or employment (ETE) after release.  
defaultIn order to make the most of the short time available, some learning opportunities should be available at evenings and weekends and in-cell.  
default4.
default8
default defaultI
defaultn non-resettlement prisons
default, with longer 
defaultsentenced prisoners,
default there may need to be additional flexibility to support distance learning and higher level qualifications to enable progression for those who have time to reach higher levels.  Non-resettlement prisons are also likely to be working or t
defaultraining prisons, therefore the contracts will need to enable providers to provide vocational and embedded learning to go alongside work activity.  
default4.
default9
default 
defaultNon-resettlement prisons may also have more very long sentenced prisoners and therefore will need to ensu
defaultre that informal and creative learning opportunities are available for those prisoners to be able to cope with their sentences.  
default4.
default10 
defaultIn non-resettlement prisons there will be longer-sentenced prisoners providing a more stable population with more time to
default focus on learning. 
defaultHowever t
defaulthere is a danger that due to the 
defaultcurrent 
defaultfocus placed on the beginning and end of the sentence, there is a gap in learning in the middle of the sentence
default.
default  
defaultTime spent in a non-resettlement prison is valuable time to learn knowle
defaultdge, skills and personal development.  If left until a prisoner arrives back at a resettlement prison in the last three months this will be too late and valuable time to be engaged in productive activity, working towards the process of desistance, will hav
defaulte been wasted.      
default4.
default11
default defaultLonger term prisoners coming back to resettlement prisons at the end of their sentence may have started a course of learning in the non-resettlement prison and therefore require support to complete that course of study and take th
defaulte appropriate assessment to gain the qualification. 
default4.
default12 
defaultCRCs, paid by their ability to reduce reoffending, will be interested to work with OLASS providers to ensure the learning in prison is preparing prisoners towards desistance.  However currently OLAS
defaultS providers have no incentive to consider whether the learning and curriculum they provide contributes to desistance.  They are encouraged to think about employability, although are paid by numbers of accreditations rather than by outcomes of prisoners ent
defaultering employment.  
default4.
default13 
defaultT
defaulthe Ministry of Justice has stated that there is a ‘complex relationship’ between employment and reducing reoffending and that there are other factors which contribute to the process of desistance.  This could therefore lead to c
defaultonflict between the CRC who will
default favour a desistance-led approach and the OLASS providers who
default will favour an accreditation / employability
default-led approach.
default  
default&#xa0;
default4.
default14 
defaultUnder current TR arrangements CRCs will not have a say in the education and training provision 
defaultin non-resettlement prisons.  However, what happens in non-resettlement prisons will impact the CRCs
default’
default ability to achieve their reducing reoffending results.  If the time in the non-resettlement prison has been used productively, including access to learnin
defaultg, the prisoner in question will be in a better position to prepare for resettlement than a prisoner who has not been engaged in learning.  By aligning the focus on rehabilitation outcomes of primary and secondary desistance for both the OLASS provider and
default CRC, this should enable them to work closer together for the benefit of the prisoner learner whether at a resettlement or non-resettlement prison.  Without this, there risks an approach which focuses solely on the final months of a sentence and valuable t
defaultime earlier in the sentence to engage and progress with learning has been lost.   
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default5
default 
defaultAnother issue is the 
defaultmismatch in 
defaultcontract length
defaults which adds additional complexity.  The c
defaultontract length for CRCs will be 7 to 10 years, with the option to extend by 
defaultup to 3 years.  Current
defaultly OLASS contracts are for 3
default years, with the option to extend.  The PLA roundtables heard from practitioners about the disruption caused each time the contracts are re-tendered and the length of time it can take to ‘bed-in’.  OLASS p
defaultroviders also told us that the short contract terms can disincentivise investment in capital projects, such as vocational training or social enterprises.  Another disadvantage of shorter contract terms is that it prevents the collection of longitudinal dat
defaulta about ‘what works’.  This does not matter when the focus is on output measures such as number of accreditations, how ever if there is a move towards outcome desistance based measures, then shorter contracts will make longitudinal data collection of outco
defaultmes more difficult.  These considerations must of course be balanced with the need to hold providers to account and therefore if contract terms were lengthened, other strong measures of accountability would need to be in place. 
default4.1
default6
default 
defaultAnother concern about 
defaultthe contract length for CRCs is that prisoners who will not be released within that contract term may ‘fall between the gaps’ as CRCs have no incentive to be interested in that prisoner as they will not impact their payment by results.  Therefore mechanism
defaults
default should be in place to ensure longer sentenced prisoners have access to learning, despite not being released within the contract term.  
default4.17
default defaultUnder TR prisoners subject to Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) and those who pose highest risk
default to the public will be managed by the new National Probation Service, rather than by the CRCs.  Therefore NPS will need to work more closely with the education provider to ensure that these ‘high risk’ and MAPPA prisoners are able to access appropriate lea
defaultrning.  
defaultGiven that these prisoners are most likely to find it challenging to find traditional employment, an OLASS approach solely focused on employment is likely to exclude these prisoners.  Therefore, as described in chapter one, a ‘whole-person’ and des
defaultistance – led approach to learning would be of benefit, for example by ensuring that Offending Behaviour Programmes are combined with appropriate personal and social development and other learning activities to ensure the soft skills / intermediate outcome
defaults are pract
defaultised and developed over time (NOMS, 2013).
default&#xa0;default4.18
default defaultTherefore in formulating sentence plans and learning plans there should be mechanisms to ensure a joined up approach between the NPS and OLASS providers to meet the needs of these prisoners. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCondefaultclusiondefaultGiven the importance of achieving reductions in reoffending and the increasingly complex matrix of governmental and other stakeholders involved, co-ordination and accountability is vital. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn this time of unprecedented change, it is 
defaultcrucial
default that the role of learning in achieving rehabilitation outcomes is championed at the highest levels. The increas

default

default And 
defaultthe impact of transforming rehabilitation on improving outcomes will depend crucially on how the changes are implemented.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PLA recommend that parliament should consider how best it can ensure that there is scrutiny of these different g
