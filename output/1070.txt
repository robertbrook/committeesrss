[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]This memorandum is submitted in response to an invitation from the Committee.  My professional experience includes both the ECHR and EU law, as a professor of law, as a barrister and Queen’s Counsel, and for more than 17 years as an Advocate General at the European Court of Justice.

[[[ The issue of denying prisoners voting rights]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]My observations will be confined to the issue of principle:  the question of a total ban on prisoners’ voting.

[[[&#xa0;]]]It is helpful to address this issue by examining the first three questions raised in the Call for Evidence.&#xa0;

[[[I.1.]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Question 1.  ]]]

[[[What are the historical and philosophical justifications for denying prisoners the right to vote?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I.1.1.              The historical justifications &#xa0;Historically, convicted criminals were “outlaws”, who could be killed on sight.  Under the common law, outlawry evolved into “attainder”, the status of all those convicted of felonies.  That status entailed the loss of all civil rights, and amounted to “civic death”.   &#xa0;I.1.2.              It is surely clear that such historical justifications cannot have great force in the 21st century, even though the long history of the ban has been much relied upon as a justification.  (In the 2011 debate in the House of Commons, for example, it was stated:  “We decided in this country centuries ago that convicted criminals should not have the right to vote”.)   It would widely be regarded as regrettable if the current penal system were to be judged by  the standards which prevailed centuries ago.&#xa0;I.1.3.              It may be thought that the Grand Chamber of the Court was therefore correct in Hirst in refusing to attach value to a long-standing ban in the absence of an assessment of its appropriateness in the light of modern penal policy and current human rights standards.  &#xa0;I.1.4.              There is however one historical development of particular significance:  the introduction of postal voting under the Representation of the People Act 1948.  This made prisoners’ voting a practical possibility.&#xa0;I.1.5.              The philosophical justifications&#xa0;Until recently there was relatively little debate in Britain about the philosophical justification for denying prisoners the right to vote. The justification was partly historical, and there was no recent debate on the issue in Parliament or, apparently, beyond.  One of the consequences of the ECHR was the need to consider justifications seriously.  So for example the UK in Hirst put forward careful argument which was in part accepted by the Court.&#xa0;I.1.6.              Several strands can be discerned in the recent debate on the issue of whether as a matter of principle a ban is justified.  A brief comment may be made on the various strands.&#xa0;I.1.7. (1)              Can the ban be justified as part of the offender’s punishment?  In general, the loss of amenities which accompanies incarceration can be seen as part of the offender’s punishment.  It is not obvious however that deprivation of the right to vote is very significant in this context.  (See below, under question 3.)&#xa0;I.1.7. (2)              Can the ban be justified as enhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law?  This was part of the argument advanced by the UK in the Hirst case and was accepted in principle as a justification by the Court.  However it could clearly also be argued that, on the contrary, and in contrast with deprivation of other amenities, to allow certain categories of prisoner to vote would “enhance civic responsibility”.&#xa0;I.1.8. (1)              Can the ban be justified as an “inherent feature” of imprisonment? In the early years of the Convention, the European Commission of Human Rights regularly argued that certain restrictions of human rights were an “inherent feature” of imprisonment, or that certain limitations on human rights were “inherent limitations”, i.e. limitations inherent in imprisonment.  So for example a prohibition on correspondence by prisoners was regarded as an inherent limitation.  That approach was dropped about forty years ago: it was recognised by the Court and the Commission that such limitations and restrictions must be justified by one of the public interests recognised under the Convention.&#xa0;

[[[I.2.]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Question 2.   ]]]

[[[Why is the right to vote considered to be a human right?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I.2.1.              The right to vote has long been considered a constitutional and human right.  It is recognised as such in the leading universal instrument on human rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966 (Article 25).   It is routinely included in modern constitutions and bills of rights.  It would no doubt be included in any new British Bill of Rights.  This does not mean that there cannot be limitations on the right to vote.  But it does mean that any such limitation must be properly justified as appropriate and necessary, that is, as proportionate  The reasons why the right to vote is, and should be, considered a human right may emerge from the following brief discussion.

[[[&#xa0;]]]I.2.2.              This question can best be considered in the context of the ECHR provisions themselves.  Consideration of those provisions will suggest why the right to vote is and should be regarded as a human right.  It is true that Article 3 of the First Protocol is not drafted in the same manner as the other provisions; it does not, on the model of most of the other provisions, explicitly provide   (perhaps with certain limitations) “Everyone has the right to vote …”.  Article3 provides as follows:  “The High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.”&#xa0;I.2.3.              Nevertheless it seems clear that the article must be regarded as providing for a right to vote, and it has long been so interpreted by the Court.  A right to vote can readily be implied in the article:  that view is supported by the following considerations. &#xa0;I.2.4.

[[[              ]]]

[[[First]]], the essential requirements for a right to qualify as a human right are, broadly speaking, first, that it is fundamental, and second, that it is in principle – subject to possible exceptions – to be available to everyone.  Few would dispute, since the advent of universal suffrage, that there is such a right to vote:  it is fundamental, and it is a right for everyone, in the sense that any exceptions (for example, minors, possibly convicted prisoners, etc.)  must be properly justified.                I.2.5.              

[[[Second]]], it would make little sense to include the provision in the ECHR, which is after all a Convention on human rights, if the right to vote, which is implicit in, and is the key to, the provision were not a human right.&#xa0;I.2.6.              

[[[Third]]], it would make it impossible to enforce the provision under the ECHR’s system of access for individuals to an international Court.  (A case could be brought before the Court by another Contracting State, but such cases are almost never brought: there have been very few in the entire 60-year history of the Convention.)&#xa0;I.2.7.              

[[[Fourth]]], the right is indeed a human right since it underpins many of the other rights and is fundamental to the very existence of a modern democratic society.  There is throughout the Convention a close link with democracy, a link which is also emphasised in the preamble.  Convention rights and their limitations are safeguarded by national law, which is underpinned by a democratic system of government.  However that does not of course entitle even a democratically elected legislature to override human rights.  The position of the UK Parliament is particularly important in this respect:  in many European States and other democracies around the world, human rights are protected by constitutional courts and supreme courts whose decisions prevail over parliamentary legislation.  Thus the UK Parliament has a special responsibility for the protection of human rights in the United Kingdom.&#xa0;I.2.8.              Because of its fundamental importance in a democracy, voting is, unusually, regarded as not only a right but a duty.  In most systems, it is a moral and political duty rather than a legal duty (in some legal systems it is also a legal duty, and a failure to vote is penalised). &#xa0;I.2.9.              It may also be thought that, if voting is properly regarded as a duty, a total ban on prisoners voting is more difficult to defend.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Excursus on EU law]]]&#xa0;From the letter inviting me to give evidence to the Committee, I gather that I am also expected to consider EU law. The right to vote is also a fundamental right in EU law.  (The term “fundamental right” is generally used in EU law, rather than “human right”, but the meaning is essentially the same.) &#xa0;I.2.11.              Elections to national parliaments are not regulated by EU law.  However, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, first adopted in 2000, includes as fundamental rights the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament and in municipal elections.   The right to vote in elections to the European Parliament also falls within Article 3 of the First Protocol to the ECHR.  Since those Charter rights which correspond to Convention rights are to be interpreted in the same way as the Convention rights, it can be argued, on  that ground also, that a total ban on prisoner voting in elections to the European Parliament, and perhaps also to some extent in municipal elections,  infringes the Charter and therefore the EU Treaty.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[I.3.]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Question 3.  ]]]

[[[Is disqualifying prisoners from voting a suitable part of their punishment?]]]&#xa0;I.3.1.              This must be to some extent a matter of opinion.  Disqualification from voting may seem to some rather inappropriate as a punishment.  They may see a positive value in giving the vote to certain categories of prisoners – for example, those serving short sentences, or those in open prisons nearing the end of their sentence.  And some of those who support denying prisoners the vote may accept that its significance as a punishment is modest.  Considered on top of incarceration itself, with the attendant humiliations and with all the restrictions which incarceration necessarily entails, it may be thought that deprivation of the vote is symbolic rather than part of the punishment.  It certainly seems unlikely to have any deterrent value.  It may well be thought however that at any rate prisoners convicted of serious offences should not be allowed to vote. &#xa0;I.3.2.              It will be the essential task of Parliament to decide how the balance should be struck to take account of these views:  and it seems that the Court’s judgment gives sufficient latitude to enable an appropriate balance to be struck while complying with the essential requirement of the judgment.&#xa0;

[[[II]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[The issue of compliance with the judgment of the Strasbourg Court.]]]&#xa0;II.1.              Parliament’s concern at the judgment is understandable on several counts.&#xa0;II.2.              The Committee finds itself in an unusual situation, in which it is called upon to consider for itself how to respond to the Court’s judgment.   Conflicting signals have come from the Government.  Even the Court has not given a clear signal on how to comply.  And the subject matter – the election of Members of Parliament – is manifestly one of special concern to Parliament.&#xa0;II.3.              However, two points do seem clear beyond doubt.  First, there is an obligation to comply with the judgment – this will be discussed below.  Second, it should be seen as an advantage that the judgment gives sufficient scope for a reasonable solution to be found.  Thus a measure which makes some significant provision for voting rights, replacing the current total ban, would be sufficient to comply with the judgment; and it would be for the Committee and ultimately for Parliament to find the best solution.As for the obligation to comply with the judgment, there is no doubt whatever about the principle.II.4.

[[[              ]]]

[[[First]]]

[[[,]]] it would be flagrantly illegal not to comply with the judgment.  It would be illegal under international law, not domestic law, but there should be no doubt whatever that international law is binding on the UK.  It is moreover a treaty obligation, one to which the United Kingdom has signed up.&#xa0;II.5.              Article 46(1) of the ECHR provides:  “The High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the final judgment of the Court in any case where they are parties.”&#xa0;II.6.              In the United Kingdom treaty obligations are not directly enforceable in the courts.  But that does not mean that they are not binding on the United Kingdom.&#xa0;II.7.              Moreover the duty to comply with international law and treaty obligations is spelt out in the opening provisions of the Ministerial Code, as proclaimed by the Prime Minister when he took office in 2010.&#xa0;II.8.              “

[[[1 MINISTERS OF THE CROWN]]]&#xa0;

[[[General principle]]]&#xa0;1.1 Ministers of the Crown are expected to behave in a way that upholds the highest standards of propriety.&#xa0;1.2 The Ministerial Code should be read alongside the Coalition agreement and the background of the overarching duty on Ministers to comply with the law including international law and treaty obligations and to uphold the administration of justice and to protect the integrity of public life.”&#xa0;II.9.              The reference to “the overarching duty on Ministers to comply with the law including international law and treaty obligations” is clear and categorical.&#xa0;II.10.              It seems clear also that Parliament should not – still less, deliberately – put Ministers and the Government in breach of their duty, and put the United Kingdom in breach of its solemn legal obligations.&#xa0;II.11.              Moreover, there is an element of paradox in penalising those who break the law by a measure which is itself manifestly illegal.&#xa0;II.12.              It must also be stressed that no adverse consequences are likely to follow from a measure which gives voting rights to some prisoners.  Most European States impose limited restrictions, or no restrictions, on prisoners’ voting rights, and difficulties, of whatever kind, do not seem to have arisen.&#xa0;II.13.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Second]]], failure to comply with the judgment would seriously damage the United Kingdom’s reputation.  The United Kingdom has justifiably taken pride in the protection of human rights: plans are under way for substantial celebrations of the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta; but a serious breach of the ECHR would strike a seriously jarring note.  The United Kingdom has justifiably taken pride also in respect for the rule of law.  To select those judgments with which to comply and to reject others is profoundly inconsistent with any understanding of the rule of law.&#xa0;II.14.

[[[              ]]]

[[[Third,]]] failure to comply with the judgment would send the wrong signal to the other 46 Contracting States to the Convention.  It might encourage other States to violate the Convention, which, it may well be thought, would not be in the interests of the United Kingdom.  The United Kingdom has hitherto had an outstanding record of compliance with the Convention and, beyond the Convention and the Council of Europe, has made protection of human rights and observance of the rule of law a central plank of its policy.&#xa0;1&#xa0;  From 1974 to 1988 I was Professor of European Law at King’s College London and a practising barrister, appearing frequently, often on behalf of the United Kingdom, before the European Court of Justice; I also appeared in English courts and before the European Commission and Court of Human Rights.  From 1988 to 2006 I was an Advocate General at the European Court of Justice.  I served many years ago on the secretariat of the European Commission of Human Rights, and wrote one of the first books on the European Convention on Human Rights (Jacobs, The European Convention on Human Rights: Oxford University Press 1975; 5th edition by Ovey and White, 2010).  I am currently Professor of Law at King’s College London and a consultant on EU law and the ECHR.  I am the first President of the European Law Institute (as from 2011).  G. Streeter MP, HC Deb., vol. 523, col. 505, 10 February 2011.    Judgment of the Grand Chamber, para. 79.   See Jacobs, op.cit. (1975) pp. 198-201.   Exceptions may also be allowed for aliens, but this is provided for under Article 16 of the ECHR, which allows the Contracting States to impose restrictions on the political activities of aliens.   Article 16 (which applies to the First Protocol by virtue of Article 5 of that Protocol) therefore also shows that the exclusion of aliens from certain rights does not make those rights any the less human rights.&#xa0;                Article 39

[[[Right to vote and to stand as a candidate at elections to the European Parliament]]]1. Every citizen of the Union has the right to vote and to stand as a candidate at elections to the European Parliament in the Member State in which he or she resides, under the same conditions as nationals of that State.2. Members of the European Parliament shall be elected by direct universal suffrage in a free andsecret ballot.Article 40

[[[Right to vote and to stand as a candidate at municipal elections]]]Every citizen of the Union has the right to vote and to stand as a candidate at municipal elections in the Member State in which he or she resides under the same conditions as nationals of that State.  See Matthews v United Kingdom, judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, 18 February 1999.  Article 52(3)   of the Charter provides:  “Insofar as this Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said Convention. This provision shall not prevent Union law providing more extensive protection.”&#xa0;
