defaultDevelopment and Production of British filmsdefaultThe BBC plays a vital role as an investor in the development and production of British independent films with a budget of £11m per annum. During the current Charter period, the BFI (and before that, the UK Film Council the previous Lottery distributor for film), has co-invested in a wide range of feature films with BBC Films including 
defaultFish Tank
default, 
defaultAlan Partridge: Alpha Papa
default and 
defaultPhilomena
default.
default 
defaultWithout such investment by the BBC, audiences in the UK and internationally  would suffer from a significant reduction in the range of British films on offer, and the independent production sector in the UK would be forced to contract damaging our creative economy and in particular the capabilities of our talent and skillsbase. We therefore want to see a strong and well-funded BBC Films as a key part of the BBC throughout the next Charter period.

defaultArchivedefault&#xa0;defaultThe BFI is designated as custodian of the National TV Archive under the 2003 Communications Act. The collection comprises approximately 900,000 TV programmes, mainly from the 1970s to the present. We maintain a close relationship with the BBC on archive matters. It includes a unique continuous record of BBC broadcast output spanning 23 years.
default&#xa0;
defaultPublic access is available through our research viewings service (a BBC Charter obligation, discharged by contracting with BFI). The BFI also includes BBC archive material in its Southbank programme, on digital platforms such as Screenonline and Mediatheques, and on DVD releases. Our 
defaultDoctor 
defaultWho
default at 50 
defaultseries of events at BFI Southbank in 2013 is a prominent example of this.
default&#xa0;defaultBBC programmes based on BFI research have included 
defaultBlack and White in Colour
default, 
defaultThe Last Machine
default and 
defaultThe Lost World of Mitchell and Kenyon
default, Further programmes are being developed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BFI partnered the BBC (as well as the Open University and Teachers’ TV) in the Creative Archive experiment offering films for non-commercial repurposing. We also supplied material to The Space a pilot online initiative between the BBC and Arts Council England.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the coming years, we want to build and strengthen this working with the BBC around archive. The BFI has proposed creating a Digital National TV Archive in partnership with the BBC—bringing BBC technology and BFI legal rights together to create an innovative new public service. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBBC R&amp;D Department has long worked with the BFI, and has a technology platform which records, stores and can make available television content. In 2012 we formed a collaboration agreement with BBC to test a platform for the Digital National TV Archive. A pilot service has been available in the BFI Reuben Library for eighteen months. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are planning to build on this pilot to develop a shared service platform for the use of other national institutions with an interest in television, such as the British Library, and the wider educational community.
default&#xa0;
defaultSuch joint working between the BBC and public organisations like the BFI which share similar goals should form an important part of the BBC’s role during the next Charter period. It would help to optimise the value of the funding supplied by both the licence fee payer and the taxpayer, and help ensure that the BBC contributes to the broader culture of the UK and serves as an enabler for the wider creative economy.

default plays a crucial role in supporting and enabling education and learning at every level and for people of all ages and from all walks of life. Since its creation in 1922, the BBC has been a powerful force for good in advancing understanding and knowledge.
defaultWe are keen to explore ways in which we can help to refresh the BBC’s strategy in this sphere as part of our broader partnership discussions. We want to see how our emerging education strategy, which includes the Lottery-funded initiative Film Nation UK, can contribute to advancing film, television and the moving image in line with the objectives set out in our Royal Charter. Film Nation UK, which is aimed at 5-19 year olds, 
defaultseeks to safeguard and boost future film audiences through learning and appreciation of film and stimulate a new generation of filmmakers and film talent.

defaultPromotion of the cultural value of film and television across all BBC servicesdefault&#xa0;defaultThe BBC has a vital role to play in promoting film across a variety of services to the benefit of audiences and the film sector in the UK. At present, its radio output including regular shows such as The Film Programme and Kermode and Mayo’s Film Review, along with other one-off series’ such as the Autumn 2013 season devoted to film music provides a valuable service for audience by exploring the breadth of film culture. 
defaultHowever, although the season on music included a three-part BBC 4 series, television coverage of film culture generally is much weaker than its radio counterpart. Much of the BBC’s online coverage, including journalistic output, tends to be focussed on mainstream US films rather than on helping audiences to discover and learn more about the full range  of British and international film. 
defaultAs part of our proposed partnership with the Corporation we are keen to help 
defaultdevelop a joint edit
defaultorial proposition which helps audiences discover a much more diverse range of films using the BBC’s services and also helps strengthen our indigenous film industry. 
defaultFurthermore we believe the BBC and the BFI share a joint interest in exploring and promoting the cultural and educational value of television, as well as film.
default&#xa0;
default A joined up approach to ‘screen culture’ could yield clearer policies for its future social application.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo begin with, we believe we could quickly put together a powerful proposition around film and television culture, utilising the strength of both our own BFI Player and the iPlayer Plus that would be attractive to us both and help to significantly broaden audience appreciation and choice.
