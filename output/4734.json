"&#xa0;\nAFS0108Written evidence submitted by the New Schools Network&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNew Schools Network (NSN) is the only national charity which supports groups seeking to set up Free Schools. \nW\ne aim to improve the quality of education – particularly for the most deprived – by increasing the nu\nmber of \nnew \ninnovative, independent state-funded \nschools\n. W\ne provide free advice and support to Free School applicant groups and have helped 70% of groups a\npproved to open these schools\n.\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur suppo\nrt is available to anyone but NSN’s\n focus is on \nhelping \nteacher, \nschool,\n \nparent\n, charity \nand community groups to develop a high quality application\ns\n. \n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have restricted our responses to those elements\n of the Inquiry\n most relevant to Free Schools and \nraised some key questions that will need to be considered to \nensure that any \nsystem\n that approve\ns\n and oversee\ns\n academies – including Free Schools – \nin future \ndo\nes\n not limit the potential of these new schools to improve standards.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1&#xa0; \nT\nhe first Free Schools \nopen\ned\n \nin\n September \n2011\n \nand\n \nearly evidence \nsuggests that they are ach\nieving what the policy intended\n: \ncreating good new \nlocal \nschools. \nOf the first 24 to open\n,\n 75% have been\n rated Good or Outstanding\n by Ofsted\n compared to\n \n64\n% of Local \nAuthority (LA)\n maintained schools inspected under the same regime\n during the same perio\nd\n. In an even closer comparison, \nhalf of new local authority schools that opened at the same \ntime as the 2011 Free Schools were rated as \ngood or \noutstanding under the new Framework\n. \nNSN \nbelieve\ns\n that\n Free Schools will continue to \nraise \nstandards \nboth \ndirectly through \nthe creation of good new school\ns and\n \nindirectly through the impact they have on \nsurrounding schools \nbecause\n of the following factors\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Increase of providers within the system and the benefits of competition&#xa0;2.2&#xa0; \nThe opportunity to start a school from scratch has allowed teachers, charities, universities\n, independent schools and community groups\n (oft\nen in conjunction with parents)\n to \nbring new ideas\n and expertise into the st\nate sector, creating schools\n \nwhich offer \na new approach to meeting the needs of \npupils in their area. \nAmongst others, s\nchools have been set up by:\n&#xa0;\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n41 \nparent/community \ngroups\n,\n often in areas where new school places are needed such as \nCamden,\n \nRuncorn\n and \nLeeds\n; \n \n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n37 groups of t\neachers,\n often in areas of high deprivation such as \nGreenwich\n,\n \nKnowsley and Sheffield; \n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n27 c\nharities \nand existing \neducation \nproviders \nincluding the Nation\nal Autistic Society,\n Everton Football Club and\n \nSouthend YMCA\n;\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n21 independent \nschools, \nincluding Manchester Grammar School, \nBrighton College\n \nand Eton College; and \n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFour universities – including King\n’\ns Colleg\ne London and Exeter University.\n&#xa0;\n2.3&#xa0; \nAround 70%\n of Free Schools have opened \nin areas where there is a \nneed for new school places\n, but they are also providing new good school places in areas where existing schools are underperforming.  Introducing choice for parents has been an important rationale for \nmany groups, with 45% of pr\nimary and 34% of secondary Free \nSchools opening in areas where the number of schools rated as ‘requires improvement’ or ‘inadequate’ is at or above the national average\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.4&#xa0; \nNew schools can\n act as a \ncatalytic \nforce, particularly \nthanks to\n the support they \nreceive\n from local \nparents. \nThe fact that parents, teachers, local businesses and other interested organisations can now dem\nand, and set up, a new school\n – even where there is a surplus of places –\n challenge\ns existing schools \nto \nreassess their own educational offer and attainment, helping to raise standards across the board. Anecdotally,\n we are already beginning to see the competitive impact of\n \nFree Schools influencing the b\nehaviour of neighbouring schools\n. \nFor example, since one primary Free School in Haringey started offering an extended day, a number of local primaries have \nfollowed suit\n. Similarly, since a Free School was approved to open on the Isle of Wight next year offering pupils Latin, several local\n secondary schools have also decided to offer it.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIncreasing innovation and testing best practice &#xa0;2.5&#xa0; \nFree\n Schools are leading\n educational innovation\n. Though all mainstream Free Schools \nmust offer their \npupils a \nbroad and balanced curriculum, some of them take a different approach to \nteaching and learning\n. In many cases they \nare\n \ndrawing on\n international best practice and \nadopt\ning\n \napproaches from countries which consistently score highly in the PISA tests. Free Sch\nools are now pioneering the use of:\n \n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n‘Core Knowledge’\n curricula, \nwhich \nare \na feature of \nmany \ntop performing US states\n,\n \nis\n used by Pimlico Primary Academy to raise the cultural liter\nacy of deprived pupils\n; \n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n‘Forest School’ \neducation\n, \nwhich is popular in \nScandinavian countries\n,\n is being used by West Newcastle Academy to engage pupils and parents in one of the most deprived parts of the city; \n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n‘Maths Mastery’, \nwhich is based on the approach Singaporean schools use to teach Maths\n, \nis now being \nacross the\n \nARK\n network of\n Free Schools; \n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProject based learning\n will be used in the XP Scho\nol in Doncaster and is\n based on the success of ‘High Tech High’ in California;\n and\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBilingual\n curricul\na \nare being taught to\n students at \nBrighton Bilingual Primary School and the \nJudith Kerr School\n \nwhere\n half their \nstudies \nare conducted \nin S\npanish and German respectively. \n&#xa0;\n2.6&#xa0; \nI\nnitial indications \nalso \nsuggest that \nFree Schools \nare more likely to take advantage of \nAcademy freedoms\n than traditional \nacademies\n. \nI\nn a recent \nNSN \nsurvey\n of mainstr\neam Free Schools (\n2011 and 2012\n openers)\n, 82\n% of \nrespondents said they \nmake\n use of\n their freedo\nm to offer a longer school day compared to \n10% of Academies\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.7&#xa0; \nA\ns new schools, Free Schools have unparalleled opportunities to measure the impact of \nthese alter\nn\native approaches \nand \nso make an important contribution to improving the quality of educational research in England\n. A number of Free Schools (like School 21\n in Newham\n) are working with organisations like the Education Endowment Fund to do just \nthat.\n&#xa0;\nAllowing outstanding schools to expand and create new Academy chains&#xa0;2.8&#xa0; \nThe \nFree School\n policy i\ns \nproviding\n new \nways \nfor successful schools \nto \nexpand \ntheir educational offering, and \ndisseminate\n leadership and best practice across a wider network of schools\n. \nThis is an ar\nea \nof significant growth. In 2011 \nexisting state schools opened four \nof the \nfree \nschools set up \n(17%);\n of those expected to open in 2014 that \nhas\n risen to 41 schools (35%)\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.9&#xa0; \nIn \nsome cases, outstanding schools have set up Free Schools to replicate their existing model\ns\n. For example, Perry Beeches, an ‘outstanding’ secondary school in Bi\nrmingham has been able to open two\n \nnew\n schools in \ndeprived parts of the\n city\n where parents have \nnot \npreviously \nhad access to the same standard of education\n. In others, successful schools have been able to complement their existing provision by opening different phases or types of school. For example, \nin London,\n St Marylebone School has recently opene\nd a Special school for pupils with speech, language and communication difficulties and\n Burlington Danes Academy will \nsoon \nopen a primary school to feed into\n its existing secondary school. And this growth hasn’t been limited just to Acad\nemies.\n \nMaintained \nschools have also taken advantage of the opportunity to open Free Scho\nols\n. For example, school leaders in one of the most deprived par\nts of Barking and Dagenham \nrecently opened the Riverside School, which will share a Head with the exi\nsting Sydney Russell \nschool. They\n will open a n\new Special Free School in 2014\n. Similarly, in Slough a group of local Headteachers came together to form the SASH school \nto help to meet the\n critical need for new secondary school places in the town. \n&#xa0;\n2.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nFree School \npolicy has \na\nlso \nallowed the\n best Academy chains\n to grow rapidly, with \n45 multi-academy sponsors so far \napproved to open Free Schools, and to innovate with\nin their chain\n. For example, \nfrom next year \nthe \nHarris\n Federation\n \nwill offer academically gifted sixth formers fro\nm London’s deprived inner boroughs the chance to study at a sixth for\nm linked to Westminster School, while t\nhe Phoenix Family of Schools will be opening a b\nilingual \nprimary \nFree School\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinally\n with the policy starting to mature, we are seeing\n the emergence of the first Free School chains, with a number now looking to open a second or third school. For example, Canary Wharf College, one of the first ‘outstanding’ Free Schools, has recently \nbeen approved to \nopen\n a second primary school\n while \nKha\nlsa Primary School, a Sikh ethos Free School in \na deprived area of \nLeeds\n,\n has been approved to open another school in Bradford \nwhich will share its STEM focus. \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nReaching the most disadvantaged &#xa0;\n2.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNSN\n bel\nieves that Free Schools should be targeting\n the most deprived \npupils\n and e\narly evidence suggests \nthey are\n.\n Free School Meal (FSM) data is available for 72 of the 81 schools that opened in 2011 or 2012 and 50% of these 72 schools have more students on FSM than their \nLA\n average. At Secondary this ris\nes to 63%\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn some cases, existing schools are collaborating \nto find \nnew solutions to longstanding challenges –\n \nthe East Birmingham Network Free School\n for instance has been\n formed by local schools for pupils who have traditionally fallen out of education\n while\n th\ne London Academy of Excellence \nhas been \nset up\n by a group of independent schools to offer \nyoung people in Newham \naccess to \na\n \nhigh quality academic education\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe p\nolicy has also enabled\n dynamic groups of teachers to start schools in areas of high deprivation, often modelling themselves on some of the most successful urban Cha\nrter School chains, such as KIPP\n or Uncommon\n. \nSuch\n motivation \nis \nbehind Reach Academy \nFeltham and Greenwich Free School – both of which are led by teachers who use the same ‘no excuses’ approach, a longer school day and an emphasis on the education of pupils’ character to raise standards in those areas.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Approval3.1&#xa0; \nFree Schools \nunder\ngo a rigorous approval process,\n distinct\n from th\nat for\n both converter and sponsored academies\n. \nTh\nis\n has evolved \nin every year since the programme began\n and has built\n on the experience of each \nof the five\n \napplication wave\ns\n. \nThe tightening of this\n process was\n noted by the recent NAO report\n, which found that the DfE has, ‘incrementally improved its selection and pre-opening processes’.\n&#xa0;\n3.2&#xa0; \nThe \ncurrent \nproc\ness \nis \ndemanding\n, \nonly \n26% of applications \nsubmitted \nhave been approved by the DfE\n. A\n full s\nummary of each stage is included\n as an a\nppendix but a\n brief outline is provided\n here.\n \nAt the application stage g\nroups have to:\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSet out a strong vision for their school\n;\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDevelop detailed education, finance and \ngovernance plans\n \nand \nset out ambitious outcomes for their pupils\n;\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProve they have the capacity and capability – especially in educational expertise – to run a \ngood \nschool\n;\n and\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProve there is need and demand for the school in their community.\n&#xa0;\n3.3&#xa0; \nThis is not t\no say that further\n improvements cannot be made to the current approvals process to make it more rigorous\n. \nIn particular NSN\n believe\ns\n that greater expertise is needed when reviewing the governance elements of applications. With the growth of Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs) the complexity of governance arrangements is increasing and ensuring that groups \nhave effective structures in place to \ngovern new schools is critical.\n&#xa0;\n3.4&#xa0; \nThe fast growth of the Free Schools programme\n has also meant that the process\n \nh\nas\n \nchanged, often quite substantial\nly,\n with each wave of applications. \nHaving learned these lessons to create the more rigorous systems that are\n in place today, it will now be important to maintain these standards consistently.\n&#xa0;\n3.5&#xa0; \nOnce groups \nare approved \nto open a Free School, they \nenter a ‘pre-opening’ phase during which they have to meet fur\nther stringent targets if\n the school \nis \nto \nopen. This \nincludes developing comprehensive education plans and policies; building financial systems and recruiting pupils. They must also conduct a statutory consultation with the local community\n while the DfE \nconducts an assessment of the impact the project will h\nave on other schools in the area.\n&#xa0;\n3.6&#xa0; \nThe DfE provides oversight and challenge to the project through a series of che\nckpoint meetings and, \nbefore being allow\ned to open\n,\n the school must \nbe inspected by Ofsted to ensure premises \nand policies are up to standard\n.\n If the school is found to be unsatisfactory at any stage then the \nproject may be cancelled \nor delayed.\n&#xa0;\n3.7&#xa0; \nAlthough L\nocal \nA\nuthoritie\ns have no formal role in the approval of Free Schools, NSN encourages all groups \nwe work with \nto m\nake early contact with their\n LA\n. In many cases \ngroups have been able to work collaboratively particularly\n \naround\n \nprovision of data on places shortages and \nthe identification of premises\n. \nWhile \nLAs \ncannot formally block t\nhe opening of a Free School, \nthey\n \ncan \nma\nke submissions to a \ngroup’s public consultation or to the DfE’s impact assessment report \nduring the pre\n-\nopening stage.\n \nFor Special (and in some cases \nAlternative \nP\nrovision\n) Free Schools\n, the\nir\n support is essential since \nL\nAs\n must provide evidence of demand for their proposals.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOversight and accountability &#xa0;\n3.8&#xa0; \nFree schools are subject to greater examination than almost any other type of state\n-funded\n school. Not only are they subject to the same accountability framework\n \nas \nany Academy\n but they face additional levels of scrutiny. The political controversy which has surround\ned\n the policy means that Free Schools are the subject of intense analysis from local and national media as well as other interest groups. Even \nmore important\n, because\n parents have actively chosen a Free School, often before it even physically exists, they have high expectations of what the school will deliver and are more engaged in holding it to account.\n&#xa0;\n3.9&#xa0; \nOnce open, Free Schools have the same legal status as Academies\n which is formally set out in a Funding Agreement\n, signed by the Secretary of State and the \nCompany Limited by Guarantee that operates the new academy\n. Free Schools are expected to adopt a model funding agreement which, amongst other \nthings, states that t\nhey must follow the School Admissions Code, be inspected by Ofsted, publish their results and provide a broad and balanced curriculum, which cannot teach anything counter to fundamental British values, or creationism.\n&#xa0;\n3.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a seven year notice period i\nn standard Free School funding agreements\n. \nI\nf a Free School is found to be in breach of it any time before then, the Secretary of State \nhas the power to \nterminate \nthe agreement. \nThis power has proved reasonably\n effective – it was the threat of terminating \nthe funding agreement that allowed the \nDfE \nto \ntake action \nin terms of the governance of\n \nAl-Madinah\n in Derby\n \n– requiring them \nto \naccept new \nmanagement\n or face termination\n.\n It is worth noting however that there is no defined point at which an agreement is re\nviewed and, apart from this power to terminate, there is no power to intervene or pass management of \na Free School or an \nacademy to someone else. The need for these wider powers and the standard period of funding agreements should be \nreviewed to ensure \nthat they allow swift and decisive action can be taken in cases where there are serious concerns about the school\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe EFA oversees the financial management and governance of Free Schools through a named contact for each school\n \nand \nwho visits the\nm in thei\nr\n first term\n. DfE Education Advisers \nalso visit new schools \nin the autumn term of each of the first two years of \noperation\n. \nFinally, \nOfsted inspects the school within two years of opening \nassessing against the same standards \nrequired of all state schools. \n These assessments are used to identify potential risks to schools and risk rate each school, with particular concerns being escalated through further monitoring. \nIt was through this route that the issues at Discovery New School\n in Crawley\n were identified \nand \nsubsequently \naddressed.\n&#xa0;\n3.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Secretary of State can take a number of actions in relation to failing Free Schools:\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAllow Ofsted to follow its standard processes for all state schools through subsequent inspection and monitoring; \n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nD\nemand a compreh\nensive \nplan to address failure; \n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntervene to appoint and rem\nove governors; \n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTransfer the running of the school to a different Academy sponsor; or\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTerminate the school’s funding agreement and close the school\n3.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAttention has been drawn to the weaknesses of a small number of the first Free Schools, which have been exposed either by inspection from Ofsted, investigation by the EFA or by individuals bringing matters to the attention of the DfE. In all cases the resp\nonse has been both swift and practical. There is little evidence to suggest that intervention would have been any swifter if these schools had been s\nubject to LA oversight – for instance \nthere are currently more than 350 maintained schools in special measu\nres, nearly a third of which have had that status for more than a year.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1&#xa0; \nIf Free Schools are to reach their full potential in \nimproving\n standards\n, \nusing their academy freedoms\n, \nintroducing innovation into\n the system\n, \nallowing outstanding providers to open new schools, encouraging competition\n and increasing\n the number of good school places in the system\n, it is important\n \nthat both the approval and oversight systems to which Free Schools are subject are designed to protec\nt and encourage their distinctive features and the unique addition they make to the schools system\n&#xa0;\n4.2&#xa0; \nUnderlying these distinctive features is the fact that new \nproviders and \ninnovations have \nthe potential to raise educational standards \nby \nbring\ning\n challenge\n and competition to existing systems, even if this means creating a surplus of places. \nAny \nrevisions to the \napproval \nand \noversight systems\n, especially if they are designed \nto accommodate all a\ncademies or schools more widely, will \ntherefore \nneed to be caref\nully assessed to ensure they do \nnot create unforeseen \nbarriers\n or stifle the development and potential of the Free School programme in particular\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.3&#xa0; \nThis need is particularly a\ncute when it comes to\n the\n \napprovals \nprocess where it is important to\n ensure that good schools continue to be approved to open where they are needed\n and wanted by local parents\n – including\n when they will be competing with existing \nunderperforming \nprovision\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.4&#xa0; \nLocal authorities and local schools, as providers with \nresponsibil\nity for managing and overseeing \nexisting \nschools\n in a given region\n \nmay be inclined to resist \nwhen it\n comes to considering the introduction of alternative school\ns\n that might challenge the status quo. In light of this, \nNSN believes \nt\nhe approval process for Free Schools should remain independent of Local Authorities and other local existing providers. \nWhile it is undeniable the \nFree School programme has a strong momentum behind it\n, the scale of growth\n, even in the medium term,\n is likel\ny to be small enough that it should be possible to manage centrally.  \n&#xa0;\n4.5&#xa0; \nSimilarly, there are unique challenges in setting up an entirely new school and the right support and challenge is needed to ensure schools are set up to succeed not fail. \nStrong accou\nntability and performance \ncriteria\n are vital to the success of the Free School programme. In NSN’s view, the current framework is robust and, alongside the Ofsted systems that apply to all schools, has allowed the DfE/EFA\n/Ofsted\n to take swift and decisive \naction where necessary.  However, given the rate of growth in the number of Free Schools and academies more widely, the DfE’s capacity to monitor risks centrally and interv\nene where appropriate is becoming\n \nstretched so it is \na sensible next step to fully \nreview\n whether \nthe current framework will remain fit for purpose\n. \n&#xa0;December 2013\nAPPENDIX: The current approval process&#xa0;\nAs it stands, the approval process falls broadly into two phases:\n&#xa0;\nThe application phase Groups wanting to set up a Free School rightly have to \ncomplete a demanding application process. Aside from the first year of the programme – when \ngroups completed a much briefer initial application and then received paid for support to turn this into a detailed \nbusiness \nplan\n – all Free School applicants have \nhad to undertake significant work \nwithout any financial support (except those receiv\ning small grants from NSN). Currently, this includes:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTo gather evidence of demand\n, M\nainstream Free School\n applicant\ns \nmust\n show \nthat \nlocal parents\n,\n \nwith\n children of \nrelevant\n age\ns\n to attend the \ns\nchool when it opens\n, would choose it as a first choice, were it to open\n.\n \nSpecial and AP Free School applicants must show that they have both the\n support of relevant parents/young people and in principle financial commitments from relevant commissioners to purchase places at the school\n, over and\n above the central funding (£10,000 and £8\n,\n000\n respectively) available to them\n. \nI\ndeally\n, applicants have to show that the school would be \nseveral times oversubscribed\n in its first two years of operation\n.\n&#xa0;\nOnce submitt\ned, these applications are \nassessed by dedicated teams at the DfE/EFA and, where they have been submitted by an existing Acade\nmy sponsor, discussed with the Academies division to analyse the sponsor’s capacity to expand further.\n&#xa0;\nFollowing this, a number of applicants are invited for interview by a panel which includes representatives from the DfE, EFA, external educational advis\ners and independent experts. \n&#xa0;\nThe rigour of the application phase can be seen in’ the relatively low success rate of applicants, with only 26% of the 1103 applications received by the DfE being progressed to the pre-opening phase\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe pre-opening phaseIf successful \nat interview\n, groups are\n then\n \nprovisionally \n‘approved’ to open a \nFree S\nchool\n. Groups receive funding from the DfE\n (currently £220,000 for primary schools and £300,000 for secondary/all-through schools) in order to ensure the school ready to open – including recruiting staff, developing education plans and policies, building financial systems and recruiting pupils. Th\ney must also conduct a statutory consultation with the local community to ask whether stakeholders believe the school should open, and respond to any concerns.\n&#xa0;\nGroups also receive substantial support at this stage with finding, securing and developing a s\nite with the EFA taking all key decisions. Aside from this, the role of the DfE is largely to provide oversight and challenge to the project – through a dedicated project lead, education and finance advisers, who hold regular checkpoint meetings to review \nits progress. \nIf \nthis is found to be unsatisfactory at any stage then the \nproject may be cancelled, or the opening \nof the school delayed. \n&#xa0;\nBefore being allowed to open, the school must also \npass\n two further requirements. First, it is inspected by\n Ofsted t\no ensure \nthat it meets \nnecessary standards\n around the quality of its premises and the provision of policies relating to issues such as the welfare, health and safety of pupils\n. Secondly, DfE officials must \nconduct an\n assessment of the\n Free School\n’s impact\n on other schools in the area. Only at this stage, if all other requirements have been fulfilled, will the Secretary of State sign a funding agreement with the school which allows it to formally open. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Of the 24 Free Schools which opened in 2011: four were rated outstanding; 14 were rated good; five required improvement and one was inadequate.
