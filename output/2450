defaultMutual Exchange
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default 
defaultCircle 
defaultHousing Group provides House Exchange, the country’s largest not-for-profit web-based mutual exchange service. 
defaultHouse Exchange allows for home swaps between 
defaultany council and housing association tenant with the right to mutually exchange by
default automatically matc
defaulthing house-seekers with 
defaulta home
default that meet their needs. There are 300,000 people registered on the site and more than 220,000 properties on the system.
default&#xa0;
default2.2 Mutual exchange can be a useful tool in responding to welfare reform by enabling tenants to move to a
default property which is cheaper to run or which has fewer bedrooms 
defaultand therefore avoids the Under-O
defaultccupation Penalty.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default Indeed, since the Under-O
defaultccupation Penalty was introduced in April 2013, the number of registrations to House Exchange website, 
defaultwww.houseexchange.org.uk
default, have increased by 26%. The majority of those registering on the site, around 26%, are looking to move to a larger property 
defaultbut 
defaultthe number looking to down
default-size
default has increased as a proportion of registrations to around 10%.
default We have also held 
defaultsuccessful ‘speed-dating’ events where we invite
default tenants 
defaultto attend and try to 
defaultfind a 
defaultsuitable 
defaultproperty match for mutual exchange.
default&#xa0;
defaultInvestment in Financial Inclusion

defaultin financial inclusion services
default 
defaultin three main areas. Firstly, we provide health checks, to support customers to understand their finances and know what support is available such as money advice and 
defaultour 
defaultbenefits ca
defaultlculator.
default 
defaultSecondly, we focus on prevention by supporting customers to proactively manage their finances and maximise effective use of services and products such as bank accounts and affordable credit. Finally, in crisis situations, we 
defaultgive
default 
defaultcustomers 
defaultaccess
default 
defaultto specialised 
defaultsupport services such as debt advice
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.5 
defaultO
defaultne of our partners, Roddons Housing Association, 
defaulthas 
defaultalso secured £1m funding over 5 years from the Big Lottery Fund’s ‘Improving Financial Confidence’ programme which has funded additional staff
default an
defaultd training in our income team. 
defaultAcross the Group, our
default income officers
default have
default reprioritised the use of resources to ensure a focus on face-to-face communication with tenants impacted by the Under-Occupation Penalty and 
defaultthe Benefit
default 
defaultCap 
defaultthrough a programme of
default home visits.
default 
defaultAs a result of this investment, our arrears level have so far been held at a steady level, 
defaultand in fact reduced
default f
defaultrom 3.2% in July 2012 to 3.1% in
default July 2013. 
default&#xa0;
defaultEmployment and Skills Support
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default 
defaultWe believe that getting people into employment 
defaultand training is a crucial tool
default help 
defaultto 
defaultaddress the welfare reform challenge. Last year, we helped 9
default,
default417 people with employment and skills support, including 1
default,
default934 into paid work, accredited training or apprenticeships. We are also the lead partner in a pan
default-London shared apprenticeship scheme in partnership with the CITB to support the movement of apprentices between contractors to ensure that they can complete their training.
default&#xa0;
default2.7
default As part of our £1.2 billion repairs and maintenance procurement, each contrac
defaulttor will provide one apprenticeship opportunity within their business for every £0.5m that Circle spends with them. This means 233 apprenticeship opportunities will be created over the 10-year lifespan of the new contracts. In addition, our contractors wil
defaultl offer 77 graduate placements or internships, 309 work placements and 166 volunteering opportunities within their businesses.
default We would like to see other organisations take a similar pro-active approach to apprenticeships in their procurement projects.

default Circle is also working to save tenants money on their energy bills
default,
default securing £200,000 through DECC’s Renewable Heat Premium Payment scheme to install air source heat pumps and 
defaultlast year we installed measures that helped our custome
defaultrs save around £450,000 on their energy bills.
default&#xa0;
default2.9 We have around 60 Resident Energy Champions across the Group. Since their initial training session in April last year, the Champions have passed on energy saving advice to over 250 Circle customers with a
defaultn expected saving for each customer of around £100 per year through following basic energy saving tips.
default&#xa0;
default2.10 We have partnered with the National Housing Federation to provide an energy tariff switching service bespoke to Circle staff and customers, provid
defaulting a service they can trust to find a cheaper deal on their energy bills.

default3default. defaultThe implications of the changes for landlordsdefault&#xa0;
defaultImpact on capacity to build new homes
default&#xa0;
default3.1 Circle’s intention is to develop a substantial number of new homes in the years to come, and under our current
default financial plan
default we have the capacity to do so.
default We 
defaulttherefore 
defaultwelcome the recent rent regime settlement for the 10 years from 2015/16, providing a level of stabi
defaultlity on our main income stream.
default However, we may be compelled to revisit our assumptions if curren
defaultt uncertainties surrounding key elements of Welfare Reform (particularly Universal Credit roll-out and the new welfare cap arrangements) 
defaultresult in
default a further increase in costs.
default&#xa0;
defaultImpact of Under-Occupation Penalty
default&#xa0;
default3.2 For tenancy sustainment services, the U
defaultnder-Occupation Penalty has affected 20-30% of households and assistance is being provided to facilitate moves to more appropriately sized accommodation. The main impact already being seen in regard to tenant custome
defaultr behaviour in response to the Under-Occ
defaultupation P
defaultenalty is a significant escalation in the rate of enquiries and completions of mutual exchanges of tenancy.
default&#xa0;
default3.3 
defaultWhen offering an internal transfer to a new home within our properties to one of our existing tenants, we will currently maintain thei
defaultr rent level at social rent
default, rather than moving them onto Affordable R
defaultent. However, due
default to the higher number of internal transfers as a result of needing to find accommodation for tenants affected by the Under-Occupation Penalty, this has resulted in 
defaultfewer
default conversions to Affordable Rent as part of the Affordable Homes Programme
default. Because the programme is designed to use this increase in rental income
default 
defaultfrom conversions to fund the building of new homes, this has had a negative effect on our 
defaultcapacity which we h
defaultave had to fu
defaultnd from elsewhere.
default&#xa0;
default3.4 
defaultThere is also potential for programme delivery disruption as local authority planning c
defaultommittee m
defaultembers seeking to substantially amend schemes in order to include numbers of smal
defaultler units as a response to the Under-Occu
defaultpation P
defaultenalty – which may render some schemes as financially non-viable or, even if this is not the case, at a minimum substantially slow
defaulter 
defaultdelivery timescales.
default&#xa0;
defaultImpact of Benefit Cap
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default 
defaultWe have also have seen sizable decreases in income for customers as a result of 
defaultthe Benefit Cap
default, although these are small in number. Reductions have been in the region of £100 - £150 a month outside of 
defaultLondon
default and £240 within 
defaultLondon
default. 
defaultHowever, we have one fa
defaultmily in 
defaultLondon
default which is losing £330 a week under the measure. 
defaultIt is likely that rent payments will be the key area where families amend their budgets and this in turn may prevent their move to smaller accommodation.
default&#xa0;
defaultImpact of Universal Credit and Direct P
defaultayments
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default 
defaultThis measure is by far the greatest risk to our revenue stream and future financial resources available for investment in housing and provision of community services. 
defaultAny significant increase in arrears levels
default 
defaultwould
default have a
defaultn
default impact on
default housing a
defaultssociations’ cash flow and revenue position and 
defaultthe capacity of association
defaults
default to build new homes and invest in local services.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.7 The uncertainty around 
defaultthe implementation and timetable for 
defaultUniversal Credit 
defaulthas made it very difficult for housing associa
defaulttions to conduct their business planning and to make any realistic consideration of additional resources required to support our customers with Universal Credit in the absence of a firm, clear and detailed national roll-out plan. We are working with the De
defaultpartment of Work and Pensions to establish the detail of how Universal Credit will operate but as an organisation which operates over 127 local authority areas it would be useful to have 
defaultknow as early 
defaultas possible where Universal Credit will next be 
defaultimpleme
defaultnted as part of the national roll-out
default so that we can manage our resources accordingly.
default&#xa0;
default3.8 
defaultAs a result of the impact of Universal Credit and direct payments, housing associations may be forced to re
defaultview their allocations policy and risk manage and profile
default their future lettings by focussing on people in work who will have greater ability to pay and less dependency on welfare benefits. 
defaultThis would have a significant impact on the resources of local authorities who would be responsible for housing more people 
defaulton full Housing Benefit.
default&#xa0;default4default. defaultThe implications of the changes for claimantsdefault and vulnerable peopledefault&#xa0;
default4.1 
defaultIn 2011, in preparation for welfare reform we undertook a survey of our tenants and their attitudes to their finances. It 
defaultled to
default the following findings:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default 
defaultThe report 
defaultshowed
default that our tenants will need more advice to help them respond when the Government brings together all benefits under the Universal Credit
default and recipients 
defaultreceive all of their benefits in one ‘monthly lump sum’ to their accounts for 
defaultthe first time ever, rather than their rent being paid direct to their landlord.
default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultMost of our tenants will not be used to receiving this amount of money at once, and may have difficulties in the transition to the new system. Some will want support to h
defaultelp them understand the changes and manage their money. 
defaultThe movement to monthly budgeting will be a challenge for households with the likelihood of shortfalls in the various household budgets will require additional assistance, most notably budgeting for f
defaultood and u
defaulttility costs if paid via a pre-
defaultpayment meter system. 
defaultThe DWP is keen for these direct payments to be made online and for advice to be internet-based. However, our research shows that 45% of our customers don’t have internet access at home, and can
default’t access online advice. So, for many, online solutions will not work, and face-to-face advice is the most effective way to guide people through the changes. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4 In July 2013 we did a further survey of our customers which showed that:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis shows the lack of awareness amongst social housing tenants towards Universal Credit and its implications and the challenge faced by housing 
defaultassociations to prepare people for direct payments and the need to budget monthly to cover rent and other basic requirements.
default&#xa0;
default4.5 In t
defaulthe light of this, our recommendation is that the Government should provide a guarantee of at least one face-to-face money
default advice session for each new recipient of direct Universal Credit payments who needs it. In this way, we can prepare people for the 
defaulttransition to the new welfare reform system
default 
defaultand 
defaultgive them the information and guidance they need to navigate towards proacti
defaultve management of their resources.
default&#xa0;default5default. defaultThe treatment of housing costs within Universal Creditdefault&#xa0;
default5.1 We would like to see the
default housing element 
defaultof Universal Credit 
defaultto be clearly defined and not 
defaultjust absorbed within with the single payment to allow those who 
defaultwish to have their housing costs deducted at source to be able to do so.
default&#xa0;
default5.2 
defaultThere are also some 
defaultpractical
default questions around how the housing cost element will work in practice. 
defaultIf ‘direct payments’ to the tenant are switched back to ‘managed payments’ to t
defaulthe landlord after 8 weeks of arrears as suggested by the Department for Work and Pensions, it is not clear how this debt will be recovered through the benefits system and how the need to reduce these arrears will be balanced against the tenants need to pay
default for basic goods such as food and heating. Clarity from Government is required in this area and we are keen to work with the Department and others to ensure both the wellbeing of our customers and the financial stability of the housing association sector.
