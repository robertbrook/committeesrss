[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.2 Circle 
[normal]Housing 
[normal]G
[normal]roup includes 12 partners. Nine registered providers (RPs): South Anglia Housing, Wherry Housing Association, Old Ford Housing Association, 
[normal]Circle 33 Housing Trust, Merton Priory Homes, Mole Valley Housing Association, Mercian Housing Association, Roddons Housing Association and Russet Homes; two support &amp; care partners: Circle Support and Invicta Telecare, as well as Circle Living for sales a
[normal]nd marketing and management of shared ownership, market rent and private sale properties, and property repairs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 Across the Group, 
[normal]32% of 
[normal]our 
[normal]tenants receive full Housing Benefit and 27% receive partial Housing Benefit. 
[normal]3
[normal],
[normal]3
[normal]99 of our customers are affec
[normal]ted by the Under-Occupation Penalty (also known as the ‘Bedroom Tax’
[normal])
[normal] and 
[normal]197 are affected by the Benefit
[normal] Cap.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2. [bold]New and innovative responses to the changes to housing support [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Mutual Exchange
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal] 
[normal]Circle 
[normal]Housing Group provides House Exchange, the country’s largest not-for-profit web-based mutual exchange service. 
[normal]House Exchange allows for home swaps between 
[normal]any council and housing association tenant with the right to mutually exchange by
[normal] automatically matc
[normal]hing house-seekers with 
[normal]a home
[normal] that meet their needs. There are 300,000 people registered on the site and more than 220,000 properties on the system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 Mutual exchange can be a useful tool in responding to welfare reform by enabling tenants to move to a
[normal] property which is cheaper to run or which has fewer bedrooms 
[normal]and therefore avoids the Under-O
[normal]ccupation Penalty.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal] Indeed, since the Under-O
[normal]ccupation Penalty was introduced in April 2013, the number of registrations to House Exchange website, 
[normal]www.houseexchange.org.uk
[normal], have increased by 26%. The majority of those registering on the site, around 26%, are looking to move to a larger property 
[normal]but 
[normal]the number looking to down
[normal]-size
[normal] has increased as a proportion of registrations to around 10%.
[normal] We have also held 
[normal]successful ‘speed-dating’ events where we invite
[normal] tenants 
[normal]to attend and try to 
[normal]find a 
[normal]suitable 
[normal]property match for mutual exchange.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Investment in Financial Inclusion
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 
[normal]C
[normal]ircle Housing Group invest
[normal]s
[normal] £1m 
[normal]each year 
[normal]in financial inclusion services
[normal] 
[normal]in three main areas. Firstly, we provide health checks, to support customers to understand their finances and know what support is available such as money advice and 
[normal]our 
[normal]benefits ca
[normal]lculator.
[normal] 
[normal]Secondly, we focus on prevention by supporting customers to proactively manage their finances and maximise effective use of services and products such as bank accounts and affordable credit. Finally, in crisis situations, we 
[normal]give
[normal] 
[normal]customers 
[normal]access
[normal] 
[normal]to specialised 
[normal]support services such as debt advice
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5 
[normal]O
[normal]ne of our partners, Roddons Housing Association, 
[normal]has 
[normal]also secured £1m funding over 5 years from the Big Lottery Fund’s ‘Improving Financial Confidence’ programme which has funded additional staff
[normal] an
[normal]d training in our income team. 
[normal]Across the Group, our
[normal] income officers
[normal] have
[normal] reprioritised the use of resources to ensure a focus on face-to-face communication with tenants impacted by the Under-Occupation Penalty and 
[normal]the Benefit
[normal] 
[normal]Cap 
[normal]through a programme of
[normal] home visits.
[normal] 
[normal]As a result of this investment, our arrears level have so far been held at a steady level, 
[normal]and in fact reduced
[normal] f
[normal]rom 3.2% in July 2012 to 3.1% in
[normal] July 2013. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Employment and Skills Support
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal] 
[normal]We believe that getting people into employment 
[normal]and training is a crucial tool
[normal] help 
[normal]to 
[normal]address the welfare reform challenge. Last year, we helped 9
[normal],
[normal]417 people with employment and skills support, including 1
[normal],
[normal]934 into paid work, accredited training or apprenticeships. We are also the lead partner in a pan
[normal]-London shared apprenticeship scheme in partnership with the CITB to support the movement of apprentices between contractors to ensure that they can complete their training.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal] As part of our £1.2 billion repairs and maintenance procurement, each contrac
[normal]tor will provide one apprenticeship opportunity within their business for every £0.5m that Circle spends with them. This means 233 apprenticeship opportunities will be created over the 10-year lifespan of the new contracts. In addition, our contractors wil
[normal]l offer 77 graduate placements or internships, 309 work placements and 166 volunteering opportunities within their businesses.
[normal] We would like to see other organisations take a similar pro-active approach to apprenticeships in their procurement projects.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]En
[normal]ergy and Warm Homes
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal] Circle is also working to save tenants money on their energy bills
[normal],
[normal] securing £200,000 through DECC’s Renewable Heat Premium Payment scheme to install air source heat pumps and 
[normal]last year we installed measures that helped our custome
[normal]rs save around £450,000 on their energy bills.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9 We have around 60 Resident Energy Champions across the Group. Since their initial training session in April last year, the Champions have passed on energy saving advice to over 250 Circle customers with a
[normal]n expected saving for each customer of around £100 per year through following basic energy saving tips.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.10 We have partnered with the National Housing Federation to provide an energy tariff switching service bespoke to Circle staff and customers, provid
[normal]ing a service they can trust to find a cheaper deal on their energy bills. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Social Return on Investment
[normal] (SROI) and Wellbeing valuation
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.11
[normal] 
[normal]Overall 
[normal]Circle
[normal] invests £3 million a year in sustainable communities activities, and 
[normal]delivers
[normal] a return of £31.8 million in value obtained in kind through projects, value obtained in external funding and total returned value based on currently valuable interventions. This included £16.8 million value from Employment and Skills outcomes and £13.7 mi
[normal]llion value from Financial Inclusion outcomes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]. [bold]The implications of the changes for landlords[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Impact on capacity to build new homes
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 Circle’s intention is to develop a substantial number of new homes in the years to come, and under our current
[normal] financial plan
[normal] we have the capacity to do so.
[normal] We 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]welcome the recent rent regime settlement for the 10 years from 2015/16, providing a level of stabi
[normal]lity on our main income stream.
[normal] However, we may be compelled to revisit our assumptions if curren
[normal]t uncertainties surrounding key elements of Welfare Reform (particularly Universal Credit roll-out and the new welfare cap arrangements) 
[normal]result in
[normal] a further increase in costs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Impact of Under-Occupation Penalty
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 For tenancy sustainment services, the U
[normal]nder-Occupation Penalty has affected 20-30% of households and assistance is being provided to facilitate moves to more appropriately sized accommodation. The main impact already being seen in regard to tenant custome
[normal]r behaviour in response to the Under-Occ
[normal]upation P
[normal]enalty is a significant escalation in the rate of enquiries and completions of mutual exchanges of tenancy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3 
[normal]When offering an internal transfer to a new home within our properties to one of our existing tenants, we will currently maintain thei
[normal]r rent level at social rent
[normal], rather than moving them onto Affordable R
[normal]ent. However, due
[normal] to the higher number of internal transfers as a result of needing to find accommodation for tenants affected by the Under-Occupation Penalty, this has resulted in 
[normal]fewer
[normal] conversions to Affordable Rent as part of the Affordable Homes Programme
[normal]. Because the programme is designed to use this increase in rental income
[normal] 
[normal]from conversions to fund the building of new homes, this has had a negative effect on our 
[normal]capacity which we h
[normal]ave had to fu
[normal]nd from elsewhere.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4 
[normal]There is also potential for programme delivery disruption as local authority planning c
[normal]ommittee m
[normal]embers seeking to substantially amend schemes in order to include numbers of smal
[normal]ler units as a response to the Under-Occu
[normal]pation P
[normal]enalty – which may render some schemes as financially non-viable or, even if this is not the case, at a minimum substantially slow
[normal]er 
[normal]delivery timescales.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Impact of Benefit Cap
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal] 
[normal]We have also have seen sizable decreases in income for customers as a result of 
[normal]the Benefit Cap
[normal], although these are small in number. Reductions have been in the region of £100 - £150 a month outside of 
[normal]London
[normal] and £240 within 
[normal]London
[normal]. 
[normal]However, we have one fa
[normal]mily in 
[normal]London
[normal] which is losing £330 a week under the measure. 
[normal]It is likely that rent payments will be the key area where families amend their budgets and this in turn may prevent their move to smaller accommodation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Impact of Universal Credit and Direct P
[normal]ayments
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal] 
[normal]This measure is by far the greatest risk to our revenue stream and future financial resources available for investment in housing and provision of community services. 
[normal]Any significant increase in arrears levels
[normal] 
[normal]would
[normal] have a
[normal]n
[normal] impact on
[normal] housing a
[normal]ssociations’ cash flow and revenue position and 
[normal]the capacity of association
[normal]s
[normal] to build new homes and invest in local services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7 The uncertainty around 
[normal]the implementation and timetable for 
[normal]Universal Credit 
[normal]has made it very difficult for housing associa
[normal]tions to conduct their business planning and to make any realistic consideration of additional resources required to support our customers with Universal Credit in the absence of a firm, clear and detailed national roll-out plan. We are working with the De
[normal]partment of Work and Pensions to establish the detail of how Universal Credit will operate but as an organisation which operates over 127 local authority areas it would be useful to have 
[normal]know as early 
[normal]as possible where Universal Credit will next be 
[normal]impleme
[normal]nted as part of the national roll-out
[normal] so that we can manage our resources accordingly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8 
[normal]As a result of the impact of Universal Credit and direct payments, housing associations may be forced to re
[normal]view their allocations policy and risk manage and profile
[normal] their future lettings by focussing on people in work who will have greater ability to pay and less dependency on welfare benefits. 
[normal]This would have a significant impact on the resources of local authorities who would be responsible for housing more people 
[normal]on full Housing Benefit.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4[bold]. [bold]The implications of the changes for claimants[bold] and vulnerable people[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1 
[normal]In 2011, in preparation for welfare reform we undertook a survey of our tenants and their attitudes to their finances. It 
[normal]led to
[normal] the following findings:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal] 
[normal]The report 
[normal]showed
[normal] that our tenants will need more advice to help them respond when the Government brings together all benefits under the Universal Credit
[normal] and recipients 
[normal]receive all of their benefits in one ‘monthly lump sum’ to their accounts for 
[normal]the first time ever, rather than their rent being paid direct to their landlord.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 
[normal]Most of our tenants will not be used to receiving this amount of money at once, and may have difficulties in the transition to the new system. Some will want support to h
[normal]elp them understand the changes and manage their money. 
[normal]The movement to monthly budgeting will be a challenge for households with the likelihood of shortfalls in the various household budgets will require additional assistance, most notably budgeting for f
[normal]ood and u
[normal]tility costs if paid via a pre-
[normal]payment meter system. 
[normal]The DWP is keen for these direct payments to be made online and for advice to be internet-based. However, our research shows that 45% of our customers don’t have internet access at home, and can
[normal]’t access online advice. So, for many, online solutions will not work, and face-to-face advice is the most effective way to guide people through the changes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4 In July 2013 we did a further survey of our customers which showed that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This shows the lack of awareness amongst social housing tenants towards Universal Credit and its implications and the challenge faced by housing 
[normal]associations to prepare people for direct payments and the need to budget monthly to cover rent and other basic requirements.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5 In t
[normal]he light of this, our recommendation is that the Government should provide a guarantee of at least one face-to-face money
[normal] advice session for each new recipient of direct Universal Credit payments who needs it. In this way, we can prepare people for the 
[normal]transition to the new welfare reform system
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]give them the information and guidance they need to navigate towards proacti
[normal]ve management of their resources.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5[bold]. [bold]The treatment of housing costs within Universal Credit[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1 We would like to see the
[normal] housing element 
[normal]of Universal Credit 
[normal]to be clearly defined and not 
[normal]just absorbed within with the single payment to allow those who 
[normal]wish to have their housing costs deducted at source to be able to do so.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2 
[normal]There are also some 
[normal]practical
[normal] questions around how the housing cost element will work in practice. 
[normal]If ‘direct payments’ to the tenant are switched back to ‘managed payments’ to t
[normal]he landlord after 8 weeks of arrears as suggested by the Department for Work and Pensions, it is not clear how this debt will be recovered through the benefits system and how the need to reduce these arrears will be balanced against the tenants need to pay
[normal] for basic goods such as food and heating. Clarity from Government is required in this area and we are keen to work with the Department and others to ensure both the wellbeing of our customers and the financial stability of the housing association sector.
