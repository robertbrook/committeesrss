"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submission by the British Airline Pilots’ Association (BALPA) (HCS0012)&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe British Airline Pilots’ Association (BALPA) is grateful \nfor opportunity to submit written evidence to the Committee in support of its inquiry into helicopter safety.\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBALPA welcomes the Committee\n’\ns continued interest in aviation safety, and applauds it for its decision to hold an inquiry\n to\n the important and \nper\ntinent \narea of off-shore helicopter safety.\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, BALPA believes that an ind\nependent judicial inquiry into o\nffshore \nh\nelicopter safety is required for two principal reasons:\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe CAA and the \nh\nelicopter \nc\nompanies have both recently announced reviews, but BALPA \ndoes not believe that either of these will adequately assess the role of the \no\nil \nc\nompanies, the amount of control they exert over the helicopter com\npanies and ultimately their impact on the safety of public transport on the North Sea.\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNor will these reviews independently examine the adequacy of the “light touch” regulatory regime of the CAA which has demonstrably failed to ensure universally safe stan\ndards of operation.\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSix UK \no\nffshore public transport helicopters have been involved in serious accidents during the last \nseven\n years. These events happened in 2006, two in 2009, two in 2012, and 2013. In all cases the helicopters entered the wa\nter. In two of the cases, water entry took place in a controlled manner following a malfunction contained by a published emergency procedure. These cases had the potential for fatalities due to the hostile nature of the environment. In the remaining four c\nases, the water entry was inadvertent or uncontrolled. Three of these cases resulted in multiple fatalities.\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll the accidents have been investigated by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB); their investigation into the latest accident is continuin\ng.\n.\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn 29 November a Eurocopter EC-135 operated by Bond helicopters on behalf of Police Scotland crashed in the centre of Glasgow.  The AAIB is \nat an early stage of investigation into the cause of this incident and at the current time the cause is far from\n clear.  Therefore, we will not submit evidence regarding this particular crash at this time, but, with the Committee’s permission, we may seek to submit supplementary evidence if more details are known before the Committee takes oral evidence.\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll the hel\nicopter companies involved were subject to regulation by the UK CAA and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). \n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe fatal accident in 2006 Morecambe Bay (Ref 1) occurred due to pilot disorientation and poor monitoring during a visual night approach \nunder low cloud followed by a poorly executed go-around from the approach. The CAA subsequently instructed all operators to review their procedures for night and poor visibility approaches.\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe next accident in 2009 ETAP (Ref2) occurred due to pilot disori\nentation and poor monitoring during a visual night approach in poor visibility. The helicopter company had reviewed its procedures in accordance with the CAA instruction above, and deemed them to be robust. The CAA’s evaluation of this internal review fail\ned to establish that the operator’s procedures fell well short of industry best practice\n. Following the accident, other North Sea helicopter companies made their own operations manuals available to the company involved to allow it to copy best practice in\nto its procedures. The CAA’s oversight of the company’s original Operations Manual is thus open to question, since its contents fell short of industry best practice prior to the accident, and yet were approved by the regulator.\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe second accident in 2009,\n an AS332L2 East of Peterhead (Ref 3) occurred due to a catastrophic failure within the helicopter’s main rotor gearbox. The AAIB report found that the operating company had misidentified the origin and composition of a metal chip which had initiated a war\nning on the gearbox chip detector system. The company had not followed the formal protocol in discussions with the manufacturer and as a result had not complied with \nthe full\n maintenance procedure following its discovery. It is difficult to understand why,\n with the company\n being subject to two\n simultaneous serious accident investigations out of a fleet of only \nnine\n aircraft, the regulator did not consider it necessary to suspend its Aircraft Operator’s Certificate (AOC) pending the conduct of a full investi\ngation of its operations.\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBoth accidents in 2012 (Refs 4 &amp; 5) were as a result of the fracture of a shaft in the main rotor gearbox of EC 225 helicopters operated by two different companies. Whilst the root cause of both accidents was a manufacturing issue\n, neither company was using industry best practice of downloading and assessing Integrated Helicopter Usage Monitoring System (IHUMS) data after every flight. Had they done so, it is probable that the progressive cracking of the shafts would have been iden\ntified in time to remove both aircraft from service prior to the final fractures occurring.\n2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 2013 Sumburgh accident involved an AS332L2 helicopter entering the sea while conducting a non-precision instrument approach in low cloud and poor visibility. Th\ne AAIB investigation has yet to be completed, but the interim report (Ref 6) indicates \nthat the aircraft was in a serviceable state, and that use of automation and monitoring procedures were contributory factors.\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBALPA’s opinio\nn is that in recent years the CAA’s regulatory oversight of offshore helicopter operations has developed into “light touch” supervision as opposed to regulation. This has encouraged the oil and gas industry to introduce its own standards of equipment or in\n some cases operating limits. For example, one oil company has issued its own height minima for approaches to its installations, which conflict with CAA approved approach procedures. BALPA contends that the regulator has sole authority to approve aviation \nprocedures, and it alone should be setting and maintaining and enforcing the high standards required to maintain safety – i.e. regulating the industry rather than overseeing it.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecent events have shown that the lessons learnt from the\n 1992 Cormorant Alpha accident (Ref 7) have not been universally applied by all helicopter companies including new entrants to the market. As a result of this omission, the common thread of helicopters crashing into the sea whilst conducting approaches in \npoor visibility and/or at night has continued with the 2006 G-BLUN Morecambe Bay, the 2009 G-REDU ETAP and the 2013 G-WNSB Sumburgh accidents. \n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecommendations made by the AAIB to individual helicopter companies with regard to best practice in operations m\nanuals, inflight conditions, stabilised approaches, use of automation and monitoring techniques have \nreceived a \nCAA \nresponse \n“not addressed to the CAA” \nin follow up reports \nwhen \nthe issues \nwere clearly within the Authority’s regulatory purview (Refs 8, 9 &amp;\n10). BALPA believes that the actions required by these recommendations should have been subject to regular review and enforcement by a robust regulator. Had this been the case, these accidents could have been avoided.\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile the \nAAIB \ninvestigation into the \nfatal 2013 Sumburgh accident is still in progress, the initial report describes a sequence of events with marked similarities to the 1992, 2006 and 2009 accidents, despite the approach being conducted under instrument flight rules. This latest example, and\n the public outcry it has occasioned, has undoubtedly prompted the CAA to initiate its own review into its regulatory activities.\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Operations Manuals of all offshore helicopter operators should now be brought up to a common standard with particular rega\nrd to the use of automation, monitoring procedures, visibility and cloud base minima and procedures for  the conduct of visual approaches by night and in poor visibility. New entrants to the offshore market should be required to comply with accepted indust\nry best practice. This could be achieved by a helicopter operators’ conference sponsored by the regulator to identify \nand agree the common criteria and procedures, which would then be incorporated in all operations manuals.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs\n already stated, the \nAAIB\n report into the latest accident on 23 August 2013 has not yet been completed, but is likely to involve questions about training which is regulated by the CAA under its approval for Type Rating Training Organisations.\n3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA recent tren\nd has developed of helicopter companies outsourcing training and recurrent checking of their crews to third party training providers. This policy is designed to reduce training costs to the operator which is achieved by having the training conducted by gro\nund simulator instructors rather than current operational pilots who are also Type Rating Examiners (TRE).\n3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe techniques being taught and checked by these third party training providers must therefore be included in the oversight of best practice in the o\nffshore helicopter industry by the CAA Offshore Inspectorate. \n&#xa0;\n3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn terms of maintenance procedures, the CAA has not required all helicopter operators follow current best practice with regard to advances in IHUMS technology. \nSpecifically, it has not mandated best practice with regard to downloading and analysing IHUMS data after every flight. Had this been the case, it is highly probable that the impending fracture of the gearbox bevel shafts in EC\n \n225 helicopters G-REDW and G\n-CHCN would have been detected before failure, and hence neither aircraft would have been despatched for the flights on which they ditched.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n \nBALPA believes that regulation of the offshore helicopter secto\nr of the UK aviation industry should be significantly strengthened. The CAA has a recent history of being reactive to accidents rather than pre-empting problems. The required improvement in safety could be achieved by a robust pro-active approach which ide\nntifies and enforces industry best practice, takes account of developments in equipment and techniques, and ensures new entrants to the sector match up to the safest standards in operational and maintenance procedures.\n4.2.\n \nBALPA believes that the Flight Operat\nions Inspectorate (FOI) of the safety regulation group of the CAA would benefit from the recruitment of additional inspectors with current experience of offshore helicopter operations, including some with experience of training, to a specialist Offshore He\nlicopter section of the inspectorate. This would increase the department’s appreciation of the detailed issues involved and enable it to assess the need for improvements to operational standards across the entire industry. The remuneration of these inspect\nors would have to match that of current North Sea pilots and licenced engineers to enable recruitment of suitably experienced staff to take place. This would mirror the status of the offshore department of the Health and Safety Executive, and BALPA is conf\nident that this would provide a significant net safety benefit.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBALPA believes that the oil and gas companies exert an undue influence over the safety of the public transport helico\npter sector of UK aviation \nbecause \nthey have immense financial customer power, and control the market to ensure very strong competition which leads to a dearth of spare capacity, and encourages cost cutting at the ultimate expense of safety. This is in mar\nked contrast with the Norwegian sector where a strongly dominant national oil company sets high standards, ensures adequate spare capacity is maintained, and where the  international oil companies have to comply to retain their operating licences. The UK i\ns one of the very few significant oil producing countries in the world with no state oil company or sovereign wealth fund. In the absence of a state oil company, the role of the aviation regulator is critical in ensuring safety.\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOil and Gas companies in th\ne UK sector have traditionally ensured that a highly competitive market exists for their helicopter support operations. This is managed in 2 ways.\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFirstly, standard contracts are structured in such a way that the oil company generally has a 90 day notice p\neriod for termination of contract, whereas the contracting helicopter company is normally tied in to the contract for a period of years. This allows the customer to effectively threaten the helicopter company with a “market testing” exercise at any stage t\nhrough the duration of the contract, and to pull out of the contract at short notice if their market testing finds another operator to undercut the price. The oil companies frequently use the cyclical nature of the oil industry to impose price cuts on thei\nr contractors and service providers. This philosophy encourages the appearance of low-cost helicopter companies who inevitably try to cut corners on safety to achieve their low pricing structure. Many of these small companies are based in other European co\nuntries and organise their UK operations using “remote site” regulations which allow them to use their less restrictive Flight Time Limitation (FTL) schemes for competitive commercial advantage. These foreign operators are regulated by their own national a\nviation authorities rather than the UK CAA which could enforce a level playing field on safety if it had complete regulatory authority over all UK offshore helicopter operations.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSecondly, the oil companies have ensured strong competition among helicopter \noperators by providing financial backing to new entrants to the market. \n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is best exemplified by \na super-major oil company’s \nfunding of \na large new entrant to the market \nin 2004\n.  BALPA understands that \nthe oil company \nawarded \nthe new entrant \na contra\nct which was heavily front end loaded to enable \nit \nto purchase \nsix \nhelicopters and acquire hangar, maintenance, operations and \npassenger handling facilities at Aberdeen and Sumburgh airports. This \nmajor \ncontract allowed \nthe new company \nto re-enter the market exactly \nfive \nyears after \nthe same owners sold a \nprevious business to a Norwegian competitor with a five year exclusion clause to \nprevent them setting up a competing enterprise.\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis sponsorship action was exactly as predicted by the \nOffice of Fair Trading/ Monopolies and Mergers Commission in their decision to permit the merger between British International Helicopters (CHC) and Bond Helicopters into CHC Scotia in 2001. The analysis fails to identify the main reason prices for helicop\nter services rose after the 2001 merger. This was that following the disappearance of the previous company, wages for helicopter pilots had to rise by nearly 50% over \nthree\n years in order to stem the dramatic loss of helicopter pilots to the fixed wing jet\n sector of the aviation industry in the late \n19\n90s and early 2000s. This exodus followed many years of wages depressed by the results of the previous company’s successful business model of building market share by undercutting rival operators on the basis \nof low wages. \n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \noil c\nompanies also usurp the power of the regulatory authority by setting up “industry bodies” such as Step Change in Safety and the Helicopter Safety Study Group (HSSG) which take the initiative over policy and equipment, (Oil and Gas P\nroducer Aircraft Management Guidelines (OGP AMG)) which they impose through their unequal contractual arrangements. The \no\nil \nc\nompanies are careful to invite the CAA to membership of their HSSG thus giving it some “legitimacy”. BALPA believes that the correc\nt regime would be to have a powerful and proactive UK national regulatory authority which sets common standards of safety which transcend competitive pressures, and mandates safety improvements in equipment and procedures.\n5.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn example of the oil companies e\nnforcing their own agenda to the detriment of aviation safety was their issuing personal locator beacons (PLB) to “their” helicopter passengers. These PLBs were designed for use by personnel working over the side of offshore installations, and were intende\nd to assist rescue from the water by fast rescue craft with homing devices.  In the case of the 2009 ETAP accident, these small PLBs were initiated by the passengers and interfered with and rendered inoperative the powerful aircraft locating beacons which \nwere part of the mandatory aircraft equipment for the purpose of rescue of passengers and crew. The very short range of these PLBs actually hindered the rescue of those involved in the accident.\n5.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe reservations of the helicopter operators about the issue \nof these PLBs to passengers were over-ridden by the oil companies who insisted that they be worn by the passengers as an addition to the mandatory Personal Protective Equipment.\n5.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt took an \nAAIB\n safety recommendation following the ETAP crash before the CAA \nfinally acted despite many Air Safety Reports being rendered by helicopter operating crews over the use and erroneous activation of these devices by the passengers.\n5.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \no\nil \nc\nompanies have also fiercely resisted attempts to abolish reliance on mechanical me\nthods (Dacon Scoop) as the sole means of recovery of survivors from the sea in high sea states, and to ensure provision of fire cover on many Normally Unmanned Installations (NUI) in the Southern North Sea.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBALPA believes that aviation in the North Sea is necessary to ensure a productive oil and gas sector which has huge positive knock-on effects in the local and national economy.  However, our vision is to make every flight a safe flight.\n To improve safety B\nALPA makes the following recommendations:\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat a full independent public judicial enquiry takes place into the conduct of the \no\nffshore \nh\nelicopter \nindustry with a \nremit to include:\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat a separate Offshore Helicopter section of the CAA Safety Regulation Group\n Flight Operations Inspectorate be established. This section should be staffed by inspectors who have at least \nfive\n years\n’\n recent personal experience in the large offshore public transport helicopter sector of the aviation industry, and who are remunerated\n at a level equivalent to senior front line pilots and licenced engineers to allow recruitment from the industry.\n6.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat frequent and regular reviews of industry best practice be initiated by the CAA in order to keep up with new technology developments, and \nto ensure that all lessons learnt from accidents and AAIB recommendations are universally applied. In particular, new entrants to the market should only have their Operations Manuals approved, when they have been scrutinised to ensure that they incorporate\n all the current industry best practice, rather than \nmere \ncompliance with minimum international standards.\n6.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat the CAA obtains authority from EASA to regulate the operations of al\nl foreign entrants into the UK o\nffshore \nh\nelicopter public transport market, \nto ensure that they meet the same rigorous standards of equipment, operations and maintenance required of the UK based operators.\n6.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat the CAA mandates downloading of IHUMS data immediately after every flight and analysis prior to the next flight.\n&#xa0;\n(1) Air Accident Report 07/2008 G-BLUN Morecambe Bay 27/12/2006\n(2) Air Accident Report 1/2011 G-REDU ETAP 18/02/2009 \n(3) Air Accident Report 2/2011 G-REDL East of Peterhead 01/04/2009\n(4) AAIB Special Bulletin S3/2012 G-REDW East of Aberdeen 10/05/20\n12\n(5) AAIB\n Special Bulletin S7/2012 G-CHCN\n SW Shetland 22/10/2012\n(6) AAIB Special Bulletin S7/2013 G-WNSB Sumburgh 23/08/2013\n(7) Air Accident Report 2/1993 G-TIGH Cormorant Alpha 14/03/1992\n(8) CAA Follow Up Action on Occurrence Report - Factor Number F\n12/2008 on AAR 7/2008\n(9) CAA Follow Up Action on Occurrence Report – Factor Number F7/2011 on AAR 1/2011\n(10) CAA Follow Up Action on Occurrence Report – Factor Number F9/2011 Issue 2 on AAR 2/2011\n(11) Ex Post Evaluation of Mergers (Office of Fair Tradin\ng, Competition Commission, Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission) Report by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP dated March 2005.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n8\n&#xa0;\n \nBest practice can be defined by \nthe contents of the AAIB recommendations 050, 051,\n \n054\n, \n055 and 056 on pages 117-118 \nof R\nef 2.
