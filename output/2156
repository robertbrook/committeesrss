[normal]the

[normal]common law

[normal] D
[normal]raft Deregulation Bill intends to improve 
[normal]the 
[normal]consistency and the legal cross-referenc
[normal]ing in the UK legal system by fixing a few non-functioning and obsolete laws
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Clause 1: Health and safety at work: genera[bold]l duty of self-employed persons[bold]My concern about the Clause 1 in this proposed bill that makes amendments to Section 3 in Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (general duty of employers and self-employed to persons other than their employees) [bold]is [bold]about the intended effect and functionality to produce the envisaged cost savings and streamlined procedures for the self-employed personnel. I outline my concern for self-employed people with a situational example - which the law must adequately address to ensure its effectiveness to reduce - not to increase - any regulatory burdens and nuisance to the public[bold]:[bold]EXAMPLE: [bold]A Case Study of a Window Cleaner Incident (Bracknell, July 2013):[bold]I had my second floor apartment windows cleaned by a self-employed person who put his 
[normal]very tall 
[normal]ladders against my second floor window. This happened early in the morning when my window was still covered by thick curtains to keep the early sunlight away 
[normal](
[normal]from waking me up
[normal])
[normal]. I 
[normal]knock
[normal] every morning my window open without removing 
[normal]my 
[normal]curtains to get fresh air into my apartment after a night
[normal]’s
[normal] sleep. 
[normal]Had the window cleaner laid his ladder against my win
[normal]dow when I open window, as his l
[normal]adder was near the top of its upper reach and near vertical to reach the second floor, the cleaner would have fallen down with ladders many metres to hard ground, possibly fatal consequences. This could have produced a tiresome manslaughter or accidental death hearings involving me (due to his carelessness on having ladder leaning on covered windows without me having any idea of the danger). 
[normal]It may be that some tenure holders at our estate had received 
[normal]n
[normal]otice
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]about
[normal] window cleaners working, but I 
[normal]certainly 
[normal]had not. This happened 
[normal]as
[normal] 
[normal]the self-employed person was
[normal] cleaning windows faster on our estate than the housing association (Southern Housing Group) or 
[normal]he 
[normal]himself had estimated (and hence 
[normal]he ended up 
[normal]cleaning 
[normal]windows 
[normal]ahead of 
[normal]any published 
[normal]schedule
[normal]s
[normal] in 
[normal]the 
[normal]areas where he was not yet supposed to do 
[normal]window cleaning 
[normal]as the occupants of the homes 
[normal]were
[normal] not 
[normal]yet
[normal] informed). 
[normal]The above case example represents a typical case of many self-employed people that must be foreseen. The legislator must understand that all self-employed people are clever or considerate people who can foresee all dangers and nuisance their ill-considered actions can sometimes cause. Therefore, the amendments proposed in Clause 1 must assume and include provisions that the proposed alterations to streamline the law but 
[normal]DO NOT[bold] encourage for a reckless behaviour by the self-employed people who –as money driven – all too often forget that extra money that comes in if they rush things faster and faster, comes at unacceptable price of potential self-harm to themselves, due to poorly thought out plans by some self-employed workers. I remain concerned that that the new subsection (2A) proposed to Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 “relevant undertaking” is, not fully thought out.
[normal]The deregulations must be carried out with a full understanding of the self-employed people: there are both greedy and workaholic self-employed individuals who become prone to industrial accidents. The UK legislators do not want any noticeable increases in costly litigations and prosecutions from work accidents that occur often in unclear circumstances - which involve self-employed people, their customers and other third parties (as in the given case study above). 
[normal]The proposed law's Clause 1 Subsection 3 inserts a new subsection 2A must have adequate provisions that the work output and attempted income maximisation are not occurring against an increased risks of accidental injuries and deaths. In the Victorian times chimney cleaning was made cheaply by chimney-sweeping children but this led many 
[normal]children 
[normal]getting stuck in smokestacks and was ruled 
[normal]1875 
[normal]as an illegal practise
[normal].
[normal][2

[normal],
[normal][3

[normal],
[normal][4
[normal]]
[normal],
[normal]It is the intention of the lawmakers that the section 3(2) duty of the existing Health and Safety at Work Act continues to apply to all self-employed persons who conduct their undertaking as before deregulation. 
[normal]I am suggesting a possible remedy in industry self-regulation against health and safety abuses: a more pronounced regime of fines should be available to the offenders who carry their work out with little regard to the safety to themselves, their customers and other third parties. A risk of legal ban should be the ultimate sanction for the worst and repetitive offenders found of gross health and safety negligence. Most reasonable workmen will voluntarily subjugate themselves to the good practise if the alternative, corner-cutting, attracts fines. The health and safety shortcuts should be understood as a distortion on the marketplace and to be seen as unfair to those businesses that have decided to carry out their work duties safely. Any measure to encourage good behaviour should be encouraged without too much paperwork and administration being involved and more weight to be given to good common sense and care in carrying out work duties safely.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clause 9: Authorisation of insolvency practitioners[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As[bold] my response to the Question 6.[bold] of "Call for Written Evidence" document: "To what extent does the draft Bill benefit consumers as well as businesses?", I must emphasize that the principle as expressed in Clause 9 will have very limited economic impact when the idea is only applied to small group of professionals to produce a large economic effect a bigger group [bold]than ‘insolvency practitioners’ [bold]must be chosen for the proposed [bold]style of [bold]measures for authorising Part Qualified workers[bold] to obtain real economic gains[bold].[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Clause 9 amends Part 13 of the Insolvency Act 1986 to introduce a new regime for the partial authorisation of insolvency practitioners. Currently, individuals who are authorised to act as an insolvency practitioner are authorised in relation to all categories of appointment. A new section 390A proposes a provision for an insolvency practitioner who is partially authorised to carry out certain limited categories. The proposed new regime will increase accessibility to the insolvency practitioner profession and improve competition. It will also reduce the cost of training and ongoing regulation for applicants who wish to specialise.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The above raises an interesting question if there would be a far greater economic efficiencies available by applying similar principles for the medical practitioners to use more partially-qualified personnel in health care provision to reduce its costs, to raise competition and quantitative supply and demand of various health care services that would then become more affordable and widespread in consumer use - with all the above-listed benefits from the partial qualifications (reduction of cost and delay from study to employment) as shown in case of the insolvency practitioners. Clause 9 Subsection 4 amendments the Insolvency Act 1986 principles - if Partial Qualifications similarly applied for the health care professions would bring 50-100 times greater economic benefits in many areas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is also common in engineering practises to subdivide a task to small modules and utilise team work instead of one individual attaining a too large proportion of engineering knowledge which he w
[normal]ould not be later needing. In 
[normal]modern hospitals, there is lots of team work already and it remains open to questions that some of the learning of the health care faculty may be redundant and Partial Qualifications should be used also in health care professions to improve access and shorten the gap between one's learning experience and its deployment in workplace. Safety in many engineering issues is equally vital; the "uniqueness" of health care is 
[normal]probably 
[normal]exaggerated
[normal] by the profession
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thus my answer to Question 6: "To what extent does the draft Bill benefit consumers as well as businesses?" is that the concept of Partial Qualifications should be explored in a hospital business as the industry adage is exaggerated and not fundamentally different to any other life-critical engineering set up, whether it is the nuclear power station, maintenance and operation of helicopters, submarines, spacecrafts, manufacture of explosives, or the repair of the UK electricity grid.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I was trained as dentist's assistant in apprenticeship arrangement at 
[normal]Savo
[normal] Brigade Military Hospital and worked for year their dental emergency clinic treating face injuries attained in combat training and also treated acute teeth problems. There appeared a vast amount of red tape which could be removed without affecting any patient security. There would be opposition from those who will want to perpetuate the existing privileges (requiring Fully Qualified medic
[normal]al practitioners
[normal] for every 
[normal]type 
[normal]patient duty).
[normal] A real expansion, with economic scope may be found from subdivision of medical tasks to smaller task areas.

[normal]Clause 25: Removal of duty to order re-hearing of marine accident investigations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As one of the Vice-Presidents of Sea Research Society[bold],[bold][5
[normal]]
[normal],
[normal][6
[normal]]
[normal],
[normal] [bold]a 16,000 member organisation focused on marine salvage of shipwrecks, I believe that a distinction must be made in law between the fatal and non-fatal marine accidents to establish the exact conditions of fatalities occurrence where the section 269(1) provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 requires the Secretary of State to order the rehearing of a formal investigation into a marine accident. [bold]We think ‘death at sea’ must be respected and be comparable to the criminal law's principle of murder enquires that have no expiry date if new evidence turns up. Sea Research Society's reasoning for this is the dignity of the seamen and the principle that "every life is important" and those who have lost their lives at sea deserve the respect of the land-dwelling people who facilitate for them transfer of goods across the seas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would also only exclude marine accidents where there is "no certainty of casualties" being established for exemptions, but include all those cases where lives are known to have been lost. The principle of monetisation of seamen risking their lives is in this way inappropriate. However, when there is the question of a mere economic loss and the lost vessel is no longer relevant to the present time situations, there is reason not to investigate such an incident. It, 
[normal]therefore, should remain that in cases of known fatalities, and/or serious bodily injuries, the accident rehearing should stay mandatory feature. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We at Sea Research Society believe the appropriate scheme for fatal and serious bodily injury marine accident 
[normal]rehearings
[normal] would be a marine insurance scheme fashioned after the provisions of road insurance in uninsured accident cases by the Motor Insurers Bureau
[normal], 
[normal][7
[normal]]
[normal] 
[normal]which is an organisation set up by the Government and Motor Insurers to compensate the victims of uninsured and untraced drivers. The Motor Insurers Bureau compensates for the cases where the guilty party remains unknown
[normal], 
[normal][8
[normal]]
[normal] 
[normal]and has established agreement with the Secretary of State
[normal].
[normal][9
[normal]]
[normal],
[normal][10
[normal]]
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Similar collective marine industry responsibility, Marine Insurers Bureau arrangement should apply to all fatal and serious injury cases without expiry for all fatal/serious injury accidents in the UK waters, and to the UK flagged vessels abroad, and the UK flagged vessels in the international waters, to establish the facts leading up to the loss of life or incidence of a recorded serious bodily injury/injuries; a loss of vessel or cargo should be seen as an immaterial consideration here as far as there is no economic benefit or safety considerations to be learned, from such accident investigations. Thus, we are against the Secretary of State's discretionary powers only in all marine fatalities or serious injury cases (where human lives were lost due to someone's attempted economic gain from the said marine activity that can now be further investigated due to the shipwreck discovery or any other new evidence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A new shipwreck discovery should always instigate an enquiry that pays a meticulous attention to factors such as a deviation between the resting place of the ship's hull and other debris from the ship's wreck, and the area where the marine rescue services had been dispatched to establish the reasons why the distress call (transponder, radio call, rocket, or visual observation) differ from the area where rescue services had been dispatched after a marine accident was reported or seen. 
[normal]This ought to establish the systemic failure whether the observation or the reporting of the accident site was inaccurate or false, or whether the error lays in the deployment of the rescue services that searched off the site or from entirely wrong sea area. The greater the deviation between the rescue services dispatch area and the discovery of ship's hull and debris, the deeper the investigations must be to understand the root causes of such a deviation to prevent similar errors in reporting and accident response in future, or despatch of sea rescue in future accidents - and to establish a guilt when necessary due to negligence, incompetence or crime.
[normal]Clause 29: Household waste: de-criminalisation[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]"Under section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (the “EPA”) a waste collection authority may by notice require occupiers of premises to present their
[normal] 
[normal]household waste for collection in a specified way. Failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with such a requirement is an offence under section 46(6) of the EPA."
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I support the proposed measure to impose fines on the offenders. But I also view government and its confusing way of allowing food industry to package recyclable plastics in such a way that the members of public are wearied to prepare their recyclables. Whilst the cleaning of recyclable food packaging from, say chicken curry, is laborious, the readily laborious separation of recyclables from the pure waste (i.e. food) is made double more tiresome by non-recyclable package labels that often have to be removed with a [bold]huge effort. This encourages[bold] household waste offences under the current UK systems of food packaging, labelling and refuse collection. [bold]Some companies have already made great efforts to produce a good quality, easily torn recyclable paper sleeves, whereas others make it extremely difficult to have their recyclable-label food packages to be prepared for recycling due to glue, plastic slips stuck too firmly into the plastic bottles and their recyclable food containers. I believe the current UK system needs standardization and to guarantee easily removable labels for the food and drinks packaging to reduce these household waste offences. In the Nordic countries (i.e. Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland) the shops are collecting used plastic bottles and have collection automates that issue tickets for shop cashiers to re-claim small token payments for the returned plastic bottles etc. from customer's shopping bill as a reward for returning the used food or drink packaging. This enhances high rates of recycling and reduces household refuse amounts and litter left on the streets, pavements and other public spaces like parks. Also rivers and seas in these countries are noticeably less polluted with the plastic waste than in the UK. I, therefore, suggest that the ultimate solution on household waste is to be resolved by other means than the prescribed fines which, however, is an excellent interim measure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The persistent offenders should see the fine rising gradually, i.e. say from £60, for the repeat offences with the further offending made progressively more expensive.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Clause 44: Repeal of duty to prepare sustainable community strategy[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The principle of sustainable communities should be enshrined in law and some mechanism 
[normal]must
[normal] maintain 
[normal]an
[normal] audit
[normal]able process 
[normal]that communities 
[normal]will 
[normal]remain viable in
[normal]to
[normal] the future
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Clause 49: Power to spell out dates described in legislation[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Clause 49: the issue of converting unspecified dates in legislation into any actual calendar dates must be personally conducted by a stipulated Minister of the Crown whose name should appear in brackets ( ) after the calendar date insertion. This reduces the possibility of clerical errors and implies a specified responsibility to the minister involved. "Overall, ministers have already decided that 1,910 substantive regulations will be scrapped or reduced." This will amount in innumerable changes in the legal texts and its cross references of dates, which raises the risk of mass-produced overhaul of the UK legal corpus having new clerical errors.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The commencement date is vague if there is a lack of reference 
[normal]who
[normal] made the authorised date insertion (to install the specified calendar date). The law should specifically stipulate it as minister's personal responsibility to oversee that the date given is correct, not to delegate the search to his aides without seeing all relevant documents, as any incorrect date could potentially lead to a vast number of costly legal disputes involving the government. It should also be explored whether insertion of specific calendar date should always mandatory, with the exceptions stating the conditions and reasons why the date was not made available in the first instance when the law was passed.
[normal] [bold]Clauses 50, 54, 55, 56: Legislation no longer of practical use[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Call for Written Evidence, Question 12: "Are the safeguards regarding the use of the "no longer of practical use" power (set out in Clauses 54 to 56) adequate and appropriate?"[bold]&#xa0;[bold]As response to Question 12 on Call for Written Evidence, the Clauses 50, 54, 55, 56 should specifically include the following guarantees that: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](a) 
[normal]specify
[normal] that they will not be intended to instigate a 
[normal]'social
[normal] change' which the minister might inadvertently, or intently, see (subjectively) as of 'bygone era', 'be obsolete'. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b) 
[normal]set
[normal] a limitation (demarcation of limits) to the ministerial powers. This is necessary as per the warning examples (quoted as ref. no. 7) below on the unintended legislative use to provide additional guarantees and reassurance against any unintended future abuses by Deregulation Bill - and any future similar pieces of legislation - against unforeseen (originally unintended) expansions of the legislative power to the executive arm of the UK government (i.e. the Ministers and the Queen/King) over the Houses of Parliament. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]EXAMPLE: [bold]A Case Study of [bold]the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ([bold]Ripa[bold])[bold]:[bold]My concern over this 
[normal]bill 
[normal]rises from recent interpretations of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (
[normal]Ripa
[normal]) that were used as a "
[normal]snooper's
[normal] charter" in minor cases:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"Seventy-seven of the 151 councils who responded to a Freedom of Information request admitted using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (
[normal]Ripa
[normal]) to crack down on "domestic waste, littering or fly-tipping offences" in the last three years. Last month The Sunday Telegraph disclosed that three-quarters of local authorities had used the act – which was introduced to help the police fight terrorism and crime in 2000 - to tackle minor misdemeanours."
[normal] 
[normal][11
[normal]]
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The law enacted originally for the anti-terrorism purposes was used indiscriminately by the councils: "Their surveillance tactics include hiding secret cameras on streets and even in neighbouring homes to catch householders putting their rubbish out on the wrong day. The Act allows public bodies – since expanded to include councils – to place residents and businesses under surveillance, trace telephone and email accounts and even send staff on undercover missions."
[normal] 
[normal][11
[normal]]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Councils are also using the Act to tackle dog fouling, the unauthorised sale of pizzas and even the abuse of the blue badge scheme for disabled drivers. Yet, the Local Government association was defending these actions that were carried out under law designed to fight against terrorist threats: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"A spokesman for the Local Government Association said that councils had been instructed to only use 
[normal]Ripa
[normal] when "absolutely necessary"
[normal]. "
[normal]These powers are essential in making sure that benefits cheats, fly-tippers, rogue traders and other serious criminals are caught and brought to justice." he said. Poole Borough Council in Dorset was one of the first local authorities to admit to using 
[normal]Ripa
[normal] to counter minor offences. It put a family under secret surveillance for two weeks to find out if they really lived in a school's catchment area."
[normal] 
[normal][11
[normal]]
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The unplanned use of legislation originally designed by the Houses of Parliament to fight terrorism and other extremely serious crime[bold] was later applied by the local governments, with the tacit support of the Local Government Association (as indicated above) to car
[normal]ry out mundane investigations 
[normal]to petty offences 
[normal]like
[normal] as spying on dog's 
[normal]fouling in streets or 
[normal]parks, or parents using a fake address to drop their children into a school that is prefer
[normal]r
[normal]e
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]by
[normal] them instead of school that they should have placed their children into another nearby school. Could something similar happen to the Deregulation Act 2014, if enacted?
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]In extreme cases, for example, minister or court could be issuing a ruling against religious observance of Christmas shopping hours, Sunday opening hours, or other worship elements citing socio-economic reasons as "no longer of practical use". It would be an extreme interpretation to regulate a religious activity or public holiday, which
[normal] -
[normal] as a result of social or economic development
[normal] -
[normal] may in future become issue if the religious observance takes place more rarely. However, the right to religious worship such as the Christmas Festivities period cessation of businesses and shops or other social activity should be safeguarded for the possible remaining minority opinions and social customs practitioners in an ever-changing composition of the British Society where old customs and norms are in constant flux. 
[normal]There is a [bold]Ripa[bold] style risk of expanding the interpretations of "no longer practical use" beyond the original intentions of the law maker by the future ministers or courts which should be foreseen in order not to repeat the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ([bold]Ripa[bold]) [bold]snooper's[bold] charter to social engineering projects by a back door.[bold]&#xa0;[bold](c) quantify that an entire law enacted by a full Houses of Parliament, involving possibly hundreds of its members, MPs, can never be revoked by an individual government minister, but that a full law, even if considered obsolete, have to be revoked by the Houses of Parliament with a proper opportunity for debate to end it. Only small portion or minor part, a limited number of obsolete paragraphs, say maximum of 20% of the legal text, should be only offered for ministerial revisions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal](d) 
[normal]procedurally
[normal] ensure that in future the UK law corpus is not revoked in large legal conglomerates, but the Law Commission, or Houses of Parliament research lawyers would ensure that all new laws are correctly cross-referenced at the time a Bill is voted to become a Law. There is the serious question in Deregulation Bill, whether it is advantageous, or even moral, to hav
[normal]e
[normal] in a modern information age a passages of such law corpuses t
[normal]hat one can compare to the Hamm
[normal]urabi's Law 
[normal]passed 
[normal]3786 years ago?
[normal] 
[normal][12
[normal]]
[normal] 
[normal]Unintended effect of a passage of a [bold]‘[bold]legal conglutinate kaleidoscope[bold]’[bold] increases considerably the risk of accidental inclusion/exclusion of laws within the selected rainbow that may be less considered (like [bold]Ripa[bold] was back in 2000) than they would [bold]normally[bold] be.[bold] [bold]"Call for Written Evidence" includes several overall issues regarding to the desirability of promoting economic growth. [bold]Questions 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21.[bold]The law has been written with the assumption that there is economic growth to be indefinitely maintained to the future the way as we understand it. This may be difficult to attain and there [bold]will[bold] be adjustment[bold]s[bold] [bold]t[bold]o the growth to ascertain the following factors:[bold]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Malthusian Growth Model

[normal]]
[normal] 
[normal]may require a diminishing resource availability for the growing population; this implies that the per capita Gross National Product will fall first, followed by the overall Gross National Product due to resource depletion of natural resources such as minerals and supply of oil and gas that are not renewable energy with infinite supply. A Club of Rome has made similar resource limitation forecasts
[normal] with the peak oil being the first brake
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In recent years
[normal] the atmosphere 
[normal]has 
[normal]show
[normal]n
[normal] signs of its finiteness as a sink of carbon dioxide from the 
[normal]human 
[normal]combustion of fossil fuels that are used by households with their appliances, industry with their machines and transport with vehicles.
[normal] Research suggests that there will be a junction where the climate-induced wealth destruction will at some point exceed the new wealth creation by the world’s economy. This will largely disrupt any further economic growth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many economic models are incomplete in their provisions to calculate for the depreciation of the ecosystem services which the previous generations have taken granted as free. The resource extraction is often accompanied by the depreciation of ecosystem services that people had been enjoying which no longer function due to the pollution. The use of atmosphere and waterways as a free sink for our wastes will have their upper limits.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The resource constraints may force societies to consider alternative benchmarks such as social development and acquisition of learning and skills that are given economic value in absence or scarcity of material resources. Indicators such as health, human wellbeing and happiness may be future economic capital as the societies are forced to rethink their identities in ever smaller and resource constrained world. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion:[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The infinite economic growth based on fossil fuelled consumption of goods and services facilitated by low central bank interest rates (money supply) may not work in the future due to all above said factors.
