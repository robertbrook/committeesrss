"&#xa0;\n                                                                          &#xa0;Written evidence from British Airways\n (WRT 030)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;\nBritish Airways welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the Transport Select Committee’s inquiry into \nWinter Resilience in Transport.\n&#xa0;\nBritish Airways is one of the world’s leading global premium airlines and the UK’s largest international scheduled airline, carrying approximately 37 million passengers worldwide annually, on around 830 daily flights.  The \nairline employs around 40,000 people, the vast majority of these at its sites throughout the UK, and has an annual turnover of over £9 billion.\n&#xa0;\nThe airline’s two main operating bases are London’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports, with a smaller base at Londo\nn City airport serving New York, European and domestic destinations.  From these three, British Airways flies over 280 aircraft to 173 destinations in more than 80 countries. In addition to passengers, the airline also transports cargo – more than 785,000 \ntonnes of cargo are carried around the globe each year. \n&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0; \nBritish Airways’ main operating base, Heathrow, is one of the world’s busiest international airports. Unlike other major competitor hubs in Europe, Heathrow has been operating for many year\ns at full capacity throughout most of the day. It is further constrained by rigorous limits on night movements and restrictions on how the capacity of its two runways is maximised. Therefore it is vital that the impact of this operating environment is full\ny understood when considering the response of airlines and airport operators to winter weather disruption. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0; \nWhile British Airways will continue to do everything in its power to minimise both the incidence and the impact of weather disruption, it is important to note that responsibility must lie with the airport operators and their service partners for ensuring t\nhat the airport, including runways, taxiways, aprons, service roads and public access points to and from the airport, are resilient to adverse weather conditions. Heathrow Airport Limited and Gatwick Airport Limited, together with other airport operators, \nmust continue to prioritise snow preparedness and provide timely, reliable and proactive responses both prior to, and during adverse weather events. \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0; \nThe impact of winter weather disruption on airport and airline operations is different for each event and\n is highly dependent on the nature and duration of the adverse weather conditions. Despite robust contingency planning, airlines would never be able to guarantee operating a full schedule during times of significant weather disruption. This is particularly\n the case at capacity constrained airports on the British Airways network, especially Heathrow. \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0; \nIt should be noted that Heathrow is not the only airport affected by winter weather disruption. In fact most UK airports, including Gatwick and London City, a\nnd many in Western Europe, including Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, also suffer disruption during adverse winter weather conditions. However disruption at Heathrow is usually a result of a complex set of factors, key among which is the challenge presented\n by attempting to recover following any operational disruption at an airport which is operating at full capacity. At peak periods of travel demand, the capability for airlines to re-book and reaccommodate disrupted customers is more challenging and does ha\nve a more detrimental customer impact for a longer duration.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0; \nBritish Airways has a significant operating presence at three of the key London Airports – Heathrow, Gatwick and London City – and any disruption will therefore have a disproportionate impact on\n the airline’s operations. This is especially the case at Heathrow where British Airways is the hub carrier.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0; \nSince 2010 British Airways has committed significant resources to planning and preparing for adverse winter weather conditions and the airline has\n held a company-wide review of its disruption planning process. In 2013 British Airways is investing over £18 million in improving its customers’ experience during times of disruption, and ensuring that British Airways staff can be mobilised effectively to\n deal with such disruption. The investment consists of developing new tools and technologies, as well as improving our training and processes.\n&#xa0;\n1.7\n&#xa0; \nBritish Airways is committed to improving the experience for its customers during disruption and their welfare i\ns extremely important to us. The airline has put in place improved resilience and contingency measures to deal with severe weather conditions through its Disruption Management Programme. British Airways is also working closely with the key airport operator\ns and service par\ntners to ensure that they \nare\n also\n suitably prepared to provide welfare support for our customers during disruption. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow resilient are the UK’s transport networks (including road, rail and air) to adverse winter weather?&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0; \nIt is vital that airport operators, airlines, surface transport providers, and government agencies co-ordinate more effectively to ensure that where transport is affected by adverse weather, the impact on passengers is minimised. For example, where airline\n operations are disrupted and airlines have the opportunity to recover by extending operations late into the night, it is vital that services such as surface transport provision and immigration facilities remain operational in order to minimise the risk of\n further disruption to customers. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat lessons have been learned since the severe weather experienced in the winter of 2009-10?&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0; \nBritish Airways cannot comment on the broader lessons learned by the wider transport sector, but the following lessons have \ninformed the specific approach taken by the airline since the severe weather experienced in 2009-2010, as well as disruption experienced in subsequent winters.\n&#xa0;3.2\n&#xa0; \nTo improve communications to our customers through all available channels during disruption – t\nhe feedback we received from customers su\nggested that there is a\n need to ensure systems that display critical operational information are set up in the most effective way, and that there is a desire for earlier notification of cancellations or delays commu\nnicated through more channels. \n&#xa0;3.3\n&#xa0; \nTo offer customers choice/options when their journey has been disrupted – an improved\n approach to dealing with rebooking and refunds has been implemented.\n&#xa0;3.4\n&#xa0; \nNeed for Improved operational planning and delivery during periods of disruption – the effectiveness of the Heathrow Air Traffic Management Demand and Capacity Balancing group (HADACAB) - which is responsible for deciding on the percentage reduction of fli\nghts needed to deal with expected disruption - and the consistency in the Met Office weather forecasting\n, has\n indicated that these are on-going issues and more development work needs to be done. In the past, the lack of an agreed multi-lateral schedule red\nuction and the success rate of the \nMet Office to forecast the severity of weather were major contributing factors to disruption. In addition, the prolonged closure of both of the runways at Heathrow for snow sweeping has had a material impact on delivering\n the operation. \n(Please see 6.1 for further details regarding HADACAB).\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0; \nTo review and revise our command and control processes and procedures, including training – for example\n,\n the operational triggers that indicate the most appropriate level of command a\nnd escalation needed to be revisited. As a result\n,\n a revised Crisis Management Process has now been implemented. \n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0; \nProviding customer facing colleagues with enhanced training and tools – a review of British Airway’s ‘Customer Support Programme’ proposition\n and communication was necessary to ensure colleagues are motivated, well briefed and intelligently deployed to assist our customers during times of disruption.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n&#xa0; \nIncreased regularity of process and procedure exercises – British Airways has now implemented \nmore regular and cross-company exercises to improve its ability to respond in a real situation.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat practical changes have been made to ensure the UK is now better equipped to deal with severe weather?&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0; \nHeathrow Airport is British Airways’ main \noperating base and any disruption at this airport is likely to have an impact on all of its operations – because of this\n,\n Heathrow is the main focus in this section.\n&#xa0;4.2\n&#xa0; \nThe airline has undertaken a full review of its response to severe weather disruption in order to introduce improvements that will help to minimise the negative impact on its passengers. As part of this review the airline has looked at the ways other compa\nnies help their customers during times of disruption and listened to feedback from both customers and colleagues. \n&#xa0;\n      \nWinter Resilience4.3\n&#xa0; \nSince 2010 British Airways has expanded its de-icing capability, investing in a significant amount of new equipment \nto the value of more than £6 million. In addition, the airline is developing a safe and reliable de-icing operation at Heathrow to ensure this is not a limiting factor in any adverse winter weather conditions to departing aircraft, for example, by:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;      Customer Experience4.4\n&#xa0; \nBritish Airways is investing £18 million in improving its customers’ experience during disruption. Over the next 12 months the airline’s new ‘Disruption Management Programme’ will provide the right tools, technologies, trai\nning and processes so that British Airways can continue to deliver outstanding service to its customers, even in times of disruption.\n \nBritish Airways has improved how it manages its customers’ journeys when they have been disrupted with the following measu\nres:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0; \nA new ‘Customer Response Team’ has been introduced to increase colleague presence in the terminals during times of significant dis\nruption, by supplementing the team with office-based colleagues. British Airways has also increased its pool of volunteers who have been fully trained to support customer contact centres.\n&#xa0;\n4.6\n&#xa0; \nStaff at Heathrow, Gatwick and London City airports have been \nequipped with new technology to better serve customers with information and rebooking services during times of disruption. The introduction of mobile device technology in airport terminals will result in a superior and speedier resolution for the customer \nin times of disruption. This technology will also ensure colleagues have up-to-date operational flight information, and will be empowered to answer customer queries efficiently, both during normal operations and in times of disruption\n&#xa0;\n4.7\n&#xa0; \nA review of customer\n hotel booking and allocation processes has been undertaken to make it more efficient. The Hotel Provision Project has been set up in partnership with Heathrow Airport Ltd (HAL) and the British Hotel Reservation Centre (BHRC), to \"share inventory\" about ho\ntel rooms during disruption and to identify suitable facilities around Heathrow.\n&#xa0;\n4.8\n&#xa0; \nThe airline’s ‘Vulnerable Customers Process’ – a company policy designed to help customers with reduced mobility and unaccompanied minors - has been reviewed at Heathrow and \nBritish Airways has introduced the following improvements: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThese initiatives supplement the existing Passenger with Reduced Mobilit\ny (PRM) and Unaccompanied Minor (UM) processes.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Control Centre Operations4.9\n&#xa0; \nBritish Airways is reconfiguring its systems, accountabilities and controls that provide colleagues with the tools and behavioural parameters to work within, in managing the operation and any form of disruption, including: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Other UK airports:              4.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll of the UK and Ireland airports are prepared for the coming winter. Our de-icing providers have assured us that they have equipm\nent, manpower and de-icing fluid ready and in place at all stations to ensure that an effective and rigorous de-icing process is delivered on British Airways’ behalf. In support of the de-icing programme, our airport teams work with the various airport ope\nrators to ensure they have a robust airside and landside snow plan, ensuring our customers, colleagues and aircraft can move and operate safely in winter conditions.\n&#xa0;\n4.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhere cancellations are unavoidable, our airport teams have plans in place to handle disr\nuption up to and including full programme cancellations. The teams prepare weekly updates of hotel accommodation, coach and baggage delivery providers in order to understand potential pinch points or threats to our operation. This is shared between the tea\nms and held in readiness should disruption occur. Finally, we are communicating with our \noffline diversion stations (airports which are not normally served by British Airways) regarding their readiness and ability to handle diversions this winter, includin\ng airport infrastructure, local hotel and coach providers, and any other key details that we can use to prepare for disruption.\n&#xa0;\n4.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll of the above are constantly being reviewed and revised where necessary. The team share learning and collaborate with \nservice providers and colleagues alike to ensure we deliver the best we can for the customer in challenging circumstances.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat more should be done to ensure a coordinated response?&#xa0;6.1 \nHeathrow Demand and Capacity Balancing Group (HADACAB)A key \nrecommendation of the Begg Inquiry in 2011, following the snow disruption of December 2010, was for Heathrow Airport to proactively declare a reduced capacity based on the forecast weather to enable the airlines to proactively amend their schedule in order\n to give customers advanced notification of revised schedules. To date this has taken the form of the HADACAB – Heathrow Demand and Capacity Balancing Group – process. HADACAB is backed by a local rule at Heathrow which mandates airlines to follow its inst\nructions. Its main drawback though has been identified by British Airways, Heathrow Airport Ltd and NATS as having no power to mandate schedule reductions or changes in advance of an expected adverse event. It only comes into effect once the disruption has\n commenced. Up to now HADACAB has been reluctant to invoke proactive capacity reduction, and on occasions where the decision has been made, compliance by the airlines has been poor and inconsistent. It is worth noting that airports such as Paris Charles De\n Gaulle, under the auspices of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, act consistently and ensure compliance.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0; \nIn order to improve the effectiveness of HADACAB, thereby giving passengers more accurate information of the flying programme, airlines need \nconfidence that Heathrow Airport Ltd will invoke HADACAB and take the necessary proactive capacity decisions and that all carriers will abide by the rules, that the reductions necessary are proportionate, that the Met Office forecasts they are based upon a\nre accurate and reliable, and finally, that airlines will not be liable for future claims under EU261 rules for cancellations made under a HADACAB determination. The CAA has indicated on the last point that they are sympathetic but it would be very useful \nfor the Department for Transport to take a proactive role in confirming this. \n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0; \nThere is an urgent need for the UK government and the CAA to work with relevant European institutions to provide airlines with reassurance that, where cancellations or delays a\nre caused by collective decisions in a properly governed decision-making body such as HADACAB, airlines which comply with requests to implement capacity reductions in the interest of minimising disruption to passengers overall, will not be liable to provid\ne compensation to those passengers who are disrupted under EU261. Clarity on this issue will be vital if the airline community is to commit to full participation in implementing the decisions of HADACAB.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
