[normal]WWC003[bold]Written evidence submitted by Richard Burden MP[bold]Introduction[bold]As the MP for Birmingham Northfield I welcome the oppo
[normal]rtunity to make a submission to the Education Select Committee inquiry into the educational underachievement of white working class children.
[normal]This submission 
[normal]builds on a debate I held on this issue 
[normal]i
[normal]n May 2009, when a report funded by Birmingham City Counc
[normal]il revealed that 
[normal]a high number of white pupils on free school meals in Birmingham we
[normal]re performing poorly at schools.
[normal]1
[normal] 
[normal]My response focuses on the 
[normal]extent of – and factors leading to –
[normal] 
[normal]white working class pupils 
[normal]educational underachievement, and approaches th
[normal]e Government can ta
[normal]ke in response
[normal].
[normal] In summary, this 
[normal]submission:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Extent of White Working Class Underachievement[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In 20
[normal]10-2011
[normal] less than a third of white British students eligible for Free School Means (FSM) reached the national GCSE target of 5A*-C passes including English and Maths. Barely a quarter of boys, and just above a third of girls, achieved the target. In contrast, 63%
[normal] of white British students not eligible for FSM reached the national target. The 
[normal]size of the attainment gap 
[normal]between FSM and non-FSM students is unique to t
[normal]he white
[normal] ethnic group.
[normal]2
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In Birmingham, statistics from 2001-2003 revealed that
[normal] following
[normal] African Car
[normal]ibbean boys 
[normal]receiving
[normal] FSM, 
[normal]the 
[normal]demographic groups least likely to achieve 5 A*-C at GCSE were white boys and girls
[normal] receiving
[normal] FSM. Looking beyond averages, the absolute numbers of white pupils underachieving in education makes this issue particularly concer
[normal]ning. In 2003, 486 white pupils (compared to 89 Pakistani pupils, 56 black pupils, and 18 Bangladeshi pupils) in Birmingham did not achieve any GCSE grades at all.
[normal] 
[normal]1 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In higher education, 2012 saw a fall of
[normal] 
[normal]54,000 
[normal]white 
[normal]men applying to university, 
[normal]which w
[normal]as 
[normal]a
[normal] d
[normal]ecrease of 13% from 
[normal]2011 
[normal]– 
[normal]and four tim
[normal]es higher than the reduction of female 
[normal]applicants. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Factors leading to White Working Class Underachievement [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The
[normal] reality is still that if you are white and disadvantaged, you are half as likely to achieve in education as those who are better off. 
[normal]The odds are decisively stacked against poor white [bold]children achieving within the education system. [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]reasons for educ
[normal]ational underachievement 
[normal]in impoverished groups 
[normal]are myriad 
[normal]and well documented
[normal]. Inadequate 
[normal]housing, weak parental involvement, 
[normal]poor schoo
[normal]l quality, familial low income and unemployment, and low aspiration and expectation
[normal] 
[normal]all 
[normal]contributing 
[normal]to 
[normal]why 
[normal]children 
[normal]from lower socio-
[normal]economic groups are less successful at school
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The geographic
[normal]al
[normal] areas in which white working class educational underachievement is most marked are also the areas 
[normal]that have
[normal] undergone massive change in employment patterns and relative weal
[normal]th. In many cases this is associated with the decline of large enterprises associated with traditional industries – such as manufacturing – over the last quarter of the 20
[normal]th
[normal] Century. Although some of those industries have undergone a major and very positiv
[normal]e transformation in recent years (such as automotive), 
[normal]this innovation has often bypassed the people in the areas
[normal] traditionally 
[normal]associated
[normal] with those industries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The result is that inequality has grown, albeit highly unevenly even in geographically compac
[normal]t areas, with pockets of high deprivation, low skills, high long term unemployment and low aspiration close to areas of relative affluence. 
[normal]This has a 
[normal]major impact in increasing educational underachievement in the areas concerned. There are lessons here ab
[normal]out the impact of some of the government’s current welfare reforms, which could 
[normal]further 
[normal]aggravate the problem. That these issues are beyond the sc
[normal]ope of this paper should not 
[normal]minimise their importance.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The ‘neighbourhood effect
[normal]’ – how a community social
[normal]ises p
[normal]eople – is also a leading factor in 
[normal]reinforcing cycles
[normal] of
[normal] low aspiration and
[normal] underachievement.
[normal]3
[normal] 
[normal]Children in white working class communities do not benefit from the 
[normal]social and cultural capital of the middle classes, which is more conducive to
[normal] success 
[normal]in
[normal] education
[normal] and schools. 
[normal]W
[normal]hite children from disadvant
[normal]aged backgrounds do not grow up with 
[normal]the 
[normal]knowledge
[normal] – or role models 
[normal]– that
[normal] demonstrate that education
[normal] 
[normal]provides 
[normal]opportunity, 
[normal]or that hard work 
[normal]creates
[normal] success and financial security. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]School based [bold]interventions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In terms of specific 
[normal]interventions to
[normal] address white 
[normal]underachievement
[normal] at school
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]lessons can be 
[normal]learnt 
[normal]from success in
[normal] reducing black minority et
[normal]hnic disadvantage in education. Action is needed on a number of different levels: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]In 2009 
[normal]I stated that 
[normal]when statistics are compiled to inform education policy
[normal], the
[normal] 
[normal]Government must
[normal] subdivide the white ethnic group according to 
[normal]eligibility 
[normal]for free school meals. 
[normal]Although the results of white children on FSM are now collect
[normal]ed, 
[normal]m
[normal]ajor improvements need to be made in the dissemination
[normal] of data 
[normal]so
[normal] that
[normal] 
[normal]accurate conclusions 
[normal]and assessment
[normal] 
[normal]can be made easily
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Subdividing results by raci
[normal]al and economic categories needs to become
[normal] routine 
[normal]and explicit 
[normal]if we are to
[normal] better
[normal] understand, and act upon, 
[normal]this issue. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Schools – and teachers –
[normal] are critical for 
[normal]equipping children with the skills, opportunities and behaviour that will help them succeed in later life.  
[normal]R
[normal]aising school quality in disadvantaged areas is clearl
[normal]y of paramount importance 
[normal]for improving achievement
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Schools in disadvantaged areas face 
[normal]resourcing 
[normal]pressures (such as equipment, subsidising the cost of trips, security and pastoral care) and difficulty in staff retention, standards and morale
[normal]. 
[normal]The [bold]Govern[bold]ment should consider [bold]options for [bold]t[bold]argeting funding on [bold]schools in areas with low white working class achievemen[bold]t[bold] beyond the Pupil Premium[bold]. [bold]Th
[normal]ese
[normal] could include 
[normal]measures to incentivise outstanding teachers
[normal],
[normal] or support q
[normal]uality 
[normal]vocational
[normal] schemes
[normal] that provide real to alternatives to the academic route.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Research has also demonstrated
[normal] that
[normal] successful
[normal] schools can 
[normal]have
[normal] a small scale, local 
[normal]impact on regeneration within 
[normal]a community.
[normal]4
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]impact
[normal] 
[normal]that the new
[normal] Bournville College – opened in 2010 with
[normal] Lab
[normal]our Government funding for the regeneration of Longbridge
[normal] 
[normal]after MG Rover collapsed in 200
[normal]5 – has made in my constituency
[normal] is testament to how 
[normal]well-
[normal]run educational 
[normal]facilities can raise local aspiration and 
[normal]opportunities
[normal].
[normal] Further targeted efforts, similar to 
[normal]that which funded Bournville, are needed. In light of this, the Department of Education must question the provision of resources and support for new free 
[normal]schools and academies 
[normal]in areas where there are already good schools
[normal] 
[normal]– 
[normal]or 
[normal]where 
[normal]the development of impr
[normal]oving schools could be undermined
[normal]. Rather, the focus must be on
[normal] targeting the 
[normal]areas of greatest need.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]But, as noted above, a child’s background and environment is almost decisive in determining their educational outcomes. Although improving school quality
[normal] in disadvantaged areas is important, the Government must recognise that the impact a school can have in turning a child’s life chances around is limited. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]It has also been well noted that 
[normal]strong 
[normal]parental engagement is important for raising 
[normal]educational achievement.
[normal]5
[normal] 
[normal]Successful parenting for 
[normal]education includes
[normal] the
[normal] provision of a stable and secur
[normal]e environment
[normal] for study
[normal],
[normal] raising a child’s aspiration and ambition, and crucially – 
[normal] strong
[normal] 
[normal]participation wi
[normal]th the school. However s
[normal]chool discriminatio
[normal]n
[normal], stereotyping and
[normal] distrust 
[normal]of low income parents
[normal] has been well noted and remains a barrier to the successful engagement of such families in their child’s education.
[normal]6
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T[bold]he Government [bold]need to consider[bold] [bold]how [bold]schools can improve engagement with families from [bold]disadvantaged[bold] backgrounds[bold]. P
[normal]olicies to 
[normal]ensure schools can 
[normal]constructively and positively engage with parents from w
[normal]hite working class backgrounds will be crucial for
[normal] ensur
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]parents 
[normal]will s
[normal]upport, 
[normal]rather than restrict
[normal],
[normal] educational achievement. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Tackling [bold]the Economic Environment[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]However, the Government must recognise that the 
[normal]o[bold]verall impact of a young person’s external environment on attainment is enormous.[bold] 3.5 million children in the UK live in poverty, a figure which is expected to rise further with the
[normal] introduction of the Government’s tax and benefit reforms. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given the fundamental importance of eco
[normal]nomic inequality and community, 
[normal]there is a clear need to tackle and economic environment to increase white working class attainment. 
[normal]A piecemeal response - 
[normal]focusing solely on school based interventions and not tackling larger national questions of unemployment, skills, low pay and work insecurity, the poor availability and affordability of housing, and the rising cost of living – will be ineffective at improv
[normal]ing opportunities for poor white children.
[normal] At a more local level, t
[normal]here must be a concerted effort to ensure that physical and 
[normal]enterprise regeneration initiatives reach 
[normal]the areas concerned.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The importance of the wider economic environment in a child’s edu
[normal]cation highlights
[normal] why targeted educational initiatives of the kind outlined in this paper 
[normal]will need to consider the
[normal] industrial heritage of the communities involved
[normal], and aim to
[normal] dramatically 
[normal]boost skills
[normal] 
[normal]in the industries of the future. But rather than as a 
[normal]wake for days gone by, 
[normal]this heritage needs to be celebrated and built on
[normal] 
[normal]raise aspiration for the future.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]An Inclusive Cultural A[bold]pproach[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Multi-culturalism has made a highly successful and valuable contribution to
[normal] 
[normal]UK
[normal] 
[normal]society
[normal] – making our country
[normal] more inclusive, tolerant and vibrant
[normal]. 
[normal]But
[normal] it is well documented that there has been insufficient 
[normal]recognition and celebration of 
[normal]the 
[normal]often diverse heritage of
[normal] 
[normal]culture and 
[normal]identity of
[normal] white communities, particularly in or near to major towns or in specific 
[normal]areas of the country 
[normal]– 
[normal]such as traditional coastal resorts
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] The
[normal] Department of Education has previously acknowledged that needs to greater efforts made to include white people in discussions on diversity and identity,
[normal]7
[normal] but there is little evidence to demon
[normal]strate that 
[normal]the Government has actively pursued 
[normal]such pol
[normal]icies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Schools are important places for helpin
[normal]g children explore
[normal] their identity, and more 
[normal]emphasis needs to be made on how teachers can support white pupils to develop and express their culture 
[normal]and 
[normal]background
[normal]. When developing such policies, the Government must be cautious to ensure that a white
[normal] British history and narrative 
[normal]is not promoted at the
[normal] expense of all other
[normal] cultures – as
[normal] is the danger with the current Secretary of State for Education’s
[normal] refo
[normal]rm of national curriculum.
[normal] It must also be 
[normal]clearly
[normal] differentiated
[normal] 
[normal]and unequivocally opposed to 
[normal]the racially divisive approach of groups such as E
[normal]nglish 
[normal]D
[normal]efence 
[normal]L
[normal]eague (EDL) and t
[normal]he British National Party (BNP). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The kind of approach
[normal] 
[normal]articulated by perform
[normal]ers such as Billy Bragg and academics such as 
[normal]the 
[normal]Birmingham community historian, Carl Chinn, may be useful in taking forward this expression of identity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In brief, t
[normal]he focus must be on
[normal] promoting a more inclusive approach
[normal], which
[normal] 
[normal]celebrates
[normal] the numerous di
[normal]fferent cultures that make up 
[normal]the 21
[normal]st
[normal] Century British identity
[normal] and aims 
[normal]to ensure that the school environment gives children from all backgrounds a fair start.
