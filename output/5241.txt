[[[VSO Submission to International Development Select Committee Inquiry into Disability and Development.]]]

[[[Introduction ]]]VSO is an international development agency with 55 years’ experience of addressing poverty and disadvantage through our unique approach of working through volunteers. By working closely over time with carefully selected partners – from grassroots organisations to government ministries – volunteers provide the right support to help ensure that local development efforts deliver greatest impact and lasting change. VSO aims to support disabled people to participate as equal members of their families, communities and societies. Volunteers are supporting local agencies and governments to identify strategies that promote disabled people's human rights, such as education, employment and healthcare.  We do this by supporting disabled people's groups to raise awareness of issues that affect disabled people, and working to improve the accessibility and quality of mainstream and special services provided by both the government and by non-governmental organisations. We welcome the opportunity to submit evidence to this inquiry. VSO is a member of the Global Campaign for Education (GCE UK), and supports its submission to this inquiry.
