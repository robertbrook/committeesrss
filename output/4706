[normal]Written evidence from the British Ports Association (LTD0039)
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Summary of main points:-[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We welcome this inquiry which covers a critical part of transport
[normal] decision making.  The British Ports Association (BPA) represents 48 ports in England, all of which will depend on the adequacy of their links to the transport network.  Local decision making is especially important as it is often the final links to ports 
[normal]that are the most problematic, a point we have made in various responses to the Committee.  Although some BPA members have an interest in rail connections, our overwhelming interest is in road connections which carry 85% of the cargo entering and leaving p
[normal]orts, and virtually all passengers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We believe that decision making should be guided by five principles to reflect not only port interests but the interests of everyone who has a stake in the commercial health of the UK and its efficiency and competitiven
[normal]ess.  These are :-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Underpinned by:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our responses below to the Committee’s questions are based on the fact that devolving more responsibility to local decision making is at a very early and largely untested stage.  We have little experience of how the new organisations will work or of their 
[normal]effectiveness, particularly in comparison with their predecessor, the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs).  The way in which funding is allocated in 2015 and beyond through the Single Local Growth Fund will, in our view, represent a significant test.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Que[bold]stions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]What is the rationale for the government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the government’s appr
[normal]oach
[normal]?  Are there better models?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is for the government t
[normal]o explain the rationale but we have no problem in principle with devolving decision making to a local level, and indeed we can see a number of advantages assuming a genuinely increased involvement of local organisations which should be more aware of local 
[normal]issues and requirements.  Another potential advantage is that the split between 
[normal]Highways Agency (HA) functions and local responsibilities becomes clearer, and co ordination between the HA and local bodies will therefore be a key part of the success of the 
[normal]new arrangements. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Do local bodies have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes?  What would the optimum delivery body look like?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At a time when local government is under severe financial pressure the addition of these 
[normal]responsibilities will test the capacity and resources of local authorities in particular.  RDAs were substantial organisations and resourced to create transport strategies which were widely consulted on.  The likely result – and there is already some evide
[normal]nce for it – is that local authorities will take a much narrower view of transport needs and not take account of the strategic context or, possibly, not have the capacity to keep their list of wanted projects up to date.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]LTBs rightly include
[normal] private secto
[normal]r representatives
[normal].  Initial experience is that involvement can be very time consuming, particularly in these early stages, and resources in the private sector are as under pressure as those in the public sector.  LTBs will need to operate in ways which can
[normal] ensure that ports and other private sector representatives can remain fully engaged.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clearly co ordination between the LTBs
[normal] is going to be vital.  We believe that the Committee has already identified this as an issue in its report into ‘Access to Ports’ (para 15).  This draws attention to the benefits of local organisations giving ‘proper consideration to port schemes’ which s
[normal]hould ‘not be overlooked because they might not obviously benefit local people or businesses’.  It also recommends, and we entirely support this, that the DfT should itself ‘act as an advocate for ports’ and possibly challenge local decisions which potenti
[normal]ally neglect port interests.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These are important recommendations and if implemented should go some way to ensuring that schemes of a wider regional and national significance are not marginalised.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How effectively do local bodies work with each other and 
[normal]with government departments and national transport agencies?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is an area yet to be tested and we have no real experience on which to base any comments at present.  We would however comment that bearing in mind the significant changes also underway wit
[normal]h the Highways Agency ( and the winding up of RDAs) we now have a system quite different from that which was operating only a short while ago.  We would refer back here to the principles we outlined at the outset and the need for stability and long term th
[normal]inking.  The action by successive government
[normal]s
[normal] is normally to bring in radical change; we have no objection per se to this, but the effort and resources involved in delivering new arrangements are considerable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Do the current funding streams for major loca
[normal]l transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In its recent document ‘Action for Roads’ the government by its own admission acknowledges that the quality of the transport networ
[normal]k has been falling behind, that other countries ‘have invested more in their networks’ and that our roads are ranked twenty fourth in the world and 
[normal]some way behind many EU competitors.  We can only assume that funding is insufficient compared with similar 
[normal]economies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to LTBs and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The new arrangements for 2015 and beyond will introduce a high degree of competition between different LTBs for what remains 
[normal]a relatively small amount of funding.  From what we understand, the amount available is largely a combination of existing funding which will be the subject of competitive tendering between LTBs rather than allocated by central government.  We fear that whi
[normal]le the process may have changed and injected more local involvement, it will nevertheless not lead to any major change in the quality of the network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and mainten
[normal]ance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The recent decision on the A14 whereby plans for tolling have been withdrawn suggests that achieving public acceptance of tolls and making them effecti
[normal]ve are some way off.  Even if schemes were to be introduced, at best their impact is likely to be marginal and there are no expectations of motorway or other tolling of the type used on the Continent, or indeed in London.  Ports have their own guidance on 
[normal]developer contributions and we note and welcome the Committee’s call in its ‘Access to Ports
[normal]’ 
[normal]report for a refresh of that guidance.  In the absence of realistic private sector options, paying for road infrastructure has to be ultimately the responsibility
[normal] of national government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For the new arrangements this should become more apparent with the start of the Single Local Growth Fund in 2015.  With a clearer disti
[normal]nction between central and local government spending, accountability should be improved and this may be a benefit arising out of the changes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In conclusion we can see some potential benefits in the new local arrangements and ports are already fully invol
[normal]ved in both LEPs and LTBs.  Longer term stability for the Highways Agency should also provide benefits.  The extent of funding, however, 
[normal]remains our greatest concern and we are not convinced that sufficient funds will be available to meet the welcome but a
[normal]mbitious targets set out in the DfT’s ‘Action for Roads’ document.
