[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]National Grid owns and manages the grids to which many different energy sources are connected. In 
[normal]Britain
[normal] we run systems that deliver gas and electricity across the entire country. We hold a vital position at the centre of the energy system. We join everything up.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]National Grid is at the heart of one of the greatest challenges 
[normal]for the 
[normal]UK
[normal] energy industry - to
[normal] deliver low carbon energy in an affordable, secure and sustainable way. This is an industry wide challenge that will require an estimated £200 billion of investment up to 2020 to transform the UK’s energy infrastructure
[normal], 
[normal]e
[normal]nsuring the development of an energy system that can underpin our economic prosperity in the 21st century.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We develop 
[normal]scenarios
[normal],
[normal] based on extensive industry and stakeholder feedback
[normal],
[normal] which present pathways to decarbonisation. 
[normal]These scenarios are detaile
[normal]d in our 
[normal]UK Future Energy Scenarios[bold] (FES)[bold], the latest version of 
[normal]which
[normal] 
[normal]were published in July 2013.
[normal]These scenarios are used as a reference point for a range of modelling activities, enabling us to identify strategic network investment requirements for the future. 
[normal]Our scenarios do not predict the 
[normal]future
[normal]; t
[normal]hey explore a range
[normal] 
[normal]of plausible outcomes and the
[normal] complete scope of potential
[normal] 
[normal]drivers that might have an impact on that outcome. This year we have developed two scenarios:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In this paper, we have specifically detailed our scenarios related to heat.
[normal] 
[normal]In addition, we refer to analysis carried out by:

[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Decarbonising heat will be a vital step in he
[normal]lping the 
[normal]UK
[normal] to meet its 2050 
[normal]carbon 
[normal]targets
[normal], more so than the 2020 renewable targets. Heat represents nearly 50% of 
[normal]UK
[normal] end use energy and contributes to 30% of CO2 emissions. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, it is not just the size of heat demand
[normal],
[normal] but the fact that it is extremely seasonal and energy system capacity is need
[normal]ed
[normal] to meet the winter peak, as evidenced by the 2012 heat demand curves shown below.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Gas currently dominates the heat supply curve, 83% of the 
[normal]UK
[normal]’s buildings are heated by gas and similarly most industrial heat demands are fuelled by gas. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the future, in order to hit climate change targets
[normal],
[normal] technologies will need to be deployed such as electric heat pumps, gas heat
[normal] 
[normal]pumps and heat networks in order to decarbonise heat. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our analysis indicates that there is no single solution
[normal],
[normal] but a balance of technologies and methods will need to be deployed
[normal] depending on timing, location
[normal] and
[normal] property type. At a high level, our scenarios indicate a pathway as follows:

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Whilst these pathways are optimal 
[normal]from
[normal] a system perspective
[normal],
[normal] there are still significant consumer challenges to the take up of new heating technologies, due to the cost and suitability of the technology to meet the needs of the U
[normal]K
[normal] housing stock. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Investment in new domestic heating technologie
[normal]s will need to be affordable for consumers and appropriate for the 
[normal]UK
[normal] housing stock. Energy Networks Association (ENA) commissioned a study
[normal] (led by Delta-
[normal]EE
[normal]) examining carbon reduction in domestic heat. The report detailed different solutions required for
[normal] different property types
[normal],
[normal] and concluded that ongoing Government interventions will be necessary to transition consumers to low carbon appliances
[normal]. The report also found that 
[normal]maintaining a balanced approach across gas, electric and heat networks requires le
[normal]ss intervention than if gas were to be removed from buildings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The development of heat pumps will be of
[normal] 
[normal]great importance in meeting 
[normal]the UK’s 
[normal]environmental
[normal] 
[normal]targets. Our assumptions
[normal], as detailed in our Future Energy Scenarios, 
[normal]on the type of 
[normal]heat
[normal] 
[normal]pump
[normal]s
[normal] fitted in 
[normal]domestic homes
[normal] remains unchanged
[normal] 
[normal]from last year, with 
[normal]the majority be
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]air source
[normal] 
[normal]heat pumps.
[normal] 
[normal]The extra work involved in laying piping for
[normal] 
[normal]ground-source heat pumps suggests that costs
[normal] 
[normal]will be significantly higher. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In our 2013 Gone 
[normal]Green scenario
[normal],
[normal] we project the number of heat pumps increases from 100,000 today to 1.2m in 2020 and 5.7m by 2030. Initially
[normal],
[normal] we see heat
[normal] 
[normal]pumps replacing existing resistive electrical heating in off gas grid properties
[normal],
[normal] and as a consequence initially elect
[normal]ricity demand for heat falls. As more heat
[normal] 
[normal]pumps are deployed
[normal],
[normal] demand on the electricity system increases as they start to replace oil boilers
[normal],
[normal] and later in the scenario gas boilers. 
[normal]The scenario sees 
[normal]potentially 
[normal]50% of homes 
[normal]having some sort of heat pump 
[normal]by 2050
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, gas still has a very important role to play, through more efficient appliances coming to market such as gas heat pumps, and dual fuel units that will use gas to provide ‘top up’ heat at peak times in the home. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In all cases
[normal],
[normal] however,
[normal] a 
[normal]high level
[normal] 
[normal]o
[normal]f insulation is required to ensure the
[normal] best use of the
[normal] 
[normal]lower temperature heat delivered by heat pumps.
[normal] 
[normal]Currently, u
[normal]pwards of 12 million properties meet
[normal] 
[normal]this criterion,
[normal] with this figure 
[normal]expected to 
[normal]increase
[normal] 
[normal]under the Green Deal scheme.

[normal]The timescales
[normal] 
[normal]for installing heat pumps will be a crucial factor
[normal] 
[normal]in determining the level of uptake of this
[normal] 
[normal]technology
[normal],
[normal] as many boiler
[normal] 
[normal]/ heating replacements
[normal] 
[normal]are distressed purchases when the existing
[normal] 
[normal]heating fails.
[normal] 
[normal]In our assumptions,
[normal] heat pumps are initially
[normal] 
[normal]concentrated in houses 
[normal]which are 
[normal]not connected to the
[normal] 
[normal]gas grid and 
[normal]encouraged by 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment policy to
[normal] 
[normal]electrify heat through the
[normal] Renewable Heat Incentive (
[normal]RHI
[normal]|)
[normal], the Renewable
[normal] 
[normal]Heat Premium Payment (RHPP) incentive scheme,

[normal]Questions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment approach to reduce heat energy demand has been twofold
[normal] – i)
[normal] key policies to reduce the heat demand through insulation (such as ECO and CERT)
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]ii) 
[normal]legislation on boilers to improve the efficiency of heat production. Both 
[normal]of 
[normal]these policies
[normal], 
[normal]coupled with rising energy costs
[normal],
[normal] have seen heat demand fall. 
[normal]I
[normal]mproving 
[normal]building standards in new builds has also had an impact. However, further progress could be made with insulation penetration
[normal],
[normal] and it is unclear whether the Green Deal will provide sufficient impetus for the reductions to continue. In our 2013 FES scenarios
[normal] both in Gone Green and Slow Progression uptake of insulation is lower than assumed in the 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment
[normal]’s
[normal] Green Deal Impact Assessment, whilst similar progress to historic trends is made in boiler energy savings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Since 2005, significant and continuing
[normal] 
[normal]increases in energy prices, combined
[normal] 
[normal]with 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment policies, have brought
[normal] 
[normal]about substantial increases in residential
[normal] 
[normal]energy efficiency.
[normal] 
[normal]Investment in insulation and energy efficienc
[normal]y programmes, heating controls and behaviour change can significantly reduce the demand for heat in an economic and sustainable way
[normal],
[normal] and should be the highest priority on our pathway to meeting 2050 carbon reduction targets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the last 5-10 years, 
[normal]significant savings have occurred through improved insulation, with cavity wall and loft insulation seeing the greatest energy demand
[normal] 
[normal]improvements. This has been
[normal] 
[normal]primarily due to 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment energy efficiency
[normal] 
[normal]schemes such as the Carbon Emission Reduction 
[normal]Target (CERT)
[normal],
[normal] and the Community Energy Saving
[normal] 
[normal]Programme (CESP) also contributing to
[normal] 
[normal]an increase in solid wall insulation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have seen CERT and the previous EEC reduce domestic heat demand by around 10% in the last decade (roughly 30TWh 
[normal]heat
[normal] demand savi
[normal]ng annually). Since 2006 the savings derived from the legal requirement to install condensing boilers has reduced domestic gas demand further by around 10% (roughly 30TWh 
[normal]gas
[normal] demand saving annually). Our scenarios assess that a further 30-40TWh 
[normal]of 
[normal]annual g
[normal]as demand savings will occur due to continued boiler replacement, under the existing legislation
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Energy savings from cavity wall insulation are
[normal] 
[normal]greater than those from loft and solid wall
[normal] 
[normal]insulation, due to the combination of uptake
[normal] 
[normal]numbers and the amount
[normal] each installation can
[normal] 
[normal]save. The cavity wall insulation savings account for
[normal] 
[normal]more than the other two measures added together
[normal] 
[normal]by 2020. Solid wall insulation has the greatest
[normal] 
[normal]variability as there remains
[normal] 
[normal]considerable uncertainty over how the Green Deal
[normal] 
[normal]and En
[normal]ergy Company Obligation (ECO) incentives will influence the take-up of
[normal] 
[normal]solid wall insulation.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]electrification of heat using either air sourced or ground sourced heat pumps is expected to play a very significant role in the future management of domestic heat by 2050. However, there is still a role for gas in heat in 2050
[normal],
[normal] as it is more economic to p
[normal]rovide baseload heat for buildings with electric heat
[normal] 
[normal]pumps and use gas boilers as seasonal top up, than to remove gas altogether. This is because air source heat
[normal] 
[normal]pumps performance fall as outside temperature reduces, at the time when demand is highest. Th
[normal]is has a significant impact on the need to supply proportionately more power and capacity on the electricity system to meet winter peaks. By balancing this with top up gas use
[normal],
[normal] 2050 carbon targets can be met more economically than by using electricity alon
[normal]e
[normal],
[normal] by avoiding the significant investment in generating and network capacity that would be needed otherwise. The annual heat demand curve for 2050 from our 2013 FES is illustrated below:

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is a comprehensive gas distribution network within the UK, a long life reliable asset that supplies heat economically to most domestic consumers. Replacing the gas network with a community heat network has
[normal] 
[normal]n
[normal]o
[normal]t made economic sense for most pl
[normal]aces in the UK. The exception to this are places with low cost sources of recovered heat that can supply heat to heat networks at a competitive rate. Our analysis of heat networks suggests that there is a role for industrial and commercial sectors where it
[normal] is possible to cluster businesses that could use the recovered heat from industrial processes and thermal power stations. For example, the heat pipe that takes recovered heat from Eon’s Isle of Grain power station to be used at National Grid’s Isle of Gra
[normal]in LNG terminal.
[normal] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]8.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The RHI currently only promotes ground source heat
[normal] 
[normal]pumps in commercial applications
[normal],
[normal] and is due to apply for residential properties from March 2014 so it is too early to tell whether it promotes heat pumps successfully. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In our assumptions, heat pumps are initially
[normal] 
[normal]concentrated in houses which are not connected to the
[normal] 
[normal]gas grid as the RHI value will be set to be most financially attractive for these customers due to the high price of non-gas fuels and the Green
[normal] 
[normal]Deal / Energy Companies Obligation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]By extending the sch
[normal]eme to include gas heat pumps as they come to the market, it would increase the appeal to ‘on gas grid’ customers and expand the potential reduction in carbon emissions without the need to build upstream infrastructure.
[normal] 
[normal]Deploying energy efficiency measures
[normal] including insulation will be a vital first step in helping to reduce heat used in homes and buildings. The Government’s Green Deal programme will provide support for individuals and businesses making energy efficiency improvements to their homes and build
[normal]ings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We welcome support for domestic low carbon technologies proposed under the RHI, however ask that policy makers ensure sufficient scope and flexibility – either now or when commercially available – in funding support for technologies which will be im
[normal]portant in utilising natural gas more efficiently, 
[normal]e.g.
[normal] dual fuel appliances and gas heat pumps. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Storage of energy needs to be considered from a full system perspective and its role in balancing and peak management could be important if the right technologies are developed our 2050 assume some heat st
[normal]orage.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Thermal storage is more likely to provide diurnal storage, similar to the gas network or a hot water tank today, as it tends to be at the point of use and this has some system benefits in managing the within day heat load.  However seasonal storage
[normal] of energy, not just heat, could create greater value as it would mitigate the seasonal impact of heat demand, and reduce the need for increased network and generator capacity to electrify heat, research into technologies that could provide this would be o
[normal]f value.
