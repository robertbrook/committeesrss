"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET (GSH0008)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIET members’ \n \ninvolvement, both e\nxternal\nly\n and internal\nly\n,\n \nwith some studies \ns\nuggests \nthat:\n(a)\n              \nthere is reluctance to \nconsider commissioning \nwork at the horizon because \nof \nthe \nperceived \nlack of detail especially on costs and timing\n;\n(b)\n              \nwhat \ncan be seen at the horizon is too easily ridiculed by cynics or the media\n,\n so studies \ntend to be\n \nlaunched somewhat later and are \nthus \non issues that have already \nappeared\n \nover the horizon\n;\n and\n(c)\n              \nsuccessful \nadoption and utilisation of\n a study \ndepends\n \non the extent to which the work was locked in to internal strategic thinking and option analysis and also the degree to which there was a political involvement either directly or \nvia\n Special Advisers.\nIn our experience, many\n Departments are less than enthu\nsiastic about publicising their \nHorizon Scanning \n/ Foresight studies.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe best examples have been \nwhen Departmental\n stakeholders appoint champions from the Civil Service to push forward the studies and \nhave \nan enthusiastic \nMinister\n \nwho \nendorse\ns\n it\n, for \nexample the\n Foresight \n“\nIntelligent Infrastructure\n \nFutures\n”\n study that reported in 2006 had this in terms of a Departmental lead \nfrom DfT \nand an interested Minister (Dr Stephen Ladyman\n).\n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe definitive response to this question needs to come from\n Departmen\nts\n’ setting out their policies and practices.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is very difficult to address this\n question \nfrom an external \nperspective\n; it is surely \nmore productive to ask\n \nDepartment\ns to specify the studies they have been involved in over the last 7–10 years\n,\n \nand to\n report on what actions were taken as a consequence. An alternative\n way to get a good answer \nwould be\n to poll 100 experts wh\no have been involved in studies to ask if they can see any changes 18\n \nm\nonths\n or so after they completed their work.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPeople who have been involved in Foresight reviews have noted the additional vigour regarding follow-up and regular \npost hoc \nmonitoring when a Minister has been involved as \nPrincipal \nClient.  There has been very uneven practice regarding publicity and the \nopportunity for open debate on studies and their findings\n.  Indeed\n,\n the allegation that\n for many \nstudies the\n \na\nnalytic\n \ncommunity has enjoyed the chase rather than the capture is probably correct.\n  \nThe Committee might find it useful to review the\n short-term \nand long-term reviews of many of the Foresight projects to determine\n the\n impact of the work\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are a number of perceived shortcomings with the current position and it is not clear that the Day Review has recognised them\n,\n let alone addressed them.  The recommendations of the review seem to concentrate almost exclusively on the commissioning and governance processes.  \nGovernance\n is at best \nof \nacademic \ninterest \nand the problem with \ncommissioning\n is the apparent reluctance to\n act at a very early stage.  To be effective\n,\n horizon scanning\n genuinely has to operate at the horizon and look forward; not wait until issues are \nvisible and \nbeginning to smoulder.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBut perhaps the weakest elements of the review are implementation and fol\nlow-up\n.  The interpretation of senior customers as Permanent Secretaries \net al\n is too narrow and\n \nthere is no \nmention of the need to\n link horizon scanning to the work of the Technology Strategy Board\n.  There is also a\n gap regarding the non-public sector\n –\n  \nt\nhe delivery of policy for many Departments (Health, \nDefence\n, \nTransport for example) rests heavily on public and private industry and it would seem sensible to expand the \nmembership of both the CSAG and HSOG to reflect this.\n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 2010 Science and \nEngineering Assurance Review (SEA) of how the DfT used science and engineering evidence in its policy making showed that there were some significant dysfunctional disconnects in this process that would inhibit horizon scanning and subsequent strategic poli\ncy making.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is very difficult to address this\n question \nfrom an external \nperspective\n; it is surely more productive to ask \nDepartment\ns \nor the Cabinet \nOffice?\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSee also response to Q1.  Government has frequently been t\noo slow and too privat\ne\n,\n not least because Chief Scientific Advisers are only loosely tied in to top level strategy and planning i\nn many Departments. There is a general flaw \nwithin\n Departments\n of\n having too few external advisory bodies\n.  These tend to be \nrelatively\n informal bodies operating at about Deputy Director level\n,\n discuss\ning\n technology movements, \nindustry \ntrends and\n \nscientific developments and thus acting as the very early \ndetectors of issues where a more structured approach would be justified.  There are particular\n problems in Transport where the fact that delivery rests with Local Authorities and Industry has been s\neen as a reason to justify too much inactivity regarding tactical technology thinking.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
