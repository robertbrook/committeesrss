"8\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted\n by Steven J. Rosen\n Director, The Washington project of the Middle East Forum \n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;\nOver 63 years,\n&#xa0;\nUNRWA has become an agency that perpetuates the refugee problem rather than \ncontributing to its resolution.\nUNRWA does not work to settle refugees; instead, by registering each day ever more grandchildren and great-grandchildren who have never been displaced from their homes or employment, artificially adding them to the tally of\n “refugees,” it adds to number of refugees nursing grievances. By now, these descendants comprise over 90 percent of UNRWA refugees.\nFurther, UNRWA violates the Refugee Convention by insisting that nearly two million people who have been given citizenship\n in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon (and who constitute 40% of UNRWA’s beneficiaries) are still refugees.\nAs a result of such practices, instead of going down through resettlement and natural attrition, the number of UNRWA refugees has steadily grown since 1949\n, from 750,000 to almost 5 million. At this rate, UNRWA refugees will exceed 8 million by 2030 and 20 million by 2060, its camps and schools endlessly promoting the futile dream that these millions of descendants someday will “return” to their ancestors’ h\nomes in Israel. When even Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas acknowledges that sending five million Palestinians would mean “the end of Israel,” it’s clear that UNRWA obstructs conflict resolution.\n&#xa0;\nCan the elements of UNRWA useful to Israel be \nretained without perpetuating the refugee status? Yes, but this requires distinguishing UNRWA’s role as a social service agency from its role producing ever-more refugees.\n&#xa0;\nSection III.A.2 and Section III.B of UNRWA’s Consolidated Eligibility &amp; Registration\n Instructions allow it to provide social services to Palestinians without defining them as refugees. \nUNRWA donors, starting with the United Kingdom, should stop being accomplices to UNRWA’s perpetuation of the refugee status.\nThe U.K.\n&#xa0;\nshould treat UNRWA\n as a vehicle to deliver social services, nothing more. It should insist that UNRWA beneficiaries who either were never displaced or who already have citizenship in other countries, although perhaps eligible for UNRWA services, are not refugees. Establishi\nng this distinction reduces a key irritant in Arab-Israeli relations.\nSubmission&#xa0;\n              \n(1) \nLed by the \nUnited States\n,\n t\nhe \nfounders of the United Nations Relief and Works Administration (UNRWA), the agency tasked with oversight of the \nPalestine\n refugees\n, conce\nived \nof it as a \ntemporary \ninstrument to help \nrelieve the plight of \nthe Arab refugees displa\nced by the struggle over \nIsrael\n’\ns creation in 1948.\n \nBut over the ensuing sixty\n-three years,\n UNRWA has evolved into an agency that perpetuates the refugee \nproblem as \na source of conflict\n rather than contributing to its resolution.\n \nIts refugee camps and educational programs keep alive the impossible dream that millions of descendants\n of the original refugees will “return” to today’\ns \nIsrael\n.\n \nIts social service delivery \nprograms create permanent dependency and impede local integration into the societies and countries where its beneficiaries have resided for decades.\n \nUnlike its sister agency, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)\n,\n which is responsible for\n millions of non-Palestinian refugees worldwide, it does not have an active program \nfor “local integration” of \nrefugees where they now reside nor \n“resettlement” \nin third countries.\n This special issue will explore the extent to which it has complied with it\ns original mandate and ways and means for its reform.\n(2) I\nt was not always the case that UNRWA \nstood in the way of local integration and \nres\nettlement. \nIn \nits \nearly years\n, \nparticularly from 1949 to 1960,\n \nUNRWA\n \nfollowed a \ndeclared policy of \n“reintegration”\n of Palestinian refugees into the normal life of the Middle East, a term understood to include resettling large numbers of \nthem \noutside \nIsrael\n(3) UNRWA’s reintegration program was endorsed by U.N.\n General Assembly Resolut\nion 393 (V)\n, enacted\n on December 2,\n \n1950\n. It called for “\nthe reintegration of the refugees into the economic life of the \nNear East\n, either by repatriation or resettlement\n,” which “\nis essential in preparation for the time when international assistance is no\n longer available, and for the realization of conditions of \npeace and stability in the area.” The resolution also instructed UNRWA “\nto establish a reintegration fund\n ... \nfor the permanent re-establishment of refugees and their removal from relief\n.”\n(4) In\n November 1951,\n&#xa0;\nUNRWA’\ns second director\n, John Blandford, Jr., \nproposed a three\n-year, $200 million program to r\neintegrate 150,000–200,000 refugees into their Arab host countries.\n Blandford’s plan\n was endorsed by U\n.\nN\n.\n General Assembly\n \nReso\nlution\n&#xa0;\n513\n&#xa0;\nof Janu\nary 26, 1952, which tasked \nUNRWA \n“\nto explore with the governments\n \n...\n \ntheir assuming administration of reintegration project\ns at the earliest possible date.”\n Seven years later, t\nhe \nconcept was reaffirmed by U\n.\nN\n.\n secretary general Dag Hammarskjold, \nwho cal\nled for the “r\neintegration\n”\n of refugees \n“\ninto the economic life of the area.\n”\n&#xa0;\n \n(7) \nToday, neither UNRWA\n’s\n \n“Medium Term Strategy 2010-\n2015\n,”\n nor the official “Framework for Cooperation b\netween UNRWA and the Government of the United States,\n”\n mention reintegration\n at all, nor do \nc\nongressional appropriations of funds for UNRWA \nmake allocations for r\neintegration as they did in earlier years\n.\n(8) \nFormer UNRWA general\n \ncounsel\n James G. Lindsay \nremarked\n that \n“\nneither the donors nor the General\n Assem\nbly has pressed UNRWA on ‘reintegration’\n in quite some time.\n”\n Lance Bartholomeus\nz, \nformer head \nof the\n \nInternational\n Law Division of UNRWA, said, “\nThis part of the mandate probably e\nnded by 1960 when reference to ‘reintegration’\n was dropped from General As\nsembly resolutions relating to UNRWA, reflecting some acknowledgment that this objective had been defeated.\n”\n And \nPeter Hansen, former commissioner g\neneral of UNRWA, said in 2004, “\nThe \na\ngency\n’\ns mandate has repeatedly been refined and shaped by other Genera\nl Assembly resolutions, which have allowed it to shift its focus from reintegration efforts in its early years to human development projects through to this very day.\n”\n(9) And so UNRWA abandoned its original mission of relief extension and conflict resolu\ntion, evolving into an agency for the perpetuation of unsettled claims against \nIsrael\n for millions of persons born in the years attending the founding of \nIsrael\n in 1948.\n(10) \nAt its inception \non May 1, \n1950, UNRWA served \napproximately 750,000 persons whom it considered \nPalestine\n refugees. \nDue to natural attrition, many of those original refugees are no longer alive today\n \nand shou\nld have been removed from UNRWA’\ns registra\ntion rolls. Yet the number of “refugees”\n now registered with UNRWA has grown expone\nntially instead of \ndeclining, with \nalmost 5,000,000 persons registered \nas \nPalestinian refugees\n—\nseven times as many as \nthose \nregistered \nsixty-two years ago\n.\n(11) \nThis \nhas been made \npossible \nthrough the addition of \ndescendants of refugees \n(\nalong the male line) to \nUNRWA’s \nrefugee rolls, regardless of how much time has passed.\n \nToday, the \nvast \nmajority of tho\nse classified by UNRWA as Palestinian refugees\n are in fact descendants of refugees, not persons who were ever ref\nugees themselves.\n \nThese are grandchildren and great-grandchildren born in \nJordan\n, the West \nBank, \nGaza\n, \nLebanon\n, and \nSyria\n—\nnot in pre-194\n8 \nPalestine\n.\n(12) According to a projection published by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees extrapolating f\nrom UNRWA’s past growth rates, by 2030 UNRWA’s refugee list will expand another 70 percent to 8.5 million.\n In fact, at the same growth rate, by 2060 there will be \nfour times\n as many Palestinian refugees as there are today and\n twenty five times \nthe number \nregistered by UNRWA in 1950—though none of the original Palestinian refugees are likely to be alive by then.\n&#xa0;\n              \nProjected growth of UNRWA Refugee Rolls1950\n              \n 750,000\n2010\n              \n4,880,377\n2020\n              \n6,432,567\n2030\n              \n8,478,434\n \n2040\n              \n11,174,981\n \n2050\n              \n14,729,159\n \n2060\n              \n19,413,735 \n&#xa0;\n(13) This represents a drastic break with UNRWA’s early practice. In 1950, its first d\nirector told the \nGeneral Assembly that the “a\ngency has decided that a refugee is a needy person, who, as a result of the war in Palestine, has lost his home \nand his means of livelihood.\n”\n His definition made no reference to descendants.\n(14) \nNot until \n1965, fifteen years after its \ncreation, did a\nn UNRWA commissioner g\neneral decide, against objections from the \nUnite\nd States\n government, to create “\nan extension o\nf eligibility, subject to need, to the third generation of refugees (that is, to children of persons who were themselves born after 14 May 1948).\n”\n \nAnd even then, he extended eligibility only to the third generation, the grandchildren.\n According to Benjami\nn Schiff, Commissioner General Laurence \nMichelmore\n’s motive was driven by a short term budget imperative to “\nenlist the host-states\n’\n assistance in cut\n&#xad;\nting the rolls\n ...\n he had offered a trade: If the governments would help rectify the rolls, he would be w\nilling to\n ... \nadd third-generation refugees to the rolls.\n”\n(15) I\nn 1982, \nthirty-two years after its creation, UNRWA \ntook another step\n forward by \nextend\ning \neligibility to\n all \ngenerations of descendants. \nIt did so by obtaining a General Assembly Resolution\n \ninstructing UNRWA “\nto issue identification cards to all Palestine \nrefugees and their descendants”\n \nwithout any limitation on how many generations of descendancy\n this practice would continue. \nThis momentous decision was adopted without a \nspecific debate or \nseparate \nvote in the General Assembly.\n(16) \nU\nNRWA went still further in 1992\n by adding a provision that those\n d\nescendants\n \nof Palestine refugee males who “\nare eligible\n to register for UNRWA services”\n and are registered with UNRWA, should be \n“referred to as Registered Refugees or as Registered Palestine Refugees” \n[AU: emphasis added\n?\n ??\n] though they do not meet UNRWA’\ns own standard of having lived in Palestine prior to May 1948.\n They are not persons “\nwhose normal place of residence was \nPalest\nine\n between June 1946 and May 1948, [and] who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of \nthe 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict.” \nIn fact, fewer than 10\n percent of today’s UNRWA-classified refugees were born before 1948\n.\n(17) \nUnder \nU.S.\n law, \na \nP\nalestinian who sought admission to the \nUnited States\n as \na \nrefugee on the grounds that \nhis/her \ngrandfather was a refugee\n \nwould be ineligible for\n refugee status. The law \nspecifically declares that a grandchild is \nineligible\n \nfor derivative refugee status.\n Th\ne standard form used by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security\n-\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\n states that “\nA petition \nmay not be approved\n \n[AU: emphasis added?\n Yes, added by me\n] \nfor the following persons:\n ... (6) \nA parent, sister, brother, grandpare\nnt, grandchild, nephew, niece, uncle, aunt, cousin, or in-law.\n”\n \n \nOther developed countries employ similar definitions.\n(18) Clearly, UNRWA’s\n \ndefinition of \ndescendants of refugees as refugees is artificial and misleading\n \nand undermines any possibility of r\nesolving the refugee \nproblem \nin future \npeace negotiations. \nIt manufactures fictional refugees w\nho vastly outnumber the actual \nrem\naining 1948 and 1967 refugees. The real refugees \nare today only a small fracti\non of the five million nominal refugees registered with UNRWA. \nAnd five million is such a huge number that even Palestinian \nAuthority \npresident Mahmoud Abbas has acknowledged that asking \nIsrael\n to repatriate \nthis number “\nwould mean the end of \nIsrael\n.\n”\n \n(19) \nThe United \nKingdom\n is a signatory to and a strong supporter of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees\n, as are 143 other nations\n.\n  \nThat convention \nstates\n that a person s\nhall no longer be considered\n a refugee\n if \n“\n(3) He has acquired a new nationality\n \nand enjoys the protection of the country of his new nationality.\n”\n \nThe United Nations High Commission on Refugees\n (UNHCR)\n, charged with implement\ning \nthe refugee convention for all refugees in the world o\nther than \nthose \nPalestinians covered by UNRWA, is guided by this principle\n as is the European Union, which \nprovides that \na “\nthird country national or a stateless person shall cease to be a refugee, if he or she:\n \n...\n \n(c) \nhas\n acquired a new nationality, and\n enjoys the protection of the country of his or her new nationality\n.”\n When UNHCR refugees get citizenship in another country, they are taken off its list. But when UNRWA “refugees” get new citizenships, they are still considered refugees.\n(20) Most \nrecipi\nents of UNRWA services in \nJordan\n have been given citizenship in that country\n,\n \nbut UNR\nWA continues to define them as r\nefugees\n. O\nf the \ntwo\n million\n Palestinian refugees \nregistered in \nJordan\n, all but 167,000 have citizenship\n under \nJordanian \nlaw, which grants\n citizenship to “[a]\nny person who, not being Jewish, possessed Palestinian nationality before 15 May 1948 and was a regular resident in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan between 20 Dece\nmber 1949 and 16 February 1954.” In addition, the law states: “\nThe childr\nen of a Jordanian man shall be Jordanian wherever they are born.\n”\n Yet a great grandchild of a Jordanian \ncitizen\n who was a Palestinian refugee, born tomorrow morning in \nAmman\n, is entitled to UNRWA refugee status for life.\n(21) Another peculiar practice of UNRWA is to c\nlassif\ny\n its beneficiaries \nliving in the West Bank and Gaza as \nrefugees\n although the\n Palestinian Authority \n(PA) classifies them as \ncitizens \nliving in their “homeland” according to\n the Palestinian Basic Law\n of 2\n003: “\nNo Palestinian may be deported from the homeland, prevented or prohibited from returning to or leaving it, deprived of his citizenship, or han\nded over to any foreign entity … \nPalestinian citizenship shall be regulated \nby law\n.”\n The PA also issues pas\nsports to its citizens, i\nn accordance with the \nIsrael-PLO Declaration of Principles of September 13, 1993.\n(22) \nAlmost\n the entire international community \nview UNRWA beneficiaries in the West Bank and \nGaza\n as futu\nre citizens of the prospective Palestinian \nstate, who already live in their homeland\n.\n U.S. \nPresident \nBill \nClinton told \na \nPalestinian negotiating team \nat in December 2000,\nThe solution \n[to the refugee problem] \nwill have to be consistent with\n \n..\n. \nthe state of Palestine as the homeland of the \nPalestinian people and the state of Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people\n \n...\n \nThe Palestinian state would be the focal point for Palestinians who choose to ret\nurn to the area ...W\ne need to adopt a formulation on the right of return that will make cle\nar that there is no specific right of return to Israel itself\n … R\neturn to the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and areas acquired in the land swap would be the right of all Palestinian refugees\n.\n \n \n \n(24) \nFor his part, \nPresident Obama \nargued \nin June 2011\n that a “\nlast\ning peace will involve two states for two peoples: \nIsrael\n as a Jewish state and the homeland for the Jewish people, and the state of \nPalestine\n as the homeland for the Palestinian people.\n”\n \nIn January\n \n2008, while a presi\ndential hopeful, Obama said, “\nThe right of return [to \nIsrael\n] is something that is not an option in a literal sense.\n”\n(25) \nEven P\nA \npresident Abbas told his negotiations sup\nport unit: “\nOn numbers of refugees, it is illogical to ask \nIsrael\n to take five million, or indeed one million. Th\nat would mean the end of \nIsrael\n. … \nAll refugees can get Palestinian citizenship \n[\nall five million\n]\n, if they want to \n[\nfor example, Palestinian refugees in \nJordan\n may not \nwish so\n,\n while for refugees in \nLebanon\n there is a need.]”\n \nSaeb Er\ne\nkat,\n the chief Pales\ntinian negotiator, told Mitchell that the “\nPalestinian\ns\n will need to know that 5 million refugees wil\nl not go back” to \nIsrael\n.\n Abbas gave the \nU.S.\n mediators a paper proposing only a “\nsym\nbolic number of refugees return” to \nIsrael\n.\n(26) Palestinians in the\n West Bank and \nGaza\n are already residing in their own self-proclaimed homeland, building by their own account the instruments of their future state. Yet \nUNRWA colludes in the practice of defining them artificially as refugees, encouraging unending claims a\ngainst \nIsrael\n that perpetuate conflict.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n U.N.
