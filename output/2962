defaultWritten evidence from  the Open Data User Group (ODUG) [OD14]default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Open Data User Group (ODUG) is an independent advisory body appointed by the Chair of the Group and the 
defaultMinister for the Cabinet Office
default. It receives administrative support from staff in the Cabinet Of
defaultfice, but speaks independently
default on behalf of the data community
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is a collective response from ODUG to the Public Administration Select Committee request for evidence on statistics and open data
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIndividual members of ODUG, or their employing organizations, may make separate responses.
defaultOur main observations are
default:
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe release of Public Sector Information, which is not restricted on grounds of privacy or security, as Open Data, is the most effective way 
defaultof maximising its utility and allowing the nation to 
defaultachieve
default 
defaultmaximum
default benefit from
default the 
defaulttaxpayer 
defaultfunds used to collect the data originally
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition to re-use, which may generate additional economic activity, Open Data contributes to transparency enabling the public to hold the public sector to account
default for the effective delivery of public services. W
defaulthere 
defaultsuch data
default relates to the quality of public services 
defaultit 
defaultcan often allow the public to exercise informed choice.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMaking information available as Open Data often leads to improvements in quality as errors 
defaultwill
default 
defaultbe noticed and reported by more individuals and organisations
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment policy relating to which data should be open, which should be closed
default,
default which should be traded 
defaultand at what prices 
defaulthas been incoherent and has often appeared to be arbitrary
default and lacking in detailed accountability
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDespite the agreed policy of a ‘presumption to publish’ t
defaulthe release of public sector 
defaultinformation as Open D
defaultata has often been in
defaultconsistently
default planned 
defaultand is poorly
default regulated. There needs to be clear accountability where public officials 
defaultare
default answerable to a single body or individual who will 
defaultensure
default 
defaultthat they are fulfilling their obligations to release 
defaultOpen Data
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll future systems to collect public sector data for the fulfilment of public services delivery should be 
defaultrequired, from their inception, to build in an 
defaultOpen Data 
defaultdelivery mechanism
default which is publicly accountable and takes data security and privacy issues into consideration
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultPASC’s questionsdefault&#xa0;
default1. Why is open data important?default&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInformation has become the key economic resource of the 21
defaultst
default century. The economic 
defaultefficiency and the 
defaultcompetitiveness of nations will depend on the choices that are made over how data is collected and shared to maximise the opportunities of deriving information from it.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPrivate companies have a clear obligation to use data, in the same way as any other resource, to maximise the return to shareholders.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSome private companies achieve this by 
defaultapparently 
defaultmaking the data they collect, create or collate openly available. This is usually not the case as
default, often, users are only permitted
default to view the data,
default not to capture and reuse it. 
defaultMaking the data ‘open’ to view only is a mechanism 
defaultto attract users to view advertising material that is placed
default alongside it, and data reuse is limited
default to prevent the collation of information
default by others.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultG
defaultenuinely Open Data from the private and 
defaultvoluntary 
defaultsectors is rare. Wikipedia and OpenstreetMap.org are notable exceptions
default; 
defaultboth 
defaultare 
defaultnot-for-profit organisations that allow the relatively free re-use of their data.
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the age of broadband and superfast broadband the internet has become a ubiquitous 
defaultchannel of communication
default. 
defaultOnce initial data hosting costs are covered 
defaultthe marginal cost of sharing data 
defaultis 
defaultclose to zero
default and
default allows the release of Open Data as a public good at a substantially lower cost than previous mechanisms for disseminating data which carried significant costs. It is this technological change that has created the Open Data opportunity.
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAround the world many governments are coming to the conclusion that maximising the amount of Open Data available to citizens and businesses is the way to maximise the economic benefit that countries as a whole can derive from that data. This is particularly the case for Public Sector Information (PSI) which has already had to be collected in order to allow government departments or agencies to fulfil their Public Task
defaults
default. European regulations on the re-use of PSI strongly encourage the release of as much of it as possible as Open Data (subject to privacy or security constraints) in order to maximise its re-use and the economic activity related to its re-use.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment has had 
defaultperiodic 
defaultmajor strategic reviews of the release and charging mechanisms for 
defaultpublic sector information, in particular 
defaultstatistical information
default and core reference data
default.
default Perhaps the most significant ones have been
default:
default&#xa0;default2.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultRayner Review of 1979default, which led indirectly to a Tradable Information policy being introduced by the Treasury which lives on in guidelines for charging for government information.
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTh
defaulte
default 
defaultRayner R
defaulteview created a situation where vital statistical information, and in particular Census Information was no longer freely available even to Government Departments, but had to be purchased through “Census Agencies”, private sector brokers who paid a licence 
defaultfee for the exclusive right to re-sell government statistical information.
default 
defaultThis led to some government departments claiming that they were no longer able to afford to pay for the information necessary to carry out aspects of their Public Tasks
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.4.
default&#xa0; 
default“Crown Copyright in the Information Agedefault”default publisheddefault in 1998default.default Rather than taking a strateg
defaultic view of what data should be o
defaultpen and how it should be funded, this review divided agencies into those that were successfully recovering a significant proportion of their costs by trading in information, such as Ordnance Survey
default (OS)
default, and should continue to do so, and those not recovering significant costs which were liberated to release their data without charge, such as 
defaultthe Office for National Statistics
default (ONS)
default.
default 
defaultThe impact of this 
defaultseemingly 
defaultpragmatic decision was to create a difficult divide between the trading agencies and the Open Data agencies.
default&#xa0;
default2.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAddressing and geospatial data is of particular value 
defaultto 
defaultall aspects of our 
defaultsociety
default. Its pseudo-c
defaultommercialisation as tradable data underpins much of the complexity found in the public sector information landscape where many publ
defaultic sector bodies re-purchase 
defaultdata 
defaultfrom one-another in
default 
defaultan overly complex, inefficient system which re-cycles
default public money 
defaultbetween publicly owned entities.
default&#xa0;
default2.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultFurther complexities in licensing and re-use of public sector information arise from this system particularly where so-called ‘derived-data’ restrictions are put in place by the data holders. For example Ordnance Survey place restrictions on both public sector and private sector organisations re-using 
defaulttheir own data,
default once it has been combined in some way with OS data.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs an
default example,
default in
default 
defaultpreparing for the 2001 Census
default the ONS found itself unable to afford all the geographical data from the OS which would have been helpful in conducting the Census.
default  
defaultFollowing the publication of 2001 census results in 2003,
default 
defaultONS found that it was unable to release 
defaultthe census 
defaultoutput area boundaries
default (OAs)
default as 
defaultunrestricted 
defaultOpen Data, because of Ordnance Survey’s com
defaultmercial interests in that data.
default&#xa0;
default2.8.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA consultation on default‘defaultPolicy options for geographic information from Ordnance Surveydefault’default in 2009default led to the 
defaultdecision 
defaultto 
defaultrelease some 
defaultOrdnance Survey (OS) 
defaultdata as 
defaultOpen Data
default, and the Public Sector Mapping Agreement (PSMA) which makes OS data available for free to the public sector
default. This
default was a significant change of policy, though it did not appear to be part of an overall strategy
default and excluded the Royal Mail Postcode Address File (PAF)
default. OS negotiated with a nominated “intelligent customer” as to which products should be released as Open Data. These included administrative and statistical boundaries in BoundaryLine and Postcode locations (though not the locations, or the text, of individual addresses). 
defaultThis was a significant step forward
default for the Open Data agenda
default, but 
defaultdid not deliver a
default coherent Open Data strategy.
default&#xa0;
default2.9.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultCabinet Office Open Datadefault White paper and the subsequent defaultShakespeare Reviewdefault both make cogent and compelling cases for Open Data. However neither can be regarded as a strategy and, while they have led to the release of over 10,000 government data sets, these have not been released or prioritised according to any discernible strategic framework. Nor is there any regulatory mechanism to ensure 
defaultongoing 
defaultpublication, release or change update strategies for 
defaultthe 
defaultdata sets that have been released.
default&#xa0;
default2.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn order for the country to gain the maximum utility and economic advantage from Open Data a more strategic response is needed. There needs to be a single, permanent, locus in government for the regulation of Open Data release and for the dissemination of a coherent strategy which will outline: 
default(i) 
defaultwhat should be released; 
default(ii) 
defaulthow it should be released; 
default(iii) 
defaulthow frequently dynamic data sets 
defaultshould 
defaultbe updated or whether, by simply exposing dynamic data sets, users 
defaultshould
default 
defaulttrack change
defaults
default themselves; 
default(iv) 
defaultwhat metadata standards should be used 
default(data.gov.uk delivers a quasi standard and the recent National Information Infrastructure guidelines for departments are an additional step) 
defaultand
default; (v) 
default what skills and funding are required to ensure that the Open Data strategy is sustainable.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the short term the Cabinet Office has taken on this role enthusiastically
default and is achieving some good results
default. 
defaultHowever the 
defaultoverall 
defaultremit is spread across many public sector bodies including the
default Office for Public Sector Information
default, the 
defaultInformation Commissioner’s Office
default,
default The Department for Business 
defaultInnovation
default and Skills (BIS)
default, 
defaultd
defaultata holders within individual departments
default and their agencies
default, Local 
defaultAuthorities
default and other public 
defaults
defaultector 
defaultd
defaultata holder
defaults
default. These bodies do not work effectively together which we suggest is as a result of 
default(a) the historic complexity of the legislative and executive landscape; and (b) 
defaulta lack of overall strategy
default and priorities for Open Data
default and 
defaultO
defaultpen 
defaultD
defaultata standards
default.
default&#xa0;defaultright onesdefault?default&#xa0;default3.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe Government’s stated aims for the release of 
defaultO
defaultpen 
defaultD
defaultata and the stated key outcomes of the 
defaultO
defaultpen Data Strategy are entirely appropriate and laudable. We support them strongly.
default&#xa0;default3.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever we cannot be sure that there is a 
defaultcoherent 
defaultcommitment to the Open Data Strategy from all government departments. 
defaultThe government
default appears to be resolutely focussed on relatively small revenue streams arising from some of the Trading Funds and a short term focus on raising one-off revenues through the privatisation of public assets, which include fundamental datasets. As a result 
defaultboth parts of BIS and the Shareholder Executive 
defaultare pushing forward short-term policy decisions which undermine the fundamentals of the
default Open Data Strategy.
default&#xa0;default3.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhile the release of individual data sets is valuable, some data is essential to make other data sets meaningful. This is sometimes referred to as “Core Reference Data”, items of data which will be used across many data sets 
defaultas identifiers to show what a record relates to
default. This data
default need
defaults
default to be 
defaultmaintained and disseminated from a single source. Examples are: addresses with postcodes
default and geo
default-
defaultcoordinates
default; geographical codes for statistical or administrative areas; company registration numbers; VAT numbers; codes or standardised names for health or 
defaulteducational establishments
default; NHS numbers; Social Security numbers
default, classifications for public administrations and their services
default.
default&#xa0;default3.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultSome p
defaultersonal identifiers are contentious and should not be released as Open Data except as part of a system that anonymises records and preserves and protects the privacy of individuals. Others are, or should be, matters of public record, these include Company Registration Numbers, VAT registrations
default.
default&#xa0;default3.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe decision by BIS to allow Royal Mail to take the Postcode Address File (PAF) into private ownership as a commercial data set, and for Ordnance Survey to participate in the creation of GeoPlace LLP as a trading Value Added Reseller of PAF which intends to commercially exploit geographically referenced addresses appears to fly in the face of any Government commitment to Open Data.
default&#xa0;default3.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Office for National Statistics has consistently explained how essential a single National Address Register is for a wide range of statistical purposes from taking a reliable Census, through Census alternatives to the sampling and geographical aggregation of many other surveys.
default&#xa0;default3.7
default&#xa0; 
defaultFor users of statistics it is very important to know what set of addresses ar
defaulte
default included in each statistical area so that other data can be matched reliably to data from ONS, or data can be submitted to ONS reliably. It is difficult to understand how this can be accomplished effectively if a National Address 
defaultR
defaultegister is not available as Open Data.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default4.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe availability of government datasets as part of the National Information Infrastructure, including a single underlying platform of Core Reference Data needs to be agreed, delivered and maintained.
default&#xa0;default4.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment analysts and statisticians should make the widest possible use of this data, to avoid the inefficiency associated with multiple dataset-capture and maintenance of essentially identical sets of public sector information.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe use of single data repositories will enable im
defaultproved like-for-like comparison and
default peer review in the generation of management information and statistics. Open 
defaultD
defaultata allows improved levels of analysis and innovation, and will also increase the quality of the underlying data (the more users of a given dataset the higher the number of issues which will be detected and can be rectified).
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBy enforcing the current presumption to publish a
defaultnd
default making sure all new data collection and IT contracts: (i) do not duplicate what is already collected by others; (ii) are designed with the release of Open Data as an upfront requirement. This should apply to all public bodies i.e. Central and Local Government.
default&#xa0;default5.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSustainable funding 
defaultis essential to ensure that public sector information is made available, and continues to be available as Open Data. This can be achieved by ensuring that the cost of exposing data on an open platform is included in the initial cost of any project requiring data (this is generally likely to be a marginal overhead on the basic data collection cost
defaults).
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhere data is generated as a result of statutory registration, such as: Land Registration, registering to vote, being registered to pay Council Tax or Business Rates, registering a planning application or building regulations consent etc. the cost of registration should include an element used to make the data collected openly available.
default&#xa0;
default5.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA principle of charging those who cause 
defaultO
defaultpen 
defaultD
defaultata to change, rather than those who seek to use it, should be adopted as government policy.
default 
defaultCitizens 
defaultalready pay to register births, deaths, marriages, cars, companies, land, planning applications, building permits and many other transactions. Each of these cause official data to change. A fee charged to a person registering, or causing, a change in an official record, should include an element that pays for that data to b
defaulte included and disseminated as Open D
defaultata. This is a much
default more efficient way of funding Open D
defaultata than closing the data and charging for 
defaultits 
defaultuse
default. It requires fewer tra
defaultnsactions, the sum
defaults
default involved 
defaultare a s
defaultmall percentage of 
defaultthe fees being paid 
defaultand collected
default anyway and the amount
default collected is directly proportional to the update effort so there is no need to speculate how many times data will be used to set a price. This is a fair, efficien
defaultt and effective way of funding Open D
defaultata generated as part of a public task.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default6.1
default&#xa0; 
default(a) The default requirement for CSV format is adequate in the first instance. Moves to deliver Linked Data formats are welcome, but not essential. The provision of APIs is useful in some use cases, but it does not constitute a proper Open Data solution to deliver a service (ie: pre-analysed or aggregated results) without allowing for the bulk download of the underlying data.
default&#xa0;default6.2
default&#xa0; 
default(a) 
defaultWhile releasing data in a useful format is helpful and desirable, the minimum requirement should be that data is first released in the format used to deliver the public task for which it was collected. This minimises delay and cost in data release and it is likely that the Open Data community, or value adding re-processors will quickly adapt the data into more usable formats
default. This is the “Raw data now!” principle proposed by Sir Tim Berners Lee, which states that the release of data should be the prime requirement, while improving it to make it more usable is secondary.
default&#xa0;default6.3
default&#xa0; 
default(a) Where possible data should make use of existing standards and reference common vocabularies to enable the comparison and combination of data, therefore enhancing its reuse. 
defaultOpen Data should comply with the Open Data Certificate 
defaulthttps://certificates.theodi.org/
default.
default&#xa0;default6.4
default&#xa0; 
default(b) 
defaultAt a minimum m
defaultetadata concerning the available data formats, size of dataset, provenance (data owner),
default 
defaultlatest update (date), frequency of release, data holder (contact details) 
defaultand reference to any common vocabularies 
defaultshould be provided. 
default&#xa0;default6.5
default&#xa0; 
default(b) 
defaultA number of more complete metadata standa
defaultrds such as Dubli
defaultn Core and UK Gemini exist and are useful. However the requirement to provide complete metadata to these standards is often a barrier to Open Data release. It is for this reason that we suggest that a very simple metadata record should be treated as essential, while full standard metadata records are regarded as nice to have and can be added after data release.
default&#xa0;default6.6
default&#xa0; 
default(c) Society
default will use the data. It should be freely 
defaultusable by anyone; public sector
default, 
defaultvoluntary and not-for-profit sectors, 
defaultprivate sector, researchers
default and 
defaultindividual citizens.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default7.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultdata.gov.uk has been successful in providing a 
defaultfocal point for Open Data and a 
defaultmechanism for the release of datasets which are not currently traded.
default It has been successful in starting to change attitudes and behaviours in the public sector about the rationale for and opportunities to release public sector information as Open Data.
default 
defaultHowever, the main focus is on meeting central government departments’ information publishing needs. data.gov.uk needs to consider the data publishing requirements of the wider public sector, including local government and other public bodies. 
defaultIt is too early to say how widely this data is used, but the provision of a simple mechanism and a single location for data release 
defaultand to locate available datasets is essential.
default 
default&#xa0;default7.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever th
defaulte availability of
default 
defaultthis Open Data 
defaulthas brought to the fore the issue of Tradable Public 
defaultSector 
defaultInformation which is not only unavail
defaultable as Open Data, but 
defaultif 
defaultcom
defaultbined with
default, or used in the process of generating, other data sets prevents their 
defaultonward 
defaultrelease in a useful form
default, thereby breaking the 
defaultOpen Data 
defaultmodel.
default 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default8.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBy definition “Core 
defaultR
defaulteference Data” sets are the most important, these are data sets that provide the identifiers needed to generate 
defaultand combine 
defaultother data sets 
defaultto release value. Core Reference Data 
defaultgenerally identify places, institutions and individuals. Unfortunately the term 
defaultCore Reference Data 
defaultis sometimes used loosely to describe the data sets that individual departments believe are most important 
defaultto their operation, 
defaultrather than 
defaultthe 
defaultdata sets that contain
default true
default “reference” 
defaultor connectivity 
defaultdata.
default&#xa0;default8.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe single most frequently cited example of a core reference data set is a National Address Register. 
defaultPast d
defaultecisions concerning the Postcode Address File and the publicly owned GeoPlace LLP company owned by Ordnance Survey and the Local Government Association have undermined, for the time being, the prospect of an Open National 
defaultA
defaultddress 
defaultR
defaultegister that many are calling for
default as essential to society and to delivering economic value from other Open Data.
default&#xa0;default8.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAn excellent example of a data set which has been made open after more than a decade of resistance from Royal Mail and Ordnance Survey is the ONS Postcode Directory, an open dataset which gives the administrative and statistical area codes for every postcode current and past. This data set allows organi
defaults
defaultations to create statistical information which can be compared to statistics from ONS, increasing the value of both. Previously this was an expensive data set because of the requirements of the GridLink agreement between Ordnance Survey, Royal Mail and ONS
default which was
default a serious constraint
default.
default&#xa0;default8.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultImportant 
defaultareas where the release of Open Data has made 
defaultthe 
defaultmost progress an
defaultd delivered tangible results to-
defaultdate are in 
defaultCompanies House and Land Registry data
default, 
defaultand 
defaulteducation, health
default and 
defaulttransport
default datasets.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default9.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Cabinet Office has 
defaultrequired departments to set out 
defaultO
defaultpen 
defaultD
defaultata 
defaultS
defaulttrategies which are helpful to set out goals and milestones for the release of Open Data. Over 10,000 datasets are now available on data.go.uk. These are positive results. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultthe mechanisms available to hold
default departments and other public sector bodies to account
default are weak, hampered by a disparate legislative framework with responsibilities spread across multiple bodies and 
defaultthe pace of delivery is relatively slow
default. T
defaulthere has been little focus 
defaultover the years i
defaultn 
defaultsetting out an
default overall strategy
default for the Open Data agenda
default, as exemplified in the recent Shakespeare Review. Th
defaulte programme also lacks any substantial economic analysis to determine which
default datasets 
defaulthave the potential to
default deliver the 
defaultgreatest value to the economy. If a wider strategic approach 
defaulthad 
defaultbeen taken earlier in the programme there would be more robust evidence available to underpin the current debate that core reference data should be made more widely available as Open Data and should not be allowed to pass into private ownership.
default&#xa0;default9.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOfficials also struggle to engage with the wider community and businesses. Setting up the Open Data User Group (ODUG), as an independent voice
default for the 
defaultdata 
defaultcommunity
default, has 
defaultproven to be 
defaulta positive step in bridging the gap between Whitehall and the ‘real-world’. T
defaulthe data request mechanism ODUG has set up on data.gov.
defaultuk 
defaultis a 
defaultdemand led approach 
defaultwhich 
defaultallow
defaults
default the data community to evidence the main barriers
default to the use of public datasets, and to highlight the datasets which will deliver the greatest value if released as Open Data
default. This has enabled ODUG to produce business cases and evidence the need to prioritise certain datasets deemed 
defaultto be
default 
defaultof 
defaultmost value to the data community. 
defaultIt
default is essential that 
defaultdata.gov.uk 
defaultcontinues to 
defaultcollect and 
defaultcreate detailed evidence with the new presumption to publish agenda. 
default&#xa0;
default9.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAnother very positive step, 
defaultf
defaultollowing the Shakespeare Review, is the proposal for the National Information Infrastructure (NII) 
defaultrequiring Departments to create dataset inventories and to monitor the release of datasets from those inventories
default. However the initial basis for the
defaultse
default inventories is rather ad-hoc and it is 
defaultdifficult to judge what is missing from those directories and for what reason.
default Also, the inventories do not include public sector dataset
defaults
default collated and held by local authorities, many of which are of high importance and economic value – such as the National Street Gazetteer, nor do they identify datasets which span the requirements of multiple departments
default and public sector organisations
default, where significant efficiencies would be derived by cross-public sector organisation working.
default&#xa0;
default9.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is not helpful that agreement has not been reached on opening up some of the 
defaultimportant datasets
default (in particular addressing and geospatial data) which are fundamental as an underlying platform of Core Reference Data for the National Information Infrastructure. These datasets are essentially (re-)
defaultpurchased
default from the data holders
default exclusively for the Public Sector
default, including
default products made available under the Public Sector Mapping Agreement
default (PSMA)
default to a restricted set of 
defaultp
defaultublic 
defaultb
defaultodies, and the proposed Public Sector Licence for the Postcode Address File
default (PAF). In both these cases public funds are used to re-purchase data which was originally funded from the public purse for the delivery of a public task
default.
default 
defaultSuch agreements remove 
defaultthe 
defaultpressure to open the relevant data sets 
defaultmore widely for maximum economic benefit. They also leave
default many 
defaultpublicly funded and
default/or
default publicly regulated 
defaultbodies
default, such as h
defaultousing 
defaulta
defaultssociations, the utilities
default and
default charities unable to justify the 
defaultadditional 
defaultexpenditure necessary to use 
defaultessential public sector information which has already been paid for twice by the taxpayer, but whose access is restricted.
