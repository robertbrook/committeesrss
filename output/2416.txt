[[[ ]]]Introduction&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The proposed introduction of a residence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to those with a “strong connection” with the UK&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;    The proposed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisoners&#xa0;&#xa0;The proposal that providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceed&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1. That JR permission may be refused because a claim is academic, despite the fact that this decision has been made because the Defendant has changed its position and the claim is on the verge of settling.&#xa0;2. That it is extremely difficult, notwithstanding the merits of the claim, to get past the Permission stage.&#xa0;3. That with many claims substantial negotiation takes place between the issuing of a claim and the ultimate decision on Permission.  It is often as a result of negotiation that the claim settles in the Claimant's favour.  Further, often Judges will make an Order that further negotiation should take place.  The proposal has not engaged with whether this work will be paid for.  It clearly ought to be.&#xa0;4. That with urgent cases expedition is sought which involves seeking a "rolled up" hearing - where the substantive claim and the application for JR permission are considered at the same time.  No solicitor in the land, and no barrister either, would commit themselves to a full JR hearing such as this and risk not being paid for any of their work.  This would mean urgent cases (usually in cases I deal with these involve children whose welfare is at significant risk because a local authority has failed to provide them with crucial services) would not be taken on and children would be at significant risk of harm.&#xa0;5. That this is analogous to a Conditional Fee arrangement.  However, in such cases, if the claim fails solicitors and barristers are not paid. Whereas if the case succeeds solicitors and barristers receive a substantial uplift on their usual hourly rates, meaning that the risk is financially justified by the prospect of obtaining a very high hourly rate if the case is successful.  For this proposal to work in any way which would mean lawyers would take the risk of applying for permission and not getting paid for it (given the substantial work involved simply in drafting JR Grounds and lodging bundles etc) then lawyers must expect to get paid, by the Legal Aid Fund, their private hourly rates + an uplift of 100%, for their work applying for JR Permission.  As enhancements apply in any event to legal aid rates, such that lawyers factor in these enhancements in business planning, to cover the additional risk of this particular conditional fee the enhancements would not be sufficient.  It is likely that paying such uplifts (without which this proposal is utterly unworkable since lawyers will not be able to afford to take the risk of applying for JR permission) will cost the State more than simply trusting that lawyers at present diligently assess prospects, that the LAA considers prospects in addition to this in any event, and that therefore the system should remain as it is and funding should continue for applications for permission notwithstanding that, for whatever reason, they may fail.&#xa0;6. That some cases may not have significant merits, but the benefits are such that the claim should be fought.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The proposal that legal aid should be removed for all cases assessed as having “borderline” prospects of success.&#xa0;26 September 2013 Solicitors Journal, “Legal Aid Agency Refuses to fund Exceptional Cases”, 9th September 2013.
