[[[&#xa0;]]]Executive SummaryIn light of growing concerns relating to microbial resistance to antibiotics increasing attention is being given to the role that herbal medicines may play as autonomous anti-bacterial agents or as adjuvant treatments used to potentiate conventional drugs. This paper selectively reviews the evidence for herbal medicine as a valuable resource to combat bacterial resistance to antibiotics and suggests that further research is warranted.

[[[Main Findings]]]

[[[Possible Mechanisms]]]

[[[Strength of Evidence]]]An evidence-based systematic review of umckaloabo (Pelargonium sidoides) by the US Natural Standard Research Collaboration.Ulbricht C et al. (2010) Journal of Dietary Supplements ;7(3):283-302.This comprehensive systematic review concluded that there was strong scientific evidence (Grade A) - including 4 good quality RCTs involving 933 participants - to support the use of pelargonium for acute bronchitis and good scientific evidence (Grade B) for the its use in acute pharyngitis and the common cold. No serious toxic effects have been observed in any trial relating to pelargonium.Pelargonium has exhibited a marked antibacterial action against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria.

[[[High]]]Efficacy and safety of a combination herbal medicinal product containing nasturtium (Tropaeoli majoris herba)  and Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana)for the prophylactic treatment of patients with respiratory tract diseases: a randomised, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial.Fintelmann V et al. (2012). Current Medical Research Opinion; 28(11):1799-807.351 participants were randomly allocated to either active treatment (Group 1), a lower dose of active herbs + placebo (Group 2), or just placebo (Group 3). The maximum duration of treatment was 84 days.In the intention to treat (ITT) population excluding early infections (n = 344) the infection rates were 13.3% for Group 1, 18.4% for Group 2 and 25.6% for placebo Group 3. The statistical trend test showed significant results (p = 0.0171). The herbal combination appears to offer a prophylactic advantage which could help reduce antibiotic prescription.These herbs contain several isothiocyanates which have a marked in vitro broad spectrum anti-bacterial action.

[[[Moderate]]]A double blind randomised control trial where 107 participants were randomised to receive either licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra ) - trade name gutgard - or placebo for 60 daysPuram et al. (2013) Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine; Article ID 263805.The results showed that 56% (n=28) were H.pylori negative compared to 4% (n=2) in the placebo group.  In other work by the same team, the herb extract reduced symptoms of dyspepsia and there were no adverse events reported.Glycyrrhiza glabra showed antimicrobial activity in vitro and anti-adhesive properties against H-pylori.

[[[Moderate]]]A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a herbal medicinal product Angocin Anti-Infekt N containing nasturtium (Tropaeoli majoris herba) and horseradish (Armoraciae rusticana) for the prophylactic treatment of patients with chronically recurrent lower urinary tract infections (RUTIs).

[[[&#xa0;]]]Albrecht U et al. (2007).  Current Medical Research Opinion;23(10):2415-22.&#xa0;129 patients with RUTIs were randomised to active herbal or placebo treatment for 90 days. The primary outcome was the number of laboratory confirmed urinary tract infections. The per protocol mean number of recurrent UTIs in the study period was 0.43 versus 0.77 for the placebo group. This result is statistically significant (p = 0.035). A total of 36 patients in the test group and 37 patients in the placebo group reported adverse events. Two serious adverse events were reported in the placebo group and one serious adverse event in the treatment group (not associated with the study medication).This herbal product appears to be effective and safe as a prophylaxis for RUTIs.Mustard oils (including isothiocyanates) found in these two herbs have been shown to have a broad spectrum antibacterial action.

[[[Preliminary]]] (This trial needs to be repeated by independent researchers using an intention to treat analysis.)A randomised control trial of a complex Chinese herbal medicine (San Ling Jie Du Tang) in the treatment of women with recurrent lower urinary tract infections (RUTIs)Huang MJ. (2007). Hubei J. of Traditional Chinese Medicine;29:38-9.300 women were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to the Chinese herbal remedy or an antibiotic. Treatment was administered for 7 days with a 6 month follow up. 79.5% of the herbal group reported no infection in the follow up period compared with 49% in the antibiotic group. This was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).Several of the included herbs, such as tree peony bark (Paeonia suffroticosa), have been shown to have a broad spectrum antibacterial action.

[[[Preliminary]]] (Due to a lack of detail relating to the trial methodology.)A Cochrane systematic review of Chinese herbs for sore throat.Huang Y et al. (2012).  Cochrane Database Systematic Review. 14;3:CD004877.12 studies involving 1954 participants were included in this systematic review. 6/12 studies were shown to be more effective than the control with 3 herbal remedies appearing more effective than antibiotics. The remaining 6 studies showed equivalent effectiveness to the controls.Several of the included herbs such as Japanese Honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), have been shown to have a broad spectrum anti-bacterial action.

[[[Preliminary]]] (Due to the poor methodological quality of the included trials.)Comparative study of Nigella sativa and triple therapy in eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia.  88 adults with dyspeptic symptoms and positive H.pylori test were randomised to four groups: receiving i) triple therapy (TT) comprising of clarithromycin, amoxicillin, omeprazole [n= 23], ii) 1 g Nigella sativa + 40 mg omeprazole (OM) [n= 21], iii) 2 g NS + OM [n= 21] or iv) 3 g NS + OM [n= 23].  Main outcome was eradication of H.pylori.Salem et al. (2010). Saudi Journal of Gastroenterology. 16(3):207-14.H.pylori eradication was 82.6% in the antibiotic triple therapy group, 47.6 with 1g of Nigella sativa, 66.7% with 2g and 47.8% with 3g Nigella sativa. Eradication rates with 2 g Nigell sativa and antibiotics were statistically similar.  Nigella sativa seeds possess clinically useful anti-H.pylori activity, comparable to antibiotic triple therapy. Further clinical studies combining Nigella sativa with antibiotics are suggested by the authors.In vitro study showed that Nigella sativa inhibited growth in all strains of H.pylori within 60 minutes of exposure.
