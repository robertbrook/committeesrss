[normal]The biggest danger 
[normal]cyclistâ€™s
[normal] face is from poor drivers, particularly those who hate cyclists and drive in an aggressive manner.
[normal]If the rules in the Highway Code were enforced then cycling would be safer, feel safer and many more people would be inclined 
[normal]to try cycling.
[normal]The police, CPS, magistrates and Judges need to stop regarding cyclists as less worthy. 
[normal]Drivers who kill cyclists hardly ever get custodial sentences. Driving bans and fines are minimal.
[normal]The cyclist hating motorists know that should they in
[normal]jure or kill a cyclist they are likely to get a minimal punishment and this encourages them to persist in their behaviour.
[normal]I am asking for nothing more than enforcement of the law and appropriate punishment when the law is broken. I believe this is no more
[normal] than my right and the failure to provide justice is the greatest deterrent to cycling.
