defaultThe biggest danger 
defaultcyclistâ€™s
default face is from poor drivers, particularly those who hate cyclists and drive in an aggressive manner.
defaultIf the rules in the Highway Code were enforced then cycling would be safer, feel safer and many more people would be inclined 
defaultto try cycling.
defaultThe police, CPS, magistrates and Judges need to stop regarding cyclists as less worthy. 
defaultDrivers who kill cyclists hardly ever get custodial sentences. Driving bans and fines are minimal.
defaultThe cyclist hating motorists know that should they in
defaultjure or kill a cyclist they are likely to get a minimal punishment and this encourages them to persist in their behaviour.
defaultI am asking for nothing more than enforcement of the law and appropriate punishment when the law is broken. I believe this is no more
default than my right and the failure to provide justice is the greatest deterrent to cycling.
