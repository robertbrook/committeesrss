[normal]              
[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]We are grateful for 
[normal]the opportunity to contribute to the Committee’s inquiry 
[normal]              
[normal]into 
[normal]the Strategic Road Network
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]We welcome the publication of the 
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal] Command Paper
[normal] as it 
[normal]provides clarity on the way in which the national strategic road network, integral to London’s own growth and development plans, will be developed.

[normal]e 
[normal]the Mayor is responsible f
[normal]or the major 
[normal]roads in London
[normal] (amounting to five per cent of the network)
[normal],
[normal] through the Transport
[normal] for London Road Network (TLRN)
[normal], 
[normal]with more local roads being the responsibility of the London boroughs
[normal], this strategy matters to 
[normal]London
[normal] in the following ways:
[normal]motorway
[normal] network in the vicinity of London
[normal] will affect London's roads, which are already among the busiest and most congested in the country.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4    
[normal]  
[normal]Through the Mayor’s Roads Task Force
[normal] (RTF),
[normal] London has developed an
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]ambitious vision
[normal] 
[normal]and direction for all its roads
[normal],
[normal] with 
[normal]three
[normal] 
[normal]aims:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal].
[normal]              [bold]How will the polici[bold]es set out in the Govern[bold]ment’s ‘[bold]Action for Roads[bold]’[bold] [bold]C[bold]ommand [bold]P[bold]aper improve the strategic r[bold]oad network for all road users, [bold]w[bold]hilst[bold] [bold]also improving the environment? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1  
[normal]              
[normal]We welcome the D
[normal]epartment 
[normal]f
[normal]or 
[normal]T
[normal]ransport
[normal]’s 
[normal](
[normal]DfT’s
[normal]) 
[normal]vision for Britain’s road
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]and agree that a well-functioning road network and a well-protected 
[normal]              
[normal]environment are not mutually 
[normal]exclusive. The new structure and committed 
[normal]              
[normal]funding for the Highways Agency
[normal] (
[normal]HA) outlined in the report should enable 
[normal]              
[normal]better collaboration between the HA
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] other strategic agencies such as 
[normal]              
[normal]Transport for London
[normal], as the quality of the national road network impacts on 
[normal]              
[normal]the London network
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 
[normal]              
[normal]However, we recommend that the report should more strongly emphasise the varied uses of roads and the differing dema
[normal]nds
[normal] placed upon the roads by their 
[normal]users. 
[normal]For London, t
[normal]he 
[normal]RTF 
[normal]identified six functions of roads and streets – to enable movement, to provide space for ‘living’, to unlock development potential, to enable deliveries and other kerbside activity, to contribut
[normal]e to safety, and to contribute to an improved environment. 
[normal]Although ‘movement’ is key, many of these other functions 
[normal]would be relevant to the national strategic road network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Furthermore, the RTF recommended that both the ‘movement’ and the ‘place’ function of roads and streets should inform the way they are managed and developed. 
[normal]It 
[normal]proposed a framework, whic
[normal]h we have
[normal] adopted, consisting of nine street types representing those
[normal] with low to strategic importance for ‘movement’ and for ‘place’. The RTF
[normal] 
[normal]then set out priorities and minimum service standards for other users for each of the nine street types.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]A toolkit of appropriate interventions was then set out for each street 
[normal]type. 
[normal]For roads in London 
[normal]with strategic importance for 
[normal]‘
[normal]movement
[normal]’ and local ‘place’ importance
[normal] (
[normal]ie
[normal] the most relevant to the national strategic road network)
[normal], the RTF proposed the following approach to ‘movement’ and ‘place’:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Priorities[bold]Providing for othe[bold]r users[bold]Tools[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]De
[normal]spite a strong emphasis on improving ‘place’, the 
[normal]RTF recommended that 
[normal]the road network still needed 
[normal]to fulfil its movement function
[normal] - that 
[normal]the road network as a whole must continue to operate reliably and offer reasonable journeys times for essential user
[normal]s.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]To achieve this it
[normal] proposed that measures to mitigate 
[normal]against any 
[normal]increase in congestion – through either or both of demand management and the provision of alternative space – would be essential and should be investigated. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal]              
[normal]The resulting 
[normal]approach can be summarised, therefore, as to apply specific measures to each section of road to ensure it meets the needs of its users according to its street-type, and to also apply strategic measures to ensure the road network as a whole continues to ful
[normal]fil its movement role.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal]              
[normal]We 
[normal]consider 
[normal]that 
[normal]this approach is most likely to ensure the needs of all users (and the envir
[normal]onment) is likely to be met.  We are 
[normal]currently applying the street-type approach to the TLRN
[normal] 
[normal](as well as working with willing borough
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]to apply it to their roads) and exploring innovative ways in which to manage de
[normal]mand and to provide alternative
[normal]/replacement space for vehicles to mitigate congestion impacts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9
[normal]              
[normal]We
[normal] 
[normal]are happy to discuss the application of
[normal] 
[normal]the RT
[normal]F approach 
[normal]with 
[normal]the 
[normal]DfT
[normal] and HA 
[normal]further in relation to 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]development and implementation of their ambitious plans for 
[normal]England’s 
[normal]roads
[normal] to best meet the needs of all road users and improve the environment
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]How does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning fo[bold]r other[bold] [bold]     [bold]           [bold]transport[bold] modes?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]‘Action for Roads’
[normal] makes the point
[normal] 
[normal]that the Government is investing significantly in all forms of transport in England, especially in the rail network.
[normal] 
[normal]It 
[normal]says
[normal],
[normal] given the extent of 
[normal]population 
[normal]growth
[normal] and in the movement of freight
[normal], 
[normal]that 
[normal]not all journeys can be removed from the road network and 
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]nature of many journeys means that other modes cannot always offer an 
[normal]alternative 
[normal]to car travel on the strategic road network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]However, t
[normal]h
[normal]e extent
[normal] of the Government’s 
[normal]joined-up approach
[normal] is not described in detail within ‘Action for Roads’ but
[normal] is 
[normal]briefly 
[normal]outlined in the 
[normal]DfT’s
[normal] 
[normal]subsequent 
[normal]document ‘Transport – an engine for growth’, published August 2013
[normal]. We
[normal] welcome
[normal] this further document which 
[normal]calls fo
[normal]r ‘thinking of our transport network as a connected whole, not a series of separate systems’. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]This position is consistent with the
[normal] Mayor’s Transport Strategy
[normal] which sets out a balanced approach across modes to supporting economic growth and development, improving quality of life and achieving other goals in London. It is also consistent with 
[normal]the
[normal] view
[normal] of the RTF. 
[normal]This is not a question of competition between roa
[normal]d and public transport
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]4
[normal]    
[normal]We
[normal] 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]welcome
[normal] the Government’s inten
[normal]tion, described in ‘Transport an
[normal]           
[normal]engine for gr
[normal]owth’ to make clear
[normal] 
[normal]five 
[normal]year funding provisions for the Highways Agency, Transport for London, HS2, local highways maintenance, local major schemes (outside London) and integrated transport. 
[normal]This better aligns with the current rail investment planning and delivery process.
[normal] W
[normal]e bel
[normal]ieve that 
[normal]this more 
[normal]co-ordinated approach between road
[normal], 
[normal]rail
[normal] and London 
[normal]investment strategies 
[normal]is essential to meet the needs of all users
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]Investment both in the strategic road and rail 
[normal]networks,
[normal] and in London’s strategic transport networks must 
[normal]continue to
[normal] 
[normal]recognise London’s context of population and economic growth.  This will be 
[normal]critical in
[normal] 
[normal]delivering the full potential of London’s growth areas and the economic potential in all parts of the city
[normal]. T
[normal]he road networks alone, whether strategic or lo
[normal]cal, will not be able to fully accommodate
[normal] this
[normal] growth, which is projected to see London’s population grow to 10 million, and employment grow to 5.6 million people by 2031
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]n this respect we welcome the intention of a future Roads Investment Strategy
[normal] being part of a wider integrated approach to investm
[normal]ent in all modes of transport. 
[normal]W
[normal]e strongly encourage 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment to ensure that investment decisions on roads and rail occur in an aligned and timely manner that focuses on addressing key problems both on
[normal] the road and rail networks, whilst ensuring that this investment supports wider spatial, economic, social and environmental objectives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]W
[normal]e welcome the 
[normal]r
[normal]eference
[normal] in ‘Action for Roads’
[normal] to the
[normal] 
[normal]strategic road network’s linkages to local networks, and in 
[normal]London’s case 
[normal]this would apply 
[normal]pa
[normal]rticularly where HA
[normal] motorways interface with London’s own
[normal] 
[normal]road net
[normal]works which are critical points
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]We 
[normal]also 
[normal]welcome the acknowledgement that walking and cycling investments
[normal], 
[normal]which enable more sustainable ways of travel on the 
[normal]road n
[normal]etwork
[normal], also form part of the plans 
[normal]for the strategic road network
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8 
[normal]              
[normal]However, w
[normal]e 
[normal]consider that demand management will also be required to meet our strategic goals. The 
[normal]RTF
[normal] 
[normal]has hig
[normal]hlighted vario
[normal]us aspects for us
[normal] to explore, including re-timing and ‘
[normal]remoding
[normal]’ freight and servicing, smarter charging, smart work centres and practices, next generation travel demand management schemes, active network management, parking policy and land use planning. W
[normal]e would like to see greater recognition of these tools in the development of the strategic Roads Investment Strategy in so far as they apply to this network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]9
[normal]              
[normal]The commitment 
[normal]in ‘Action for Roads’ 
[normal]to greater funding certainty and flexibility for the str
[normal]ategic
[normal] 
[normal]road network through the establishment of a Roads Investment Strategy is to be welcomed.  However, such an investment strategy cannot operate in isolation from planning mechanisms and funding streams for other transport modes, in particular those fo
[normal]r 
[normal]the national rail network
[normal], and the Mayor’s transport networks in London.
[normal] 
[normal]In add
[normal]i
[normal]tion
[normal], the establishment of Road Investment Strategies must not be to the
[normal] 
[normal]detriment of either the scope of, or investment levels for, the 
[normal]n
[normal]ational Rail Investment Strategy or 
[normal]for the heavily
[normal]-
[normal]used transport networks within London.  Onl
[normal]y 
[normal]through the proper resourcing of all elements of our strategic 
[normal]transport 
[normal]networks can the demand for travel in and a
[normal]round London be met in the most 
[normal]economically, environmentally and financially s
[normal]ustainable way.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].
[normal]              [bold]How reliable is the Government’s forecast for growth in demand for the [bold]              [bold]strategic road network? How should the Government deal with [bold]              [bold]uncertainty in its forecast?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1    
[normal]Growth forecasts for demand on the strategic network are importa
[normal]nt for us as 
[normal]         
[normal]they
[normal] will impact on the level of traffic on London’s roads. 
[normal]The way in which the 
[normal]         Government deals with uncertainty is also important to us, as it will determine 
[normal]         
[normal]how
[normal] we interpret them alongside our own forecasts. 
[normal]In its 
[normal]reporting of the 
[normal]         
[normal]current
[normal] forecasts, the 
[normal]DfT
[normal] takes account of uncertainty in population 
[normal]         
[normal]forecasting
[normal], growth in GDP and the price of oil by setting out a range of future 
[normal]         
[normal]out-tur
[normal]ns
[normal] in terms of traffic growth. 
[normal]Government de
[normal]fines a central case although 
[normal]         
[normal]this
[normal] is not presented as 
[normal]the most likely scenario or the 
[normal]best scenario for 
[normal]         
[normal]planning
[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]DfT
[normal] says it will continue to review how it should represent 
[normal]         
[normal]uncertainty
[normal] in the forecasts.  
[normal]We 
[normal]support this 
[normal]approach.
[normal]              
[normal]4.2    
[normal]The 
[normal]DfT
[normal] (o
[normal]n page 1 of 
[normal]Road Transport Forecasts 2013)
[normal] makes clear
[normal] 
[normal]         
[normal]that
[normal] the Government forecasts for the growth in demand for the strategic road 
[normal]  
[normal]         
[normal]network
[normal] in England should not be viewed as what 
[normal]i
[normal]t think
[normal]s
[normal] will happen bu
[normal]t 
[normal]  
[normal]         
[normal]should
[normal] be treated as what may happen based on:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3    
[normal]There 
[normal]are
[normal] areas of further uncertainty. The 
[normal]DfT
[normal] acknowledges (o
[normal]n page 7, Box 
[normal]   
[normal]         
[normal]2 of its document 
[normal]Road Transport Forecasts 2013
[normal]) that its forecasts are 
[normal]  
[normal]         
[normal]designed
[normal] to project national traffic levels and not regional or local traffic levels.  
[normal]         
[normal]The 
[normal]DfT
[normal] also accepts that it needs to revisit its London forecast, particularly in 
[normal]         
[normal]relation
[normal] to several key factors which are not yet taken into account in producing 
[normal]         
[normal]the
[normal] traffic forecasts.
[normal] These are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4     
[normal]              
[normal]The above 
[normal]factors
[normal] would add considerable complexity to forecasting the 
[normal]   
[normal]          
[normal]              
[normal]growth
[normal] in demand for the strategic road network.  However
[normal], we
[normal] support the 
[normal]          
[normal]              
[normal]DfT’s
[normal] view that G
[normal]overnment forecasts should address these issues in order 
[normal]          
[normal]              
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]improve the 
[normal]forecasts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]We 
[normal]recognise the challenges of forecasting and, especially in the context of
[normal] 
[normal]substantial projected population growth in the UK and London, believe this is a challenge well worth addressing.  
[normal]We
[normal] welcome the recognition by 
[normal]DfT
[normal] of the need to 
[normal]strengthen some aspects of its road traffic forecasting, especially for regional and l
[normal]ocal areas 
[normal]and 
[normal]we are 
[normal]willing to work with the D
[normal]epartment 
[normal]to assist in this
[normal] task
[normal], especially on sharing our current analysis on the drivers of demand
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].
[normal] [bold] [bold]              [bold]How can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the [bold]              [bold]strategic road network? What impact will new technology have? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]Our work w
[normal]ith the RTF
[normal] concluded that a broad set of measures is required to achieve all the desired outcomes for London’s roads and streets
[normal] over the 
[normal]next 
[normal]twenty or so years
[normal], including 
[normal]the 
[normal]efficient and reliable movement on the strategic road network in London. These are

[normal]Substitute/relocated/enhanced capacity
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2 
[normal]              
[normal]All five of these will be required to improve 
[normal]reliability and efficiency of London’s strategic road network, as described in our response to Question 1
[normal], and could be considered for the 
[normal]national strategic road network
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]nvesting in new technology will enable us to significantly improve our capabil
[normal]ity to manage flows on London’s strategic roads more effectively. This will enable us to better respond to planned events and incidents as they occur, and to 
[normal]help
[normal] mitigate the impact on congestion of higher levels of cycling and ‘place’ improvements.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]vision
[normal] 
[normal]outlined in 
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal], of technology playing an
[normal] 
[normal]ever
[normal]-
[normal]increasing role in improving traffic management and safety on the UK’s
[normal] 
[normal]strategic road network,
[normal] 
[normal]is one we 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]share in relation to Lo
[normal]ndon’s strategic road network. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4 
[normal]              
[normal]We are currently extending 
[normal]SCOOT
[normal] 
[normal]to a further 1500 sites. SCOOT can increase the effective cap
[normal]acity of a junction by about 12 per cent
[normal]. We are also developing
[normal] an
[normal] ‘active network management’ capability which will 
[normal]enable us 
[normal]to manage the volume of flows acr
[normal]oss the network and could be used, for example, to 
[normal]protect 
[normal]critical parts of the strategic road network
[normal] 
[normal]from becoming 
[normal]overly 
[normal]congested. We are also developing new technology including ‘co-operative systems’ which would enable better real time management of
[normal] the network, responding almost instantly to incidents on the network, for example. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]              
[normal]While this technology creates the essential foundation for the reliable and efficient operation of the strategic network, it alone would be insufficient to cater for 
[normal]longer term growth in London. It is probable that this is also the case for the national strategic road network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6
[normal]              
[normal]We are
[normal] therefore investigating the case for further demand management measures to reduce 
[normal]pressure on the network
[normal] as well as the case for p
[normal]roviding substitute, relocated or enhanced 
[normal]road space
[normal].
[normal] Anal
[normal]ysis conducted for the RTF
[normal] concluded that 
[normal]the application of both 
[normal]demand management 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]increased road space
[normal] 
[normal]measures would be most effective at supporting long term growth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.7
[normal]              
[normal]In particular, we 
[normal]are
[normal] looking at the extent to which out-of-hours deliveries could be encouraged and the extent to which this could relieve congestion. Other measures being explored include targeted behaviour change initiatives, ‘c
[normal]ar 
[normal]lite
[normal]’
[normal] development in 
[normal]growth areas, and s
[normal]patially targeted initiatives in inner and outer London such as ‘G
[normal]reen zones
[normal]’, c
[normal]ar clubs
[normal], 
[normal]DIY streets
[normal] and 
[normal]measures to complement cycling investment. All these measures are likely to be relevant to the national strategic road network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.8
[normal]              
[normal]We are
[normal] investigat
[normal]ing measures 
[normal]to 
[normal]provid
[normal]e
[normal] additional space
[normal]. These range 
[normal]from junction improvements, fly
[normal]-
[normal]unders
[normal], mini-tunnels through to longer cross-city and orbital tunnels
[normal] as means to better cater for essential strategic movement whilst mitigating the impact i
[normal]t can have on local communities. 
[normal]Again, we suggest
[normal] that such measu
[normal]res c
[normal]ould be considered
[normal], where appropriate,
[normal] for the national strategic road network to ensure reliable and efficie
[normal]nt movement in the longer term.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.  
[normal]              
[normal]What mechanisms are there for Governme[bold]nt to increase investment [bold]in[bold] [bold]   [bold]      [bold]              [bold]strategic[bold] roads and attract new investors? Are there good examples [bold]              [bold]from other countries that could be applied in the UK? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1
[normal]      
[normal]There are several mechanisms by which the Government could increase investment in strategic roads, which would benefit the London’s roads by improving traffic flow and relieving congestion. These mechanisms include investing more in pension funds and provi
[normal]ding stability for revenue streams. 
[normal]The proposed new structure for the HA, the Roads 
[normal]Investment Strategy 
[normal]and greater certainty on the funding for HA outlined
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal] should help 
[normal]to 
[normal]deliver a long
[normal]-
[normal]term plan for the road network and attract inves
[normal]tment from the private sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2     
[normal]              
[normal]In terms of increasing investment in strategic road
[normal]s
[normal], there should be greater 
[normal]          
[normal]              
[normal]focus
[normal] on encouraging investment from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds 
[normal]          
[normal]              
[normal]and
[normal] similar. Pension funds are able to provide funding on a large scale and 
[normal]          
[normal]              
[normal]are
[normal] (in the current market) relatively cheaper than bank funding and but more 
[normal]          
[normal]              
[normal]importantly
[normal] they can support the project through the whole investment cycle.  
[normal]        
[normal]          
[normal]              
[normal]A key factor to securing this is to structure the opportunity as a low risk, low 
[normal]          
[normal]              
[normal]volatility
[normal] investment with long
[normal]-
[normal]term revenue streams.  Bond financing should 
[normal]   
[normal]         
[normal]

[normal] be considered as another suitable source for fu
[normal]nding and maintaining the 
[normal]         
[normal]              
[normal]strategic
[normal] road network wholly or in conjunction with the pension funds (and

[normal]Private investors will also be seeking 
[normal]a separate
[normal] and clearly defined revenue 
[normal] 
[normal]         
[normal]              
[normal]stream
[normal] to cover payments and cer
[normal]tainty around future investment to gain the 
[normal]

[normal]confidence
[normal] needed to plan ahead and invest.

[normal]              
[normal]The proposed 
[normal]five-
[normal]year funding settlement for 
[normal]the 
[normal]HA will help in providing some
[normal] 
[normal]stability around revenue streams. The HA will benefit from having a 
[normal]fixed
[normal] 
[normal]proportion of the current taxes paid by motorist
[normal]s
[normal] (V
[normal]ehicle 
[normal]E
[normal]xcise 
[normal]D
[normal]uty
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]fuel duty) allocated to
[normal] 
[normal]it, as this will establish an independent revenue stream, and attract private
[normal] 
[normal]investment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5 
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Nonetheless with the growing deficit and reducing taxe
[normal]s paid by motorist due 
[normal]              
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]vehicle efficiencies, the HA may still require a separate revenue stream in 
[normal]              
[normal]some form of a user charge to be able to deliver the new capacity and attract 
[normal]              
[normal]the long
[normal]-
[normal]term private investment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.6 
[normal]  
[normal]              
[normal]‘Standard tolling’ or ‘user cha
[normal]rging’ can in some cases be seen as too 
[normal]        
[normal]              
[normal]rudimentary
[normal] and may be more suitable for a new crossing with no alternatives.  
[normal]        
[normal]              
[normal]It may not be the most appropriate way to fund a network of strategic roads 
[normal]   
[normal]        
[normal]              
[normal]requiring
[normal] different level of upgrade and investment. An alternative approach, 
[normal]  
[normal]        
[normal]              
[normal]such
[normal] as setting up an ‘access charge’ to use the strategic road network could 
[normal]    
[normal]        
[normal]              
[normal]be
[normal] like buying 
[normal]a 
[normal]season ticket and may have a reduced impact on changing 
[normal]              
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]user 
[normal]behaviour. 
[normal]The use of differential charges that cater for both ‘heavy 
[normal]              
[normal]users’
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]‘light users’ may also be worth consider
[normal]ing
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.7
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Another alternative could be a ‘user fee’ based on mileage travelled on the 
[normal]    
[normal]        
[normal]              
[normal]strategic
[normal] road network. Under this model those who use it the most and 
[normal]              
[normal]benefit from the infrastructure pay the most.  This approach is possibl
[normal]y
[normal] more 
[normal]              
[normal]transparent
[normal] than an access charge in that is reflects the cost of each journey 
[normal]        
[normal]              
[normal]and
[normal] is therefor
[normal]e more likely to have a more direct impact on behaviour 
[normal]              
[normal]change.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.8 
[normal]  
[normal]              
[normal]This approach has been adopted by oth
[normal]er countries around the world.

[normal]examples
[normal], a similar system is in operation in New Zealand for some vehicle 
[normal]        
[normal]              
[normal]types
[normal], while Oregon’s Department for Transport have recently completed pilot 
[normal]        
[normal]              
[normal]studies
[normal] for a similar system and are proposing to introduce it by 2015. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.9
[normal]              
[normal]The RTF recommended that we
[normal] explore the potential for developer contributions to contribute
[normal] towards
[normal] funding for road improvements. 
[normal]This source may also be applicable to the national strategic road network.
