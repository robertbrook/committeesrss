&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The impact of the scope changes to legal aid for prison law are devastating when placed in the wider context of the issues faced by those in justice system.  The prison population remains too high, with a large proportion of people with high needs and/or serving indeterminate sentences trapped in the system.  The population is set to rise as professionals with the experience to managing prisoners are squeezed out of the system.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The complaints system is inadequate as a substitution for legal representation. It is lengthy, under-resourced, bureaucratic and only used by adult male prisoners who have years of experience. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman is not a statutory post and lacks the powers to enforce his decisions.&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is neither desirable nor realistic for prisoners to be told to rely on Judicial Review as a safety net in the absence of criminal legal aid for prison law. &#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The changes to legal aid for prison law and judicial review will be a disaster for the safety and rights of children and young people in prison. &#xa0;2.1              Founded in 1866, the Howard League for Penal Reform is the oldest penal reform charity in the world. The Howard League has 7,000 members, including prisoners and their families, lawyers, criminal justice professionals and academics. The Howard League has consultative status with both the United Nations and the Council of Europe. It is an independent charity and accepts no grant funding from the UK government.&#xa0;2.2               The Howard League campaigns for less crime, safer communities and fewer people in prison. We achieve these objectives through conducting and commissioning research and investigations aimed at revealing underlying problems and discovering new solutions to issues of public concern. The Howard League’s objectives and principles underlie and inform the charity’s parliamentary work, research, legal and participation work as well as its projects. &#xa0;&#xa0;2.3               Since 2002 the Howard League has provided the only legal service dedicated to representing children in custody. We also provide a dedicated legal service for young adults in prison (under 21) and, where appropriate, comment on the particular considerations that are required to ensure that this age group is dealt with fairly and appropriately.  &#xa0;2.4              We have therefore drawn upon our lawyers’ experience in practice as well as our expertise in this policy area when submitting this written evidence. &#xa0;2.5              The Howard League is a member of the Association of Prison Lawyers and JustRights. We endorse their evidence. Consequently, this submission deals with issues within our particular field of expertise and experience.&#xa0;3.1.1              There are currently 84,197 people in prison, 80,323 men and 3,874 women. 10,786 of these prisoners are foreign nationals in detention. &#xa0;3.1.2               According to the government’s Updated Impact Assessment for the Offender Rehabilitation Bill, if passed, around 13,000 offenders will be recalled or committed to custody, at an additional cost of £16 million per year.  Further, prisons are required to cut up to 16% of their budgets next year.  This will mean losing more experienced staff.&#xa0;3.1.3               It is estimated that 36 per cent of prisoners have a disability and approximately 25 per cent have a learning disability. In a recent Ministry of Justice study 49 per cent of female prisoners and 23 per cent of male prisoners were assessed as struggling with anxiety and depression. Levels of self-harm are high amongst the prison population with 23,134 incidents taking place in the 12 months ending September 2012. Almost 50 per cent of women in prison have attempted suicide at some point in their lives. &#xa0;3.1.4              The prison population is ageing. Prisoners over 60 are now the fastest growing group in prison. Many older people in prison have a physical health status equivalent to a person 10 years their senior in the community, with a large number suffering from serious and terminal illnesses.&#xa0;3.1.5              A large proportion of those in prison have experienced social and economic disadvantage. Almost 50 per cent of the prison population report having no qualifications and approximately a quarter of prisoners need help with basic literacy. Around half of all prisoners have histories of debt and 15 per cent report being homeless prior to custody.&#xa0;3.1.6              There are around 12,000 men, and a small number of women, serving indeterminate sentences. The average sentence length has increased so that  prisoners on a life sentence typically spend 15 to 20 years behind bars.  The number of lifers has doubled since the introduction of the now defunct indeterminate sentence for public protection in 2003. Each indeterminate sentenced prisoner costs the taxpayer around £600,000 – £800,000 for their term inside.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1.7              The indeterminate sentence is focused on public safety, reducing the risk the prisoner poses and making sure that the person is safely released at the right time to a sustainable community plan on licence. According to a recent report by HMI Probation and HMI Prisons, 95% to 98% are resettled safely. The inspection report indicated that “assumptions were often made that life sentence prisoners knew all about ‘the system’ which led to an underestimation of the amount of advice and help they needed”.  It also found that “sentence planning was weak and probation staff struggled to design meaningful objectives for those who appeared to have done all required work in custody.”&#xa0;3.1.9              As the proposed cuts to legal aid are brought in and wider cuts to criminal justice bite, systems will inevitably become more stretched and mistakes will be made. Prisons on limited budgets are providing less training for existing staff and newly recruited staff are not required to have any formal educational qualifications.  This means that prison staff are less able to provide information or advice about the complex legislative framework that governs individual sentences. It is therefore even more important that prisoners can get independent and expert advice to progress through their sentence appropriately towards safe release. Criminal legal aid for prison law currently plays a vital role in getting the journey to release right.  It is often vital to ensure that prisoners get on the right courses, progress when appropriate to an open prison so they can properly prepare for safe community living and secure appropriate release packages.  All of this work is currently done by lawyers for fixed fees for around £220.&#xa0;3.1.10              The inevitable consequence of ending access to independent and skilled legal representatives will be that prisoners will spend longer in closed conditions and longer in open prisons at immense public expense. If, as a result of the lack of legal advice and challenge, the 12,000 prisoners on life sentences and IPPs spend an extra year in jail – and only one year is a conservative estimate – this will cost £480 million. This sum dwarfs the £4 million the Ministry of Justice hopes to save by the ending of legal aid to prisoners.  Public confidence could hardly be more affected than by ending a relatively cheap and effective means to secure rehabilitation for prisoners where is not happening as a matter of course.  One shocking consequence of the changes is that prisoners who have made sufficient progress to be awarded a review of their suitability to move to open conditions prior to actual release will be deprived of legal aid for representation.  Most will be forced to represent themselves at their parole hearing and will have no choice but to question personally professional witnesses as to their assessment of their risk to obtain a fair hearing. Prisoners would therefore need to be provided with all the documentation that has hitherto been given to their lawyers, including details about victims.&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1              The Justice Secretary has said that prisoners, including children, don’t need lawyers because they can complain. Many of the serious issues that Howard League lawyers deal with every day, such as making sure children have a safe place to go to when they leave jail are not suitable for backwards looking complaints systems. A complaints system can only rectify mistakes once they have been made, often incurring many months delay. Lawyers representing prisoners with sentence planning and resettlement help to prevent mistakes.&#xa0;4.2              Even with help from lawyers, the complaints system has been inadequate to protect prisoners from abuse behind closed doors. The Howard League has represented children and young adults who have been subjected to unlawful punishments, physical restraints resulting in broken limbs, and moves to mental health facilities. Without legal action these would not have been remedied and the abuse would have continued..&#xa0;4.3              Since July 2010, the legal aid rules have restricted lawyers from claiming for legal aid for issues that could be resolved through the complaints system.  As a consequence, the Howard League legal team has considerable experience of conducting complaints on behalf of young people who cannot navigate the system themselves. Because this work is not covered by legal aid, the charity has had to provide it on a pro bono basis, supported from limited charitable funding. Our experience of this work highlights the numerous problems with the complaints system as a form of redress when compared to the benefits of legal representation:&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1              The availability of judicial review for prisoners in the future is unclear pending the further consultation on judicial review and the impact of the residence test on this group: it cannot be said to act as a safety net.  Our lawyers resolve cases simply and efficiently every day.  Although many of these cases could technically turn into judicial review cases, it is in everyone’s interests to fix the problem as quickly as possible.  5.2              On the rare occasion that judicial reviews become necessary, it is vitally important that prisoners are not barred from bringing them due to technical hurdles. The response by APL sets out the technical difficulties that will be posed by the new residence test and the way in which judicial review work is structured. We are deeply concerned that the Justice Secretary relies on the availability of legal aid for judicial review as an excuse for withdrawing criminal legal aid for prisoners’ legal problems while at the same time proposing to drastically curtail the availability of legal aid for judicial review.5.3              The proposed changes to judicial review include not only restrictions on legal aid which will mean that lawyers may simply not be able to burden the financial risk of bringing claims on behalf of individuals but also restricting the right of interest groups to bring claims in the public interest.  Although we appreciate that the new proposals to restrict standing are not within the Committee’s ambit, we are concerned that the combination means that organisations like us will no longer be able to assist individuals or raise points of principle.  Our case work over the years has done both, with great benefits to children in prison.  For instance, a case brought on behalf of 14 year old K paved the way for all children to have a right to an oral hearing before the parole board whereas the Children Act case brought in the Howard League’s own name secured child protection rights for all children in the secure estate.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Changes to legal aid for prison law and judicial review ]]]

[[[will be ]]]

[[[disastrous for the safety and rights of children and young people in prison.]]]

[[[ ]]]6.1              The Howard League legal team has represented hundreds of children in prisons and privately run secure training centres to help them to progress more safely through their incarceration and to make sure the arrangements for their resettlement are safe and supportive. Legal aid to pay for this work will be essentially abolished.  The only criminal legal aid for prison law will relate to parole hearings where release is possible or disciplinary hearings where a magistrate may impose additional days.  Yet, these cases affect a small proportion of children.  This is because all other aspects of the criminal justice system are based on the principle that children should be treated differently from adults. Hence, most children are detained under Detention and Training Orders.  Although there is no power to impose additional days on children serving such sentences, poor behaviour that might have led to a disciplinary hearing by a judge in the case of an adult, can equally lead to penalties such as the imposition of an electronic tag on release or not getting early release at all.  Yet children will have no access to a lawyer to deal with these issues unless the high threshold for judicial review is met.6.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Not only will this mean that children will not get onto the courses they need to address their offending or the local authority support to reintegrate safely into the community, but it also means that our lawyers won’t find out about any serious abuse going on inside the prison. Access to an expert lawyer, who is on their side, who helps the children to get their entitlements and help to settle back home is one of the key ways we can all find out about what is going on inside jails.6.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The relationship of trust built up between Howard League lawyers and children in custody has shown them that the law can be a force for good, one of the essential components of respect for the law and responsible citizenship.&#xa0;6.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The announcement that legal aid will no longer be available for prisoners means children in custody will be hidden from view, unable to get redress for abuse. The history of closed and secretive institutions that hold children is one of abuse and violence. Prisons and STCs are bad enough as intermittent inspections have shown, but without legal representation and challenge, they will get worse. On the day that the secretary of state announced that children in custody will no longer have access to the law, an inspection report on Cookham Wood prison revealed that half of the boys held there had experienced violent restraint, a fifth had been held in solitary confinement, the young people commonly spend 14 hours a day locked in cells and the fact that safety was not assured, even after the suicide of a 15 year old last year. 6.5              The availability of advocates in prisons is not sufficient reason to dispense with legal advice and representation.  The advocates provide a vital service, but it is different from a legal service.  The advocates were required because of the immense level of need faced by children in prison. The contracts for such services (which are not new) require that the advocates resolve things at the lowest level: they are not to provide legal advice, nor indeed would they be capable of so doing as they have no legal training or expertise.6.6              The nuts and bolts of the work the Howard League’s team undertakes under fixed fees for children concerns serious and important issues – all of which will no longer be available.  This includes:&#xa0;

[[[Resettlement]]] 

[[[work for children in prison: ]]]This is work preparing the ground for release on licence or under supervision, ensuring that an appropriate accommodation and a support package is in place for release. This is vital for a smooth transition back into the local community. Release may be delayed because this work will no longer be continued and this will increase the overall costs of detaining a child.  Around 70 per cent of children reoffend.  It is well known that inadequate accommodation and support are linked to reoffending.  Getting the right package of support for children on release from custody is critical to the success of the Ministry of Justice’s rehabilitation revolution. &#xa0;

[[[Pre-tariff reviews]]]: These are very rare for children and young people.  The system is that those who make good progress are entitled to be considered for an early review to see if they can progress to open conditions where they will be able to prepare for release and return to education and work.  Most young people will require legal help in securing such a review. That will no longer be available.  Those who are granted such a review without legal assistance will not have any legal representation at their hearing.   These children and young people will be expected to represent themselves, question witnesses and prepare the case.  It is absurd to think that a young person could have a fair hearing in such circumstances.  Yet there is no provision for any flexibility to fund such cases.&#xa0;

[[[Access to offending ]]]

[[[behaviour]]]

[[[ courses]]]

[[[:]]] it is vital for the rehabilitation of young people that they attend certain offending behaviour courses. Offending behaviour work for young people is often complex.  They do not have a large range of standard programmes available to them and they often require assessment to identify the key issues to be addressed, untangling developmental issues from core offending behaviour needs. A lot of our clients are not given the chance to attend the courses or get one to one work that should be made available to them. Without access to this work or legal help to secure it, young people will be at greater risk of reoffending. &#xa0;6.7              It is hard to see how the Justice Secretary can square these changes which will take away a simple mechanism to prevent or fix error in the rehabilitation system on an ideological footing as he pushes forward his Rehabilitation Bill as a means to “finally turn the tide and put a stopper in the revolving door of the justice system”&#xa0;
