"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written submission from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) (LPG 29)About NCVONCVO champions and strengthens the voluntary sector, with over 10,000 members, from the largest charities to the smallest community organisations. \nAlongside our sister councils in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, we make sure the voluntary sector can do what it does best. \nwww.ncvo-vol.org.uk\n \nNCVO convenes the Public Service Delivery Network, Special Interest group of sub-contractor organisations involved in the Work Programme, and a Payment-by-Results working group that will be making recommendations in 2013. \nSummary-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNCVO believes that local government procurement continues to be primarily driven by price rather than delivering true value for money. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNCVO is concerned that only \ncontracts above EU procurement thresholds are covered by the Social Value Act’s provisions. Plans to increase EU procurement thresholds to €750,000 (circa £600,000) are likely to exacerbate this situation.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLarge contracts requiring capital (such as Payment by Results (PbR) contracts or contracts at significant scale) continue to present problems for the VCSE to participate in public service delivery. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM\nany of the issues \nassociated with developing effective procurement strategies \nlie not with commissioners\n alone,\n but with how commissioning and procurement teams work together\n.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrently there is no common standard for local authorities to report spending data. This lack of data can hamper effective policy formation\n and\n improvements to procurement\n.\n&#xa0;Introduction: The voluntary sector’s role in public service deliveryThe voluntary sector has been involved in public service delivery for many years. As such, we have extensive experience of\n local government procurement policies\n and practice. \nAround a quarter \nof voluntary sector organisations \nreceive funding from government\n.\n \nI\nn 2010/11\n the voluntary sector received \n£14.2 billion\n (37 percent) of its income in the form of \ncontracts a\nnd grants from statutory bodies.\n \n50% \n(£7.0 billion) \nof this came from local authorities, highlighting the important relationship that exists between the two sectors. \nS\nince 2000, the voluntary sector’s statutory income has grown faster than total public spending, suggesting\n&#xa0;\nthat the vo\nluntary sector has become an increasingly\n important contributor to \neconomic growth \nand a \nsignificant\n actor in the provision of\n&#xa0;\npublic services\n.\nIn 2010/11 (the latest year for which data is available), the voluntary sector provided\n services across a broad range of areas: \nIncome from statutory sources, by sub-sector, 2010/11 (% of each sub-sector’s income)Source: \nNCVO\n/\nTSRC\n, \nCharity Commission\nFurther information on the voluntary sector can be found in NCVO’s UK Civil Society Almanac: \nhttp://data.ncvo-vol.org.uk/\n. \nOur report Open Public Services: Experiences of the Voluntary Sector provides recent case studies on: commissioning, supply-chain management, sharing information, managing scale, new forms of finance, managing risk and ensuring quality.\n \nhttp://www.ncvo.vol.org.uk/sites/default/files/open_public_services_experiences_from_the_voluntary_sector.pdf\n \nQ1. To what extent is local government procurement organised to deliver value for money and social, economic and environmental objectives, including stimulating the local economy? To what extent are local authorities achieving the involvement of local residents in delivering value for money? To what extent are local authorities able to develop long-term relationships with contractors? &#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is often a disconnect between the two key parties involved in leading the procurement of public services: the commissioning team and procurement team.\n \nC\nommissioners seeking to\n achieve broader social value or\n trial new methodologies, such as out\ncomes-based commissioning, can\n hav\ne their business case\n blocked by \nprocurement or finance teams\n.\n \n \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFailure to involve all relevant actors (providers, commissioners, procurement, contract managers) in the design stages of commissioning, when need is first reviewed and commissioning solutions discussed.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFailure to adequately communicate the problem and solution being procured, and the outcome to be achieved.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFailure to systematically map risks in procurement, and agree monitoring and management of these risks. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFailure to acknowledge across commissioning authorities that risk is a necessary part of change and improvement in commissioning should be valued. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLimited or no engagement of procurement and finance teams directly with providers, so they do not understand the commercial context and structures of their provider markets.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMore decisions based on price, rather t\nhan quality and value for money. For example, a recent NPC report highlighted an example from Bradford. The City Council had reduced the number of homelessness services providers from 11 to 4, and required providers to demonstrate their financial strength while squeezing pricing. With contracts becoming leaner, this resulted in fewer VCSE providers deciding to bid.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nS\nupport\ning \na diverse and effective market\n is essential for achieving value for money in local government procurement. While many commissioners express a desire to avoid creating oligopolies of large providers, funding cuts are driving them to commission at scale, putting system efficiency before frontline quality. A 2013 VCSE survey by Locality \nfound that nearly 42% of respondents believe contracts have become larger in the last five years and a further 52% expect them to become larger still over the next five years. 80% said this would provide them with less opportunities and a lower range and quality of services in their area.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLarge contracts requiring significant capital (such as Payment by Results (PbR) contracts or contracts at significant scale) can squeeze out VCSE providers or lead organisations to seek loans at rates less favourable than those the public sector can acquire\n. Compact Voice’s 2013 survey of Local Compacts found that 42.1 percent of voluntary sector respondents believe that the capital \nrequirements and financial risks involved with PbR ‘completely’ limit the sector’s capacity to compete for contracts with 28.2 percent of local authority respondents agreeing.\n \n \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommissioners need to engage with and facilitate development of their local provider markets. Providers need a clear steer about future commissioning opportunities, plenty of notice if certain types of structures that will be required to bid (e.g. consortia), and information about their market position to help them decide whether to develop new services and take on investment.  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPbR contracting is being rolled out without testing viability and impact on the market beforehand. Without sufficient research and learning, commissioning authorities can exclude VCSE providers or impose disproportionate and wasteful contracting processes.  It remains true that in many cases (for example, pilot or innovation projects) grant funding would be more appropriate and efficient than \ncompetitive contracting. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPoor quality decommissioning without proper explanation. VCSE providers are sometimes left to conclude that decisions about decommissioning have been made on the basis of short-term savings, rather than a strategy to improve service provision and quality. This can lead to providers leaving the market.\nQ2. Do authorities take sufficient advantage of collaborative and joint procurement opportunities, including those available from central government? In addition, the Committee would welcome information on PFI contracts and their operation with local government.Q3. How can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives? More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies—locally and regionally. If not, how can deficiencies be addressed?&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nenabling community engagement and consultation\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nidentifying new and emerging needs within the community\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nproviding and identifying early intervention and preventative services that work for individuals and marginalised communities\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nmobili\nsing local people as volunteers.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommissioners often hold misconceptions about the probity of speaking with providers at the pre-procurement stage. This continues despite ‘mythbusting’ guidance from the Cabinet Office.\n As a result, contracting approaches and requirements may be selected that are not appropriate for the provider market. What is needed is a more\n systematic approach to gathering market \nintelligence\n pre-procurement and \ngreater co-designing with the market\n. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommissioners lack an understanding of the commercial and governance arrangements of VCSE organisations and how this affects attitudes, management of risk and loan finance. A basic understanding of charity law and restrictions on charities would help.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPoor data creates challenges for constructing performance baselines and outcomes targets. This can result in targets being set that skew provider behaviour (‘gaming’) away from the originally intended outcome.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMisuse of contracts as the driving mechanism for relationships. Contracts should convey agreed values following a period of meaningful dialogue between the relevant parties. Variations during service delivery (for various reasons) are commonplace, so it is important that contracts are constructed by both sides to provide a flexible and supportive framework for when change occurs. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ4. To what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are tailored to product and supplier market places? More specifically, do local authorities maintain and operate effective client management functions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow the flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget reductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ6. Is local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress? Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective? More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n A recent survey by Compact Voice found that almost 90 percent of voluntary sector\n respondents \nbelieve that \npublic bodies will still focus on lower cost rather\n than social value when funding \nhttp://www.compactvoice.org.uk/blogs/compact-voice/2013/08/07/local-compact-survey-results-2013-briefing-3-social-value\n \nThese thresholds are \ncentral government and NHS contracts worth more than £113,057\n (€130,000)\n and local authority contracts worth more than £173,934\n (€200,000).\n Compact Voice - \nFreedom of Information Act responses 2012\nhttp://www.compactvoice.org.uk/foi2012\n \n \nReport \non the proposal for a directive of the Europea\nn Parliament and of the Council \non public procurement\nhttp://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201301/20130110ATT58822/20130110ATT58822EN.pdf\n \n \nOfficial Journal of the European Union (OJEU)\n \nhttp://www.ojec.com\n \n For \na step by step guide to \nharnessing\n best prac\ntice and innovation from the voluntary sector\n throughout the commissioning process\n see \nhttp://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/commissioning/commissioner_checklist\n A recent report by Nesta ‘Networks that work: partnerships for integrated case and services’ highlights how the VCSE brings particular expertise in community engagement, responding to the needs of service-users and using volunteers and peers to deliver services \nhttp://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/assets/features/networks_that_work_partnerships_for_integrated_care_and_services\n \nhttp://www.thinknpc.org/publications/governance-in-the-new-commissioning-landscape/\n The survey is yet to be published online.
