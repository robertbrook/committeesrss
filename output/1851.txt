[[[Written submission from the Market Research Society (LPG 44)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Market, social, opinion and economic research are all used to support critical policy and operational decisions in all areas of public life. When procuring research, local government is procuring evidence on which important decisions are based.  The procurement practices should be structured to reflect this.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Research is an intellectual capital and creative service depending on skills, training and intellectual capacity.  It is highly labour intensive, which requires high levels of customisation and interaction between procurers and suppliers.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Any criteria used to evaluate service procurement which is based on a high level of intellectual capital such as research, should be based on assessing whether a proposed solution is fit for purpose and good value for money; not on lowest cost.  Lowest cost does not equate with value for money.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Any procurement of research within the public sector must include research specialists who can advise on framing the business or policy problem to be addressed and the suitability of proposed solutions.  This is particularly the case within local government where research is often used to inform decisions, including the allocation of funds, and as such it is essential that appropriate research is being conducted to fully answer the issue of concern.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The procurement process must permit and foster communication between buyers and suppliers, with reference to their information, policy and business needs. Communication and consultation early in procurement is considerably more efficient in the longer-term.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Administrative procedures should be significantly streamlined, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness, by adopting some simple changes e.g. standardising core documentation and information requirements, storing such information centrally allowing those within local government responsible for procurement access to the relevant documentation.
