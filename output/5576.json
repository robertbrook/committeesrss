"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is pleased to provide written evidence to the House of Lords EU Sub-Committee B (Internal Market, Infrastructure and Employment) as part of its important inquiry into youth unemployment. \n&#xa0;\nIn responding to the call for evidence, we have answered questions where our experience is most relevant.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRBS provides a range of initiatives to help young people into the job market, from direct employment to tailored advice and support services. \nRBS currently employs around 7000 people under the age of 25, representing around 10% of the bank’s total UK workforce. RBS runs far-reaching graduate, apprenticeship and internship programmes to support and develop young people’s careers:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nAside from direct employment, RBS provides training and advice services designed to give young people a crucial insight into succeeding in the world of work. The breadth of \nresources, volunteering opportunities, sponsorships and partnerships for pupils and students are brought together in The RBS Future Ready Hub; a \nbreak down\n of relevant initiatives is provided below:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nWe are committed to working with each devolved administration to support young people into employment and have the following comments on specific programmes:\n&#xa0;\nIn England the links with EU policies, as expressed in \nWorking together for 'Europe’s young people - A call to action on youth unemployment\n are clear given that traineeships and apprenticeships are at the centre of BIS policy on Youth Employment. The English traineeship model shows good potential in recognition of its systematic approach to helping young people to develop the key skills needed in order to improve their labour market opportunities. While the introduction of £9,000 tuition fees in England has challenged young people to reflect on the economic benefits of achieving a degree, apprenticeship policy has been supportive in creating alternative opportunities for young people.\n&#xa0;\nThe creation of Higher Apprenticeships has changed the proposition from firms to young people. We will be reviewing the opportunities that Higher Apprenticeships \nprovide to RBS as more relevant frameworks are developed and are pleased to be involved in the Trailblazer initiative for Corporate Banking. We are hopeful that the proposed changes to apprenticeships through the Trailblazer initiative in England and the new funding model will continue to make it easy and cost effective for employers to engage with apprenticeships in a meaningful way.\n&#xa0;\nIn Scotland, the Commission for Developing Scotland’s Young Workforce is starting to address the shortcomings given by the lack of an established mechanism through which employers can systematically engage with young unemployed people such as ‘traineeships’. The recommendations 2, 7 and 10 of the interim report of the Commission for Developing Scotland’s Young Workforce (Wood Report) are promising. Specifically, the increased focus on expanding the scope and level of apprenticeships, to guarantee better employer influence within the governance of apprenticeships and interventions for those at risk of disengaging from education and having a focus on early intervention relating to labour market demand. We look forward to the full report that will be released spring 2014 and are committed to supporting the Scottish Government in its implementation to help create more meaningful opportunities for the young people in the communities we serve.\n&#xa0;\nThe Welsh Government has developed the similar structures as in England in terms of expanding apprenticeships to include \nHigher\n levels.  The Northern Ireland Government is currently reviewing its apprenticeship policy to ensure it is fit for purpose.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nNo response\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe case studies of best practice often quoted in research, such as the German or Swiss model, are based on education systems with significant differences in comparison to the UK. As such it is difficult to comment on the applicability of such practices in the UK. For large employers with an international footprint such as RBS, it is helpful that there is some level of harmonisation between the youth employment policies adopted in each Member State in order to allow for coordinated programmes which to best support young people in Europe into work.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNo response.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;At RBS we believe that self employment is a realistic route for young people. Indeed, the Higher Education Statistics Agency recently announced that 75% of students expect to be self-employed within 10 years. RBS runs its own quarterly research tracker - the RBS Enterprise Tracker - and we have seem similar trends in this research. The latest findings from the tracker were published on 13\nth\n January 2014.\n&#xa0;\nThe findings indicate that young people are consistently seen to be more interested in being self employed, or running their own business than old generations. That said - they also perceive greater barriers to starting up - and so need more support in order to be successful.\n&#xa0;\nRBS is committed to support self employment and has developed the Inspiring Enterprise programme to encourage a more entrepreneurial culture from the classroom to the boardroom; its main aim is to encourage more people in more communities to explore enterprise, build their skills and ultimately to start up and succeed in business.\n&#xa0;\nIn this space RBS has been working for over a decade in partnership with The Prince’s Trust. The current award winning partnership is focused on the Enterprise Programme, of which RBS is the largest corporate funder, to support the next generation of UK entrepreneurs. \nThe Enterprise Programme operates across the UK, with the Scottish programme run by The Prince’s Trust Youth Business Scotland. \n&#xa0;\nThe programme offers young entrepreneurs loan funding, advice and the support of a business mentor when starting up a business. The Enterprise Programme supports \n6,000 young people each year\n. The strength of the partnership was recognised in 2012 when The Prince’s Trust and RBS won a joint £1.6 million bid to become a delivery partner for the pilot of the UK Government’s Youth Enterprise Loans scheme. The Prince's Trust was able to use this funding\n&#xa0;\nto support an additional 600 young people in England with start-up funding and mentoring.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition to our core support of the Enterprise Programme, the RBS partnership with The Prince's Trust aims to raise the profile of young entrepreneurs and undertake research to understand the barriers to enterprise faced by young people. Examples include research reports The Start \nUp\n Generation, The Cost of Exclusion, Broke Not Broken and Down, But Not Out. Moreover, the RBS Enterprise Award at The Trust’s annual Celebrate Success Awards and the recent A-Z of Young Business campaign, help to highlight the success of many young entrepreneurs throughout the UK.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
