defaultMy wife and I have been active walkers in the Pennines and particularly the Yorkshire Dales for over 60 years!

defaultIncreasingly we have been disturbed by trail motor bikes and 4 wheel vehicles using footpaths, bridle ways and green tracks.  The noise is appalling and great damage is done to the fragile turf and wider environment.

defaultI enclose three photos to illustrate my points, there are captions on the back.

defaultWe are very keen for the problem to be tackled once and for all by the forthcoming Deregulation Bill.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would propose that all unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be reclassified as Restricted Byways.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition we would like to propose that when a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to a magistrate or an independent inspector.

defaultWe have been members of the Yorkshire Green Lanes Alliance since its formation.
