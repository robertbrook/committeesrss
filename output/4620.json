"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLeonard Cheshire Disability believes that disability should be at the heart of development. Disability must therefore be explicitly referenced in the post-2015 development framework. With \napproximately\n a billion disabled people across the globe\n,\n it will simply not be possible to secure the optimum development outco\nmes unless disabled people are fully included and mainstreamed within \nall \ndevelopment programmes.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo this end we believe that the UK Government must be at the forefront of pushing for disability to be referenced in the post-2015 development framework. The\n UK is well placed to be a leading voice in this call, which could help ensure that millions of disabled people \nare fully included in \ndevelopment work.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe recognise that there has been a willingness to pursue this agenda within the Department for Internat\nional Development, particularly through a number of key programmes.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe would however suggest that it is difficult to identify the\n extent to which mainstreaming\n of disability issues has actually \nhappened across the Department. \nWe suggest that the Department produces a specific disability strategy \nwith a set of clear outcomes and indic\nators to measure\n its impact on disabled people\n.\n We recommend that \na full-time senior civil servant is appointed in the department to oversee the implementation of this strategy. \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe recommend that the Department \ndevelops a monitoring and evaluation framework that specifically measures disability inclusion in their mainstream policies and programmes, at both global and country levels.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe recommend that DFID looks to fu\nnd \ninstitutional \ndevelopment \nand capacity building \nof disabled people’s organisations in low and middle income countries.\n&#xa0;\n1.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe recommend that explicit reference is made \nfor the inclusion of \ndisabled people and their allies in future DFID\n-\nfunded disability\n-specific and mainstream\n initiatives.\n&#xa0;\n1.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is clear from our research that there is no “one size fits all” solution to addressing the entrenched and systematic exclusion and poverty of disabled people in developing countries\n. \nWe \ntherefore recommend that DFID takes a key strategic role in negotiating with fellow bilateral and multilateral donor agencies to develop appropriate tools for monitoring the impact of disability-specific and mainstream development programmes.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAt Leonard \nCheshire Disability, we work for a society in which every person is equally valued. We believe that disabled people should have the freedom to live their lives the way they choose - with the opportunity and support to live independently, to contribute econ\nomically, and to participate fully in society.\n&#xa0;\nL\neonard Cheshire Disability's International Department works through five regional \noffices in Africa and Asia. We support\n children with disabilities to \nget an education\n, adults with disabilities to earn a living, and all disabled people to access the rehabilitation, health and other support they need. \nWe also campaign\n to put disability at the heart of international development, and support young disabled peop\nle to campai\ngn for their rights through our Young Voices p\nrogramme\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, the Leonard Cheshire Disability and Inclusive Development Centre, University College London (which is part of \nour\n International Department), undertakes world-class qualitative and quant\nitative research in the field of disability \nand international development\n. We focus on \npolicy analysis\n, disability and poverty, livelihoods, \ninclusive education\n and\n disability in conflict-affected countries\n and in disaster and emergency situations\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe adequacy of DFID’s current policy commitments on disability and development, and whether it needs a disability strategy&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLeonard Cheshire Disability recognises and welcomes the leading role that DFID has taken in the field on disabilit\ny and international development during the past 15 years. This \nis \nevidenced by the production of the issues paper, \nDisability, Poverty and\n \nDevelopment\n, (2000), which spearheaded the highly influential “twin track approach” to disability programming. DFID has also been proactive in commissioning four discrete research programmes on disability and international development issues, which has made a signifi\ncant contribution to the growing body of knowledge in this field, including \nevidence that is now regularly used to support \nthe UN \nConvention\n \non Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID has also produced a \nHow to Note on Working on Disability in \nCountry Programmes,\n \nwritten primarily for DFID country staff. However, since its publication in 2\n009, there is little evidence of\n the extent to which this has influenced DFID’s programmes and policies at country level.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the recent past, there has been\n \nan\n increasing commitment by DFID to incorporate and mainstream disability issues within its core programmes. The\n current\n \nParliamentary Under-Secretary of State\n for\n International Development, Lynne Featherstone, has a personal commitment to disability issue\ns\n. This is to be \ncommended. However, it is important that this personal commitment becomes \ninstitutionalised within DFID, so that disability continues to be prioritise\nd in\n international development, both within the UK Government, and also by other leading \nbilateral and multilateral donor agencies.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNotwithstanding these positive initiatives, at the programme level, it is difficult to evaluate the extent to which DFID has indeed mainstreamed disability across its work. \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt remains the case that the economic\n case for the inclusion of disability issues within the international development framework needs to be constantly made and reaffirmed. The evidence base for inclusion of disability issues, though growing\n,\n still needs to be strengthened.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA development of \na coherent disability strate\ngy by DFID\n would be very positive. It would embed a disability component into DFID’s\n work\n, and provide a clear set of priorities. This should \nbe \ndeveloped in collaboration \nwith civil society institutions, \nincluding disabled peop\nle’s organisations. \nWe strongly recommend\n that this consultation process includes the input from disabled people and their representative organisations in low and middle income countries. DFID’s future disability strategy should embrace the principles and \ncommitments \nset out\n in the UNCRPD. It should also reflect\n the outcomes of The \nReport of the \nHigh Level Panel \nof Eminent Persons on\n the \nP\nost-2015 \nD\nevelopment \nA\ngenda\n on the post-2015 development agenda and\n any \nfuture \nchanges\n to the global development framework. \n&#xa0;\n3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn order to ensure that disability issues are systemically institutionalised within DFID, \nwe\n recommended that a full-time senior civil servant is appointed in the \ndepartment\n, whose primary role is to make sure that d\nisability is included in all DFID policy and strategy initiatives including country programmes and DFID-funded projects with civil society institutions.\n&#xa0;\nIntegration of disability issues within DFID’s sector programmes (for example in health, education, sanitation, livelihoods, and empowerment) and its humanitarian work&#xa0;3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a strong link between disability and multi-dimensional poverty\n. It is not lack of funds alone but a lack of inclusion in important areas such as education, health services and soc\nial participation, as well as compounding factors such as gender, age and geographical location, that limit the opportunities for disabled people to overcome poverty. Research from the Leonard Cheshire Disability Inclusive Development Centre has recently t\nermed this the ‘Disability and Development Gap’\n: disabled people who are not included in development efforts fall increasingly further behind non-disabled members of their communities as development efforts increase. \n&#xa0;\n3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLeonard Cheshire \nDisability \nendorses\n the twin track approach to disability service provision as outlined in \nDFID’s\n issues paper, \nDisability, Poverty and Development\n (2000). We therefore recommend\n that DFID finances specifically targeted disability programmes as well as enabling disabled people and their families to access mainstream public services and development initiatives (including water and sanitation, public health, education and social pro\ntection).\n&#xa0;\n3.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe evaluation strategy developed for \nDFID’s Girls’ Education Challenge (GEC) \ngives a unique opportunity to generate strong evidence of what works and what does not\n.\n \nLeonard Cheshire Disability \nwelcomes the effort made by GEC to strengthen the \nmonitoring and evaluation\n capacity of implementing agencies and to fund research initiatives. However there needs to be the right balance between the effort invested in generating the evidence and the \ndirect response to the needs of\n disabled people.\n&#xa0;\n3.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID \nneeds to develop \na \nrobust moni\ntoring and evaluation framework\n at international and country level\n. This is in relevant in two \nareas: first, with regard to DFID’s five-year country\n operational plans; and second\n with regard to DFID\n’s\n programmes through civil \nsociety institutions. \nThe framework\n should clearly measure and evaluate the specific impact(s) \nthat \nDFID’s disability-specific and mainstream initiatives have on disabled people. \nIt \nshould at \na \nminimum \nensure that \ndata \nis\n disaggregated by age, sex, categor\ny of impairment, and where possible, ethnicity, and geographical location (urban/rural \ndivide\n).\n&#xa0;\n3.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is also important that DFID actively engages and provides financial support for the empowerment of disabled people’s organisations in low and middle income \ncountries. Therefore, \nDFID\n should fund the institutional development and strengthening of disabled people’s organisations\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nn order to make disability-specific and mainstream programmes more inclusive,\n appropriate\n financial resources should be provided to support the design of innovative programmes at country level.\n&#xa0;\n3.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n We further encourage DFID to ensure that all key stakeholders receive Disability Awareness training and that disabled \npeople\n routinely sit on project\n advisory board\ns\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe strength of the evidence base on ‘what works’ in development programmes involving disability&#xa0;\n3.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFour examples a\nre given below that demonstrate\n some of the innovative work that Leonard Cheshire Disab\nility has undertaken globally. \nThis \nis not a comprehensive list but \ninstead \nprovides some \nexamples \nof\n the evidence base on ‘what works’ in development programmes involving disability\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCross-Cutting Disability Research Programme&#xa0;3.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n Cross-Cutting Disability Research Programme\n was a three-year initiative funded by DFID and managed by the Leonard Cheshire Disability and Inclusive Development Centre. The mandate was \nto work with other DFID-funded Research Programme C\nonsortia \n(RPC) \nto mainstream a disability component into other i\nnternational development research areas. \nR\nesearch was undertaken i\nn collaboration with other RPCs\n in the fields of \naccess for persons with disabilities to \nwater and sanitation (Zambia and Uganda); maternal and child health (Nepal); mental health\n, \nstigma \nand multi-dimensional poverty \n(India); and urban agriculture (Kenya). \nOne of the key lessons\n learned \nfrom this research programme\n was that disability often \nwas \nnot considered \nby \nmainstream RPCs\n. It is therefore essential\n to \nbuild the capacity of disabled p\neople and their representative organisations on \nhow to undertake and use research in th\neir core campaigning activities.\n&#xa0;\nLeonard Cheshire Disability’s Young Voices3.17\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLeonard Cheshire D\nisability’s Young Voices programme,\n \nsupported by \nthe \nEuropean Union\n,\n \nprovi\ndes clear evidence of the value of making young disabled people the agents of their own destiny within development programmes. Young Voices is a global network of over 1,200 young disabled campaigners from over 20 countries in the global South. Through the\n project, young disabled people \ngain the\n skills and confidence they need to \nengage with decision makers to \neffectively advocate and campaign to end the extreme poverty, discrimination and exclusion experienced by people with disabilities in lower income co\nuntries. The voices of \nyoung people \nwith disab\nilities are often marginalised. Through their focused\n advocacy campaigns\n, Young Voices\n have\n contributed to changing both local and national discourses on disability and participated \nat an international level\n th\nrough \nthe UN\n and UNICEF\n. \nInitiatives such as this can be a catalyst for building the next generation of the disability movement.\nInclusive education&#xa0;3.18\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThrough our\n inclusive education projects across\n Africa and Asia\n,\n \nLeonard Cheshire Disability has\n supported over 10,000 children with disabilities to go to school.\n \nOur\n inclusive education work in\n Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, s\nupported by Big Lottery Fund\n,\n \nwas recognised \nin \n‘\nBest Practices \nfor \nIncluding Persons \nwith \nDisabilities \nin \nAll Aspects \nof \nDe\nvelopment Efforts’\n published by UN in April 2011. The project \nsupported children with disabilities to access mainstream primary edu\ncation\n and s\nupported them to continue their\n education\n.\n \nOver 3,000 teachers were trained on accommodating children with disab\nilities in their classes. Preparatory classes for children with disabilities were organised prior to enrolment into mainstream schools, and an effective home-based education system was designed for areas where the terrain made it hard for children with hig\nh support needs to get to school. The project worked closely with schools to make them accessible; and with government officials to ensure that children with disabilities received any government entitlements\n due to them\n. The \nproject also undertook advocacy and policy work, including the formation of parents groups and child-to-child clubs for children with and without disabilities to support meaningful inclusion. In total, over 2,700 children were successfully enrolled in thei\nr local primary schools. The project had a significant impact on changing attitudes towards disabled children’s rights to education; there are now more children with disabilities in local primary schools in \nthe project locations\n. \n&#xa0;\nLivelihoods&#xa0;3.19\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLeonard Che\nshire Disability’s Livelihoods Resource Centres (LRCs) in Asia \nand \nAfrica \n(supported by\n funders including\n Accenture and the European Union\n respectively\n) \nhave been selected by the Zero Project\n as an example of ‘Innovative Practice’ relating to persons with\n disabilities and employment. LRCs act as ‘one-stop-shops’ for disabled people seeking employment, providing \nskills \ntraining, career guidance and links between employees and employers. There are now 22 LRCs in 9 countries across Asia and Africa\n. We have su\npported over 10,000 adults with disabilities into paid or self-employment, and provided training for nearly 50,000\n. LRCs are unique in providing the full range of support that disabled people need when seeking employment or \nstarting their own enterprise\n. L\nCD partner\ns\n with mainstream training institutions, ensuring disabled people get recognised qualifications. The training is also tailored to meet the needs of local employment markets, as well as people’s own interests and talents. Training provision in “so\nft skills” (including confidence building, decision making, and critical thinking) also supports the project’s success. In order to support self-employment, the microfinance model used by LRCs includes savings and insurance, known to be an effective povert\ny reduction tool.\n&#xa0;The role of disabled beneficiaries in planning, managing and monitoring DFID policy and programmes&#xa0;\n3.20\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt has long been recognised, especially in rural development and international gender studies, that the most sustainable and efficient \noutcomes of development initiatives occur when participatory approaches to policy and programme design are employed\n. Within the international disability and development sector, a good example of this was the negotiation process of the UNCRPD. \n&#xa0;\n3.21\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\ndopting a\n participatory approach, if undertaking in a non-tokenistic manner, will incur financial\n \nand human costs\n – for example provision of sign language interpreters,\n physically accessible venues\n, covering transport etc. We recommend \nthat explicit reference is \nmade\n \nwithin the DFID disability strategy to the need\n to involve\n disabled people and their allies in the development of DFID-funded disability initiatives. It will also be important to explicitly state what processes and methodology will be employed to ensu\nre such engagement.\n&#xa0;\n3.22\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe believe\n that both disabled and non-disabled people have a legitimate role to play in relation to policy design, programme implementation and evaluation. \n&#xa0;\n3.23\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe\n encourage \nDFID to establish a working group, comprised of key individuals\n working in the disability and international development arena, who will provide strateg\nic advice and guidance to DFID on this issue.\n&#xa0;The financial costs and benefits of an increased emphasis on disability&#xa0;3.24\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe financial and human costs of \nthe \ncontinuing \nexclusion of disability in international development are substantial. In 2000, the World Bank estimated that the annual loss to global GDP of people with disabilities not working who were in a position to \ndo so\n was between $1\n.37 trillion and $1,94 trillion\n. This figure is\n likely\n to have increased substantially since 2000.\n&#xa0;\n3.25\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the International Labour Organization’s 2009 study en\ntitled ‘The Price of Exclusion: The Economic Consequences of Excluding People with Disabilitie\ns from the World of Work’\n,\n \nt\nhe tota\nl \nannual \ncost of avoidable unemployment among disabled persons to national economies was estimated to be between 1% and 7%\n of GDP\n.\n&#xa0;The UK’s role in ensuring post-2015 development goals consider disability issues&#xa0;\n3.26\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Millennium Development Goals made no explicit reference to \ndisability issues. This was a significant omission\n. The post-2015\n development framework must explicitly \ninclude disability.\n This includes not only the final set of goals but systematic inclusion of disability in the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms built into all targets and indicators\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.27\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe recommend\n \nthat DFID \ntake\ns\n a leading, strategic role in ensuring that disability iss\nues are incorporated into the post-2015 international development framework\n.
