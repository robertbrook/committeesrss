PUB0007[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from Daphne [bold]Havercroft[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]My name is Mrs Daphne 
[normal]Havercroft
[normal]. I am a resident of South Gloucestershire. I have seven years experience as a member of the public participating in and 
[normal]observing
[normal] public and patient involveme
[normal]nt in local NHS service changes. I have also contributed to 
[normal]and o
[normal]bserved 
[normal]local health authority scrutiny of these matters. 
[normal]I am a public member of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. 
[normal]I am providing this evidence in a personal capacity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]My reason for giving evidence to the Committee is that ther
[normal]e is an assumption in the Open Public Services White Paper that people know better than politicians and that giving the people more control over services they receive will lead to better pub
[normal]lic services. This assumption needs to be thoroughly tested. Unles
[normal]s 
[normal]s
[normal]trong governance policies are in place 
[normal]at local level 
[normal]and audited
[normal] to e
[normal]nsure that
[normal] they truly deliver
[normal] full openness and 
[normal]transparency
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]increased 
[normal]delegation of powers and responsibility to local level has the potential to do more harm than good.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]I have answered some of the 
[normal]Committee’s 
[normal]consultation questions below and given examples as evidence to support the answers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To what extent is the Government’s public service reform programme[bold] [bold]succeeding in:[bold]&#xa0;[bold]a. Empowering citizens?[bold]b. Improving public serv[bold]ices?[bold]c. Ensuring that public services are accountable to the people who use them, and to elected officials?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Currently citizens are not empowered and never will be unless 
[normal]organisations providing public s
[normal]ervice
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]are seen to be 
[normal]truly accountable 
[normal]to
[normal] the public
[normal]. 
[normal]Currently l
[normal]ocal organisations providing public services have the freedom to avoid public accountability
[normal] with impunity
[normal] if they wish to do
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What are the challenges and opportunities in moving power away[bold] [bold]from Whitehall and into the hands of citi[bold]zens?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The challenge is
[normal] to genuinely move 
[normal]power into the hands of citizens
[normal]. 
[normal]There is an assumption that all citizens want it. I am not convinced this is a correct assumption because empowerment carries respon
[normal]sibility which requires citizens to commit time 
[normal]to exercise their rights. Many may not be willing to allocate time to this. Consequently there is a risk 
[normal]that power 
[normal]will move
[normal] to
[normal] organisations and groups which claim to represent 
[normal]local interests and serve the public 
[normal]but in fact may 
[normal]not do so. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]How [bold]successful have the Government’s reforms been in opening up[bold] [bold]public services [bold]to grassroots community groups, rather than to large[bold] [bold]private or third sector organisations?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I have not seen any clear evidence of local success, rather the reverse. For example th
[normal]e Councils of Bristol, North Somerset, South Gloucestershire and Bath and North East Somerset have awarded contracts to run local 
[normal]Healthwatch
[normal] to a third sector organisation which has a history of winning contracts 
[normal]with them. 
[normal]There is no publicly available 
[normal]information 
[normal]to explain 
[normal]the 
[normal]governance arrangements for
[normal] local 
[normal]Heal
[normal]thwat
[normal]ch
[normal], including arrangements for 
[normal]patient
[normal] and public
[normal] 
[normal]part
[normal]i
[normal]cipa
[normal]tion
[normal] in meetings and 
[normal]an explanation as to 
[normal]how the business of the meetings 
[normal]will be recorded
[normal] and published
[normal]. 
[normal]Over s
[normal]ix months 
[normal]after it was established, n
[normal]o information is publicly available to show whether any grassroots community groups are part of Local 
[normal]Healthwatch
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]How does the Government ensure that public services develop the right kind of leadership as they become more [bold]open, more subject to scrutiny and more customer-focused?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]A considerable 
[normal]amount of documentation 
[normal]exists 
[normal]which describes good 
[normal]leadership 
[normal]practice – for example Nolan Standards, Code of Conduct for NHS Managers, Centre for Public
[normal] Scrutiny Documents
[normal]. There a
[normal]re many examples where these practices are not followed
[normal] locally, 
[normal]to the detriment o
[normal]f openness, and public scrutiny and accountability. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]For example 
[normal]NHS Foundation Trusts can be completel
[normal]y unaccountable to local people
[normal] if they choose to be.
[normal] [bold]In the case of 
[normal]the Foundation Trust of which I am a public member, i
[normal]t is impossible to contact the public and patient governors without going through the Trust. It is impossible to have meetings and conversations with public and patient governors without them being chape
[normal]roned by the Trust Board Secretary. The Trust Board Chair (as is the statutory role of all Foundation Trust Chairs) also chairs the Governors' Membership Council, thereby having the opportunity to control and influence its meeting agendas and discussions. 
[normal]Consequently the extent to which a Foundation Trust Board holds itself accountable to patients and the public depends entirely on the extent to which it chooses to do so.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Another example is 
[normal]an organisation set up in Bristol, described as
[normal] a dynamic collab
[normal]oration between six 
[normal]NHS organisations serving the area, the city’s two universities and its local authority. It aims to 
[normal]generate significant health gain and improvements in service delivery in Bristol by integrating, promoting and developing Bristol's stre
[normal]ngths in health services, research, innovation and education.
[normal] It is inspired by 
[normal]the success of similar collaborations in the USA, Europe and East Asia
[normal]. It aspires to c
[normal]loser working with patients, the public and communities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I
[normal]n response to an FOI request 
[normal]it said its Board meetings are held eve
[normal]ry two months, are not open to 
[normal]the public and the minutes are not published. 
[normal]It has significant opportunity to influence the health and wellbeing of local people, yet 
[normal]it is not constituted and governed in any way whic
[normal]h would give citizens real empowerment a
[normal]nd scrutiny of how well the partnership services the local population and the extent to which it provides value for public money. 
[normal]Citizens should have a say in the qualities required of people appointed to leadershi
[normal]p roles. Where appropriate, applicants for the roles should be required to hold appropriate professional qualifications as a condition of appointment. To serve citizens properly, 
[normal]leaders must be appointed based not on who they know, but what they know and 
[normal]how well they perform as leaders. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]How realistic is it that “choice” can be exercised in public service[bold] [bold]provision or should we be looking instead at greater control by users[bold] [bold]so they can ensure that public services become more responsive to[bold] [bold]changing needs?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]If users see evidence that 
[normal]providers of public services are open and accountable, the
[normal]y are
[normal] less likely they are to 
[normal]demand more choice. 
[normal]However t
[normal]here is a long way to go before users have the control intended by Open Services White Paper. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How do we make[bold] sure that all citizens are able to influence[bold] [bold]public services?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Organisations which offer public services must be required to commit to delivering minimum s
[normal]tandards of governance. Their success in meeting those standards 
[normal]must be externally and
[normal] independently audited. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Organisations must have policies in place to demonstrate that all citizens can influence their servi
[normal]ces. 
[normal]They must provide citizens with evidence
[normal] that they follow these policies. 
[normal]The sort of behaviours used by
[normal] some 
[normal]service provide
[normal]rs try to obstruct citizens
[normal]’ rights
[normal] to influence services are as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]What safeguards[bold] should be in place to deal with service providers[bold] [bold]who fail to deliver services, or who deliver services of an insufficient[bold] [bold]quality?[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]They should be served with improvement notices. If they fail to improve, sanctions should 
[normal]be applied,
[normal] including contract 
[normal]termination
[normal] if necessary. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]How do we ensure that best practice is[bold] shared so it can be replicated [bold]in the context of greater diversity of provision?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]D
[normal]efine and 
[normal]agree what “best practice”
[normal] means
[normal], then gather case studies
[normal] [bold]which demonstrate best practice which
[normal] can be used as a resource for citizens, local public
[normal] [bold]service commissioners and providers. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]What progress has been made in setting up [bold]mutuals[bold] as an effective[bold] [bold]way of delivering public services?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]It is assumed that 
[normal]they will act in the best interests of the public. 
[normal]There is a risk that they will not. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The principle of 
[normal]giving
[normal] 
[normal]more power to cit
[normal]izens good, but I am not convinced that the majority of citizens want it and have the time to devote to it. M
[normal]y experience is that the culture and leadership of some organisations which have responsibility for public services is nowhere near sufficiently de
[normal]veloped to provide genuine transparency, openness and public accoun
[normal]tability. 
[normal]O
[normal]rganisations such as 
[normal]mutuals
[normal], 
[normal]which are not subject to the 
[normal]FOIA
[normal], 
[normal]are 
[normal]taking over responsibility for services which were prev
[normal]iously managed by public bodies
[normal] which were subject to 
[normal]the FOIA.
[normal] 
[normal]This is an obstacle to greater openness, transparency and public accountability. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If services are decentralised at a faster rate than local providers develop strong leadership and commitment to public service values and accountability, the conse
[normal]quence for citizens will be that they wi
[normal]l
[normal]l be disempowered and silenced.
