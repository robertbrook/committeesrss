defaultCJD
default has not gone away and continues to kill not just here in the 
defaultUk
default but globally. I have recently returned from meeting families affected by 
defaultCJD
default in Italy. People continue to die of human BSE due to ingesting infected bovine material during the 1980s and 1990s, according to Professor 
defaultCollinge
default there may be incubation periods of 50 years, generations remain at risk. Many of us who may incubate or carry the disease will be blood donors or hospital patients. All have the potential to pass on the deadly infection via blood and medical procedures. We face a secondary wave of 
defaultv
defaultCJD
default infection via these routes.

defaultOne of the most recent victims of 
defaultvCJD
default who became infected due to ingesting infected beef during the 1990s or 1980s was a vegetarian. He incubated the disease probably for decades before symptoms appeared.  People of faith who cannot eat any part of the cow and also strict veggies have died of

default a few years ago a young Muslim man who had not arrived in the UK from war torn Bosnia until late 1992.

default and his family were awarded the compensation as he had contracted the human form of BSE from food medicines here in the UK.  We need to stop more deaths of

defaultCJD
default through contaminated blood or blood 
defaultproducs
default. 
defaultI have interviewed families who have lost a loved one to 
defaultv
defaultCJD
default who had also been a blood donor, they were warned by the CJD unit and Department of Health officials ‘don’t tell anyone your child gave blood especially the press or your neighbours.’ These family members were terrified by the very officials who were supposed to offer help and support. This is a common theme in my personal and professional dealings with families who have been affected by 
defaultv
defaultCJD
default. They have been kept isolated by government officials, many bullied this is totally unacceptable. 
defaultAs a parent who has lost a dearly loved only son to 
defaultv
defaultCJD
default I have been continually appalled at the behaviour of many government officials present to victims and their families.  It’s a travesty that I am hopeful an inquiry will address too as this is part of the cankered core that created BSE, unleashing it on an unsuspecting public. 
defaultThere are thousands more ‘living victims’ who could decline just like my son, tens of 
defaultthousand
default of us now carry

defaultCJD
default, it’s the biggest political and health scandal of modern times and its finally time for the public to know the whole truth about BSE. I fear that the government will not welcome a blood screening test. It would be relatively cheap to mass screen blood donors compared with the spiralling cost of other safeguards which have limited value. 
defaultI fear the UK Government will stall and block any mass blood screening test for 
defaultv
defaultCJD
default as it would highlight the prevalence of BSE exposure within the population, it would also show the exact source of the original infections. This is a particular can of worms the incumbent Conservative led government do not want to address. With a blood screening test for

defaultI would like to give evidence at the inquiry committee meeting and will end this with an extract from my book, Who killed my son? Andrew could be any mother’s son, anyone reading this submission. I
