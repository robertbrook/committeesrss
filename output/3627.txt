[[[Introduction:]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Transport Committee is to examine the Economic Assessment of the HS2 project and, in particular, the KPMG Economic Assessment..&#xa0;I have been a consultant, banker and practitioner in infrastructure and energy project finance, - PFI, PPP and the like, - for the last 30 years or more, with both UK and wide overseas experience.  I have also given Seminars and Courses on this topic in more than 40 countries over the last 5 years.&#xa0;

[[[The Green Book:]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1. the discount rate used to express future costs and revenues in       today’s values; and2.&#xa0;the use of the concept of “Optimism Bias”.Hence, in choosing a discount rate to bring future values back to today, we choose our "cost of money", or thereabouts. Mathematically, arriving at  Present Values it is compound interest, - which we all learn in GCSE at school, - working backwards![Looking at it a different way, a “real” discount rate of 3.5% is equivalent today to around 6.2% “nominal” after adding inflation (2.7%), compared with the Government’s actual, i.e. “nominal”, cost of money = 3.7%!].

[[[ ]]][* = before 2003, a “real” discount rate of 6% p.a. was imposed by Treasury, which was equivalent to a rate of 8.5 - 9% “nominal” rate, when at that time the long-term cost of borrowing for Government was around 5.5-6%.&#xa0; Is it not surprising, therefore, that for many PFI projects, - which push out into the future the payments Government has to make to finance the assets, like a credit card, - the projected Present Value costs for the PFI option were always going to look cheaper than conventional funding? Many PFI hospital projects suffered through such flawed decision-making.The same prognosis can be applied to recent rail franchises, e.g. West Coast Main-Line.]Based on a consultant’s report of a range of projects undertaken in 1980- 1990’s, Government/HM Treasury derived multiples, which they would apply to cost estimates. Sometimes this multiple was applied to the estimates before making adjustments for risk, sometimes afterwards**. [**. there is a mathematical difference. Network Rail and HM Treasury for a time applied OB both ways respectively, and both claimed they were right whichever way they used it!!!]&#xa0;

[[[Conclusion:]]]Given the above, is it not time to question the use of the Green Book? I hope so, otherwise many more major UK infrastructure projects will be surrounded by controversy.

[[[Green Book Error:]]]In June 2013 HM Treasury published an update of the 2003 edition of the Green Book.&#xa0;On Jan 27, 2003 I alerted HM Treasury (&amp; HM Treasury acknowledged the alert) that there was an error, - or, possibly, just a misprint!, - in one of the discount rates quoted in the Green Book. &#xa0;&#xa0;That error is still there today, 10 years on! &#xa0;I leave HM Treasury until 2023 to find it!! &#xa0;
