default2default.default              defaultIntroductiondefaultOnce again there is a public furore about Internet content. However, this time the debate is messy and ill-disciplined, as many voices are speaking about many issues:- Child protection, legality of content, censorship, financial predation, bullying to name just a few.
defaultPolicy makers are in an impossible position! Caught between protection and censorship with the added problems due to the global nature of the Internet.

defaultThis paper outlines a means of mitigating the problems based on the genesis of The Internet Watch Foundation by the person who lead the founding of IWF
default4default.default              defaultA solutiondefaultIt is our view that the problem is not a legislative problem, but a market problem. Previously, there has been a diversity of media channels with each channel being moderated by an “editor”.
defaultThe Internet needs to offer the public a choice of “flavours” of Internet, similar to how people choose their newspaper, TV channel or indeed their preferred supermarket.

default              
defaultSeveral attempts have been made to provide the public with filtered content, however typically these are from a singular view-point (e.g. Western liberal Christian tradition), which means the cost of creating the filter list has to be spread over a small user base.

Internet Watch was founded, NOT BY CONSENSUS, but designed and implemented through the maverick leadership of Mr Peter Dawe.  The players ( Service providers, Government, Police, Politicians and the Press) are individually impotent. Each has conflicting objectives, all consider the other players as  responsible, irresponsible, ignorant, idealistic, imposing impossible costs, ducking their responsibility etc.

defaultHowever, with a more sophisticated set of players, it is less likely that a maverick leader will not be able to overcome the likely barriers alone. Political endorsement of this initiative, for a finite period (2 years), would encourage many of the other players to also support the initiative. Thus allowing the model design to be finalised, proof of concept completed and for the model to be promoted to all players world-wide.

defaultNote: Other initiatives, such as consensus building committees, can still be undertaken in parallel with this proposal.
default12default.default              defaultFundingdefaultFor an effective team to complete the design, prove concept and importantly to sell the model internationally, we estimate that a budget over the two years of £500,000 would suffice.  A requirement of the design is that it is ultimately self-funding in operation. (Internet Watch cost under £50,000 to set up, and was completed in less than 12 months, a voluntary levy on the industry has funded it since)

defaultThe Dawe Charitable Trust believe it can catalyse the actions needed for this global initiative, recruiting support from the industry, government, religious, freedom-of-speech and other groups.

default              
defaultDawe Charitable Trust already has an experienced core team committed to working on the initiative.

default.
default              
defaultThe Dawe Charitable Trust is seed-funding this initiative (£50,000), and the team will seek to design and implement a model regardless. However adoption of the above recommendation will both speed the initiative and improve the likelihood of global success.
