"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dr Ruth Dixon (IPC0023)I am submitting this evidence on the subject of \nscrutiny and \nreview of the IPCC report. I am not associated with the IPCC \nand my evidence is drawn from published sources\n. I have undertaken academic research and teaching at the Universi\nty of Oxford since 19\n86. I am the author or \nco-author\n of\n over 50 peer-reviewed publications \nin\n the natural sciences (\nc\nhemistry and \nb\niochemistry) and the social sciences. I have also reviewed numerous papers for academic journals. \nThe views in this evidence are my own, and do \nnot represent the views of my employer or any other organization.\n \nThe Review Process for IPCC ReportsSummaryMy evidence addresses the Committee’s questions: \n‘\nHas the IPCC adequately addressed criticisms of previous reports?’ and ‘To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?’‘\nThis independent review of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was undertaken by the InterAcademy\n Council (IAC) under a $950,000 contract signed in April 2010 with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)\n.\n’  \nThe \nIAC Review\n Committee convened for the purpose comprised twelve experts under the chairmanship of Harold Shapiro, professor of economi\ncs and public affairs at Princeton University, USA.\n‘\nCoordinating Lead Authors and Lead Authors have considerable influence over which viewpoints will be discussed\n.\n \nHaving\n \nauthor teams with diverse viewpoints is the first st\nep toward ensuring that\n \na full range of \nthoughtful views are considered. \nEqually important is combating confirmation bias—the tendency of authors to place too much weight on their own views relative to other views [\ncitation\n]\n.\n As pointed out to the Committe\ne by a presenter and some questionnaire respondents, alternative views are not always cited in a chapter if the Lead Authors do not agree with them. Getting the balance right is an ongoing struggle.\n’\n \nThe review recommended that\n:\n \n‘\nLead Authors should \nexplicitly document that a range of scientific viewpoints has been considered, and  coordinating Lead Authors and Review Editors should satisfy themselves that due consideration was given to properly documented alternative views\n.\n’\n‘\nA near-universal observation—made in presentations, interviews, and responses to the questionnaire—was the need to strengthen the authority of the Review Editors to ensure that authors consider the \nreview comments carefully and document their responses. With a tight schedule for completing revisions, authors do not always do an adequate job of revising the text, and Review Editors do not always require an explanation for rejected comments. In the cas\ne of the incorrect projection of the disappearance of the Himalayan glaciers, for example, some of the review comments were not adequately considered and the justifications were not completely explained (see Box 2.1). Although a few errors are likely to be\n missed in any review process, stronger enforcement of existing IPCC procedures by the Review Editors could minimize their number. This includes paying special attention to review comments that point out contradictions, unreferenced literature, or potentia\nl errors; and ensuring that alternate views receive proper consideration.\n’ \nThe IAC Review\n recommend\ned\n that the role of Review Editors should be strengthened, \nbut\n noted \nthat even if that were done ‘\nit would not make the review process truly independent bec\nause the Working Group Co-chairs, who have overall responsibility for the preparation of the reports, are also responsible for selecting Review Editors.\n’ \nThe IAC Review suggested that the IPCC should consider instituting a completely independent review pro\ncess.\nThe 2013 \nversion of the Principles is\n in some ways less specific than the earlier version\n.\n \nF\nor instance, the 2008 version sa\ni\nd\n that ‘\nt\nhe review circulation should include: Experts who have significant expertise and/or publications in particular areas covered by the Report’ while the 2013 version simply mention\ned\n ‘as wide a group of experts as possible.\n’\n \nT\nhe IAC’s recommendations \nfor\n \nstreamlining\n the review process for authors\n w\nere\n not acted upon\n.\nNo changes were made to the role, powers or remit of Review Editors\n. \nT\nhe 2013 \nIPCC \nPrinciples \n(like the \n2008\n version) emphasised that ‘responsibility for the fina\nl tex\nt remains with the Lead Authors\n.\n’\nC.
