defaultWitness:

default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default Minister, once again welcome to our Committee, to a one
default&#x2011;
defaultoff evidence session on the local government finance settlement.  Part of the stimulus for the 
defaultsession
default came from quite a large number of petitions, which the Committee eventually received, about the perceived imbalance in the allocation of money to rural areas, so some of our questions will focus on that, but then we will look more widely at the settlement as well.  Just to make sure we get everything on the record, it is appropriate right at the beginning of a session—I think it will do for both sessions—if Members put their interests on the record as well.  I am a Vice
default-P
defaultresident of the Local Government Association.  
defaultCould
default anyone else with a particular interest related to local government put their interest on the record
default?
defaultMrs defaultGlindondefault:default My husband is a councillor in 
defaultNorth Tyneside
default.
defaultChris Williamson:default I have got a couple of staff who are elected members.
defaultDavid defaultHeyesdefault:default Me too.
defaultSimon Danczuk:default My wife is a councillor, my father-in-law is a councillor, and some of my staff are councillors.  
defaultHeather Wheeler:default I am a Vice
default-Presid
defaultent of the LGA and my husband is leader of a council.
defaultJohn Pugh:default I have a member of staff who is a councillor.
defaultMrs defaultGlindondefault:default 
defaultI 
defaulthave a member of staff who is a councillor.  
defaultChair:default Is that our lot?  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Minister, once again for joining us.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMrs defaultGlindondefault:default Good afternoon, Minister.  Do you support the Rural Fair Share campaign for the rural penalty to be reduced from 50% to 40% by 2020?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: We do not agree with their figures, in the sense of the way they calculate the 50% and 40%.  
defaultTo compare
default like-for-like authorities, if you look at unitary authorities, in 2014-2015, the difference is about 10%; if you look at the shire district areas, in 2014-2015 it will be 12%; if you look at fire and rescue authorities, it will be about minus 3%; and for county councils, it will be about 4%.  That is because the way they assess what is a rural area is quite different 
defaultfrom 
defaultthe way we do.  In a simplistic sense—I can give you a colloquial example of this—the way they look at the rural definition, they would include 
defaultNorfolk
default as a rural county.  I can see the logic of that, but those of us who live in Great Yarmouth, 
defaultNorwich
default and 
defaultKing’s Lynn
default would be 
defaultthe 
defaultfirst to admit we 
defaultare predominantly urban and we have deprived areas and areas of high density as well.  When we distribute funding at DCLG, we do it in different ways.  We would class 
defaultNorfolk
default as North Norfolk, Mid
default&#x2011;
defaultNorfolk
default, 
defaultBroadland
default, 
defaultBreckland
default and South West Norfolk, not 
defaultNorwich
default or Great Yarmouth or 
defaultKing’s Lynn
default, so it is quite a different way of calculating it.  I have
default had this conversation with SPARSE themselves. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMrs defaultGlindondefault:default With regard to what you said on that, is there a reason why you did not take notice of the 
defaultcall for the 
defaultEfficiency Support for 
defaultS
defaultervices in 
defaultS
defaultparse 
defaultA
defaultreas funding to be 
defaultincreased to £30 
defaultmillion when Graham Stuart MP asked for that?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: We put
default £8.5 
defaultmillion in last year.  This year, in the settlement as it currently stands, that is at
default £9.5 
defaultmillion and we are going 
defaultto roll it into the base,
default because we do recognise—we have been quite clear about this—that there is a gap between rural and urban.  But, as I say, as far as we are concerned, it is not 50% narrowing to 40% in the first place, so to have a discussion 
defaultaround £30 
defaultmillion would be presuming a set of figures that we do not agree with in the first place.  As I say, if you look at it like for like, for 2014-2015 the gap 
defaultranges from a maximum of 12% down to minus 3% for the fire authorities.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMrs defaultGlindondefault:default Do you think that the 
defaultESSSA
default 
defaultis just a temporary fix—a political fix—or do you think it is evidence that the Government and your Department accept there is a rural penalty that needs to be reduced?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: As I said just now, we do agree that there is a gap.  We 
defaultwere sympathetic to the argument
default, and that is why we put the extra money in last year.  We have increased that money to
default £9.5 
defaultmillion this year and we have put it in the baseline so that it is not just a one-off; it is rolled into the baseline.  We are dealing with that.  In that sense we have recognised the issue and dealt with it.  Having said that, I also need to be quite clear 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is limited evidence of there being considerable extra cost—which some people would argue—of dealing with rural services.  The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has commissioned some work, which we are working with them on, to have a look at this very issue, as it happens.  That will be reporting back later this year and, depending on the findings—and I am not going to pre-judge 
defaultthat; the work is only being commissioned in February or March
default—that may well give everybody something to look at for the next settlement.  But at the moment, as I say, the gap for local authorities ranges from 12% to 4%.  It is not a very big gap 
defaultnow.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMrs defaultGlindondefault:default There is a big difference between the amount that the Rural Fair Share petition
default are asking for—£30 
defaultmillion—and that which the Government is saying it will give, so there must be
default some cause for concern that is justified.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: No.  As I said, the difference between the figures is the difference between the 12% and the 40% or 50% that you mentioned in the opening question.  That is because of the way that they are assessing what is a rural area.  As I say, they would class the whole of Norfolk, when in fact there are towns and districts and authorities in Norfolk that are predominantly urban, if not entirely urban, such as, as I said, Norwich, King’s Lynn and Great Yarmouth.  In terms of how we fund, they are not classed as predominantly rural areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMrs defaultGlindondefault:default 
defaultIs the 
defaultpurpose of revenue support to ensure that everybody would receive the same level of 
defaultlocal 
defaultservice if they were paying a notional uniform council tax across the board?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: The idea of every single person in the country paying the same council tax would be an interesting thing to take forward, and some councils might have different views on that to others.  The money 
defaultthat is distributed through grant predominantly—and obviously the most deprived areas get the highest amount of grant—is in order to make sure they can provide 
defaultthe core services.  Depending on where you are, different councils will make decisions on what their primary focus is and what their priorities are.  I have said to this Committee before everybody expects to have their waste collected—the Secretary of State would argue vehemently that it should be on a weekly basis—and to have the streets kept clean, but the priorities for an individual authority are a matter for the local authority.  That is localism.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMrs defaultGlindondefault:default So there would be different problems in urban and, perhaps, rural areas.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I am sure some local authorities would argue that there are not only different issues to deal with in a rural area compared to an urban area, which is undoubtedly true.  In an urban area you are dealing with density of population but in close proximity to each other, generally, because of how it is built up; a more rural area will be dealing with higher transport costs or gaps and differences between areas and villages.  Equally, you will find rural areas will make the point, depending on where they are and their proximity to the next town, that they are dealing with different issues according to their area—and the same with urban areas.  I have two of the most deprived wards in the country in my constituency.  Great 
defaultYarmouth
default would make the point that they have very different issues to deal with 
defaultfrom 
default some of the areas in the 
defaultMidlands
default and the North, partly because they are a seaside town, partly because some of it is rural
default.
default 
default 
defaultParts of 
defaultNorfolk
default 
defaultwould argue there are
default 
defaultareas of 
defaultrural deprivation.  It is quite difficult to say that rural is just different 
defaultfrom
default urban and all rural is the same.  One of the beauties of our country is wherever you go there is something unique and something different, and that gives a different challenge to that authority.  It is also why that power for local authorities to make their own priorities is so important
default,
default because they know what they need to deliver most for their local residents.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Could I just turn Mary’s 
defaultimportant 
defaultquestion around a little bit?   Is the principle of the grant settlement that it equalises out differences in needs and differences in resources between authorities, to the extent that if everyone were to pay the same level of council tax, they would get the same level of service?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: Do not forget the whole structure of how we finance local government is changing.  The basic baseline—for want of a better phrase—has the banding in; it has the four bands
default,
default which does recognise that.  That is why some authorities will be more grant-dependent than others, so they get that basic funding to be able to 
defaultprovide basic services.  But we have moved to a whole new way of funding local government through the business
default 
defaultrates retention scheme and the New Homes Bonus.  We are moving away from a system that is grant-dependent to a system where local authorities are incentivised to do things.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default So that principle has been eroded, effectively.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: Yes, there is a big shift away from the begging-bowl structure of the past to an incentive-based structure for the future.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ9 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Minister, can I follow up the concerns of rural communities that Mary has just spoken to you about and particularly ask you about the 
defaultsparsity
default ratings, or the 
defaultsparsity
default allowance?  T
defaulthe sum of £200 
defaultmillion was put on one side to reflect that, but then damping provisions were introduced, which meant that three
default-
defaultquarters of it would not get out to the local authorities.  Was it the Department’s intention to effectively give with one hand and then take away with the other?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: First of all, 
defaultnot every authority—to the point you made, Mr 
defaultPawsey
default—was detrimentally affected.  Technically, you will find some examples of rural authorities 
defaultthat 
defaultge
defaultt the benefit of the extra £9.5 
defaultmillion and benefit from damping.  It depends on where you sit on the
default scale.  The decision that was made in late 2012 for the settlement for 2013-2014 put damping in and widened and stretched the bands to make sure there was more protection in there for the most grant-dependent authorities, because there was recognition that although there is a gap between rural and urban—and I have to say
default 
defaultthis is underlining the fundamental difference between the 50% argument and 
defaultour 
default12%
default 
defaultat-
defaultworst-this-
defaultyear argument—the most grant-dependent authorities, which tend to be in some of the most deprived areas, needed that extra protection to make sure they had the basic funding
default.  It also avoided
default volatility for the business-rates scheme.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ10 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default I accept that.  You 
defaulthave said that we will look at the situation today and there will be no assessment until 2020.  Is that
default still the case?  You spoke just earlier about looking at a report later this year.  Will that change things, or is that a separate issue?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: There are two different things going on.  The business
default 
defaultrates retention scheme is locked in until 2020, and if we unlock that, then we start 
defaultdisincentivising
default the growth opportunities through th
defaultat
default scheme.  However, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are doing some work 
defaulton 
defaultthe issues for rural areas.  Our Department is working with them on that.  That work will be done over the summer; it is due to report back in the autumn.  I am not for a moment saying that there will be things in that that we need to look 
defaultat, because we do not know what is in the report yet; it would be pre-judging it.  The SPARSE argument is that there are big differences in the ability or the cost of providing services in rural areas as opposed to urban.  If that report backs that up, it will be the first time realistically there has been solid evidence to back that case up, and then the Government will have to have a look at that.  However, at the moment, that evidence does not exist, and we do not know quite what that report will feed back.  
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultmovements
default 
defaultwe 
defaultare
default able to look at
default—for 
defaultex
defaultample, this year, with the £9.5 
defaultmillion
default—give 
defaultus some flexibility, but, again, I would underwrite 
defaultthat 
defaultand say
default,
default if you look at like-for-like authorities, the worst gap is only 12%.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ11 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default But you are saying to those authorities who feel that they have not done particularly well this year that it does not necessarily mean that there can be no changes between now and 2020, because this report may provide the evidence they need, in which case the Government will act.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: From their point of view, if that report provides evidence, then it is a very strong piece of argument for them to put to the Government.  There is a track record of 
defaultour
default looking year to year at what we need to do to make sure we get the settlement in the right place.  For exam
defaultple, last year, we put the £8.5 
defaultmillion in; this 
defaultyear, we put £9.5 
defaultmillion in.  Last year, we had the de 
defaultminimis
default for some authorities—the lowest quartile of charges.  There have been variations and flexibilities quite regularly within settlements.  I am not pre-judging what may or may not happen next year, but certainly in the past there is evidence that, where there needs to be flexibility, the Government will look at it.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ12 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default So there will be a regular review.  One of the great concerns is that there is a bi
defaultt of a cliff face coming. 
default 
defaultI
defaultf there is a perceived unfairness now, the Government are not going to do anything about it until 2020
default; i
defaultf there is a review in 2020, there could be then significant change.  How will local authorities prepare for that?  Or will Government simply 
defaultdefer yet again?  How can you
default reassure authorities that that is not going to happen?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I might be going a bit beyond my remit to pre-judge what a Government in 2020 might do, because technically I could be binding the Government after next, just about, depending when in 2020 we are talking about.
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default But you understand 
defaultthe concerns.  
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I do understand the point, but to make the business
default 
defaultrates retention scheme properly able to incentivise, there needed to be 
defaulta baseline, and then beyond that, that growth allows the councils to benefit.  The view was that to lock that in until 2020 was the logical thing, bearing in mind the baseline does recognise the banded floors in the first place.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ13 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default You have probably heard that the Rural Services Network has complained that authorities in the Home Counties have seen the smallest reductions in settlement funding during 2013-2014 through to 2015-2016.  People are asking why these affluent areas are being given an easier ride than more deprived rural and urban local authorities.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I would argue they are not, in the sense that the most deprived 10% of authorities have a spending power that averages just over £3,000, whereas the 
defaultleast deprived 
default10% have a spending power of £1,952.  They have a much higher starting point in the first place.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ14 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default The indicative figures for 2015-2016 suggest that there is going to be a 0.6% increase for South East England but a 2% reduction for 
defaultEngland
default as a whole.  I just wondered how you thought th
defaultat can be fair.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: There were about 40 authorities that had an increase last year; there are some this year; and there will no doubt be some next year.  That potentially could grow.  Those authorities who had those increases had them because
default 
defaultof the New Homes Bonus.  It is proving the incentive is working; they are building the house
defaults and they are getting the money.  As the business
default 
defaultrates retention scheme works and as we start to see economic growth, there is a real potential some authorities will see growth through that as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ15 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default Can you understand, though, why some people think that the Government 
defaultis 
defaultin some ways rigging the situation in favour of more affluent parts of the country, whichever measure you look at, whether it be spending power or grant settlement?  
defaultF
defaultor example—and this is often an example that is cited—the Prime Minister’s own local authority area, West Oxfordshire, has seen a per capita increase of £57.23, whereas my own local authority, for example, has seen a reduction of £354.13.  One area that is affluent has seen an increase; an area that is less affluent has seen a massive reduction
default.  
defaultDerby
default is by no means the worst-affected in that sense
default; m
defaultany other local authority areas argue that they have seen even bigger reductions.  People just see that as being fundamentally unfair.  I just wondered how you square that circle.  How can you justify that as being reasonable?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: Just to help my memory, because I have not got it in front of me, could you remind me what the spending power for your council is against 
defaultWest Oxfordshire
default?
defaultChris Williamson:default I cannot off the top of my head.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I think you will find that it is considerably higher than 
defaultWest Oxfordshire
default in the first place.  
defaultAs I have said, 
defaultWest Oxfordshire
default and the authorities that have had increases, as I have said, have had them because they have the New Homes Bonus.  The incentive scheme is working.  That is something we should be pleased about.  It works, and other authorities can benefit from that.  But you have just highlighted the issue.  For example, as I have said, the most deprived areas tend to have a spending power that is well over £1,000 more than the areas that are more affluent.  For example, people tend to use West Oxfordshire, Woking and places like that, which have spending power of between £1,500 and £1,900 per household
default; 
defaultif you look at areas like 
defaultNewcastle
default and 
defaultLiverpool
default, they will be between £3,000 and £4,500 in some cases per household.  As I say, they have a much higher spending power per dwelling in the first place.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ16 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default That is because there is a great deal more deprivation.  I think you would accept that.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: They have deprivation to
default deal with; that is why they have 
defaultthis higher grant
default in the first place.  My point is you 
defaultcannot do a direct comparison of somewhere that is
default getting £4,500 per dwelling 
defaultin spending
default with somewhere that is getting about £1,800 and argue that 
defaultthe one that is getting 
default£
default1,800 is better off.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ17 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default We constantly get into this battle, 
defaultthough, 
defaultdo
defaultn’t
default we
default, between this definition of spending power and grant settlements?  There is a 
defaultconstan
defaultt
default tension, it seems, between DCLG’s interpretation of
default what the figures are saying and your arguing, “These 
defaultmore deprived areas are doing better in a sense because
default they have got more to start with”.  I just wonder, therefore, what your thoughts would be about 
defaultwhether it is time to have a local government equivalent of
default the Office for Budget Responsibility.  That would then settle it, would it not?  Would you 
defaultsupport that?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I do not think there is anything to settle.  I appreciate you do not
default know the spending power for Derby at the moment, but I think you will find, if you look at it, it is much higher than West Oxfordshire in the first place.  That is quite a simple fact.  It is the same for 
defaultNewcastle
default, Liverpoo
defaultl
default, Leeds and 
defaultManchester
default; they are much higher than the more affluent areas.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ18 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default What about the point
default, though, about a local government equivalent of the Office for Budget 
defaultResponsibility?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: 
defaultThe problem is y
defaultou are also looking at it from the point of view of the
default grant settlement.  Bear in mind, of course, 70% of local authorities’ money—it used to be 50%—now is locally derived.  That will 
defaulthopefully grow as we see economic growth.  You also have to bear in 
defaultmind we are working within a constrict in which we are having to reduce the deficit and pay down, eventually, the debt that was inherited from the last Government.  T
defaulthe Secretary of State 
defaultmade the point to you
default last w
defaulte
defaultek
default that
default, with local government accounting for
default about a quarter of all 
defaultGovernment expenditure, it has a big part to play.  If the authorities that are getting the largest part of the grant are losing 2.9% of their funding, in cash terms that will be a different figure compared 
defaultwith 
defaultsome
defaultwhere 
defaultthat gets a much smaller grant in the first place.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ19 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default Can I 
defaultjust press you one final time with regard to this point about a 
defaultlocal government equivalent of the Office
default for Budget Responsibility?  I accept you 
defaultare making the argument that the Government’s figures are reasonable, but there is this tension that a lot of people would take issue with your
default interpretation.  In terms of taking the tension and the politics out of it 
defaultsomewhat, if we had that equivalent of an Office 
defaultfor B
defaultudget Responsibility for local
default g
defaultovernment finance
default, that would settle this argument once and for all, would it not?  No matter how strongly you argue today 
defaultthat the Government is being fair and reasonable, there will be many voices in
default local government who say, “Well, I am sorry; that is just 
defaultdisingenuous
default”
default.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: The 
defaultOffice for Budget Responsibility 
defaultlooks at
default Government expenditure, so you could argue that 
defaulta part of
default DCLG is within what the Office for Budget Responsibility looks at
default.  I am sure that is
default an argument, if you want to put it, we can debate in a backbench business d
defaultebate 
defaultor a Westminster Hall debate 
defaultat some stage in the future.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ20 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChris Williamson:default As far
default as you are concerned at the moment, then, you would not necessarily 
defaultsupport—
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I am not sure
default what it particularly would add to the fact that, at DCLG, we have to set a budget for local government; we have to work out 
defaultwhat the
default grant settlement is for local government.  That is 
defaultchanging dramatically, because local government itself is
default controlling more and more of its own finances; less and less of it, regardless of who is 
defaultsitting in my chair and what party they are fr
defaultom, 
defaultis
default going to be coming from central Government.  As I say, it has already 
defaultmoved from roughly 
default55% or 56% to 70% in the last 
defaultcouple 
defaultof years.  As 
defaultthe economy grows, hopefully that will grow and local authorities, as a result of that, will become more and more autonomous.  That, in the long run, 
defaulthas to be good for them.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ21 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Minister, you talked about the propo
defaultr
defaulttion of spending
default that local government takes in terms of the national cake, so you 
defaultwould expect, therefore, there to be a reasonable proportion of any reductions in local government.  Is it fair, therefore, that from 2010-2011 to 2014-2015, local 
defaultgovernment will see the cash made available to it from central Government decline by 
default15
default% but central Government itself, on its own expenditure—its own direct services—will have increased its cash spend by 
default15
default%?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: As I said, local government has got a huge part to play.  It has still got a lot further to go.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ22 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default A 
default15
default% cut
default for local government; a 15% increase for central Government.  It is 
defaultnot very fair, is it?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: 
defaultWe are down about 60% in terms of our reductions at DCLG, so w
defaulte do practise what we preach.  We 
defaulteven go as far as sharing, effectively, our chief executive—our Permanent Secretary—and we are going to be 
defaultmoving our offices to be even more cost
default- 
defaulteffective this year.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ23 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIt is not the real question, is it?
default  15% increase in cash for central Government as a whole; 
default15% reduction 
defaultin cash 
defaultfor
default local government.  It is not very fair, is it?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: Local government is still
default spending more than it did last year.  It is up at £117 
defaultbillion from 
default£114 
defaultbillion.  The actual spend in local government and the amount of money it has in reserves is showing local government is still doing a very good job.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ24 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 15% down in
default cash in four years.  
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: 
defaultIt went from £114 billion last year to £117 billion 
defaultthis year.  It 
defaulthas managed to increase its reserves and keep 
defaultproviding good services.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ25 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan you justify the fairness of why local government has been picked out for the 
defaultbiggest cuts of all?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: 
defaultThere are certain departments that have been protected, because t
defaulthe Government took a political 
defaultdecision about what was to be protected.  Local government is responsible for about 25% of all Government expenditure, so it is
default going to end up taking a
default 
defaultbig c
defaulth
defaultunk 
defaultof the savings that have to be made.  
defaultWe have to pay down that debt and deficit, and it has to come from somewhere.  
defaultEqually, w
defaulte
default have given the power to local authorities
default to be more in control of their own finances as they go forward.  As I said earlier, some authorities 
defaulthave
default seen increases in 
defaulttheir g
defaultr
defaultant 
defaultmoney 
defaultfrom Government 
defaultthrough the incentive schemes.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ26 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default I have
default some questions on timing, but ca
defaultn
default I just
default take you back to a previous question probed by our C
defaulthairman?  What we 
defaultare 
defaulttrying to
default find out is whether there is a change of 
defaultprinciple behind the allocation of resources.  I think you said 
defaultsomething like 
defaultyou
default 
defaultwanted to move
default away from a “begging-bowl”—that is the expression you used—system to 
defaultincentivising local authorities
default.  Is that what you said?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ27 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default I do not think councils
default traditionally beg, but they do expect that their funding is somehow a 
defaultreflection of a needs assessment.  Are you saying that you want to move away from a
default 
defaultneeds-based s
defaulty
defaultstem of funding local authorities
default to a different system not based on need?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: Need is built into the baseline that is there for the 
defaultbusiness rates retention scheme.  The business rates retention scheme, the New 
defaultHomes Bonus, the Efficiency Support Grant and the Transformation Challenge Award are
default 
defaultmoving the 
defaultgrant
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default part 
defaultinto an 
defaultincentive-based system; absolutely.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ28 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default So you are moving away from
default a needs system.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: 
defaultThe needs system is built into the baseline, but where you move from there is incentive-
defaultbased, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ29 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default If you do that, would it not follow that over time
default those authorities that have great needs but limited opportunities will 
defaultcontinue to have less money to spend and those areas that have limited needs but huge opportunities—like, for example
default, Oxfordshire with its house building—will continue to do better?  Is that not the obvious 
defaulttrend that will result?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: No.  I would argue that is an unfair assessment of some of the authorities
default.
default 
default When I meet local authorities, whether it is from the north-west, the north-east, the midlands or a
defaultnywhere else
default, they 
defaulttalk about wanting
default opportunities for growth, and what they can do to see businesses grow and 
defaultdevelop business
default.  T
defaulthere is a real appetite for that
default out there, and if they do that and they drive forward with that, they will see 
defaultthe benefit.  
defaultIn my area, where we have big issues with 
defaultdeprivation 
defaultin a couple of wards, 
defaultthe energy industry is driving the economy forward; in parts of the 
defaultn
defaultorth
default-e
defaultast 
defaultthere is a similar effect. 
defaultI do
default not necessarily think just because a 
defaultcouncil has in the past relied purely on a
default needs-based formula that they should not be able to be incentivised by a growth formula.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ30 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default I am perfectly happy to accept that
default councils may seriously underestimate the economic opportunities they have 
defaultin front of them, but there are certain areas of the country that
default every economist would acknowledge offer greater opportunities than others—say, for example, the s
defaultouth
default-e
defaultast compared
default with the north-east.  That will continue to be the case regardless, won’t it
default?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: Do
default not forget that there is a baseline, so it is
default about the growth that they show.  Some areas of the south-east would argue that there is a limited amount of space 
defaultfor them to grow business rates because they
default have so much there in the first place, whereas other parts of the country 
defaultthat have not got so much have more room for growth and
default to develop more space for businesses.  That argument can be played 
defaulteither way round, and I have heard authorities
default make that both ways.  You have to also bear in mind, as I say, that it starts with a baseline that does build in needs through the 
defaultfour bands.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ31 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default With regard to timing now, the settlement was announced over the
default Christmas period and local authorities, many of whom are now making 
defaulteconomies by closing down over the
default Christmas period, had 17 days 
defaultto respond.  Why was it done like that?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: We do the settlement
default after the autumn statement.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ32 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default Was it because
default the autumn statement was so late?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: Yes.  
defaultActually, it 
defaultwas
default 
defaulta pretty similar
default timeframe to the year before.  Bear in mind this year was much easier for authorities, because the previous year we gave a two-year 
defaultindication, and t
defaulth
defaulte changes 
defaultthat came 
defaultthrough this year from the
default original indication were generally beneficial for them, so authorities had a pretty good 
defaultlead-in time this 
defaultyear
default.  
defaultIn t
defaulthe same
default way, this year we have given them an indication 
defaultfor next year.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ33 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default But 
defaultyou have been a council leader yourself; you would have preferred probably more lead-in.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: 
defaultI do appreciate authorities make the case 
defaultthey would like the settlement earlier.  I have absolute sympathy with
default why they want that, which is why last year we gave them effectively a year’s 
defaultnotice.  To me, it is difficult for them to argue this year 
defaultthey did not have enough notice when
default 
defaultthey
default had about a year’s notice. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ34 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default What about the council tax referendum threshold?  
defaultThat 
defaultis
default quite critical, and it is something that has been quite confused 
defaultin recent years.  Could you not have 
defaultestablished that earlier?  That was irrespective of the numbers the Budget 
defaultcame up with, 
defaultwasn’t it
default?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: We gave an indication it certainly will not be more than 2%.  We
default will make a final decision and a recommendation to Parliament very shortly.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ35 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default Why is it not possible to do it earlier?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: Through the consultation,
default we have had representations—
defaultJohn Pugh:default 
defaultWell, b
defaultegin the consultation earlier.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: We cannot 
defaultstart 
defaultthe
default consultation until after we have done the draft settlement.  T
defaulthrough that consultation, we had representations 
defaultabout 
defaultthe
default referendum level.  Last year, there was a variation in the 
defaultreferendum 
defaultprinciple
default levels for some authorities because of the de 
defaultminimis
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ36 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default 
defaultThere was confusion about the referendum threshold, wasn’t there?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: Last year, it was local authorities
default who argued for de 
defaultminimis
default, which we put in, which was welcomed by 
defaultthose 
defaultauthorities
default.  This year
default, there have been authorities making a case for a lower referendum threshold 
defaultthan 2%, and we are looking at that.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ37 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Minister, is the Local Government Association accurate when it says that the cut in central funding for council tax support to 2016 “could be as much as £
default1 
defaultbillion”?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: The Local Government Association has from time t
defaulto
default time made claims
default about what it thinks might happen.  In the past, local authorities have made claims about 
defaultthe council tax freeze grant.  They 
defaulthave 
defaultargue
defaultd
default there is a cliff edge
default because of where they think that will end.  That is why this year we have made it very clear that it is in the baseline, so there 
defaultis not this cliff edge coming, but it would
default also be a bit beyond my purview to go beyond the 
defaultspending round.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ38 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default What 
defaultis 
defaultyour estimate of what it is, then?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: As
default I 
defaultsay, we have given the settlement this year; we have given an indication of next year.  I am not going to be 
defaultjudging now what might happen in the settlement after that, but we have rolled
default the freeze grant into the baseline so that we avoid the cliff edge that some authorities thought they might face if they took the council tax freeze grant.
default That simply is not there now
default.  Coming b
defaultack to the point Dr Pugh made about 
defaultthe referend
defaultums 
defaultlevels, the Government would really like all authorities to take the freeze grant and freeze the council tax to help people.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ39 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Let us, Minister, turn to what 
defaultwas the Social Fund, which has been devolved to local authorities.  Could you just very 
defaultbriefly give the Committee a flavour of what 
defaultvulnerable 
defaultpeople use
default crisis loans and community care grants for?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: It would be
default a 
defaultrange of 
defaultthings
default.  A lot of authorities 
defaulthave 
defaultnot had it taken up fully, but it
default would be for a range of things, around needing money in an emergency for whatever it 
defaulthappens to be for that
default particular person at that particular time in that area.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ40 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default So people
default needing a cooker because it is broken, 
defaultor something like that
default, to be able to warm up food to be able to feed the children.  Things like that.  
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: It could be a 
defaultw
defaulthole
default range of things.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ41 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Yes.  Like that
default.  Vulnerable people in real need.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: 
defaultYes.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ42 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default 
defaultI am right in saying the Government passed the responsibility for this 
defaulttype 
defaultof safety net 
defaultdown to local 
defaultauthorities 
defaultto administer
default.  They reduced the amount.  It was £175 
defaultmillion in 2013-2014; it has gone down to
default £172 million in 2014-2015.  The Government said at the time when they 
defaultintroduced this and
default 
defaultpassed it to local authorities that they would carry out an assessment
default after the first 12 months, but you now know, as I do, that just before Christmas the Government announced that 
defaultthey were stopping funding it
default completely.  That is right, isn’t it?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: Yes.  The Department 
defaultfor 
defaultWork and Pensions made that
default announcement a couple of weeks ago.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ43 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default So local authorities have to
default fund that £172 million or £174 million now, do they?
default  
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: Yes, although some local authorities, including some of the larger ones, were finding that they were not using it, and they were closing the schemes; they were not getting the call for it
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ44 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default So there was a 
defaultdemand
default for £178
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion-worth of
default—
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: 
defaultI do not know what the actual demand was, but I know it was not the full amount.  
default&#xa0;defaultQ45 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default We know
default what it was from when the DWP administered it.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: 
defaultI know what the DWP had allowed for it, but I believe there were some authorities that were not using the full amount.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ46 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default 
defaultBut we know what the demand was.  
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: We know what the 
defaultclaim levels
default were, yes.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ47 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default So it has gone from
default £178
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion, or around that figure, in parts of the country to zero.  T
defaulthat is
default what you are claiming, is it?  
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I have not got the
default exact figures in front of me, so I am 
defaultnot going to pre-judge.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ48 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Fair enough.  Would you not share my view that government—whether it be
default central or local—should really be the crisis-lender of last resort 
defaultfor vulnerable people?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: Again, what local authorities do
default has to be decided according to what they feel the priorities are for their 
defaultlocal areas.  It is one of the reasons
default that local authorities now have that 
defaultgeneral power of competence to look at
default what they think is right for their area.  They have also to bear in mind 
defaultwe are all living in a fiscal
default envelope in which we are still dealing with the debt and deficit of the last Government, and that has to be paid down.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ49 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default By vulnerable people.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: By
default all of us
default, unfortunately.  The previous Government spent money it did not have, and we now have to make cuts in the expenditure of central Government 
defaultto get that deficit down. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSimon Danczuk:default By vulnerable people not being able to get a cooker
default to be able to warm food to feed their children.  
defaultThey have to
default help pay the deficit down.  
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: That is not what I said, 
defaultMr Danczuk.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ50 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Minister, you said that some local authorities
default,
default spending only 1% of the money given to them by central Government
default,
default will choose, and have already chosen—and they have, because I have done research on this—not to provide this 
defaulthelp 
defaultat all.  They are not being the crisis-lender of last
default resort, so some people will not get any help whatsoever, and you are comfortable with that.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I would make the point that
default local authorities have a duty to their local communities.  If, in a local community, there is a n
defaulteed for that, those councillors in 
defaultthat authority 
defaultshould
default look at what the priorities are 
defaultfor 
defaulttheir 
defaultlocal authority
default and how they spend their budget accordingly
default.
default  That is a matter for the local authority.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ51 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default The only alternative for
default many vulnerable people as a result of this change in policy—and you have decided 
defaultnot eve
defaultn
default to assess it before the time is up on it
default—will be payday lenders.  What the Government 
defaulthave effectively done in many parts of the coun
defaultt
defaultry is privatise
default—because these are private companies—crisis-lending 
defaultto vulnerable
default people.  That is a fair assessment, isn’t it?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: No, I would not agree 
defaultwith 
defaultthat.  As I
default say, it is a matter of the priorities that are decided on by the local authority and the councillors on those local authorities.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ52 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Would you 
defaultgive a
default guarantee that all
default local authorities will provide some sort of support?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I can
defaultnot give that guarantee, 
defaultbecause
default that is a matter for the local authorities.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ53 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default Minister, can I take you back to 
defaultconversations i
defaultn the autumn statement for
default 2012
default?  I am particularly thinking about the business
default 
defaultrate relief.  There have now been other statements for 2013 as well.  Very understandably and, from my point of view, laudably, the 50% relief for small businesses was extended and it has been a great success, but at the time councils had budgeted for that money to come in and out of their coffers and it stopped.  The councils
default are still waiting for
default that agreed amount of money to come back in.  Are you any closer to being able 
defaultto give a date when 70% 
defaultof it 
defaultor 90% of it might come their way?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I cannot give 
defaultyou a date now, but, if you will allow me, I will write to you on that.  
defaultHeather Wheeler:default Thank you very much indeed.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ54 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default 
defaultThe business 
defaultrates retention scheme
default 
defaultwas introduced
default to incentivise local authorities to promote business and economic growth 
defaultin their area, 
defaultbut, 
defaultaccording to the LGA, 
defaultless than a third of councils believe that the business
default 
defaultrate retention scheme provides sufficient incentives
default.  What do you say to that?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: The proof will be in the 
defaultpudding over the next couple of years.  We will get the first full set of NNDR figures at the end of this week—so the business rates take-up.  I appreciate there will be local authorities who would argue they would like a bigger share of the pie, but, again, we are working in a constrained
default fiscal environment.  I
defaultt is an incentive for them.  If they get
default growth from business, they will get the benefit through more income through the business rates.  
defaultThere is an incentive there, and my hope is that 
defaultauthorities 
defaultwill
default seize that and take advantage of it.  When I meet local authorities, a large number of them are very keen on moving forward with that, but, 
defaultlike any organisation, they
default would like to move further and faster.  
defaultI have great 
defaultrespect for that, but we are all working in constrained 
defaultfiscal environments.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ55 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default Why should
defaultn’t
default we just move to
default the point where all business rates growth is retained?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: There is 
defaultjust 
defaulta pretty simple 
defaultanswer to that, which is that 
defaultthat has an impact on public e
defaultxpenditure
default, and it is unrealistic to 
defaultthink that central Government and the Treasury are not going to want to make sure that we have a grip 
defaulton that kind of expenditure.  To see it move
default much beyond where it is now in the near future, while 
defaultwe are where we are economically—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ56 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default 
defaultBut would you not agree with me that if you did move towards the local authorities being able to retain the whole amount, t
defaulthat would be a real incentive for 
defaultthem to promote economic growth, 
defaultwhich would then
default benefit the wider economy?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: That is a fair point.  It depends
default on how you do it, in the sense that if every local authority kept its entire business rates for its area, then that 
defaultgoes even further down the road in terms of the
default equalisation of the funding that goes to authorities.  C
defaultertain authorities
default who have a massive business rates income, 
defaultsuch as those around where we are sitting right now, 
defaultwould be at a massive advantage to 
defaultauthorities in more rural areas, more deprived areas or areas of lower business levels.  That is why we have set the baseline and then it is 
defaultabout growth.  It is not just giving people the benefit of the businesses they have already got; it is incentivising them to get the benefit from growth.  As I
default say, some form 
defaultof long-term control over local 
defaultgovernment finance
default from the centre is not entirely unrealistic in the sense of where we are 
defaulteconomically.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ57 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultHeyesdefault:default Just to 
defaultfollow up on what were you were saying then, whether the councils keep the entire business rates
default or it is just a ma
defaultt
defaultter of growth, how do you square that
default with the fact that the Prime Minister this morning announced that the Federation of Small Businesses is going to act to reduce the business 
defaultrate burden?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: We are say
defaulti
defaultng to local authorities, “If you
default develop more businesses, you will benefit from business rate growth”.  
defaultDavid defaultHeyesdefault:default 
defaultBut t
defaulthe 
defaultPrime 
defaultMinister
default is going to cut the amount of business rates and therefore cut the resources that are available to local authorities.  
defaultChair:default We will have to suspend the session.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultSitting suspended for a Division in the House. 
default              
defaultOn resuming—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ58 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default David, do you
default just want to repeat the question that you raised and then we will carry on 
defaultfrom there?
defaultDavid defaultHeyesdefault:default 
defaultYes.  
defaultAll 
defaultof 
defaultthese
default discussions about devolving power to local areas in one way or 
defaultanother seem to hinge on the idea of giving greater power over business rates, and retaining a greater amount of the business rates within the local community.  That seems to me
default 
defaultnot 
defaultto sit well with the Prime Minister’s
default announcement this morning that central Government under him would act 
defaultto reduce business rates.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: There are a couple of things.  Local authorities
default have the power now to offer business rates discounts if they want to and if they feel they can afford
default it.  We part-fund that.  The idea
default behind that, just briefly, is they might want to use that to incentivise businesses to come in and get going, 
defaultand then eventually 
defaultthey 
defaultbenefit from the business rates down the line
default; it is an investment
default.  What the Prime Minister was referring to
default particularly focused on the package that was announced in the autumn statement, around the £1,000 discount, which is particularly beneficial for high streets and town centres; the small-
defaultbusiness rate relief
default; and the re-occupation 
defaultrelief that will come in
default.  T
defaulthat is
default central Government funded, so the local authorities will not 
defaultlose out from that.  They 
defaultcould 
defaultactually 
defaultbenefit
default.  O
defaultnce we get those business
defaultes in and once they get going, they can benefit 
defaultin the long run.  
defaultChair:default We 
defaultare going to 
defaulthave to
default suspend again; I am sorry.  
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultSitting suspended for a Division in the House. 
default              
defaultOn resuming—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ59 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Minister, for the third time, could
default you have a go at answering the question from 
defaultDavid 
defaultHeyes
default?  
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I think I had kind of finished
default answering, but yes, I will.  I would also just like to take the opportunity to say—these breaks do give me an opportunity to double-check things—just in terms of Mrs Wheeler’s query around the business rates money coming back to local authorities, b
defaulty the time she gets
default the letter from me explaining it, the authorities will probably 
defaultalready have had the letter giving 
defaultthem 
defaultthe details
default, but I will write to her.  It is imminent; it is 
defaultalready signed off.  
defaultThe point I was making to Mr 
defaultHeyes
default is that the Prime Minister was referring to the package that was put out 
defaultas part of the 
defaultautumn statement
default that
default is central Government funded.  There is a £1,000 discount for 
defaultsmall businesses, in particular in the
default retail sector and the high-street, town-centre 
defaultsector.  It is a really good thing 
defaultthat 
defaultthe
default Government has been able to recognise business rates are a pressure on businesses.  There is also a discount in there 
defaultfor getting businesses and properties back into use for
default 18 months.  That is a really good thing.  Yes, that does mean there is a discount 
defaulton those business rates
default, which is central Government funded for that period, but then 
defaultafter that, there is a chance for those businesses to survive.  It just
default gives them that opportunity to have that bit of pump-priming, for want of a better phrase.  There was a really good 
defaultpackage of things in there that 
defaultdo 
defaultnot cost local government
default but could well be quite a good stimulus for local government to benefit from in the 
defaultmedium term and, 
defaultindeed, the long term as well.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ60 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Minister, finally, I will come on to the
default issue of 2.3% once again, which was the figure the Chancellor used in the spending review as to 
defaulthow much spending for local government will fall
default in 2015-2016, a figure that the Prime Minister then 
defaultrepeated on 
defaultSunday Politics
default in October.  I have raised this
default with the Prime Minister; he referred me to the Chief Secretary, who told me it would all be 
defaultrevealed when the local government finance settlement was announced.  You
default said the same when you came to the Committee.  At the time of the finance settlement, you said that you would write to me with the 
defaultfigure explaining how
default the 2.3% 
defaulthad been calculated and put the figures in the Library.  We have not seen anything 
defaultyet. 
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I will chase up the letter.  I think it might 
defaultbe on 
defaultits way to you, but
default I will chase that up and 
defaultmake sure you have 
defaultthat.  I will do everything I can to make sure you have 
defaultit this week.  What I can say is the Treasury
default’s local authority spending figure—the 2.3% you referred to—which was published back in June was 
defaultan approximation of the total
default potential amount of funding available to councils 
defaultin 2015-2016
default.  At 
defaultthe Department
default, we publish spending-power figures when we do the assessment in December; 
defaultthat in itself is based on the latest information and our methodology. 
default 
defaultThis
default year, it is 2.9% on average, and next year it will be 1.8%.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ61 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default It would be
default 
defaultinteresting
default to know how the 2.3% was calculated.  
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I see your point.
defaultChair:default Yes.  The Treasury must have had
default a way of calculating it; it cannot have been a figure they plucked out of thin air, presumably.  To see that figure and
default 
defaultthe calculations 
defaultwould be helpful.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I will chase up the letter.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ62 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Just in terms of
default the way figures for local government spending are dealt with in general terms, y
defaultou 
defaultsaid 
defaultpreviously
default that local government spending has gone up this year.  It has gone up because 
defaultpublic health
default 
defaultis included in the figures, has
defaultn’t
default it
default, and for 
defaultno other reason
default?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: 
defaultSpending power covers the money the local authorities have influence over and decisions over 
defaultin terms of the s
defaultp
defaultend
default within their local communities.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ63 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But spending
default would have gone down if public health was not included.  Is that 
defaultright?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: I would have to chec
defaultk
default that.  I 
defaultwould 
defaultnot want to
default give you a definitive answer on that, because it depends on how the business rates retention works in.  I am 
defaultnot sure, but I can confirm that for you.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ64 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Right.  You can
default 
defaulthave a look at it.  
defaultW
defaulte see figures
default about local government spend in future years, but they include, don’t they, this NHS money of 
default£1.1
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion next year and £3.8
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion the year after
default?
default  It is interesting
default that those figures also appear in the NHS spending 
defaultfigures.  They are there to fulfil the Government’s 
defaultcommitment 
defaultto 
defaultkeep NHS spending at least level 
defaultin rea
defaultl terms, but they are also being
default used
default at the 
defaultsame time to show that local government spending is not going down by as much.  
defaultIs that not double counting?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: No, it is not.  It is just showing what is available for a local authority to have influence and decisions over.  One of the things I would stress and, while I am on the record, I think 
defaultit 
defaultis a really important point to make, is that the local authorities are involved in the Better Care Fund negotiations at the moment—I have been very open about this; so has Norman Lamb, the Minister at Health I am working with on this—to make sure that we get something different, that it is a proper partnership, and that the local authorities are involved in the decision
default 
defaultmaking and involved in the planning of the service that is going to be there.  That is not just because they have influence over it, but also because it is how we get the better outcome in the end.
default  It is a really important shift, and it is a massive opportunity for
default local government to show that local government is a vehicle that can facilitate bringing the public sector 
defaulttogether in a way we have not been able to achieve 
defaultas widely as some of us would have liked in the past.  Community budgets have proven it works.  T
defaulthe 
defaulttransformation 
defaultnetwork is
default taking that further forward.  The Better Care Fund is a 
defaultmassive opportunity for local government
default to really step up and prove that.

defaultQ65 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Minister, I was not taking
default any issue with the policy, which I think is a 
defaultvery good idea to try to join 
defaultu
defaultp the approach.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: 
defaultNo, I appreciate that, but it is part of what local authorities will have—that influence and decision-making power.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ66 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Is it 
defaultreasonable
default and fair accounting practice to include
default that amount of money both in the NHS spend and in the local government spend 
defaultin the same set of accounts?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: It is NHS money, but it is local authorities
default who will be involved in the planning of it and decisions about how it is spent.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ67 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultYes, but it 
defaultcannot be 
defaultshown 
defaulttwice in the 
defaultaccounts
default.  Is that fair?  
defaultIs that not trying to get the same sum of money and saying, “It is there for NHS purposes because it justifies the policy there, and 
defaultthen we include it
default in the local government spend as well”?  It 
defaultcannot be both.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: No, because 
defaultwe are not saying 
defaultlocal 
defaultgovernment 
defaultspending power
default is the grant money central Government gives just to local government and is not part of anything else; s
defaultpending power 
defaultoutlines 
defaultthe
default money that is spent in a local area that a local authority makes decisions on or has influence over.  T
defaulthat has not changed.  That 
defaultB
defaultette
defaultr
default Care Fund will be 
defaultan increasingly important part of that, particularly for the authorities dealing with adult social care.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ68 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default It is true, is it, therefore, that
default in terms of local government spending power, that 
defaultsame amount 
defaultof 
defaultmoney is included
default under local government spending and under NHS spending?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: It is included in the spending power.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default And it
default is included in the NHS budget as well.  It is the same money.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: It is part of the NHS budget, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ69 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default I apologise for not being here when we were talking about the
default allocation of resources.  My understanding for 2015-2016 is that for 
defaultLondon
default councils the New Homes Bonus is being 
defaultincluded in their spending power, but for the rest of the
default country it is not.  Can you explain the inconsistency 
defaultin that approach?
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: It is being spent across 
defaultLondon
default 
defaultthrough 
defaultthe
default local enterprise partnership.  In the rest of the country, that money has gone back into the local authorities following the consultation over the summer.  I am not quite sure 
defaultwhat you mean in terms of spending power.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ70 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default My understanding is
default that what is being talked about for 
defaultLondon
default authorities in terms of their spending power 
defaultincludes New Homes Bonus money
default for 2015-2016.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: The New Homes Bonus
default is in the spending power for all authorities.  The difference in 
defaultLondon
default is that, 
defaultin other areas, the New Homes Bonus money
default goes back to that district authority or that local council; in 
defaultLondon
default it is pooled 
defaultthrough the LEP, because 
defaultLondon
default 
defaulthas
default a
default rather unique structure—
defaultin terms of how it delivers housing
default.  
defaultLondon
default is 
defaultpooled, and the team in 
defaultLondon
default are working together at the moment to get the right structure to govern how they spend that, with all the local authorities 
defaultin 
defaultLondon
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ71 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default That then gives an inconsistent pattern
default.  When the figures are being looked at in terms of how much reduction there is, given that 
defaultthe 
defaultLondon
default authorities
default will have no control over that money whatsoever, their spending power has been reduced even more than the figures would 
defaultpurport to suggest.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: 
defaultNo, t
defaulthat is not 
defaultnecessarily 
defaultthe case.
default  
defaultIt is money for 
defaultLondon
default 
defaultauthorities.  It will go into 
defaultLondon
default; it will be spent in 
defaultLondon
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ72 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default 
defaultBut the local authority will not have the power to spend that money.  That 
defaultis the key.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: It depends on what the final structure is, but they 
defaultmay well 
defaultbe
default involved in deciding how that money is spent.  They have 
defaultnot decided that yet.  It depends on
default how they structure what they do, but it will not be for the individual local authorities, no, because it has been 
defaultpooled.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ73 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default 
defaultThat is correct.  So it is different.  
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: 
defaultIt is different in 
defaultLondon
default.
default&#xa0;defaultQ74 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default 
defaultA local authority outside 
defaultLondon
default 
defaultwould 
defaulth
defaultave their spending power reflected
default with the New Homes Bonus money allocated to them to spend 
defaultas they wish, but that will not be the case for 
defaultLondon
default local authorities.  For example, 
defaultif 
defaultthey
default wanted to take that money and use it for another purpose, my understanding is they are not able to do that.  
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: It will be up to the enterprise
default partnership how they spend the 
defaultmoney because it has been pooled.  It will be spent in London by London
default authorities, but it will not be under the control of the individual authority.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ75 default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default This London-wide body could decide to spend all the money
default in one borough in east 
defaultLondon
default, and that would be fine.  A
defaultll the
default rest of the 
defaultLondon
default authorities would 
defaultlose out, and that would be perfectly okay, but the spending
default power would not be there for another 
defaultLondon
default authority.  That is the 
defaultkey issue.
defaultBrandon Lewisdefault: In theory, 
defaultI assume 
defaultthat is technically possible, but it depends on how they
default get the governance structure set up in 
defaultLondon
default to make the decisions.  I 
defaultdo not think there are any local 
defaultauthorities in London that I have met—I have met most of the London authorities over the last few weeks—who have fears over 
defaultone body deciding to spend all the money in one 
defaultauthority that they are not happy with.  It is about recognising the issue of that duty to co-operate to make sure you get the money for the 
defaulthousing structure spent correctl
defaulty
default in 
defaultLondon
default.  
defaultLondon
default is
default being treated differently from the rest of the country, because 
defaultLondon
default has a 
defaultunique structure compared 
defaultwith 
defaultthe rest of the coun
defaultt
defaultry.
defaultChair:default Minister, thank you
default very much indeed for coming back for a third time to see us this afternoon.  T
defaulthank you very much.
