Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?[bold]Does the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?[bold]Has AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?[bold]Do the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or [bold]weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change? [bold]What implications do the IPCC’s conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report have for policy making both nati[bold]onally and internationally?
