defaultThe UK is failing to deliver on its potential for CCS. Past momentum has been lost, policy ambition has been reduced, and high quality projects have been cancelled.
default1.3
default              
defaultThe current package of the UK CCS Commercialisation Programme, plus Electricity Market Reform (EMR), plus emissions waivers is at extreme risk of repeating past failings. An overly narrow focus, with slow ‘delivery’ of one or at most two projects this decade will not succeed in achieving even DECC’s own limited stated aims for the Commercialisation Programme and CCS roadmap.

defaultRapid progress occurring in the USA, Canada, and China, highlights that additional attention must be given to parallel enabling actions.

defaultActions are required to build pipeline and shipping infrastructures for broader CCS deployment and cost reduction; and to take liability for stored CO

defaultSuccessful results need to focus on 
defaulttimely partnership
default, not assessment, enabling better connections within DECC, and across HM Government. 
default2.1 
default              
defaultScottish Carbon Capture and Storage (
defaultSCCS
default)
default is the largest carbon capture and storage research group in the UK. With internationally renowned researchers and state-of-the-art facilities, we are unique in our connected strength across the full CCS chain
default,
default ranging from capture engineering and geoscience to public engagement, policy and economics. 
defaultFounded in 2005, SCCS 
defaultworks
default with universities 
defaultand researchers 
defaultacross Scotland. SCCS is funded by 
defaultthe Scottish Funding Council (SFC) and the Energy Technology Partnership (ETP).
default2.2
default              
defaultSCCS highlights three areas, believed to be of particular importance for the Committee’s consideration: 
default2.3
default              
defaultSCCS can provide impartial evidence on these or other questions. 
default3.1
default              
defaultCCS in the UK emerged in 1996, when Norway started to inject CO
default2
default for storage. In 2003 the first commercial evaluation was made (Grangemouth-Forties), in 2005 CCS became G8 policy, in 2007 the UK first competition started, and in 2013 the UK is still at least 4 years away from its first project. The UK still has the best combination of geological, engineering, industrial and academic capabilities in the whole of Europe, together with a professed policy commitment to reduce CO
default2
default emissions and the foundational legislative framework required for CO
default2
default storage. This confluence of factors has succeeded in attracting the proposals of over 50% of Europe’s CCS projects. But this enthusiasm has now been stifled via repeated bureaucratic ‘competition’ processes.
default3.2
default              
defaultWhile other EU member states have focused efforts on individual projects, 
defaultthe UK 
defaulthas been
default unique in operating a formal and bureaucratic process, which is named “competition”, but is actually a national procurement. This has proven to be slow, demoralising, inaccurate and ineffective at delivering a result.
default3.3
default              
defaultSince 2007, 
defaultcommercial CCS projects 
defaultin the UK have been
default mired in government bureaucracy, stifled by immensely detailed and slow examination of “competition” proposals. 
defaultRequirements to tender for funding support have been more effective at killing off projects and frustrating international project consortia than they have been at securing investment. The current commercialisation programme could have secured a ‘pipeline’ of projects for the coming decade in pursuit of the stated outcome of cost-competitive CCS. This is now at risk. 
default3.4
default              
defaultThe Commercialisation Programme saw a speedy beginning but now faces a drawn out process before funding can be confirmed for none, one, or both of the preferred projects (Peterhead and White Rose). 
default3.5
default              
defaultThe inclusion of Contracts for Difference for CCS within EMR should in theory provide a route to market for these and other well-developed projects, but insufficient details have been provided. 
defaultIt appears that CCS pricing is bottom of the list for DECC, compared to a diverse portfolio of renewables producing intermittent generation, new-build nuclear power which appears likely to be extraordinarily expensive, and permission for unabated gas
default – which removes any driver for CCS
default.
default3.6
default              
defaultThe outcome to date is that there appears to be no visible prospect of any further CCS projects accessing CfDs during the first period of the Levy Control Framework out to 2021. Competition is the ultimate intent of EMR – but seems at present to be not an available option.
default3.7
default              
defaultThis means that the reserve projects (Teesside and Captain) and the previously de-selected (but still EU-funded) Don Valley project have no current means of accessing financial support and are at severe risk of cancellation.
default3.8
default              
defaultThe UK currently plans to support development of just one, perhaps two, commercial projects. These will start operation no earlier than 2017, and possibly several years later, to deliver about 0.8 to 1.0 GW of generation capacity. 
default3.9
default              
defaultFitting 
defaultCCS 
defaultto
default the majority of existing, and projected future new-build, fossil fuel plant, will be limited by the practical build-rate. That can be estimated from prior experience in the 1990s “dash for gas”. 
default3.10
default              
defaultCalculating back from 
defaultthe 
default2030 
defaulttarget 
defaultshows that at least 5 GW of CCS generation capacity should be operating by 2020
default, as shown in Figure 1 below
default. Storage capacity must be identified to commercial quality standard 
defaultbefore
default each of these projects commences. Consequently it is necessary to prove about 3 Gigatonnes of CO
default2
default storage for decisions in 2025. 
defaultPresent UK actions are about 100x too slow
default (Fig.1).

default, 
defaultthe developers

defaultto have clear sight of the CfD value

default and timescale. Th
defaultis
default has been persistently not available during the past 12 months, and consequently these project teams have been, and continue to be, progressively dismantled. 
default3.12
default              
defaultIf these three dormant projects were enacted rapidly, by means of CfD decisions, or even strongly worded letters of comfort, then the UK would immediately be back on track towards
default 5GW CCS construction by 2020
default, giving learning cycles and cost reduction to help full CCS rollout by 2030.
defaultThe current lack of planning, and especially lack of action, for what happens to complementary projects during and after the CCS competition seems destined to produce a very small number of expensive tests, which have minimal connection towards incentivising and developing a new CCS industry in the UK.  The UK should also be aware that the EU 
defaultmay
default enact some CCS

default support mechanism to 
defaultsurmount the
default EU-ETS, that may not fit well with UK-centric policies.

default3.14
default              
defaultBeyond the commercialisation programme, the UK does not currently have a credible plan to secure the wider deployment of CCS on key industrial sectors. Neither does it have a strategy for accelerating the enabling infrastructure of CO
default2
default transport and storage that will be required for cost reduction, de-risking of investments, and the achievement of economies of scale. A proactive approach that seeks to use existing low-cost, high-value sources of CO
default2
default (SCCS research) as a means of developing transport and storage is urgent and essential. This will require the Office of CCS within DECC to proactively link between Government Departments
default.

default (SCCS research).
default 
defaultThese fundamental sectors are unfunded.  
default4.1
default              
defaultIt would appear at first glance that the UK fares no worse than other EU member states in its failure to deliver CCS projects. However in reality the UK is only winning in respect of not having grasped its opportunities, and to have seen more projects cancelled than the rest of Europe put together. This is not a good advertisement for the UK being the ‘first choice for investment in CCS’ with four large projects that the coalition government initially claimed to be aiming for.
default4.2
default              
defaultBeyond Europe, efforts on 
defaultCCS 
defaultare now showing practical progress 
defaultin the USA
default,
default in Canada, and China. 
defaultThe f
defaultailure of 
defaultEuropean multi-party fun
defaultding mechanisms and carbon pricing
default mean
defaults
default that Europe may now lag 10 years behind
default in its ability to construct and utilise CO
default2
default transport and storage infrastructures and geologies. This will have 
defaultconsequent impacts on 
defaultEU
default ability to deve
defaultlop profitable new technologies 
defaultand 
defaultretain industrial production capacity
default.
default4.3
default              
defaultIn 
defaultAustralia
default, the 
defaultlack of
default a
default stable policy has failed to develop commercial projects
default at the scale previously envisaged
default.
default 
defaultPolicy uncertainty, combined with equivocation of funding, is most like the UK. A world leading research industry has 
defaulthowever been developed with CO2CRC 
defaultforming and funding Uni
defaultversity industry partnerships. Additionally, the Gorgon LNG project (the world’s largest) is integrating CO
default2
default capture and storage from gas processing operations. This points again to the benefit of encouraging low-cost, high-value CCS projects.
default4.4
default              
defaultThe USA has been most successful in progressing CCS from concept, through research
default,
default to commercial reality. The Department of Energy formulated a multi-year
default strategic plan:
default4.5
default              
defaultCrucial differences between th
defaulte USA CCS process and the UK are:
default 
default4.6
default              
defaultCanada has maintained an effort on CCS research for many years. Strong groups have been persistent in University of Regina on 
defaults
defaulttorage, and in Ottawa CANMET on capture. 
default4.7
default              
defaultProvinces have great political and fiscal autonomy, 
defaultand
default Saskatchewan, Alberta, 
defaultand
default British Columbia have enact
defaulted
default targeted carbon taxes 
defaultand / or a form of Emissions Performance Standard 
defaulton power production. 
default4.8
default              
defaultThis has catalysed industrial engagement, most notably by SaskPower at Boundary Dam where the world's first CCS retrofit onto an operating (brown) coal power plant is completing construction, and will be operating commercially from 
defaultend
default 2013. This project uses existing industrial components, and is being delivered for less than the projected price
default; the next project will be 30% less again
default. 
default4.9
default              
defaultIn Alberta the QUEST project will reduce emissions from Shell’s oil sand upgrading operations; the ACTL pipeline will transport captured CO
default2
default to sites of use for Enhanced Oil Recovery and geological storage. 
default4.10
default              
defaultAll these projects have been enabled by company partnerships with very large, and timely, provincial funding, with
default some federal support.
default The Canadian experience has been marked by a willingness to make sure that agreements are reached; with state-owned utilities and private companies both displaying a willingness to invest due to the need to reduce emissions to maintain operations.
default4.11
default              
defaultChina has for many years maintained a watching brief on CCS, well aware of its position as the globally largest source of CO
default2
default, with poor air quality, and reliance on coal. About 20 CCS experiments on capture, transport, and injection have been undertaken in China within the last five years. 
default4.12
default              
defaultIn 
defaultApril
default 2013, the Chinese central government issued a statement requesting all provinces to make plans for CCS enactment in the next five-year plan
default. Historical precedents, and SCCS current research participation with China, strongly suggest that rigidly enforced top-down policy, combined with bottom-up 
defaultp
defaultrovincial and local creativity and business insight, will start planning of specific CCS projects in 2014, and construction of commercial CCS projects in 2015. This method of operation decide-announce-control, is unlike the UK market system with its plethora of actors, but will achieve extremely rapid results.
default4.13
default              
defaultUK-funded efforts continue to have influence in China. The NZEC process continues to limp along, but a more recent project funded by British Embassy Beijing has helped Shaanxi province to identify low-cost, high-value CCS options that would link Methanol production to CO
default2
default-EOR. (It is ironic that no similar strategic project has been undertaken in the UK or Europe).
default5.1
default              
defaultAs a consequence of past failures, DECC is currently overly focussed on delivering none, one (or possibly two) projects. This will not be sufficient to achieve DECC’s own (limited) stated goals for CCS. New, parallel, initiatives are required to address key barriers to investment and re-create momentum for CCS deployment. Also required are greater clarity on decarbonisation objectives, and a pathway for the deployment of CCS on gas-fired power stations (rather than a licence to continue un-abated). These tonnages of CO
default2
default provide a clearer market driver for CCS and infrastructure deployment into the next decade.
default5.2
default              
defaultIn
default light of the above reflections, it is possible to identify a set of actions that would help secure the wider deployment of CCS in the UK, and assist the achievement of DECC’s own stated aims on cost reduction and deployment potential. These must include both practical measures and improved policy incentives.
default5.3
default              
defaultIt is increasingly recognised that access to CO
default2
default transport and storage is an essential enabler of the cost-effective deployment of
default CCS at scale. Projects in the USA and Canada have been able to move forward more rapidly in part due to the existence of CO
default2 
defaultpipelines and readily available storage options as a result of decades of experience with CO
default2
default-EOR. 
defaultWhat will make UK actors invest in transport, when there is no stated ambition of CCS-CO
default2
default for 2025, or 2030?
default5.4
default              
defaultThe UK’s CCS Cost Reduction Taskforce
default has highlighted the importance of access to CO
default2
default transport and storage as an essential means of both reducing capital costs and effective de-risking of investment for follow-on projects
default.

default

defaultarly efforts to prove and validate this CO

default 
default and by recent studies on behalf of specific industry sectors.
default 
default5.7
default 
default              
defaultThe policy approach to CCS in the UK (and indeed EU) to date has been centred on the power sector as a means of undertaking the demonstration of CCS at commercial scale (via financing support) to be followed by deployment (driven by the carbon price). To date,
default 
defaultin the absence of a clear and enduring business case
default or ambition for captured CO

default5.10
default              
defaultThe UK has immense 
defaultpotential 
defaultvalue in its offshore CO
default2
default storage resource. This comprises about 35% of all CO
default2
default storage for Europe. None of the onshore storage for leading industrial states in Europe is currently available, due to adverse public opinion. Consequently, the UK has a very large opportunity to 
defaultbecome 
defaultthe first developer of commercially proven, secure, and well-licensed CO
default2
default storage for Europe. Crucial gaps 
defaultin enabling this include
default the legal ability to import CO
default2
default for storage from European or other states
default, and liability
default. It is inevitable that the UK state must take long-term ownership of stored CO
default2
default. Transfer of ownership needs to be explicitly guaranteed, and at a date soon after completion of an injection project.
default5.11
default              
defaultI
defaultt is very unclear how this theoretical storage resource will be converted commercially into viable storage reserves. At present the subsurface expertise, 
defaultis 
defaultheld by multinational oil companies
default. This
default is not attracted into UK CO
default2
default storage because of the uncertain investment climate, the lack of guaranteed profitability, and the total lack of forward projections for CO
default2
default supply as a revenue stream. It is possible to envisage state-led investigations
default of storage
default, but this will require hundreds
default of millions,
default o
defaultr
default billions
default,
default of pounds investment during the next decade. 
default5.12
default              
defaultLack of commercially proven storage is likely to become a blockage in approving end-to-end commercial CCS projects. Whoever investigates CO
default2
default storage offshore, it is essential that the data gained are freely available to undertake academic research at no charge, and to be used as incentives to attract investigations by additional developers.
default&#xa0;
default5.13 
default              
defaultContinued inconsistencies between carbon budgets, gas strategy, EMR aims and industrial policy have swamped past signals of a growing market for CCS in the UK. The Office of CCS within DECC is also responsible for fossil fuel policy, but current policy proposals are biased towards continued unabated gas use with CCS noticeable by its absence.
