defaultReasons for homelessness:default trenddefaultSource: P1E statsdefault&#xa0;defaultAt the same time as homelessness due to loss of private rented accommodation is increasing, local authorities are finding it more and 
defaultmore difficult to procure reasonable quality temporary accommodation in and around London. The number of households being place
defaultd in temporary accommodation has continued to increase since 2011 but the availability of 
defaulttemporary private rented accommodation 
defaulthas dropped as private landlords leave the ‘temporary accommodation’ sector for the 
defaultbuoyant
default rental market in the non-benefit sector. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs the proportion of private sector temporary accommodation decreases, l
defaultocal authorities are working hard to maintain the existing supply in a difficult market 
defaultbut
default are increasingly being forced to look out of London.
default The concerns in respect of child safety and welfare in out of borough placements are well documented and of par
defaultamount 
defaultimportance. Local
default authorities are likely to have to meet the shortfalls in rent for families in unaffordable temporary accommodation
default, with 
defaultmore 
defaulthouseholds being moved out of London as the situation is not sustainable. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOptions for local authorities
default are therefore extremely limited, and near non-existent for accommodating larger families.

default accommodation leased 
defaultfrom the
default private rented sector. The government has agreed that when universal credit comes in this management fee will be p
defaultaid  direct to boroughs rather than through Housing Benefit as it is at present. In the meantime, the overall benefit cap means that in many cases the fee is lost, leaving the local authority to cover the costs from their own increasingly limited funds.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultLarger Families and the overall Benefit CapdefaultUnder the 
defaultBenefit C
defaultap, unless they are exempt, families with 
defaultsix
default or more children receive only 50p Housing
default Benefit. Whilst boroughs are working with households to help them get into employment, for single parents with young children, child care costs in 
defaultLondon
default make this very difficult. If the children are at school, part-time employment with hours that fit in 
defaultwith schools or self-employment may be the only options. If the parent is unable to get work, then they may be moved to a cheaper area. However, there are often reasons why this cannot happen. For example, it is difficult to move families with a child doin
defaultg GSCEs or A-levels because of the disruption to a key stage of their education.  
default&#xa0;
defaultEven if a family is moved to a cheaper location, they won't be able to afford the rent,
default whether private, affordable or social
default. 
defaultThis means that boroughs have to provide accodefaultmmodation and subsidise the rent until they are able to obtain employmentdefault. DHP is currently being used to top rents up, but boroughs will have to subsidise rents even if DHP is not available
default. 
defaultWhilst the number of families subject to the 50p housing benefit
default entitlement
default is comparatively small, the financial burden
default ultimately falls to the tax payer. 
defaultThese households are likely to be worse off on U
defaultniversal 
defaultC
defaultredit
default. At the very least, some form of transitional protection would be 
defaultwelcome. The
default freedom provided by the Localism Act to discharge homeless duty into the private sector is not an option for these families as there is no attraction to landlords in accepting those whose rent cannot be covered.

defaultSome claimants are visibly ‘capable and employable’ but are adamant they do not want to work 
defaultwhilst expressing
default resistance to moving to cheaper areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese issues also apply to families whose benefits have been capped by smaller amounts to a lesser degree
default and the overall impact on local authorities needs to be considered
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOver
default 4000 households are experiencing shortfalls in Housing Benefit
default payments due to the bedroom tax in 
defaultw
defaultest London
default which will inevitably lead to increased rent arrears.
default The national press is already reporting the increase in rent arrears for Registered Providers.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a lack of suitably sized accommodation for under occupiers facing a shortfall in their Housing
default Benefit payments to downsize into. This will adversely affect social landlords’ rental income. The only real option available to many of these households is to try and downsize through a mutual exchange
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst allocation policies give under occupiers p
defaultriority, the reality is that the number of tenants affected by the 
defaultBedroom T
defaultax exceeds the 
defaulttotal
default number of lettings for all categories in need, across the whole 
defaultw
defaultest London 
defaultsub-
defaultregion last year. 
defaultAlthough maximum priority is given to social tenants who are 
defaultdown-sizing, t
defaulthe fact that only 
default234 
defaultunder occupiers moved last year indicates that the majority of the 4000+ households will be stuck
default for many years 
defaultbeing 
defaultpenali
defaults
defaulted for something they cannot swiftly change. 
defaultWe would welcome some transitional relief for te
defaultnants who have applied to down size.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultLocal authorities are in a difficult position in estimating the effects of direct payments, based on the roll out progress of Universal Credit. The majority are expecting losses and making bad debt provision, particularly in the light of the pilot authorit
defaulties who suffered significant decreases in rental income. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are potential difficulties in ensuring payment of UC for TA cases in bed and breakfast placements for a few nights due to UC being assessed monthly, based on the claimant’s circumstances at 
defaultthe end of the month. If B&amp;B claimants do not make a UC claim when they enter B&amp;B they (or more likely the local authority) will not receive any payment towards the rent. Direct payments for 
defaulttemporary

default would be welcome.

defaultfor preventions in the PRS and PRSOs 
defaultwould 
defaultgive
default landlords piece of mind and assist 
defaultboroughs to
default 
defaultcontrol the growth of TA, especially B&amp;B.
default&#xa0;
defaultConcern has also been raised in respect of the DWP being able to cope with bulk rent increases; a situa
defaulttion that will be exacerb
defaultated by landlords not being able to distinguish b
defaulte
defaultnefit claimants (which they can currently). 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a real concern that UC will affect social landlord’s income streams thus affecting the ability to invest in/ build new stock. 
defaultIn order to mitigate this, local authorities are developing various initiatives including: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe majority of these will of course only be effective if tenants engage in processes which for some of them will be completely new and daunting.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst the 
defaultWest London
default boroughs have been pro-active in responding to the changes, particularly in mitigating the impact of the reforms now an
defaultd in the future, they are doing so under funding that falls far short of the requirements for this resource intensive work.
default&#xa0;
defaultBoroughs are taking individual approaches, but the sub region’s innovations may be grouped under the following subject areas:
