[[[Summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Education has not yet come to grips with evidence about the nature (genetics) and nurture (environment) of individual differences in children’s academic achievement and underachievement. Differences between children are often assumed to be entirely caused by variation in family, school, teacher and peer environments – but research by me, and many others in several countries, shows that genetic (DNA) differences between children account for more than half of the differences between children in their educational achievement. By contrast, only about a fifth of the differences between children in educational achievement is accounted for by schools. No specific policy implications follow directly from recognising genetic differences between children in how easily -- they learn even basic literacy and numeracy skills. Nonetheless, it cannot be right to ignore genetics in discussions about why children differ in their educational achievement.&#xa0;I was asked to provide no more than two pages of written evidence. In what follows, I cite my own research as evidence, although the papers cited also summarise other research. General background information can be found in the sixth edition of the major textbook in the field (Plomin, DeFries, Knopik, &amp; Neiderhiser, 2013) and specific background reading about genetics and education can be found in a book that has just been published on the topic (Asbury &amp; Plomin, 2013).
