defaultWritten submissiondefault from defaultKevin Williams, defaultChair of the defaultNAPIT Governing Board (BRC 57)default&#xa0;
defaultI am writing in my capacity as the independent Chairman of the Governing Board of NAPIT, one of the competent person scheme operators. I am addressing only the 
defaultquestion raised by the Select Committee regarding the adequacy of supervision of the schemes by DCLG, and my response has been agreed by the all the participants on the Board, which comprises:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Board acts as the “impartiality committee” as required by NAPIT’s accreditation and as such has a primary responsib
defaultility of holding NAPIT to account for its operations and to quote from our terms of reference:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Governing Board shall:
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultassist in developing the policies relating to impartiality of its certification activities
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultcounteract any tendency on the part of the 
defaultowners of a certification body to allow commercial or other considerations to prevent the consistent objective provision of certification activities
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultadvise on matters affecting confidence in certification, including openness and public perception
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile the
default question raises the adequacy of the Department’s supervision of schemes, I wish to draw attention to the effect of the Department’s decision to require schemes to become accredited to the international standard EN45011 which requires each scheme operator 
defaultto put in place an “impartiality committee” such as NAPIT’s
default which must be 
defaultrepresentative, 
defaultindependent from the scheme operator, must have access to all information it feels necessary to hold the scheme operator to account
default. The impartiality committee
default has th
defaulte power to report the scheme operator to UKAS or the Department if the scheme operator does not takes its advice. 
defaultI consider
default these 
defaultto be 
defaultquite powerful tools of scrutiny.
default&#xa0;
defaultDCLG’s terms of authorisation require UKAS accreditation by June 2014 so this element
default of scrutiny will not be in place for all scheme operators until that time
default.
default NAPIT’s Governing Board was formed in March 2009 and 
defaultI 
defaultbelieve has benefited NAPIT, the scheme members and consumers alike in that during that time we have had access and scrutiny 
defaultin regards to many issues including:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe frequency of meetings and the topics covered on 
defaultthe 
defaultagenda are within the Board’
defaults control;
default although NAPIT will 
defaultalso 
defaultsuggest issues that have arisen since the last meeting that they believe should be 
defaultshared
default. 
defaultThe board 
defaulthave always been provided with the information we request, and 
defaultit is 
defaultconsider
defaulted
default the reports supplied by NAPIT have been open and complete in raising key issues. I believe that NAPIT have viewed the external scrutiny by UKAS and the Govern
defaulting Board in a constructive an
defaultd
default positive way and have sought improvements through our interactions.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe board 
defaulthave from time to time, set specific actions for NAPIT to carry out to our satisfaction, or given advice for them to consider. To date we have been satisfied that NAPIT take action and appropriate account of our advice. The board have never had to use our 
defaultpower to raise concerns with UKAS or the Department.
default&#xa0;
defaultUKAS 
defaultspend extensive 
defaulttime carrying out surveillance on scheme operators, 
defaultand 
defaultI 
defaultdraw your attention to the fact
default that in 2013 to date 
defaultthe board 
defaulthave seen reports that represent 17 person-days of UKAS time 
defaultwith NAPIT both at the headquarters and witnessing NAPIT at work assessing scheme members, which far exceeds anything the Department was conducting prior to accreditation.
default&#xa0;
defaultI am aware that NAPIT have 
defaultinvited
default DCLG 
defaultto 
defaultjoin the Board 
default(positively received by th
defaulte Department) 
defaultwhich w
defaultill
default further improve this element of scrutiny
default.
default I would also note that 
defaultthe board
default reviewed all the DCLG Conditions of 
defaultAuthorisation
default and the implementation of these will give far more scrutiny than has been the case to date
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe amount of 
defaultinformation reported has been increased and the findings of UKAS are reported to the Department
default. 
defaultThe board suggests that perhaps 
defaultthe Department should consider taking a seat on the Governing Board for each scheme, or at least taking a report or minutes fro
defaultm the Governing Board of each scheme.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo conclude, I consider that UKAS accreditation and the formation of impartiality committees 
default(or Governing Board) 
defaultfor each scheme operator will significantly improve the 
defaultscrutiny of the 
defaultperformance of schemes. In NAPIT
default’s case accreditation and the Governing Board has been in place since 2009 and 
defaultthis has resulted in a strong
default focus on improvement 
defaultand compliance
default.
default 
defaultThis 
defaultgives us as a Board confidence in the scheme operation and which should therefore 
defaultunderpin confidence at 
defaulta government level.
