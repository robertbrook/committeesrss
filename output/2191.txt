[[[Simon Cramp - Written evidence]]]&#xa0;1. I am sorry my submission is so late in the day . I have had some rotten bad luck and ill health where I nearly lost my life last November when I had a heart attack. And doing this on my dad’s computer as I don’t have one. I have three hidden disability dislysica and dyspraxia and mild austic teninies. But I battle on. 2. Anyway I am getting back to some form of normal life. And want to as I have in the past made contribution to public life.3. Just want to make some comments re the draft deregulation bill. I think it like the recent lobbying bill a dogs breakfast badly drafted the explanatory notes are not in turn with the clauses as don’t give any background and explanation in  the expltory notes are poor and incomplete. And it has no structure it has too much in it.4. And need scrapping and renamed the bit and everything and it mate bill 5. I wish you well with your inquiry.6. And sorry to make it brief. I think it only fit for the dustbin and never should be presented in any format and the committee should be clear what a complete dog’s breakfast it is.&#xa0;&#xa0;16 September 2013&#xa0;
