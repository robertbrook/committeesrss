[normal]“It can be persuasively argued that a prohibition of legal aid
[normal] is within the ambit of article 6, for the purposes of engaging article 14 a
[normal]nd so precluding unjustifiable 
[normal]discrimination… Ultimately, the exclusion would itself fail a justification test because it denies practical and effective justice
[normal].”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The legal advi
[normal]ce further notes that this aspect of the proposals
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“does not focus on legitimacy of resort to the Court, the nature of the issue 
[normal][or] 
[normal]the viability of the argument. Being a foreigner does not indicate a lesser need, or a lesser justification, for effecti
[normal]ve access to the Court.”

[normal]“we had 11,359 applications for judicial review. In the end 144 were successful and all of the rest of them tied up government lawyer
[normal]s, local authority lawyers in time, in expense for a huge number of cases of which virtually none were successful.”
