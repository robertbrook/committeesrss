[normal]I work as a part-time academic.  I have had two maternity leaves and have worked part-time for several years.  The views expressed below reflect my personal thoughts on how my career has been able to flourish despite circumstances that lead to many women 
[normal]dropping out of STEM careers.  I believe I have been lucky in several ways, and am unsure if my career would still be on track - and would almost certainly be less successful - if I had not been.  If the system were set up differently, I would have been le
[normal]ss reliant on luck, and other women in my position would have a better chance of continuing successfully in their careers.

[normal]Women will never have an equal chance of career developmen
[normal]t whilst childcare is seen primarily as a female issue.  Legislation and attitude-change has focussed on allowing women to balance work and childcare, which is certainly helpful to some women, but whilst this is seen as a balance that only women must find,
[normal] women’s careers will be much more fragile (because of the compromises made) and women will therefore be much more likely to drop out of their careers.
