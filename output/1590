defaultI work as a part-time academic.  I have had two maternity leaves and have worked part-time for several years.  The views expressed below reflect my personal thoughts on how my career has been able to flourish despite circumstances that lead to many women 
defaultdropping out of STEM careers.  I believe I have been lucky in several ways, and am unsure if my career would still be on track - and would almost certainly be less successful - if I had not been.  If the system were set up differently, I would have been le
defaultss reliant on luck, and other women in my position would have a better chance of continuing successfully in their careers.

defaultWomen will never have an equal chance of career developmen
defaultt whilst childcare is seen primarily as a female issue.  Legislation and attitude-change has focussed on allowing women to balance work and childcare, which is certainly helpful to some women, but whilst this is seen as a balance that only women must find,
default women’s careers will be much more fragile (because of the compromises made) and women will therefore be much more likely to drop out of their careers.
