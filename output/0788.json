"Written evidence from Action for M.E. (LTC 40)&#xa0;\nExecutive sExecutiveummary &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1. Background&#xa0;\n1.1.\n \nMyalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E.) is a fluctuating \nlong-term condition \nthat \naffects around 250,000 men, women and children in the UK.\n \nIt causes symptoms affecting many body systems, more commonly the nervous and immune systems. \nAround 25% of patients are severely affected, and may be confined to bed or unable to leave the house without the use of a wheelchair. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n. Action for M.E. is the UK’s largest charity for people affected by M.E.\n \nWe provide information and support, campaign for better services and more effective treatments\n, \nand drive and invest in research.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n3\n. Our\n submission \nfocuses on four terms of reference from the Health Select Committee’s inquiry into the management of long-term conditions.\ninquiry into the Management of long-term conditions inquiry into the Management of long-term conditions\n It is \nbased on responses to a 14-question survey for people with M.E. in England, devised by Action for M.E. and publicised via our Online M.E. Centre\n and social media sites\n from 4 to 30 April 2013.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n. \nThe survey was answered by \n252 \npeople with M.E. \nThis was a good response given the short time frame. Results of the survey reflect what we expected and \nare \nbroadly representativ\ne of people with M.E., with \nwho\n \nthe charity is in daily contact.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n. \nThe duration of \nrespondents’\n illness is as follows:\n&#xa0;\n(250 \nrespondents answered this question)\n% of respondentsNumber of respondentsHad M.E. for \nless than one year\n&#xa0;\n2.8\n7\nHad M.E. for \nup to two years\n&#xa0;\n8.4\n21\nHad M.E. for \nup to five years\n&#xa0;\n18.8\n47\nHad M.E. for \nup to ten years\n&#xa0;\n22.4\n56\nHad M.E. for \nmore than ten years\n&#xa0;\n47.6\n119\n&#xa0;\n2. This section refers to the ability of NHS and social care providers to treat multi-morbidities and the patient as a person rather than focusing on individual conditions.&#xa0;\n2.1. \nOf the \n244\n people who answered the question\n \n“\nDo you have any other conditions?\n”\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n27.9\n% \n(\n68\n respondents) \nsaid no\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n72.1\n% \n(176\n respondents) \nsaid yes\n&#xa0;\n2.2. \nThese\n conditions \nmost commonly include fibromyalgia, anxiety, depression, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome and thyroid-related conditions.\n&#xa0;\n2.3. \nRespondents were asked to tick all the statements that applied to them. Responses were as follows:\n&#xa0;\n(209\n respondents answered this question)\n% of respondentsNumber of respondentsI have to attend different \nappointments to have check-ups for different conditions\n&#xa0;\n49.8\n104\nMy healthcare professional considers each of my conditions separately\n&#xa0;\n36.8\n77\nI can make one appointment to discuss symptoms for any number of my conditions with my healthcare professional\n&#xa0;\n55.5\n116\n&#xa0;\n2.4. \nA respondent \nin\n Buckinghamshire said: “Some of my GPs are often biased by the diagnosis of M.E. when I try and discuss another issue or want to seek further advice or tests. It can also take some time to discuss a condition properly in light of other conditions I have, which can be difficult in a 10 minute slot.”\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n. Action for M.E. supports the view that \na holistic approach, encouraging patients to discuss more than one symptom and condition, in each appointment, would be helpful. We appreciate that GPs must operate within strict time constraints, so it would be helpful if patients with M.E. and other long-term conditions could be encouraged to book double appointments.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n.\n \nRespondents were asked to tick all the statements that applied to them. Responses were as follows:\n&#xa0;\n(231\n respondents answered this question)\n% of respondentsNumber of respondentsMy healthcare professional treats me as a person, not just as an illness or illnesses\n&#xa0;\n61\n141\nMy healthcare professional sees me just as a collection of symptoms to be treated\n&#xa0;\n39\n90\n&#xa0;\n2.\n7\n. Action for M.E. was pleased to \nsee that a majority of patients\n agreed that their healthcare professional treats them as a person, not just as an illness or illnesses. \nHowever, \nthe \nAviva\n \nhealth of the n\nation \nindex\n found that M.E./CFS was the condition that GPs find most challenging to refer for specialist attention, and has been so for the last ten years.\n&#xa0;\n2.8\n. \nWe believe \nawareness and understanding for\n patients could \nbe improved if\n GPs were able to acce\nss better education about M.E. Charities such as Action for M.E. and local M.E. support groups could help facilitate this. \n&#xa0;\n2.9\n. \nRespondents were asked to tick all the s\ntatements that applied to them. \nResponses were as follows:\n&#xa0;\n(235\n respondents answered this question)\n% of respondentsNumber of respondentsMy healthcare professional is not aware of my social care needs\n&#xa0;\n60.9\n143\nMy healthcare professional is aware of my social care needs and takes them into account\n&#xa0;\n17.9\n42\nMy healthcare and my social care are not joined up at all\n&#xa0;\n54\n127\nMy healthcare and my social care are reasonably well-integrated\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n12\nMy healthcare and my social care are very well-integrated\n&#xa0;\n0.4\n1\n&#xa0;3. This section looks at examples of effective integration of services across health, social care and other services which treat and manage long-term conditions.&#xa0;\n3.1 \nWe asked respondents to indicate which\n healthcare professionals \nthey have been\n treated by for \ntheir\n M.E.\n \n&#xa0;\n(241\n respondents answered this question)\n% of respondentsNumber of respondentsGP\n&#xa0;\n99.6\n240\nConsultant specialising in M.E.\n&#xa0;\n59.8\n144\nConsultant not specialising in M.E.\n&#xa0;\n36.1\n87\nPhysiotherapist\n&#xa0;\n31.1\n75\nOccupational therapist\n&#xa0;\n38.6\n93\nPsychologist or counsellor\n&#xa0;\n32.8\n79\nOther (most common answers: alternative and private practitioners)\n&#xa0;\n29.9\n72\n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n \nAround\n 90%\n \nof \nrespondents\n \n(221 out of 241) \nhad been seen by \nmore than one healthcare professional for their M.E.\n \nWe asked if these \nhealthcare professionals complement\ned\n each other in delivering \ntheir care. \nOf the 227 \npeople who answered this question, \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n54.2% (123 respondents) said yes\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n17.6\n% (\n40\n respondents) said no\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n29.5\n% (\n67\n respondents) said they weren’t sure.\n&#xa0;\n3.3. \nWe asked respondents to tell us more about their experience of this if they could, and \n125\n did so. \nExamples include:\n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n \n“\nI had to keep repeating myself every time I saw somebody different, even if they were members of the same team, which was exhausting for someone with M\n.E\n.”\n (Respondent in Yorkshire)\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n.\n \n“I access all the people via the CFS/M.E. North East service (based in Newcastle) which I was referred to via my GP. The service update\ns\n my GP well so he can offer advice mid sessions.”\n (Respondent in \nNorthumberland\n)\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n.\n “Bristol has a wonderful M.E. centre at Frenchay Hospital where there is multi-disciplinary care from medics, OTs, physio\ntherapist\ns, psychologists etc. My GP (both now and where I lived before) acknowledged both that I am an expert patient when it comes to this and the superiority of the knowledge of the M.E. team, and so will go along with what they suggest.” \n(Respondent in \nNorth Somerset\n)\n&#xa0;\n3.\n7\n.\n “The consultant copied letters to me to my GP. She referred me to a psychologist who was trained in offering CBT for M.E. patients and knew a lot about M.E. Again, he c\nopied his assessment to my GP. \nI've also seen a psychologist for depression, referred to by my GP, and she also copied assessments to my GP.” \n(Respondent in \nOxfordshire\n)\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n.\n \nWe asked respondents what \nsocial care services \nthey had\n been offered in the last year\n.\n&#xa0;\n(240\n respondents answered this question)\n% of respondentsNumber of respondentsnone\n&#xa0;\n80.8\n194\nday-time carer assisting with personal care \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n10\nday-time carer assisting with non-personal care\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n9\nnight-time carer\n&#xa0;\n0.4\n1\nAdaptations in the home\n&#xa0;\n11.3\n27\nTelehealth and telecare services\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n5\n&#xa0;\n3.9\n.\n \nA respondent in Suffolk told us: “After contacting Social Services in October 2012, I am still waiting for an appointment to discuss what care I am entitled to. Three out of five appointments have been cancelled within 48 hours of the scheduled appointment, by the social worker.”\n&#xa0;\n3.10\n.\n \nMany respondents told us they rely on their immediate family for care.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.11\n.\n \nWe asked if \nrespondents if\n social care professionals \nworking with them \ncomplemented each other in delivering their care. \nOf the 83\n people who answered this question, \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n67.5\n% (\n56\n respondents) said no\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n6\n% (\n5\n respondents) said yes\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n30.1\n% (\n28\n respondents) said they weren’t sure.\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n2\n.\n \nWe asked respondents to tell us more about their experience of this \nif they could, and 32\n did so. \nNone\n were able to offer examples of effective integration of services.\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n3\n.\n A respondent in Ipswich told us: \n“I have been advised by my social worker that they cannot and will not get involved with any care relating to my children and therefore any care provided for me is for me and me alone. This is particularly \nunhelpful, e\nspecially as I am no closer to getting a care package in place for me after making first contact with social services more than six months ago.”\n&#xa0;\n3.14\n.\n A majority of people with M.E. (86% - see paragraph 3.6) told us they have been offered no social care services in the last year. Given the disabling physical symptoms of M.E., and the fact that 25% of patient\ns are severely affected (house- \nor bed-bound), \nwe believe it is important to have a \nnational approach to improving quality and developing \nsocial care\n, with specific guidance for specialist conditions such as M.E.\n&#xa0;\n4. This section refers to the interaction between mental health conditions and long-term physical health conditions.&#xa0;\n4.1.\n \nLiving with a long-term condition such as M.E. is no easy task. Some people with M.E. find themselves facing a mental health issue, such as depression or anxiety, as a result. \nWe asked respondents to tell us about their\n experience of this, and \n217\n did so.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n Many respondents spoke of the anxiety, depression and isolation that comes from living with a long-term, fluctuating condition that is still little understood. Some felt that their GP understood this reaction, while others are wary of discussing mental health issues alongside their M.E.\n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n A\n respondent in Greater Manchester said: “I fear saying anything because my GP and healthcare professionals have so many times tried to attribute any symptoms I have down entirely to me being depressed.\n”\n&#xa0;\n4.\n4\n.\n \nWe asked respondents if their mental health issue was considered separately from their M.E. by their healthcare professional. Of the \n213\n people who answered this question, \n23.8% (50 respondents) said this question wasn’t relevant to them. Of the remaining 163 respondents,\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n43.6\n% (71\n respondents) said \nyes\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n35\n% (57\n respondents) said \nno\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n21.4\n% (\n35\n resp\nondents) said they weren’t sure\n4.5\n.\n \nWe asked respondents to tell us more about their experience of this if they could, and \n105\n did so.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n6\n.\n A respondent in West Sussex said: “Sometimes I have felt that healthcare professionals consider my health issues and physical symptoms to be caused by depression or anxiety, which I find extremely frustrating as I feel my anxiety and depression are brought on by the M.E. and not the other way around.”\n&#xa0;\n4.7\n.\n \nM.E. is a neurological condition, not a mental health problem. While it is encouraging to see that 43.6% (see paragraph 4.4.) reported that their mental health issue was considered separately from their M.E. by their healthcare professional, just over a third did not, while more than a fifth said they weren’t sure, indicating a lack of clarity in communication \nfrom\n their healthcare professional. \nU\nnderstanding and awareness of M.E. among health professionals \nmust be \nimproved.\n&#xa0;5. This section refers to the extent to which patients are being offered personalised services, and patient contribution to better outcomes.&#xa0;\n5.1.\n \nWe asked respondents if they \nhave a care plan based on \ntheir\n \nindividual needs. \nOf the 230\n people who answered this question, \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n87% (200\n respondents) said no\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n7.8% (18\n respondents) said yes\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n5.2% (12\n respondents) said they didn’t know.\n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n \nWe asked respondents to tell us more about their experience of this if they could, and \n57 \ndid so.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n One respondent in Greater Manchester said: “Since moving to my current address five months ago I have found it very frustrating that my care support plan has not been adhered to. I have received mostly help with domestic tasks and no personal care. It has not addressed my individual needs and has also been too expensive for me to afford, meaning that I have had to cancel care and am now making a formal complaint.”\n&#xa0;\n5.4.\n \nWe asked respondents if they thought that their healthcare professional valued their ideas when it\n came to working out treatment. \nOf the \n223\n people who answered this question, \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n37.7% (84 respondents) said yes\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n34.5% (77\n respondents) said no\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n30.9% (69\n respondents) said they weren’t sure.\n&#xa0;\n5.5.\n \nWe asked respondents to tell us more about their experience of this if they could, and \n120 \ndid so.\n Some examples of effective patient contribution to better outcomes include:\n&#xa0;\n5.6\n.\n A respondent in Kent said: “The fluctuations and limitations of my illness (dysphonia/sensory sensitivity) make consultations either difficult to attend or very long (always double appointments). So about a year ago my GP provided me with his surgery email address so that I can provide him with updates and relevant research material prior to consultati\non to inform my on-going care. \nAs a result his knowledge of my illness and support for me has increased and my consultations with him are more constructive.”\n&#xa0;\n5.7\n.\n \nListening to patients \nas individuals\n, as well as through national bodies such as Healthwatch England, is\n key to better patient outcomes.\n Action for M.E. is encouraged to see that more than a third of patients have had this experience – but they are still in the minority. \nA fundamental shift in attitude is required.\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n www.actionforme.org.uk\n www.facebook.com/actionforme and www.twitter.com/actionforme\n \n \nAviva health of the nation index\n, 2013, p 22, \nwww.aviva.co.uk/library/pdfs/health/hotn-index-2013-gen4805.pdf\n"
