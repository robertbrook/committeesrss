[normal]Written evidence from [bold]Brake, the road safety charity[bold] (CYS0129)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]About Brake[bold]Brake
[normal] is an independent charity working across the UK to make roads safer, prevent road death and injury, and care for road crash victims. Brake carries out research into public attitudes, experiences and behaviour in relation to road safety, disseminates inter
[normal]national research to road safety and fleet professionals, engages schools and communities to spread road safety education, runs public awareness and policy campaigns nationally and supports communities campaigning for road safety. It is also a national, go
[normal]vernment-funded provider of specialist support for people bereaved and seriously injured in road crashes, running a national helpline and providing information packs that are handed to bereaved families by police following every road death.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Response[bold]Increased levels of
[normal] 
[normal]cycling 
[normal]and 
[normal]walking provide significant health, environmental, 
[normal]economic
[normal], and community benefits
[normal], but r
[normal]oad danger 
[normal]poses 
[normal]a major barrier to active travel. 
[normal]Brake’s
[normal] own research suggests 35% of people could be convinced to comm
[normal]ute by bike if ro
[normal]utes
[normal] were safer
[normal]. 
[normal]R
[normal]oad dange
[normal]r creates a barrier not only to people choosing walking and cycling as a transport choice to get from A to B, but also to people, particularly children and families, simply being able to ‘get out and about’ and walk and cycle in their neighbourhood for lei
[normal]sure, exercise and social reasons. A 2012 Brake survey found many children are prevented from walking and cycling due to parents’ fears for their safety 
[normal].
[normal] Conversely, studies 
[normal]show
[normal] that where measures are implemented to offer greater protection and safe pa
[normal]ssage for people on foot and bike, it can lead to significant rises in walking and cycling
[normal],
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If the government and local authorities want to increase levels of cy
[normal]cling, which is good for health and the environment, the
[normal]y
[normal] must make improving safety for v
[normal]ulnerable road users a priority.
[normal] Brake argues that improving safety for cyclists and pedestrians goes hand-in-hand, and advocates a holistic and ambitious approach from government towards safer streets, communities and routes for walking 
[normal]and
[normal] cycling.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Evidence shows that slowing 
[normal]down 
[normal]traffic makes cycling
[normal] (and walking)
[normal] 
[normal]on roads 
[normal]safer
[normal]. It also shows
[normal] that the safest way to cycle is on a path segregated from traffic
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Brake 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]recommends
[normal] that 
[normal]in 
[normal]towns, cities and villages
[normal], traffic should be slowed 
[normal]to 
[normal]a maximum speed limit of 
[normal]20mph
[normal] 
[normal]to allow people to get out and about and make journeys by bike and on foot
[normal] (and by a combination of walking or cycling and public transport)
[normal]. 
[normal]Brake also calls for greatly increased provision of 
[normal]dedicated traffic-free
[normal] or se
[normal]gregated
[normal] 
[normal]routes
[normal] 
[normal]for cycling (and walking), particularly on key routes linking residential areas with schools and colleges, places of work, shopping areas and leisure facilities, and linking neighbouring towns
[normal]. Evidence from the Netherlands
[normal],
[normal] London
[normal] 
[normal]and elsewhere 
[normal]demonstrate
[normal]s
[normal] the effectiveness of these m
[normal]easures in reducing casualties 
[normal]among people on foot and bike. 
[normal]Other studies have shown that effective implementation of area-wide 20mph limits, traffic-free routes, and other measures to make walking a
[normal]nd cycling safer and more pleasant, can help bring about increased levels of walking 
[normal]and cycling
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Brake 
[normal]believes
[normal] 
[normal]20mph is the most appropriate 
[normal]default 
[normal]speed 
[normal]limit 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]built up areas 
[normal]based on the huge difference in stopping distances between 20mph and 30
[normal]mph, and the overwhelming evidence on the direct relationship between speed and road safety
[normal] and our belief that everyone should be able to walk or cycle without fear or threat to their safety
[normal]. Evidence on implementation of 20mph limits shows they bring ab
[normal]out reductions in devastating and costly casualties for pedestrians and cyclists in particular
[normal], have widespread public support
[normal], and encourage greater levels of walking and cycling
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Brake is part of a ‘
[normal]GO 20’ coalit
[normal]ion of 10 charities
[normal] who all believe 20mph is the most appropriate default limit for towns, cities and villages. U
[normal]ntil 
[normal]we achieve a lower default limit,
[normal] 
[normal]we
[normal] encourage more local authorities to follow the lead of Portsmouth, Bristol, London Borough of Isli
[normal]ngton and many others who have or are implementing widespread or town/city
[normal]/area
[normal]-wide 20mph limits.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Alongside calling for 20mph limits, 
[normal]Brake recommends the use of segregated and traffic-fr
[normal]ee paths as widely as possible on key routes as outlined above. 
[normal]Brake
[normal] warns that simply marking a cycle 
[normal]lane
[normal] on otherwise normal roads, 
[normal]especially
[normal] busy
[normal], fast
[normal] 
[normal]roads with
[normal] hazardous junctions, does not constitute provision of a safe route. 
[normal]Brake 
[normal]recommend
[normal]s
[normal] continuous cycle 
[normal]paths,
[normal] safe along their full length, including sa
[normal]fe negotiation of busy and complex junctions, and using segregated and traffic
[normal]-
[normal]free routes as much as possible, or where not possible making use of quiet
[normal] roads with lower speed
[normal]s.
[normal] 
[normal]There should also be a partnership approach taken 
[normal]by
[normal] local authorities and po
[normal]lice to en
[normal]courage implementation of accompanying 
[normal]measures 
[normal]to
[normal] make these routes safer
[normal] where they are on or crossing roads
[normal], particular
[normal]ly
[normal] 20mph limits, and wider enfor
[normal]cement
[normal], including through use of technology like average speed cameras for urban areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, b
[normal]ecause it is not possible to have 
[normal]safe, 
[normal]segregated routes connecting every 
[normal]home with
[normal] 
[normal]school
[normal]s
[normal], 
[normal]workplace
[normal]s
[normal] and college
[normal]s
[normal], 
[normal]it remains vital to lower our
[normal] urban limit to 20mph, 
[normal]to make whole 
[normal]areas
[normal] safer for cycling. 
[normal]Making cycling and walking the 
[normal]automa
[normal]tic choice for shorter journeys
[normal] requires that people feel familiar and comfortable with walking and cycling
[normal] in their immediate local area
[normal]. 
[normal]M
[normal]aking
[normal] whole
[normal] communities welcoming for walkers and cyclists, rather than simply providing safe routes from A to
[normal] B, will encourage people to get more active in their leisure time
[normal]. By 
[normal]helping people to feel more confident and comfortable walking and cycling in their immediate local area for leisure and very short journeys
[normal], people
[normal] (including children) are more able t
[normal]o
[normal] build up the fitness
[normal], 
[normal]skills 
[normal]and confidence 
[normal]necessary to undertake other journeys like commuting on foot or by bike
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I
[normal]f children are to be brought up with walking and cycling as the normal way to 
[normal]m
[normal]ake short journeys, they need 
[normal]to be able to
[normal] walk and c
[normal]ycle for 
[normal]school and 
[normal]leisure purposes
[normal],
[normal] to get used to those activities safely
[normal]. 
[normal]Children are safer where traffic is 20mph or slower, 
[normal]and
[normal] where they can travel and play 
[normal]away from traffic entirely, such as
[normal] on traffic-free routes
[normal] and spaces
[normal]. Children are not o
[normal]ften allowed to choose how they travel to school
[normal], but if their local environment is safe
[normal], they are more likely to be allowed to travel actively and play outside
[normal], making them
[normal] more likely to 
[normal]be
[normal] fit and healthy, and more likely to choose active travel for th
[normal]eir shorter journeys when they are older
[normal].
[normal] In this way, 20mph limits and traffic-free routes are also important in allowing children to practice and get used to active travel.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Brake argues that to bring about desired improvements in walking and cycling, w
[normal]e need a bold and determined approach from central government that ensures progress is made across the country, rather than a piecemeal 
[normal]localised 
[normal]approach where it is left up to local authorities to decide the level of priority they give this issue and what measures they implement. This should include lowering our urban default limit to 20mph, rather than leaving it up to authorities to decide wheth
[normal]er to implement this evidenced and important measure, and to go to the expense of extra signage and other measures needed when switching a limit from the default. It should also include not only provision of additional funding for 
[normal]local authorities to impl
[normal]ement 
[normal]safe walking and cycling facilities
[normal] like traffic
[normal]-
[normal]free routes
[normal], but a requirement placed on local authorities to develop 
[normal]the network of safe
[normal] routes and reduce risk for people on foot and bicycle. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally, long-term change in the safety 
[normal]and extent 
[normal]of 
[normal]cycling 
[normal]needs to include awareness-raising and engagement work, geared at 
[normal]drivers 
[normal]in particular but also cyclists 
[normal]and potential cyclists. Research from Norway
[normal] and the UK
[normal] demonstrates that initiatives to increase levels of active travel and improve road s
[normal]afety are much more effective where they include educational and enforcement component
[normal]s
[normal]. On the basis of this research, and our years of experience campaigning in road safety locally and nationally, we recommend 
[normal]the government
[normal] undertake
[normal]s
[normal] to educate 
[normal]the pub
[normal]lic
[normal] not only about the benefits cycling brings and steps cyclists can take to reduce their risks, but also, critically, the importance of 
[normal]drivers 
[normal]protecting cyclists
[normal] and their responsibilities in doing so
[normal].
