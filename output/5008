default [PCC Progress 02]
default&#xa0;defaultDeclaration of interestdefault&#xa0;defaultMy active interest in PCC's as a member of the public began after their election. I was concerned about the exceptionally low turnout of the electorate and felt that this did not give the new role any real mandate. Indeed you could say that the 85% who did not vote were indicating a No vote.
default&#xa0;
defaultAfter the election I watched with interest the activity of my PCC and also attended all but one of the Police and Crime Panels meetings. I quickly observed what appeared to me to be procedural errors with respect to the legislation. This lead to me interacting with the Police and Crime Panel (PCP) and the PCC by raising complaints. The purpose for describing the events below is to demonstrate that the problems were not isolated to a single issue of event.
default&#xa0;
defaultDuring this period I have gained a large amount of  knowledge of the legislation,
default 
defaultand engaged with such organisation as the Centre for Public Scrutiny,
default 
defaultthe Police Unit of the Home Office,
default 
defaulta MP,
default 
defaulta Government Minister &amp; CoPaCC,
default 
defaultas well as other individuals who a recognise within this area. Many of these individuals share my concerns.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis submission gives a summary of the main issues and the response from the PCC,
default 
defaultPCP and others. The purpose of doing this is to demonstrate how weak the scrutiny process is. You will quickly see how my issued were handled badly and the lack of scrutiny that I believe was taking place by the PCP,
default 
defaultPCC and others. It also shows the lack of responsibility taken by the PCP, PCC,
default 
defaulthis staff and a Government Minister. There is significant detailed documentation behind these events i.e. emails, letter,
default 
defaultminutes etc. which have not be included in this submission.
default&#xa0;
defaultYou will note that my submission deals mainly with process , procedure and the law. It does not make any judgement on the PCC “ideas” as  these have not been in place long enough to make a informed conclusion.
default&#xa0;
defaultMain submissiondefault&#xa0;
default1.In December 2012 though a freedom of Information request to the OPCC I found out that my PCC had put his new Deputy in to her role before what is know
defaultn
default as a confirmation hearing contrary to the legislation. I also found out that the public had not been properly informed by the PCP of a Public 
defaultConfirmation
default hearing for the post. I actually wanted to attend this hearing  but was unable to due to these actions. I made a complaint to the PCP regarding these issues. In response I received emails from both the Chief Executive of the OPCC and the clerk to the PCP. Both tried to convince me that I was wrong with respect to the legislation and simply dismissed me. It was my view that it appeared that the officials were making judgements that the PCP should be investigating and making. I also suspected that they had questionable motives to want to dismiss my complaint.
default&#xa0;
default2.I then decided to write to all of the members of the panel because I felt that the officials were frustrating my complaint. However at the PCP meeting in January following the date of my email the issue was not raised. After the meeting I received a “leaked” email containing an email from the Clerk of the PCP to the chair of the PCP and a email from the chair to the panel members. This email  in my view was clearly a suppression of my complaint by the clerk and the chair. It clearly explained why the issue was not raised at the meeting. I did raise these emails during public questions at the next PCP meeting but the chair refused to allow me speak on it.
default&#xa0;
default3.At the January 2013 PCP meeting which included looking at the PCC budget it took me from the Public gallery to point out a £1 Million pound error in the PCC budget document!!!
default&#xa0;
default4.I did bring these issues around the Deputy to the attention of the Local Government Ombudsman but they told me that the law did not permit them to investigate them. 
default&#xa0;
default5.What was probably more concerning is during this period I was told  privately by some of the panel members  that the reason that the panel did not act upon my complaints was due to a perception that the PCC could seek “revenge” on them!
default&#xa0;
default6.In March 2013 I contacted the clerk to the PCP who had also been the returning officer for the PCC election. I pointed out that video showing the new PCC making his declaration of acceptance (DOA) showed that the declaration words outlined in law had not be used!
defaulthttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp0Ya3BEAVs
default .I made several request asking him to provide me precise detailed information including names of witnesses and when/where the DOA had been redone correctly. He never did provide this detailed information and has now been removed from his post as CEO of Broxbourne Borough Council.
default&#xa0;
default7.This question was also asked to the PCC he replied by saying that the DOA had been redone (said) in an office in the counting hall with only him and the returning officer present. The DOA document is only signed by the PCC  It is my belief that this never happened which may explain why the CEO never gave me the detail information I requested. It is important to note that if the DOA is not completed correctly as outlined in  law the person elected cannot take up the post of PCC.
default&#xa0;
default8.After this I then had concerns regarding the appointment of a new Chief Executive to the OPCC and the failure of the PCC to apply section 7 of the Local Government and Housing act 1989 “
defaultAll staff to be appointed on merit”.default I raised this matter before and after the confirmation hearing with the PCP and they took no action. Immediately after the hearing I wrote to the PCC. The PCC did reply to my email but again simply dismissed it.
default&#xa0;
default9.Following this I place a complaint on 16
defaultth
default April 2013 with OPCC regarding the way the PCC conducted the appointment. The Monitoring Officer has been trying to find an independent person to investigate this. She has approached 42 people so far to do this but they have declined! To date this complaint remains not investigated some 7 months later!
default 
defaultI have raised this matter with the Home Office and I am still awaiting a reply after 3 months! I also raised this with the LGO who again informed me that the law prevented them from investigating.
default&#xa0;
default10.I also identified that the PCC had not complied with the Elected Local Policing Bodies (Specified Information) Order 2011. I contacted the PCC office to again to be dismissed. I then raised this with the PCP who asked the Chief Executive  to write a report. Not only did the report indicate that some of the statutory reports had not been done but did not clearly show the failure of the PCC which I knew of. It appeared that as long as the panel had its report it was not really interested in its content and took no further action. I made the Police Minister aware of some of these issues via my MP.  He simply replied tell me what should happen even though I had told him that it hadn't!
default&#xa0;
default11.Following a freedom of information request by me to the OPCC in January 2013 I had to contact the ICO in order for the OPCC to comply with my request. With the help of the ICO in June 2013 the OPCC finally released the information I had requested.
default&#xa0;
default12.In conclusion my experience of what is suppose to be an accountable,
default 
defaultopen and transparent role is clearly a myth and members of the public who scrutinise and complain are seen as a annoying inconvenience. The panel lacks the depth of knowledge to understand some of the issues it was presented with. The officials are allowed far to much freedom to interfere with complaints and the powers given to the panel are next to useless. The law has also been deliberately  written so that a non criminal complaint by a member of the public results in no real accountability but to a dead end called “informal resolution”. To be fair to PCC's who can blame them for running wild with so little real accountability and punishment for failing to do their statutory duty. The law has made them  almost “untouchable” by the PCP and the public. To underline this point a former member of the Herts PCP Roger Seabourne after standing down said of the scrutiny panel that he "didn't want to be associated with a body that is such a toothless, worthless, ineffectual, waste of time, money and space...” in addition he said that "members of the public who asked questions were often given unsatisfactory answers or were ignored" by the panel. The elected Mayor of Watford who also stood down from the panel described it as a “crocodile with rubber teeth”. Even Police Minister Damian Green MP took no action!
default&#xa0;
default13. In addition to this Annabel Frances a member of the Probation Service and an independent co-opted member of the panel stood down in October. She has since said of the panel :
default&#xa0;
default“I didn’t feel that the panel was particularly effective. I joined because I have a lot of experience in the criminal justice system and would have been able to give guidance but I don’t feel that is what the panel is doing.
default“It’s so politically charged. Most of the people there are from the 
defaultsame political party as David (PCC) which doesn’t make for an open place to have an opinion or to challenge.
default&#xa0;
default“I didn’t feel I was being listened to at all. It’s difficult as soon as these things become political”.
default&#xa0;
default“The PCC would ask the panel their opinion looking for agreement which they will give because of the majority of members’ political persuasion.”
default&#xa0;
defaultAsked what she would improve: 
default“It’s a very difficult question because politics isn’t my area and it’s (the PCP) part of the political panto.
default&#xa0;
default“I respect the idea of democracy and having people from each governing body across the county to represent the people but it’s quite a one-sided debate in Hertfordshire, which we are poorer for”.
default&#xa0;
defaultVery concerning comments indeed.
default&#xa0;
default14.I hope this information is useful to the committee. In my view  significant changes are need to made to what was a rushed and ill thought out piece of legislation. In the first instance it is my view that  the role of PCC has been a very expensive failure and should be withdrawn. Failing that it is clear that the Panels need more powers to hold the PCC to account for non c
defaultriminal  and unlawful actions. 
defaultThese powers must have real consequences for the PCC if they are to be effective . 
default&#xa0;
default15.The back stop to making PCC's accountable is either Judicial Review or some other court action. This  simply is a costly “option” in my view to deter the public. I would suggest that we have a PCC Ombudsman who has no restriction in law,
default 
defaultunlike the LGO, to investigate any member of  public’s complaint on any action of the PCC or PCP. 
default&#xa0;
default16.In addition the words “be published as soon as practicable” within  The Elected Local Policing Bodies (Specified Information) Order 2011 and associated l
defaultegislation must be removed .PCC
defaults are taking this as a licence to publish statutory data several month after clearly the legislation intended it to be published.
default&#xa0;
default17,Other areas that I would like to see reviewed is the Political mix of the panel. I find it hard to see how if the majority of the panel are of the same political persuasion of the PCC how they can truly act entirely objectively. In addition the majority of the panel in Herts are male. Maybe we need more independent members to shift the balance?
default&#xa0;
default18. I would also like to see that the power of the PCC to  “call upon the chief constable of the police force for that area to resign or retire” removed. This is grossly unfair and in my view is needs to be changed. Although the Panel can get involved with this process at present the PCC can ignore their view!
default 
defaultIf it was considered that the panel could have the final say I would still be concerned due to the point made in para 17. Can a Chief Constable simply not just be afforded the employment rights of any other citizen?
default&#xa0;
default19.I would all so like the governm
defaultent to stop the mantra that PCC
defaults will be held accountable at the next election. This assumes that a PCC is going to stand again. Clearly this is not the case so nothing t
defaulto fear with respect to some PCC
defaults!
default&#xa0;
default20.I would 
defaultalso like to see the end of PCC
defaults also holding other public office such as a councillor etc. To me there is a clear conflict of interest here.                                          
default&#xa0;
default21.I think it is worth noting that on the night of the PCC election there was another vote taking place on whether to retain the elected Mayor of  Hartlepool. The electorate decided to scrap the role. I think this plus the low turnout for the PCC election gives an indications that the public have little enthusiasm for some locally elected officials.
default&#xa0;
default22.Finally I am preparing for the next PCP meeting. 
defaultAgaindefault I will  be placing many of the issue that I have described above i.e. statutory reports failure,
default 
defaultfailure of the CE of OPCC to carry out his duty etc. to the panel. In addition just this week it appears that the complaint that I mention in para 8 has taken a very concerning turn. The CE has now appeared to of interfere with this investigation!
default 
defaultAlthough knowing that my issues will probably fall on deaf ears at the PCP meeting as usual,
default 
defaultit is not right that these wrong doings be allowed to continue.
default&#xa0;
default21.I look forward to your final report.
