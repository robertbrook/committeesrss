"FBA0023/13-14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nThe Association of Partnership Practitioners (APP) is a multi-disciplinary organisation whose members advise on \npartnership law, accounting and taxation, and on the management of professional firms.  Its members include solicitors, barristers, accountants, tax advisers, and bankers.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nThe tax committee of the APP is pleased to be afforded the opportunity to submi\nt evidence to the Finance Bill sub-committee.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nWe have focused our response to discuss the context of \nproposed s\n863A \n- \nC\n \nITTOIA 2005 (the salaried member proposals)\n. \n \nW\ne\n use this to illustrate our concern about the consultation process\n. \n \nW\ne trust \nthis \nwill be helpful \nin your review of the background to the proposed partnership taxation changes and to your \nparallel review of \"new approach to tax policy making\".\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nLimited liability partnerships (LLPs) were introduced a\ns a \nlegal entity \nin 2000.  The intention was to provide a commercial entity that had some limited liability protection for its members but with the taxati\non attributes of partnerships.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nPartnership taxation treatment is fundamental to LLPs.  If LLPs we\nre taxed as companies the LLP structure would serve \nlimited\n purpose and \nmany \nprofessional firms would operate as limited companies or as traditional partnerships under the 1890 \nA\nct.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nThe \noriginal \ndrafting of the tax legislation of LLPs (now \ns\n863 ITTOIA 2005) was not consulted upon at the time.  This lack of consultation led to defective legislation that the Government is now trying to correct (and \nagain, \nin our view\n,\n with insufficient consultation)\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nWe understand that the original intenti\non was for LLPs to be taxed as if partnerships, and therefore a member\n’\ns tax status would be the same as that \nwithin \nan 1890 \nA\nct partnership.\n  This intention was confirmed by HMRC at paragraph 2.8 in the 20 May 2013 Consultation Document.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \n‘\nSalaried pa\nrtners\n’\n of an 1890 \nA\nct partnership are employees with the title \n‘\npartner\n’\n but who are not partners.  The LLP \nA\nct allows for members of an LLP to also be employees.  The tax legislation (through erroneous drafting in our view) conferred self-employed tax st\natus as if true partners on employe\ne\n members.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nMembers of our tax committee, and other practitioners, highlighted this anomaly to HMRC at the time and explained that we anticipated that the defects in this legislation\n would be\n exploited.  It is frustra\nting that appropriate debate did not take place over a decade ago, \ntha\nt our predictions \nhave \ncome true\n (indeed beyond even our expectations)\n, and that in belatedly seeking to take corrective action our advice is \nagain \nnot being fully absorbed\n by Government\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nWe acknowledge that the consultation document published by HMRC on 20 May was the start of what we anticipated being an appropriate consultation process.  We also acknowledge that HMRC were engaged and \ninvolving in this process\n over summer 2013\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nFeedback was provided in the consultation process by professional bodies, including ourselves, and some firms potentially affected by the then proposed changes.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nWe know of many firms who did not respond\n to the consultation process because they saw that the proposals would have no\n,\n \nor at\n most little\n,\n impact upon them.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nOur response was that the proposals were an inappropriate re\naction\n to the problem identified and we recommended that a simple change t\no \nS\nection 863 ITTOIA 2005 was all that was needed to bring the position to that which we had understood was always intended and to ensure that \nrelevant\n partnership tax case law could be used to determine appropriate outcomes.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nOn 10 December, some four months after the initial consultation process\n, the\n Government published amended proposals within draft clauses for \nF\ninance Bill 2014 together with draft HMRC guidance thereon.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nThe proposals are si\ngnificantly different to those outlined in the 20 \nM\nay \n2013 \nconsultation document and thus, in our view, should be subject to fresh consultation.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nUnfortunately the HMRC \n‘\ntechnical notes and guidance\n’\n of 10 December make it clear that we have been prese\nnted a fait accompli.  \"The Government would not expect to make significant changes to the published legislation, although \ncomments on \ntechnical details would be welcome.\"\n  \n(Page 3 of HMRC’s Technical Note and Guidance 10 December 2013.)\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nThe \nimpression being strongly given is that there is no intention on the part of Government to debate the principles behind the fresh proposals.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n5\n              \nThe revised proposals will not catch some employee members who the Government clearly wished to tax as \nemployees within their original proposals.  Under the new proposals it is quite possible the low paid workers referred to in paragraph 2.9 of the 20 May consultation document will under the new proposals be able to remain self-employed\n if their arrangement\ns are set up so to do\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n6\n              \nIn contrast there were \nindividuals \nnot intended to be affected by the original proposals, who now may well be\n.  F\nor example\n,\n \"junior partners (who) are substantially rewarded by a fixed profit share\" where paragraph 2.13 of the \n20 \nM\nay consultation document suggested it would be appropriate\n for them\n to remain as self-employed\n, but who are now potentially to be caught\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n7\n              \nMany professional firms with junior members now find that the tax position of those members may well change o\nn 6 April 2014 and they have no opportunity to enter into any meaningful debate about the proposals.\n&#xa0;\n4.8\n              \nThe same is true of firms where members share profits primarily by a \npercentage\n of \nthe\n profits\n of a division of the firm\n.  Under the 20 May 2013 doc\nument proposals our understanding is that this would be a variable profit share and the individuals would not be classed as salaried members.  The draft Finance Bill clauses completely change the outcome in this regard as a share of a divisions profits is \nto be classed as ‘disguised salary’ (although clearly variable the problem is that it does not directly vary with the firm’s overall profits, only the divisions).\n&#xa0;\n4.\n9\n              \nThe timescale of implementation by 6 April 2014 is now so short that those firms who fin\nd themselves affected\n,\n and previously assumed they would \nnot\n,\n find that they have no time to debate\n the position.\n  Some quite fundamental principles have changed as we have explained above.\n \n \nThe focus of potentially affected firms\n is on attempting to minimise the \nimpact of \nwhat they believe to be inappropriate change to tax legislation.\n  With our self-assessment regime they will face interest and penalties for failing to operate PAYE if appropriate on members’ income from 6 April 2\n014\n, even though the legislation will not receive Royal Assent until summer 2014 and may change through parliamentary process in the meantime\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.10\n              \nFor some individual members the proposed legislation even has an impact upon the tax due from them on 31 Ja\nnuary 2014.  If they otherwise expect their tax liability for 2013/14 to be lower than for 2012/13 then they are able to make a ‘payment reduction claim’ to reduce their 2013/14 interim payments on account (with the first instalment due on 31 January 2014)\n.  However, if they are treated as ceasing self\n-\nemployment on 5 April 2014 on \nbecoming\n a salaried member on 6 April 2014 (see 4.\n12 \nb\nelow) they might have a higher 2013/14 tax liability as a result, and would then be liable to interest on what then proves t\no be an underpaid first instalment of tax \ndue \non 31\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014.\n&#xa0;\n4.11\n              \nWhere an individual has sufficient capital in the firm on 6 April 2014 they will be able to continue to be treated as self-employed.  Currently the draft legislation insists that any c\napital commitment made to the firm only counts to the extent it is paid in to the firm by the relevant date.  Banks are already warning that they face administrative difficulty in processing demand \nfrom individual members \nfor additional loans \nto subscribe \ncapital \nby Friday 4 April 2014 (the last working day before 6 April).  Is it right that a bank’s ability to process applications should determine an individual’s tax status?  (We have suggested to HMRC that a ‘window of opportunity’ be given for the commit\nted capital to be paid in.)\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n2\n              \nThe draft Finance Bill clauses clearly treat salaried members as employees for tax purposes from 6 April 2014.  The HMRC guidance \ndoes not explain whether self\n-\nemployment status is deemed to cease on 5 April 2014 or on 6 A\npril 2014.\n  In tax terms this is not a difference of a day but of a whole year.  Does one cease in 2013/14 or in 2014/15?\n&#xa0;\n4.\n1\n3\n              \nIn drafting the proposed new legislation HMRC \nf\na\nc\ned a choice of adopting our recommendation (to bring existing partnership case \nlaw into play\n with a minor redrafting of existing Clause 863\n)\n or drafting fresh legislation with a series of tests.  They have chosen the latter.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n1\n4\n              \nA potential advantage of tests within legislation is that taxpayers can interpret their own position \nwith some certainty.\n  However, to do so the tests need to be clear and appropriate.  There has not been an opportunity to debate whether they are.\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n5\n              \nHMRC \nhave\n kindly indicated that they welcome comment on their draft guidance such that it might be cl\narified and expanded where necessary.  We welcome this engagement and have already been liaising directly with HMRC on this.\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n6\n              \nHowever, this again highlights that all is being done in a rush.  Firms have to fully absorb \nboth the draft legislation and t\nhe draft guidance\n well in advance of 6 April 2014 so that may they may understand their position at that date and act accordingly.\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n7\n              \nOur liaison with HMRC has indicated that they hope to publish updated guidance in \nmid or \nlate February, which will only\n be six weeks\n or so\n in advance of the i\nmplementation\n date.\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n8\n              \nGiven the uncertainty firms face\n,\n one would expect that they would be able to obtain detailed guidance in respect of their own circumstances from the otherwise laudable HMRC non-statutory cle\narance team.  Unfortunately the non-statutory clearance team are only able to respond to clients’ requests once the new rules have \nRoyal\n \nA\ns\ns\nent, which is likely to be three months after the date on which firms \nneed\n to have commenced complying with the prop\nosals.\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n9\n              \nWe have the unsatisfactory position of firms being in limbo in determining their position and considering any action in the light of proposed legislation that might change.  For example, HMRC have verbally indicated that they agree that \nS\nectio\nn 863B (\n6\n) does not define the correct period to measure \"disguised salary\" \nfor the capital measure test in Condition C \nand that the clause will need correcting.  This is a key definition of one of the tests that firms need to measure by 6 April 2014.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nWe agree that the existing legislation is defective and needs amendment\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nWe do not believe that the current proposals are the appropriate corrective action\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nWe do not believe that there has been adequate consultation on the propos\nals contained within the draft legislation\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nWe recommend that a further consultation process should be undertaken with \na\n delay \ni\nn the introduction of legislation by a year so that there is time to get it right.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n"
