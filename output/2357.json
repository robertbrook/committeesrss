"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Cranfield University’s Centre for Environmental Risks and Futures (CERF) (GSH0005)&#xa0;1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntroduction\n&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCranfield University’s Centre for Environmental Risks and Futures \n(CERF) \nwelcomes this opportunity to offer written evidence to the Science and Technology Committee’s inquiry into \nGovernment Horizon Scanning. CERF \nforms part of the Department for Environmental Science and Technology in Cranfield University’s School of Applied S\ncience\ns\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCERF \nis currently commissioned by Defra to provide a full programme of horizon scanning and futures research to the Department, its network of agencies and both the Scottish and Welsh Governments. \nOn behalf of Cranfield University, this \nevidence\n \nhas been prepared by Fiona Lickorish, who is Head of the Centre for Environmental Risks and Futures at Cranfield University. \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFiona Lickorish\n has over 20 years experience in undertaking environmental futures research and long-term impact assessment in the private, third and public sectors. She joined Cranfield University in April 2011, prior to which she was Head of Horizon Scanning and Futures\n at Defra from 2005 to 2011, where she led a programme of futures research, that included a review of all the research undertaken within the Defra Futures Programme between 2002 and 2005. \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHorizon scanning is one of a number of tools that futures research\ners use which can be employed to test future policy and strategy\n. P\nractitioners do not normally use the term horizon scanning to describe all futures research techniques: it is one method in a wider toolkit used by futures research practitioners\n and is\n the\n act of gathering new insights that may point us towards affirming or discrediting existing trends and developments, as well as identifying new and emerging trends and developments which will impact on our lives in the future.\n The Jon Day Review appears to\n use the term to describe wider futures research methods. For the purposes of this submission, we will use the term ‘futures research’ to describe the\n full range of\n methods used by futures practitioners to analyse possible futures. \nWhere the term ‘horizon \nscanning\n’\n is used, \nit describes the action set out above. \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are a number of observable differences in undertaking futures research from other, perhaps more familiar research methods. We do not go into detail here, but suggest that should Committee me\nmbers so wish, they may find value in reading the review of futures research undertaken by Defra (2006), but which does not appear as part of the literature review undertaken as part of the Day Review. We consider that a good understanding of these differe\nnces is key in helping Ministers and senior officials to understand, develop and use the outputs of futures research. Additionally, it should be noted that a number of the recommendations made in the Day Review reflect those identified in the earlier Defra\n work. \n&#xa0;\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKey Points\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow do Government departments make use of horizon scanning?\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment departments, and \noften \ngroups within departments, vary both in the way they use futures research, and in the depth to which they \napply such \nresearch\n to policy and practice\n. In our experience the main uses are to: \n&#xa0;4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow effective is horizon scanning in Government? Do Ministers and senior officials consider horizon scanning outputs appropriately?\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe effectiveness o\nf futures research in Government is variable, and is conditioned by a range of factors, some of which are internal to \nD\nepartments, some of which are driven by external imperatives and pressures.\n Below, we identify some key factors that\n, in our experience,\n condition whether futures research is effective or not.\n&#xa0;4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne key factor is the need for \nconsiderable resource input from, and engagement by, domain experts\n \n(e.g. \nscientific specialists in the subject in question\n)\n, and policy- and decision-makers in Govern\nment. \nWhilst successful research generally requires a measure of user engagement\n, \neffective \nfutures research requires continuous involvement of those wishing to use the outputs of the research from procurement to delivery. \nIn short, t\no benefit from \nfutures\n \nresearch\n \nrequires\n \nan investment of \nsustained effort from all those involved, things that are often in short supply in today’s Government. Lack of time \nunderstandably \noften leads officials\n and \nMinisters\n \nto have to \nconcentrate on delivery of the current age\nnda with little time to focus on the future. \n&#xa0;4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe effectiveness of futures research is dependent on those commissioning the research understand\ning\n what it can, but \nequally\n importantly, what it cannot provide. For example, there is a tendency to want prediction\n. Futures\n research cannot provide \nthis because the future is generally not predictable\n,\n so \nthe research is\n a tool \nto\n enable policy\n-\nmakers\n and politicians \nto reflect on\n how their recommendations and decisions might unfold in a number of possible futures rather than rely on a single explicit or implicit route to the future. This is important, for example, in infrastructure planning and implementation given the timescales \ninvolved which can span decades\n: the imperatives of today, may - or may not - be relevant at the point at which the infrastructure development is completed, so thinking in structured terms about what that future might look like should be helpful\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTherefor\ne, to be truly effective, futures research should be used as a tool to enable policy\n-\nmakers to test assumptions against a range of possible futures, and to provide orientation around how policy development and decision\n-\nmaking may work – or may need to work\n – in the future. The outputs will not be a reflection of the status quo: some methods are specifically designed to shift recipients from their current world view and to enable them to think about what is possible and plausible, not just what is probable. \nIt can therefore create discomfort because it challenges the current world view.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUsing f\nutures research can be\n challenged by the \npragmatic \nneed to b\nalanc\ne\n responding to immediate policy imperatives\n against emergent ones or those where impacts may not be f\nelt until years to come. \nHarold M\na\ncMillan may be \nmis\nquoted in apparently speaking of  \n“events\n,\n dear boy\n,\n events”\n, but there is a reality in\n this that often favours\n \nthe immediate \nrather than \nthe \nemergen\nt.\n Yet, considering the \nfuture\n \ncan enable a more \nefficient and effective use of diminishing resources\n,\n which has the potential to gain savings for the tax payer\n. P\nolicies that are \n‘\nfuture\n-\nproofed\n’\n can be more sustainable and adaptable to changing circumstances, which saves resources. \nFor \nexample\n, \nfutures\n research \n(in this case, grounded in understanding demography) \ncould have \nhelped school place planning:\n we effectively count births and changes in the birth rate, yet seem challenged to relate this to planning the requisite number of school places.\n&#xa0;\n4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPoliti\ncians as well as policy makers can find futures research challenging: a proportion understand and engage with it and promote its use, bu\nt \nthe imperatives of short-term pressures \nmay \nsimply crowd out \ntaking the \nlonger-term view\n that often drives the reason \nto engage in politics in the first \nplace. \nWe understand th\nis\n, not least in an era of economic challenge and austerity, but suggest that better embedding of futures research into the fabric \nof \ndecision-making, coupled with senior political \nand official’s \nsu\npport for it, might help in balancing the short- and longer-terms.  \n&#xa0;\n5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat changes could be made to improve existing horizon scanning activity? Will the recommendations made in Jon Day’s review of cross-government horizon scanning capability address current shortcomings? What progress has been made implementing these? \n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe be\nlieve that the Day recommendations are generally well founded, but that some further nuances and steps would help to deliver the recommendations.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFutures research uses recognised social science and organisational management participatory \nmethods (expert e\nlicitation interviews, questionnaires and workshop techniques)\n, coupled with secondary research including desk-based analysis of relevant research and datasets,\n to identify all aspects of whichever issue being investigated. These include using domain exper\nts to identify and understand the interactions between the political, economic, social, technological, legislative and environmental drivers of change (PESTLE analysis), to gain an understanding of whole systems, rather than projections of individual drive\nrs\n of change\n. \nGiven this, i\nt\n \nmay \nbe best placed under the management of \nthe \nGovernment social science profession whose members have a better understanding of the utility of the outputs of research using social science techniques.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrently\n, many futures \nresearch projects\n and programmes\n are managed by and report to, central departmental evidence and strategy teams. The research programmes of these teams \ncan be \ndominated by economic research and managed by \nspecialists\n whose training \nrightly \nlends them to gi\nve more weight to data\n sourced by more traditional means\n, but who can sometimes find it \nchallenging\n to understand and give credence to the less \ndefined\n outputs gathered using \nfutures research methods\n. Futures research outputs therefore, are\n often perceived\n to be less robust\n, which can lead to a perception that there is less imperative to take action\n. Many \nspecialist\n evidence managers and policy-\nmakers are therefore, reluctant to allocate precious time and resources to \nthe \nissues identified by futures resear\nch until a greater weight of evidence to sup\nport action is available. T\nhere is a delicate balance to be \nstruck\n between acting too early and potentially wasting resources or waiting until the weight of evidence is overwhelming\n. However, this has potential to \nleav\ne\n action too late\n: at best, this may involve additional cost, at worst, it results in the sort of failure that \nthe \npolicy process seeks to avoid.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFutures research has a creative dimension and \nmethods are often describ\ned in \nlanguage that isn’t\n necessarily familiar to policy-\nmakers. We \nfind\n that \ndescribing outputs \nusing the language of risk \nassessment and \nman\nagement\n,\n \nwhich is more familiar to Government senior officials, can greatly assist in embedding understanding\n. Cra\nnfield University has pioneered the integration of risk analysis tools to complement the outputs of futures research with more robust analysis of where future risks and opportunities might lie, and where and when to intervene to gain best value for \nthe tax\npayer. \nHowever, \nwhilst this has helped improve use of outputs for those already familiar with risk terminology, \nwe also identify that training for officials needs to include developing familiarity and understanding of the applications and benefits of both \nfutures and risk research in the policy-making community. \nAdditionally\n, the involvement of Departmental risk managers can be key in \nchallenging, supporting and \nembedding the outputs of futures research with \npolicy-makers, senior officials and politicians. \n&#xa0;\n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhilst the Day Review sets out a new definition for ‘horizon scanning’ \nacross Government \nthis actually appears to be a definition of futures research. As described earlier, horizon scanning is one of a number of futures research techniques. Government’s \ncontinued use of ‘horizon scanning’ as a catch-all term for all futures research techniques is detrimental in facilitating understanding between policy\n advisors, politicians as decision makers, \nand practitioners. This has the potential to lead to misunders\ntandings during \nresearch commissioning and \nprocess, which wastes time and resources on both sides\n, and can create frustration\n. Additionally, it does not demonstrate to \nresearchers\n that Government is an intelligent customer of futures research\n, \ncompromising\n best value\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Day Review proposes the identification and use of high-level champions for futures research in Government. This \nreflects established wisdom and experience, and \nwe agree that high-level champion\ns\n for futures research would be instrumental\n in helping to embed futures thinking across Government and in individual Departments\n. This should \nbuild on the work undertaken by Prof Sir David King and the late Prof Sir Howard Dalton, who \nboth \npioneered the use of futures research methods to support de\ncision-making, across Government and in Defra respectively. \n&#xa0;\n5.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFutures research outputs are a tool to test developing policy to ensure \nresilience\n to future requirements. The next step in using this research to test policy and identify future implications\n,\n h\nas until recently been undertaken or led by policy experts within Departments. However, the Day Review suggests that policy-makers now have an expectation that futures research practitioners will identify and provide implications for the future. \nWe presume\n that this reflects Cabinet Office guidance and thinking in outsourcing policy. \nThis is challenging\n for futures research\n: futures researchers are only rarely domain or policy experts in the policy areas they help Departments to investigate – more often, th\ney bring new dimensions, evidence, insight and act as facilitators to help experts to identify the implications of future developments for themselves. Policy makers and politicians \n– or their advisors or delegates - \nneed to be equipped to seek and absorb \nt\nhis \nexpertise and insight, compute it, and then make informed decisions. \nTherefore, taken at face value, the recommendation\n represents a step change that will demand a shift in the role of researchers, and has accompanying resource shift implications\n. \n&#xa0;6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow effective is the Government at responding to policy or regulatory challenges presented by new technologies? \n&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe consider that futures research could help Government in the early identification of the challenges presented by new technologies and use the\n followi\nng examples to illustrate this:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;References: Defra\n (2006).
