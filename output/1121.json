"VEP0037\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written Submission by Dr Richard Fairburn LLB LLM BSc MB,BS DMS (VEP0037)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nContributor&#xa0;Dr Richard Fairburn studied Medicine and worked in the NHS until 1981.  He has a Masters degree in Human Rights and Public Law from Essex University.  He is a Consultant to \nproviders of \nservices regulated by the Care Quality Commission.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1              Background&#xa0;\n1\n.\n              \nA rehearsal \nhere \nof the background to t\nhis matter would be superfluous\n other \nthan, \nperhaps\n,\n to re\niterate\n that a further rejection of \na change in the law \nby the legislature will condemn the UK to a\nn extended\n period of humiliation by unknown numbers of prisoners \n- undoubtedly including the most serious offenders - \nat vast expense to the taxpayer in legal costs and fines\n;\n and that \nin any event \nsome compromise would have to be reached at some future date with further wasted Parliamentary time\n.\n&#xa0;\n2\n.\n              \nOn the evidence of the Commons debate t\nhere is no \nbasis\n whatever \nfor believing \nthat any proposal \ncurrently\n being considered by the Committee would have the very slightest chance of passing a vote in Parliament.\n&#xa0;\n2              Current proposals&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nThe current proposal of a fixed cut-off \nbased on \nthe length of sentence may be straightforward from an administrative viewpoint but is deeply flawed in its ideology.  It depends critically on the erroneous presumption that an offender with any given sentence length \n(whether six months or four years or anything in between) \nis as deserving (or undeserving) as any other offender serving the same sentence.  Th\nu\ns such a \ndeterminant \nfalls \nfirmly \nin\nto\n the category of blanket decision making, the very conduct to which the Court of Human Rights is so clearly increasingly opposed\n in this area of human rights as in any other\n.\n  It must be assumed that there will be an endless trail of appeals against such a provision\n, and that it is only a matter of time before the facts of a particular case will result in defeat of it\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nThe Committee should be very slow indeed to promote such a blanket proposal\n,\n \nwhatever the sentence length proposed, \nand should be looking for alternatives that might \ntruly be\n regarded as proportionate.\n&#xa0;\n3              A presumption of rehabilitation&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nThe proposal put forward here is that prisoners:\n(a)\n              \nwho\nse\n \ndate \nfor release \n(\nthis is \ndetermined within days of the commencement of a sentence) \nis \nwithin twelve months of the date of a general or local election; and\n(b)\n              \nwho retain a “presumption of rehabilitation”; and\n(c)\n              \nwho are \nalready \n“eligible” to vote under the rules;\nwill be entitled to vote at that election.\n&#xa0;\n2\n              \nFor the purposes of (\n3.\n1.b) there \nwould be\n a presumption of rehabilitation for prisoners upon release \nexcept\n for those on a prescribed list, as below\n (indicative criteria)\n:\n&#xa0;\n3\n              \nFor the purposes of (\n3.\n1.c) prisoners \nwould be \ndeemed eligible to vote if:\n(a)\n              \nthey were \non the voting register\n prior to commen\ncing their current sentence; or\n(b)\n              \nthey \nwere below the age of eligibility to vote at the start of their sentence.\n&#xa0;\n4\n              \nThe underlying principle is of a scheme of eligibility based on a forward look\n \nat the \nright of (and need for) representation after release, not a backward look at the crime and an \narbitrary \nextension of the punishment beyond release\n.  This is a proportionate \nand individual \nassessment of whether there should be a right to vote\n while in prison\n.  It\n \nexcludes the serial sex offender whose current sentence just happens to be a short one.  It\n \nexcludes the career armed robber whose current sentence happens to be short because the police were ly\ning in wait and thwarted the last attempt\n.\n  It makes a proper distinction between the repeat violent offender and the \nsenior executive or \npublic figure who has committed serious offences but who is \nhighly \nunlikely to repeat them.\n  A fixed sentence-length cut-off is not capable of any such distinctions.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.\n              \nThe prescribed list would doubtless be subject to much debate and change.  Should serious fraud or perjury or perverting the course of justice be in the list, \nor would \nthese offences \nbe covered by the criterion as to length of current sentence, \nand so on.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4              Other matters&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nThe prospect of large numbers of prisoners voting in a particular \nconstituency\n by virtue of the location of a prison that takes their category of offenders \n(an affront to democracy\n, albeit perhaps unlikely on the numbers \nactually \neligible\n) \nis readily solved.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nPrisoners would v\note in \nthe \nconstituency in which they were already registered to vote\n at the \nstart of \na \nprison sentence.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nIf \nthe prisoner was \nnot registered \nto vote \nat the start of a prison sentence \nthen there would be no right to \nvote\n while in prison.  It is not \na duty of the Criminal Justice system \nto \nassist \npeople to vote who have shown no previous inclination to do so\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n              \nP\nrisoner\ns\n \nnot eligible \nto vote \nonly \nat the start of a prison sentence \nby virtue of age would be eligible to \nvote in \nthe \nconstituency of last residence\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5              Recommendations&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nThat the scheme should be considered by the Committee and consulted on.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nThat the Committee call\n evidence \n(\nrefused to me \nin a FOI request \nto the Ministry of Justice \nof May 2012\n, \non the flimsiest of grounds) \nas to \nthe \nlikely numbers \nof prisoners \nwho would be eligible to vote under this scheme\n, with the prospects of success in a Commons vote in mind\n.\n&#xa0;\nJuly 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
