&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (SLC 046)&#xa0;1. Railway/level crossing questions are included in the 'hazard awareness' topic area. This covers: The Driver - changes in driver behaviour due to the influence of alcohol, drugs and medicinal products, state of mind and fatigue, perception, judgement and decision making, especially reaction time. In the car theory test we ask 6 questions from this topic area, 75% of candidates are asked a question relating to a railway/level crossing.&#xa0;2. We are currently developing the scenarios for the next iteration of the

[[[ ]]]hazard awareness section of the theory test, which is planned for 2015 and they will include railway/level crossings. We are grateful to Network Rail for their suggestions of suitable scenarios to include.&#xa0; We intend to show either the approach to a level crossing, with the lights flashing and barrier descending, and the car correctly coming to a stop, or moving off after the lights have stopped flashing and barriers are fully raised. We will also include crossings without barriers. &#xa0;&#xa0;
