&#xa0;Written evidence from Cllr. Roger Seabourne [PCC Progress 49]&#xa0;The views expressed below are my personal observations of and participation in the Hertfordshire PCP, during its nascent year and do not necessarily reflect the views of the organisations I represent or apply to other Panels.&#xa0;I have focussed my comments mainly on the role of the PCP in holding to account the PCC, which I consider to be far from satisfactory.  While I started from a position of not being supportive of the principle of an elected, political Police Commissioner, I am still open minded, waiting to be convinced of its merits; however, I have serious concerns about the lack of clear guidance and some of the detail of the new governance arrangements.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1. I believe there was a lack of understanding about the role and remit of the Panel by their officers and some members of the Panel itself.&#xa0;It is widely accepted that PCPs should perform a scrutiny function for PCCs by acting as a critical “friend”.   However, critical cronies tend not to do this and this invaluable assistance can be lost which leaves some PCCs seriously disadvantaged.&#xa0;While it is now quite common for a scrutiny committee to be of a similar political make up as the Executive body they scrutinise, in my personal experience they learned very early on that it was in everyone’s interest, particularly the Executive itself, for there to be robust scrutiny.  The PCP, perhaps because of its lack of understanding, make up or lack of balance, seemed to follow not so much a “light touch” scrutiny as a “light stroke”.&#xa0;Whilst I admire Paul Darby’s submission [PCC Progress 10] wishing “no PCC or his staff should be over-politically involved, if at all”, this might be rather ambitious if not impractical and naïve.  I fully support his wish and his reasons for having a co-opted member as Chair, this while not perfect, would be more transparent and a considerable improvement on the current position. Particularly because they would be independent of the administrative officers and hopefully as well, more independent of the PCC.&#xa0;In my experience, the PCP did not fully understand the role of a scrutiny panel, (also see 4 below).  They were defensive towards questions from the public which then developed into a strong culture of denial as more unanswered questions were followed up by further more detailed, more probing questions.  &#xa0;The PCP agreed to let the PCC have a public question &amp; answer session at the start of Panel meetings allowing the public to scrutinise the PCC.  I considered this to be inappropriate as this was the PCP’s limited allocated time to do this, and the PCC already had ample opportunities elsewhere to engage directly with the public and could create as many more as he wished.  However, the PCP would not, on too many occasions, answer questions from the public themselves when they attempted to scrutinise the Panel.&#xa0;There was a failure of the Panel to deal properly with and answer questions from members of the public, who were not shown the respect, courtesy and consideration they deserved.&#xa0;As the year progressed I began to see this was most likely the result of the over bearing influence of the administrative officers supporting the PCP.  It is also worth considering the point that there is a strong financial incentive and perhaps even a viability issue connected with an authority (in a non unitary authority) remaining as the PCP’s host authority.  As with any culture, once it became established, it was difficult to change.&#xa0;&#xa0;2. Each Panel has £53,000 of funding from the Home Office to support its Police and Crime Panel. I understand this figure was arrived at from the average funding required, with on-costs, to appoint a scrutiny officer.  Whilst I can see the logic of this in terms of setting a national budget referencing ‘market testing’ and comparative value for money, it bears no relation whatsoever to the actual costs incurred to fund a system adequately in order for it to be able to perform its functions, let alone perform them to a high or even acceptable standard.  It would be some coincidence if the vastly differing sizes of Constabularies, geographical as well as numbers employed, with different sized PCC administrations all required exactly the same amount of funding to scrutinise such vastly differing budgets.  It is also incongruous for the PCP to scrutinise the PCC’s three year budgetary plan while not being able to have a one year plan for itself.  Funding needs to be decided, secured and be predicable for at least the medium term, as is done in almost all other similar areas.&#xa0;&#xa0;3. It is widely claimed and publicised that “The public have the information they need to hold their PCC and force to account.”  Provided, of course, it is actually published.The Government expects high standards of transparency and has set out the information that PCCs must publish to support the public in effectively holding them to account.  By publically setting rates and requiring full publication of expenses quarterly the Government believes it is ensuring PCCs will be fair and transparent in claiming expenses.   &#xa0;I understand and accept it is not the Government’s role to monitor compliance, and it is for the Chief Executive, as monitoring officer, to ensure that the PCC has complied with all legal duties.  However, if this does not occur, and I witnessed that it did not, I was, and am still not convinced, having a PCP that has no powers or sanctions to force compliance is valid, justified, helpful or useful.  The PCC is required to provide information and answer questions, but there appears to be no recourse if non compliance is established.  It would appear it would then be up to a member of the public (or perhaps the PCP?) to take legal action to ensure compliance, which cannot be expected to happen, not least because of the cost.  This is unacceptable.&#xa0;The widely claimed and publicised belief is only credible if the information is actually published.&#xa0;&#xa0;4. There was, and still is in Hertfordshire, a conflict of interest in members sitting on The County Community Safety Board with executive powers, and sitting on the PCP to scrutinise decisions made by that Board, including the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the PCP.&#xa0;&#xa0;5.  There is a widely held perception that the PCP has a veto on the setting of the precept.  This is, in reality, not only misleading, but also erroneous and therefore dishonest as it only the first proposal, and not the subsequent one, that can be vetoed.&#xa0;&#xa0;6. “In contrast, 7 in 10 people know about police and crime commissioners.” (Written evidence from the Home Office [PCC Progress 01])“Recent research has demonstrated that over 60% of people have now heard of the PCC role.” (Written evidence from Kevin Hurley)&#xa0;There is a significant difference between “having heard of” and “knowing about”. However, there is a huge gulf between “knowing one could go to a police authority with concerns about policing and crime” and “knowing about / having heard of” PCCs.&#xa0;Leaving that aside, it is very misleading to claim “Only 7% of people knew that they could go to their police authorities with concerns about policing and crime in their area while 6o%+ / 70% know about police and crime commissioners”.  It begs the question - what has gone on that that has made people (more) aware of PCCs?  Unfortunately, the cause of the raising of the level of awareness appears to be more the negative media reports concerning some of the quite outrageous conduct of a few PCCs rather than the, no doubt, sound work of the majority.&#xa0;&#xa0;7. Whist the local electorate has the option of judging whether PCCs are making best use of public money and hold them to account at the ballot box, they have not given the indication that they intend to do so.  This not only does not ensure PCCs are making the best use of public money, but also might, in reality, actively discourage it.By not allowing each candidate the free post that candidates for Members of Parliament enjoy, the importance of the post of PCC was devalued in the electorates’ eyes and it contributed to the very low turnout.  Holding them to account in this way only works of course if they stand for re-election………..&#xa0;&#xa0;8. I concur, from my personal experience of one PCP, with the Local Government Association’s submission that “…..Panels have come to realise that the formal powers, such as they are, have at best been of little use………………” &#xa0;9. The appointments of Deputy PCCs in Hertfordshire (one post, two appointments following the resignation of the first incumbent) were, at best, poorly handled.  The public were left with the widespread perception that the PCC had appointed ‘one of his mates’, twice.&#xa0;There is a strong case for electing a Deputy PCC at the same time and for the same term as the PCC.  This would be more transparent and might, in some cases, even achieve a better political balance.&#xa0;It is also of note and some concern that the appointment of a Deputy PCC is subject to verification, but the appointment of an “Assistant” PCC is not.&#xa0;&#xa0;10. It is inconsistent to give the PCP a significant statutory role in scrutinising their PCC’s decisions in respect of the appointment and the removal of a Chief Constable but not to be given the same statutory responsibility of scrutinising the PCC’s decision to extend or not to extend a Chief Constable’s fixed term appointment. Given the respective four and five year terms of office of PCCs and Chief Constables, a PCC having serious concerns about the competence or performance of a Chief Constable which warrants consideration of dismissal would, at certain points in the term, almost certainly be inclined towards inertia, ‘letting the clock tick’ and tolerating the situation thereby avoiding scrutiny rather than grasping the issue and dealing with it.  &#xa0;11. The legislation was rushed and the implementation even more so.&#xa0;&#xa0;Conclusion.In the final analysis, it is the effectiveness of the police force and the level of crime and disorder that matters most.  I have seen nothing in this new governance arrangement that raises either the general public’s perception of the police or the public’s expectations of them.&#xa0;In fact I believe because of the adverse publicity some of the PCCs’ antics have attracted, and as the public do tend, unfairly and unfortunately, to ‘lump them all together’, the public confidence in the Police Force is lower now that it has been for some time.  That in itself is not only a very worrying aspect but also, more critically, makes the job of the police more difficult than it would otherwise be and crime reduction itself much more difficult to achieve.&#xa0;As it seems unlikely the governance arrangements will be abolished, it requires some serious amendment and fine tuning in the light of the experience and evidence.&#xa0;
