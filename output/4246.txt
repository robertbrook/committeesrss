[[[Written submission from the RSPCA]]]              AbstractFood security and what it means needs to be taken in the context of the increasing global trade in food and farm products and the challenges  facing the agricultural industry to meet projected global demand.  The default position -  i.e. that this needs to be met with further food production, and by implication, greater intensification of food animal production  - needs to be reconsidered.  Achieving a healthier diet, cutting down on food waste and assessing what the UK or Europe can or cannot produce (given increasing global trade and reducing subsidies) all need to be addressed first.   The EU’s progress in securing animal welfare improvements in  sectors such as pigs, chickens and laying hens in the last seven years must not be undermined.  However, these improvements could be contrary to meeting present forecasted global demand for meat and could put the EU at a disadvantage to products being more intensively produced in other countries.  Further work is required in this area.  Climate change is another parameter to be included before any framework can be developed on food security.  Progress on agreeing what scientific data indicates and getting political agreement on what is required from the British livestock industry to meet UK greenhouse gas reductions has been patchy.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
