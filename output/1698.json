"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by ScienceGrrl (WSC049)1. ScienceGrrl is a broad-based, grassroots organisation celebrating and supporting women in STEM. \nWe formed in June 2012 to produce the ScienceGrrl 2013 calendar - a project to showcase a diverse mix of female role models from a range STEM disciplines and sectors. We \nopened for membership in February 2013 and ScienceGrrl was registered as a company li\nm\nited by guarantee in June 2013.\n \nScienceGrrl’s\n activities are led by a committee of volunteers with support from our members\n and\n funded through calendar sales, donations, sponsorship, events, merchandising, membership fees and grant awards. We currently hav\ne over 200 members and 13 local chapters across the UK. Our chapters provide peer-support for members and opportunities to engage in outreach activities to showcase the real female face of STEM. \n&#xa0;\n2. This submission \nrepresents input from over 100 people \nfol\nlowing \ndirect engagement with our members\n/\nsupporters through workshops and a call for evidence. We also requested exit interview data from a number of sources and received this data from Imperial College London for the period covering 2008-2012. Considerin\ng that our membership is largely junior (PhD students, postdocs) and that the pipeline is \n‘\nleakier\n’\n at these stages, our submission focuses on issues \nrelating\n to this career stage, specifically: relocation, maternity leave and childcare, career support, and recognition and reward of non-research activities.\nRelocation\n3\n. It is well-known that within the pyramid ‘move up or move out’ structure of academic career\ns, short-term contracts and funding cycles are challenges that\n contribute to uncertainty. There is also a \nperceived ne\ned\n to relocate\n.\n This\n pressure\n is illustrated by comments from\n \na 29 year old female postdoc looking to leave the academic \ntrack\n: “I \nunderstand that in order to progress as an academic, it would be necessary to relocate. I have a long\n-\nterm boyfriend in Kent who is unable to relocate. Within the next 5 years, we plan to buy a house, move in together, and marry. Currently, I’m not willing\n to live or work more than 2 hours away from him\n”. \nAnother female lecturer\n tells us that \nhad \nshe not been successful in gaining \nher\n post she would have “left academia as I had reached the point where I could no longer deal with the uncertainty and moving a\nround”.\n \nHowever, \nissues of stability do not \nonly affect women. One of our male members \ntold us he had \n“tired of the nomadic lifestyle which had prevented settling down…..living in different places has been fun, but has totally disrupted my personal life in\n a very negative way. It’s also played havoc with long-term financial stability with regards to pensions and house buying”.\n4. \nPerhaps those who make th\ne\n choice\n to relocate\n do so from a position of independence until it impacts upon \na need for stability\n. Depending on individual timelines, this \nmay be seen \nas\n incompatible with academic progress\n. \nSuccessful international experience is \nalso \nperceived as valuable within academia \nand overseas\n relocation data\n \nmay indicate \nwhether there are gender differences i\nn mobility. \nImperial College\n London\n exit interview data for researchers leaving at grades A-C shows that whilst 19.5% of male leavers chose to move overseas to follow an academic career, women were less likely to do so: 11.9% of female leave\nrs moved abroad\n for this reason\n. However, an identical proportion (5.8%) of men and women moved abroad for non-academic employment. \nIt would be interesting to know whether this difference was accounted for by more stable long-term prospects.\nMaternity leave and childcare\n5\n. The years spent working to secure academic independence and a permanent position are also the years many people choose to\n ‘settle down’ and/or\n start a family. A number of factors seem to influence whether this decision will \nbe seen as suited to\n an acad\nemic career. During a workshop at Imperial College London (in association with the Imperial College Science Comm\nunication Forum), we heard from\n pregnant postdoctoral researchers that their decision was influenced by the financial position of their partners\n. \nThere was agreement that \n“salaries in academic postdocs aren’t enough to support a family”. One of the women was looking to leave academia for this \nreason;\n another told us\n that childcare\n “will cost about 70% of my post-tax salary. Certainly, if I had another child, I would have to either give up work or move to a more highly paid job\n”\n. The group observed that many of the male postdocs with children they knew had partners who earned more. \n6\n. There are inconsistencies in how maternity leave is awarded to PhD students. For example, \nCR\nU\nK\n \ndefers to the Host Institution\n but all Resear\nch Council funded students “are entitled to take 6 months of maternity leave on full stipend and a further 6 months of unpaid maternity leave”.\n We heard from one postdoc who was not eligible for contractual maternity pay because she had not been in employm\nent long enough. She reflected that she would have timed her move differently if she had realised\n this\n. Another postdoc says she will be “in a position where my baby is due on November 20\n and my [3 year] contract finishes on November 30\n, after which time I will not be eligible for contractual maternity leave.” \nRC\nU\nK guidance\n \nGC 9 \ntries to address this but \nthe researcher believes she is only eligi\nble for statutory maternit\ny pay, \nnot the contractual maternity \npackage\n she could have expected had she become pregnant earlier in her contract.\n \n7. The University of Leicester \nAthena SWAN\n \nwebs\ni\nte\n \nstates that it is “possible to either simply extend the grant while the postdoc is on maternity leave and/or continue the programme by appointing maternity cover (within the original cash limit).\n \n&#xa0;\nSTFC/RCUK acknowledged\n that they perhaps need to make sure that these terms and conditions and financial arrangem\nents are more widely publicised\n”\n.\n \nG\nrant extensions require advance written notification from the grant holder to the funding body. This relies on clear knowledge of policies and may be a weak link. \nWe believe that \nissues around\n disruption to research\n due to parental leave\n, lack of awareness\n of policies and the fact that these issues are not discussed openly contribute to continued confusion and \nconscious or unconscious bias\n. \n8\n.\n Career breaks are a challenge in academia.\n \nThe Daphn\ne\n Jackson Trust\n \nsays:\n “\nScientists often feel unable to return due to a wide variety of reasons: lack of part-time or flexible posts, difficulties with childcare, unpleasant and outdated working environments, lack of career progression, secretive and unfair recruitment and\n promotion procedures, to name but a few\n”\n and offers valuable \ncareer re-entry fellowships to tackle the problem\n.\n \nThe Wellcome Trust and British Heart Foundation are examples of other funders offering career re-entry fellowships. \n9\n. ‘Return to work’ polici\nes following parental leave \nare i\nnconsistent\n.\n One member, working within the NHS told us: “\nI asked to work 3 days a week after my first child was born. This was arranged without any problem”. However, members within academia have spoken\n about unrealistic e\nxpectations that they will \nreturn to full time research \nand teaching \nresponsibilities. \nCareer support: advice, mentors and sponsors\n1\n0\n. Another common theme is \na lack of active and consistent \nsupport\n regarding\n career progression\n.\n \nIf present, this\n \nhas \nbeen attributed to being “with the right supervi\nsor at the right time” and professional networks\n:\n“T\nhere has not been a significant amount of support in helping me progress in my career. I have had to go out and create my own opportunities” \n“My current su\npervisor does not mentor me in any way. He is not interested in my academic advancement, nor is he interested in developing my skills as a researcher”\n“I think the lack of a mentor since my PhD has hampered my career progression”\n“Earlier in my career, my \nsupervisor refused to put me on a paper I had contributed a lot of work to because he wanted to be sole author....lack of support has definitely contributed to my desire to leave academia”\nWe also heard from \nthose \nwho had a mentor/sponsor and the positive \nimpact this has had:\n“My PhD thesis advisor and postdoc advisor were both very supportive of my career progression providing advice and advertising my work. They were both quite senior figures and their sponsorship no doubt has contributed greatly to my \nacademic success”\n“I had one mentor in San Diego who restored my faith in science, and showed me that it was possible to do it really well without worrying too much about what the mainstream said\n you were supposed to be doing”\n“It would have been great to \nbe able to speak with other women w\nho have 'been there, done that'.\n \nB\ny joining ScienceGrrl I am starting to get the opportunity to do that, which has given me confidence that I can start a family and continue to have an active career”\n1\n1\n. \nAnother\n thing tha\nt has been consistently raised is \nthe lack of \nsenior \nwomen\n to identify with. ‘\nSuperwoma\nn’ role models are generally seen as intimidating rather than inspiring and our members and supporters would like to see more ordinary women to help ma\nke their goals see\nm achievable\n. One\n female \nProfessor puts it\n like this\n: “I think that from the outside our lives probably look, to the rising generation of young women, pretty harassed and miserable. That's because they don't see us when we are at home in the middle of the week in our slippers, eating hobnobs and happily wri\nting papers! They only see us when we are in our work clothes, rushing off to meetings and generally looking excessively busy. Who can blame them for thinking \"I don't want that\" when they don't know that \"that\" also involves getting to every single school\n play, being able to go shopping in the middle of the week so as to free up Saturday for a sports event, or whatever else we get to do as flexible academics. We have a bit of a PR problem, I think, and ought to rectify that”. \nOne of our\n members actively so\nught mentoring through WISE “but \nthey couldn't find one for me. I was looking for a senior female academic, but apparently they didn't have any on their books\n. I suspect that lack of mentors is a real problem, and that will partly be because senior academi\ncs are already completely crushed\n by their responsibilities - \nespecially the females, who have to be on committees \netc.\n so that there is at least one female there\n”.\n1\n2\n. Of course, successful mentors and sponsors can be male or female - the important thing \nbeing the guiding influence they can provide and the opportunities they can identify and push younger scientists towards. In a highly competitive setting such as academia, having a champion can increase awareness of opportunities and the confidence to go f\nor them. There have been many public discussions about whether women are less likely to push themselves forward for promotion or negotiate than their male colleagues and some companies (e.g. dstl) have changed the way they promote to counter this, allowing\n supervisors to nominate people rather than waiting for people to nominate themselves. One of our members said: “\nI was pushed by my boss to move faster and \ntake responsibility before I thought I could - being given opportunities built my confidence”.\n&#xa0;\nRecog\nnition and reward for non-research activities\n1\n3\n. Another challenge within academia is that \nnon-research \nskills \n(e.g. leadership, mentoring, \npastoral care\n, teaching, project/lab management\n)\n appear to be largely ignored when it comes to advancing up the pyramid. Considering the impact sponsorship by a senior scientist can have on a rising career, it is worrying that the presence of this support is largely left to chance rather than being embe\ndded into academic culture. We feel that weighting promotions on the basis of wider skills (\nand including \n‘360-degree feedback’) once research calibre has been established would help reward those who contribute to a supportive work culture.\n1\n4\n. This also t\nouches on observations our members have made about the type of additional work taken on by women in STEM. It is widely known\n,\n but largely unstated\n,\n that in addition to pursuing their own research, \nPhD students and \npostdoc\ns are\n expected to undertake laboratory management activities and train students \namong other duties\n. Further up the pyramid, administration load and teaching responsibilities are not equally shared. We have encountered much frustration \nthat \nnon-research \nskills a\nren’t formally recognised or valued within academia. Anecdotally, our discussions have led us to believe that more women than men take on so-called ‘soft’ responsibilities and that the extra strain they place on ability to progress w\nith research activities\n may affect\n career advancement. We have also encountered frustration that \nlack of formal recognition means\n it \nis more difficult to convince other sectors of such capabilities - and this is, after all, the route most people will take. Our members have told \nus that moving to other sectors has required them to “start again” because there \nare \nmisconception\ns\n about what being \non \nan academic\n track\n entails: “it’s about more than the research itself but no one seems to realise that”.\n1\n5\n. In terms of other non-research skills, our members have also felt their public engagement work to be undervalued. \nGirls \nand women continue to be underrepresented in STEM,\n and so\n promoting diversity and visible female role models (including in the media) \nis a critical part of inspiring the next generation and expanding the UK STEM skills base. The majority of \noutreach \nwork is done on a volunteer basis alongside a full time job and other responsibilities. \nI\nt is not \nefficient or \nsustainable to \ndepend \non good\nwill alone. \nWhat can be done to address these challenges?\n1\n6\n. \nT\nhere is a prevailing culture of confusion in which options and entitlements around starting a family are not clear or openly discussed. Universities and the HE sector should be doing more to \ndiscuss these issues in a positive way, making policy clear to gr\nant holders, staff and students\n,\n and\n \np\nolicies should be harmonised across the full range of funding bodies. Policies that tackle investment in childcare (operating hours, waiting lists and af\nfordability) are badly needed. In addition, funding opportunities that are exclusively available to those with caring responsibilities\n,\n \n‘s\ntopping the clock’ on academic age during a \ncaring \ncareer break\n and more late career/reentry fellowships\n \nmay help redu\nce competitive disadvantage. \n17\n. \nWe advocate the cultivation of\n an academic environment that more consistently nurtures rising careers\n. \nSupport for formal m\nentoring is\n one such approach\n and many institutions have mentoring programmes\n. \nHowever, it \nis \na significant undertaking and should be \nrewarded and valued \nas such\n,\n perhaps by offering incentives, formal recognition and\n \ntraining\n.\n \n18\n. \nDoctoral Training Centres \nthat \nhelp incubate young talent\n may be an interesting model\n: a\n \nD\neputy \nP\nrogramme \nD\nirector at\n one such Centre told u\ns that their advantages include\n “\nthe allocation of staff resources who are committed to deliver a high standards of postgraduate training; peer to peer learning environment; the cohort based teaching and learning; access to a broader\n audiences through the Centre as an interface between academia, industry and society overall”. \n \n19\n. Another approach is to e\nnsur\ne\n \nthat academics who progress\n \nto senior positions \nare not only good scientists but also good leaders and managers\n, which is not\n only beneficial for research environments but also productivity\n. N\non-research skills \nshould be formally recognised and taken into account \nwhen \nhiring or \nselecting people for promotion\n. Recognition would also place value on the many non-research activities\n required \nwithin\n academia and support \nthe \nprogression \nof those moving \nout of thi\ns \nsector.\n \n2\n0\n. We also advocate transparency in selection/promotion procedures - and in negotiating pay. Comments from a female Professor support this: “I think the system is \nvery unfair - you can have tw\no equally productive professors, with \nProfessor A could be being paid nearly twice Professor B. Furthermore, because this is all negotiated secretly, Professor B may know nothing about this and think their salary is normal. Thi\ns isn't hypothetical - I did a professorial pay-productivity review recently (for Athena SWAN) and while pay and productivity generally correlate, there are some notable disparities”. \n2\n1\n. How the flow of money is managed within academia compared to \nindustry is also something we would like to see examined. We have encountered frustration regarding inflexibility in\n the system\n, for example a female Fellow told us:\n “I can see that Universities are stymied by the limitations on how they can spend money an\nd hire people, and by the vast timescales it takes to find money to make new hires. In companies this seems to be easier to fix, because the funding is basically internal. \n&#xa0;\nBut one of the reasons that Universities are so dreadful at all this is that they d\non't feel they can do the logical things to solve the problem, because they don't have the money”. \n2\n2\n. \nW\ne also feel that it is unrealistic to continue telling PhD students and postdocs that an academic track is the only successful way to use their STEM ed\nucation and training. \nRetaining talent is important, and investing in a\n new tier of ‘permanent researchers’\n is one approach, but\n there are many successful paths in addition to academia. We believe that it would be useful to reframe the pipeline to include \nthose who move to other primary and secondary STEM careers. With this in mind, our members have told us that they would value better early careers advice regarding awareness of these opportunities, training in how to compete/succeed in other sectors and to\n find ways to ensure qualifications and experiences accrued to date were more formally recognised and appreciated by other sectors. \n2\n3\n. We would also like to note that many of these chall\nenges affect both men and women\n and \nthere is\n \na need\n to modernise \nacademia\n for everyone. \nClosing comments\n2\n4\n. ScienceGrrl would be happy to provide further information on the points raised here, to discuss them further with the Committee and to recommend oral witnesses or other specialist sources. \nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.cancerresearchuk.org/science/funding/terms-conditions/grant-conditions/studentships/\n \nhttp://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/documents/tcfec.pdf\n \nhttp://www2.le.ac.uk/institution/athena-swan/maternity-leave-and-grants/copy_of_maternity-leave-and-grants\n \nhttp://www.daphnejackson.org/\n"
