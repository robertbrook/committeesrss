default(ECA) 
defaultwelcomes the opportunity to respond to the Select Committee’s call for evidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ECA 
defaultsupports the comments made in the submission by Certsure. However, n
defaultotwithstanding the ECA’s role in Certsure,
default we felt i
defaultt important to make our own standalone response given our role 
defaultas a trade association 
defaultin representing the views of our 2,800 member
defaults
default, 
defaultthe broad scope of the Committee’s questions, and by dint of our experience in seeking to 
defaultenhance
default 
defaultsafety and the quality o
defaultf work 
defaultundertaken in the domestic market.
default&#xa0;
defaultSummary of defaultkey ECA pointsdefault&#xa0;
defaultAbout the ECAdefault&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe Electrical Contractors’ Association is the UK’s largest trade association representing electrical engineering and contracting companies. 
defaultOur members
default range from local electricians to national companies with several branches employing thousands. ECA members
default operate in the commercial and industrial sectors, as well as the domestic market. As
default 
defaultsuch, they 
defaultcarry out a wide range of work from domestic heating
default and lighting to installing cutting edge, environmental control technology on major projects and buildings such as Heathrow terminal 5 and the London 2012 Olympic Park.
default Most of the large contractors in the UK are members however, t
defaulthe bulk of ECA members ar
defaulte small to medium-sized contractors.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur competent person scheme activities are now carried out through Certsure.
default&#xa0;
defaultSince its formation in 1901, the ECA has championed safety, quality and standards within the electrical contracting industry. This included
default 
defaultin 1923
default, for instance, establishing a Guarantee of Work scheme to underwrite the work of its members as a guarantee to their customers, and in 1968, forming the Joint Industry Board with (now) Unite the Union to create a card to identify ski
defaultlled operatives
default for the benefit
default o
defaultf employers/consumers (which is required for those working in
default the commercial and industrial
default sector
defaults
default). 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe public as a whole are not generally aw
defaultare of the structure by which 
defaultelectrical 
defaultcontractors are assessed a
defaults
default competent. However, we note that among those who understand the ne
defaulted to use a competent contractor, there is strong brand awareness of the NICEIC brand
default in particular
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe that the issue is wider – we need to educate the public around the dangers of electrical DIY
default and rogue traders, as well as leaving
default any domestic electrical jobs to a registered 
defaultprofessional, so that they are 
defaultalways 
defaultencouraged to seek a registered contractor in the first place. We need to do more work 
defaultto understand 
defaulthow
default 
defaulthomeowners source contractors. 
defaultIn the majority of cases, this is li
defaultkely to be via a personal recommendation that is not based on whether an electrician has been assessed as competent. Of the small number
default (10
default%) 
defaultof domestic cust
defaultomers that do search the web
default, they may often do so
default through one of the number of unregulated sites
default that offer lists of traders that have not necessarily been assessed as competent.
default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultt was our intention as the in
defaultdustry
default trade b
defaultody, working with the industry
default charity
default,
default to establish a 
defaultthird-party 
defaultcertification 
defaultscheme
default operator
default 
defaultin Certsure 
default(replacing NICEIC, 
defaultELECSA and ECA Certification
default schemes
default) 
defaultthat could
default,
default 
defaultthrough a single brand – covering 80% of contractors doing 90% of the work –
defaultfund 
defaultbetter resourced 
defaultcampaigns aimed at promoting the importance of finding a registered electrician
default.
default 
defaultIndeed, the ECA and the Ele
defaultctrical Safety Council 
defaulthave 
defaultcommitted to surpluses going towards such awareness-raising 
defaultactivities.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs is covered in more depth later in the submission, 
defaultCertsure’s recent agreement with
default 
defaultNapit 
defaultto seek to develop one mark, underpinned by a register of elect
defaultricians 
defaultregistered as competent
default, 
defaultwill help in this regard.
default 
defaultIndeed, w
defaultith the public more likely to recognise, understand and act on the basis of a 
defaultthird-party 
defaultcertification 
defaultbrand – as opposed to
default taking notice of
default the comp
defaultetent person scheme structure or
default the Building Regulations – we ar
defaulte confident of driving up electrical safety awareness
default 
defaultaround the new mark.
default 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultPart P of the Building Regulations, through the compete
defaultnt person scheme operators, tests companies
default ability to ensure that safe electrical work is undertaken
default. As part of 
defaultthis, it assesses 
defaultthe
default training and experience of the key individual or individuals
default (
defaultknow
defaultn as 
defaultQS
defaults)
default with
defaultin a 
defaultfirm 
defaultlegally 
defaultresponsible for signing off on electrical work
default in the domestic environment.
default 
defaultQSs are assessed in their own right and are also responsible
default for the competences of others they 
defaultoversee.
default This
default assessment process is 
defaultsufficiently robust
default and 
defaultindividuals need to be able to carry out
default and manage
default electrical
default work
default safe
defaultl
defaulty and correctly in order to pass.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst qualifications designed for 
defaultindividuals
default to
default enter the domestic industry have
default existed for decades, the introduction of Part P has brought about an auditable trail for over 40,000 registered c
defaultontract
defaulting firms
default across all schemes. 
defaultRegistration with Certsure, for instance, confirms that QSs
default hold the minimum qualifications and have been assessed as competent to undertake safe electrical work.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen Part P was implemented, it allowed companies to obtain Part P status without 
defaultthe individual responsible for signing off on work
default being required to h
defaultold
default a qualification.
default Concerned 
defaultab
defaultout the implications for consumer safety and standards in the industry, the ECA sought to change this.
defaultThe ECA, along 
defaultwith 
defaultother competent person scheme operators, and the DCLG, sit on the Electrotechnical Assessment 
defaultSpecif
defaultication 
defaultCommittee, which sets the standards
default 
defaultfor 
defaultQSs
default in the domestic sector. 
default(
defaultThe industry’s professional body, the Institution of Engineering and Technology, acts as the Secretariat.
default)
default 
defaultThrough the EAS Committee, t
defaulthe ECA has played a leading role in the adop
defaulttion of higher minimum standards for QS
defaults
default, 
defaultwhich came into force in 
defaultApril 201
default3
default 
defaultfor
default new
default entrants and those moving jobs
default. 
defaultThis has ensured
default that partly trained operatives 
defaulthave
default cost effective routes to upskill to the current standard 
defaultand gain a Level 3 qualifica
defaulttion
default.
default 
defaultWe believe that 
defaultover time 
defaultthe
defaultse
default changes will allow us to raise standards in the industry 
defaultby increasing the numbers of operatives to acquire formal Level 3 qualifications
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, we have also established a progression route for domestic electri
defaultcians to be able to upskill to move into carrying out work in the commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) sectors. 
defaultIt should be noted that d
defaultifferent entry standards exist depending on whether someone is working in the domestic, or 
defaultC&amp;I sectors
default. In the C&amp;I sector
defaults
default, 
defaultwhere work can be of a greater complexity, 
defaultall 
defaultoperatives 
defaulthave to acquire a
defaultn (ECS)
default 
defaultskills-card 
defaultequivalent to Level 3 
defaultwhich allows them to work.
default Indeed, in our role of promoting standards, the ECA actually encourages domestic QSs to hold an ECS skills-card
default,
default whic
defaulth clearly shows an individual’s qualifications and 
defaultdemonstrates their 
defaultlicence to practise
default.
default 
defaultWe
default would support 
defaultthe 
defaultadoption of this model 
default(
defaultwhich already exists and is highly valued and endorsed by the industry and Unite the Union
default)
default as a requirement 
defaultfor QS
defaults in the domestic sector.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe assessment process is thorough 
defaultand we do not believe it is possible for a contractor to pass the assessment if it cannot demonstrate how to carry out electrical work safely.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn terms of the process of reviewing the performance of contractors, t
defaulthe
default Part P 
defaultcompetent person 
defaultscheme
default 
defaultassessmen
defaultt 
defaultrequire
defaults
default that an adequate sample of work is taken to represent the activities of the contractor. 
defaultRe-a
defaultssessment is conducted annually through questioning and observation. 
default 
defaultA f
defaulteature of the assessment is that the work is randomly checked
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese a
defaultssessment
defaults are conducted by assessors who are themselves required to have achieved a level of competence in excess of that which they are required to assess. The competence of assessors is reviewed annually 
defaultby the
default 
defaultUK
default 
defaultA
defaultccreditation 
defaultS
defaultervice
default and a regime of CPD is req
defaultuired to maintain their effectiveness and the consistency of all assessments
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is important that the certification regime reflects the range of competencies found across the domestic electrical labour force, and that it can ensure that works carried 
defaultout 
defaultunder the scope of Part P comply with the Wiring Regulations – which governs all electrical work.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAfter 
defaulta 
defaultn
defaultotifiable
default 
defaultjob 
defaultis carried out by a registered contractor, the contractor will 
defaultnotify the
default scheme operator 
defaultwhich works have taken place via an online tool. This information is sent to the local authority for where the 
defaultjob
default was carried out, with the scheme operator also send
defaulting a certificate to the homeowner confirming who did the work
defaults
default and that the work
defaults
default compl
defaulty
default with the Building Regulations.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs noted earlier, a typical sample of the work that contractors perform is assessed on an annual basis. 
defaultE
defaultxperienced
default,
default 
defaultUKAS-assessed 
defaultasse
defaultssors will conduct random inspections of this sample of work. They will check the work carried out and seek the correct justification for why the work was undertaken in the way that it was. As such, the assessment does not just 
defaultcheck whether work has been
default 
defaultcarried out correctly in
default these instances, but probes whether the contractor still maintains the methodological basis for working safely and correctly.
default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultt is 
defaultalso 
defaultcritical to assess companies
default’
default ability to
default manage work, as well as test their
default staff who are
default qual
defaultified 
defaultto sign off on work
default,
default as we know that either in isolation is not sufficient.  
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom Certsure’s operations, we note that approximately 20% of assessments either fail the contractor or recommend corrections that must 
defaultbe 
defaultadopt
defaulted in the contractor’s
default way o
defaultf working. 
default Common p
defaultroblems found through inspections are used to inform the production of advisory and training materials to create a virtuous cycle of safety improvement.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is important to note that in the majority of cases, domestic consumers choose an electrician on the basis of a personal recommendation (who may or may not be 
defaultcertified as competent). Of the small majority
default (
default10
default%) 
defaultthat choose to find an electrician via the internet, they may do so from a variety of websites, many of which, such
default as
default 
defaultCheckatrade and Rated People
default (which are recommendation-based), are not 
defaultregistered under the DCLG’s competent person scheme
default.
default Indeed, we understand that Which? will also be
default launching a similar register. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMany of these online registers belong to organisations that are not licensed by the DCLG, and some of which do not qualify th
defaulteir listed tradespeople based on technical assessment or competence.
default Of the current 
defaultseven entities 
defaultthat are 
defaultlicensed to operate electrical schemes
default by the DCLG – including both registers currently operated by Certsure and NAPIT – the public can be 
defaultsure that
default the contractor
defaults listed under these are
default assessed as competent.
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite this, 
defaultwe appreciate
default there have recently been concerns expressed over the potential for confusion amongst consumers 
defaultwith 
defaultmore than one register that references electrical firms registere
defaultd under Part P of the Building Regulations. In order to overcome these concerns, a meeting 
defaultwas recently held between
default 
defaultCertsure and Napit
default 
defaultwhere it was agreed
default 
defaultthat they would 
defaultseek to develop one easily identifiable quality mark, underpinned by a register of a
defaultll full scope Part P registered electricians, that provides a single point of reference for consumers to refer to when seeking an electrician to do
default electrical work in their home.
defaultIt is anticipated that the proposal will include all licensed Part P Scheme O
defaultperators in England and Wales who meet the new scheme requirements in line with DCLG’s timeline.
default&#xa0;
defaultNotwithstanding this development, we wish to explore the effect competition has had between competent person scheme operators
default to date
default. Indeed, w
defaulte believe that 
defaultc
defaultompetition has
default had
default some benefits for the electrician and homeowner. 
defaultS
defaultcheme operato
defaultrs 
defaultcompete
default to offer
default 
defaultlow 
defaultprice
defaults to contractors
default. This includes 
defaultthe cost of annual scheme registration paid by contractor
defaults and the cost per notification
default. 
defaultWe note that 
defaultCertsure’
defaults 
defaultannual registration fee 
defaultpaid by contractors 
defaultis £370, with a notification fee of between £1.50 and £3.00 per job depending on whether a contractor 
defaultis on a scheme which offers an
default insurance-backed guarantee option. 
default(All ECA members are covered under the ECA
default Guarantee of Work Scheme).
default 
defaultThis certainly compares very favourably to what some local authorities may charge to approve
default work
default, as we
defaultll as saving
default the contractor time
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe creation of Certsure has also allowed 
defaultpromotion of the competent person scheme 
defaultto
default a level that Governm
defaultent may not have wanted to fund. This has happened
default as 
defaulta 
defaultresult of the DCLG encouraging a competitive market in third-party certification.
default&#xa0;
defaultIndeed, we note that the Select Committee itself 
defaulthas 
defaultrecognised the benefits of the 
defaultself-certification model, which has been run through a competitive competent person scheme framework. It was noted in the March 2012 report on the Building Regulations applying to gas and electricity that contractors save on time, effort and money, consume
defaultrs have a point of redress, and rogue traders are not able to satisfy the scheme operators to be able to self-certify work.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe D
defaultCLG supervises the 
defaultaccreditation 
defaultschemes
default (includes other
default trades as well as electrical)
default. 
defaultIt was stated
default in June 2012 that full compliance with 
defaultUKAS accreditation 
defaultwill be a 
defaultrequirement 
defaultfor DCLG-scheme operators

defaultm 12 June 2014.
default However for the electrotechnical scheme (Part P)
default, it
default 
defaultis already a requirement and b
defaultot
defaulth ELECSA and NICEIC achieved their accreditation in 2002 and in 2008 respectively. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultUKAS accreditation requires a tough assessment to ensure that the certification body has robust systems and processes in place to demonstrate how it 
defaultsatisfies the followin

defaultThe above-mentioned

defaulteffective from June 2012 for f
defaultull compliance by 12 June 2014 
defaultrequires all scheme operators to be accredited by 
defaultUKAS against EN45011 for product certification. DCLG should
default, in the ECA’s view,
default stick to this requirement, as this demonstrates the confidence that UKAS has, through assessment and accreditation, of the various schemes.
