[[[&#xa0;]]]The Federation of Master Builders (FMB) is the largest trade association in the UK construction industry, and with more than 9,000 members, it is the recognised voice of small and medium-sized (SME) construction firms. Established in 1941 to protect the interests of SME building firms, the FMB is independent and non-profit-making, lobbying continuously for members’ interests at both national and local levels. The FMB is a source of knowledge, professional advice and support for its members across the UK.&#xa0;Included in this is the FMB’s route to certification and registrations services as part of its ‘complete solution’ service to member firms that are committed to delivering the highest standards of customer service and workmanship in the building industry. The FMB route to certification is offered through a service agreement with NAPIT and provides FMB members with a route to Competent Person Scheme Registration, Electrical Installer Certification, Green Deal Installer Certification and Microgeneration (MCS) Installer Certification &#xa0;

[[[THE FMB’S VIEWS ON BUILDING REGULATIONS CERTIFICATION OF ELECTRICAL INSLATTAION AND REPAIRS IN DWELLINGS]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The FMB argues that:&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The majority of the consumers lack awareness of competent persons schemes in general and do not know that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations;&#xa0;2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The ‘Electrotechnical Assessment Specification for use by Certification and Registration Bodies’ is sufficiently robust in setting out the technical competence requirements for a business to be certified/registered as competent to undertake electrical work. However, the FMB does have a concern that in some schemes, the number of electrical operatives that a ‘qualified supervisor’ is responsible for may be excessive. We have been reliably informed that a ratio of one qualified supervisor to 25 operatives is permitted in some schemes. If this is the case, we consider that the ratio to be far too high;&#xa0;3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Within the electrical competent persons scheme, the vast majority of those carrying out electrical works do review their work sufficiently to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Building Regulations;&#xa0;4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Competition between certification/registration bodies is both healthy and necessary. Many electrical installers have an established and long-term relationship with their certification/registration body and any move to force installers to use a single certification/registration body would not be well received by the electrical contracting industry;&#xa0;5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The creation of two separate registers of electricians i.e. ‘ElectricSafe Register’ and ‘Electrical Safety Register’ was a negative and inappropriate step. However, given the general lack of consumer awareness of the two registers, at this stage the impact of the creation of two registers on public confusion is limited. There is still a great opportunity to establish a single register that, if correctly marketed and supported, could play a significant role in raising public awareness, improving electrical safety and increasing compliance with the Building Regulations;&#xa0;6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The relationship between the Government endorsed TrustMark scheme, and registration of electrical contractors, needs to be considered. The TrustMark scheme includes registration for electrical work. The fact that TrustMark is so consumer focussed has the potential to confuse the general public if they are faced with what in effect is another register of electricians;&#xa0;7)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The adequacy of the supervision by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) of the electrical competent person scheme operators has, to date, not been as robust as it perhaps should have been. However, given that the revised competent persons scheme ‘Conditions of Authorisation’ includes a requirement for UKAS accreditation to standard BS EN 45011: 1998 (or latest equivalent) we consider that going forward the supervision via UKAS will be quite adequate.

[[[IONS TO ]]]

[[[THE CLG SELECT ]]]

[[[COMMITTEE]]]&#xa0;The FMB urges the Committee to make the following recommendations to government, ensuring that:&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A single register of domestic electricians exists;&#xa0;2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It supports the promotion of the register;&#xa0;3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The register offers a single point of contact for consumers;&#xa0;4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The register is inclusive and open to all existing and any future UKAS accredited electrical competent persons scheme operators;&#xa0;5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The register is operated as a separate business entity to any existing competent persons scheme but for the competent persons scheme operators to be able, to and be required to, participate in the governance of the register;&#xa0;6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Electrical competent persons scheme operators are able to continue to operate with commercial independence, whilst fulfilling the requirements for their members to be included on the register;&#xa0;7)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It reviews the relationship between the TrustMark scheme and the domestic electrician register, and puts in place arrangements that prevent or remove consumer confusion regarding the register and TrustMark.&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
