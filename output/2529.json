"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Walsall Housing Group1.0 Executive SummaryThis submission\n \n&#xa0;\n2.0 About whgwhg\n is one of the largest social housing providers in the \nWest Midlands\n. It owns and manages around 19,000 properties in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall, housing almost 40,000 people, around one fifth of the borough’s population. \nwhg\n was founded in 2003 with the transfer of Walsall Council’s housing stock and has since in\nvested over £350 million in \nthat stock.  It \nhas developed a range of services that go beyond the landlord’s traditional contractual role and support customers to sustain their tenancies.\n3.0 Reason for submissionWhg\n is \na large landlord\n \nand has \nconducted r\nesearch into the impact of the reforms and expects \nsome challen\nges for\n \nitself and its customers\n. It\n believes that its \nfindings, \nexperience\n and \ndevelopment of \nbest practice \nwill help to\n \ninform \nthe \ninquiry\n into\n the effects of welfare reform and how housing providers\n can mitigate them.\n    \n&#xa0;\n4.0 Implications of the welfare reforms on whg and its customersw\nhg\n \nhas assessed \nthe potential impacts of \nthe social sector size criteria, the overall benefit cap and the \ndirect payment of Universal Credit\n. These \nreform \nmeasures were chosen because of the direct nature of their impact on housing providers\n and customers\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.1 \nSize Criteria \n&#xa0;\nw\nhg\n predicted that the social sector size criteria would affect 2,800 customers under-occupying according to the Department for Work and Pensions \noccupancy \nrules. This would create a shortfall between rent due and benefit paid of some £1.9 million pounds\n pe\nr annum\n.\n \nIt is still relatively early in the process of assessing the \nactual \nimpact, but \nwhg’s\n \nrecords \nat the end of August suggest an increase in rent arrears \nin excess of £750,000 in this financial year\n,\n of which \njust under £400,000 can be directly attri\nbuted to the size criteria\n. \n \nThe\n shortfall of \nHousing Benefit represents the amount of total rent\nnot be\ning\n eligible for payment of Housing Benefit and which must be\npaid by \nwhg\n customers from elsewhere within their benefit income or other\nmeans.\n Initial research showed that \n1 bedroom under\n-\noccupiers\n had average rents of \n£86.30\n per week and when a \n14% \ndeduction was applied, there w\nas \na \n£12.05\n shortfall\n. Where \n2 or more bedroom\ns were under-occupied incurring a 25% deduction, the average weekly rent\n was \n£84.82\n with a \n£21.21\n shortfall\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.2 \nDirect payments to Universal Credit claimants\n&#xa0;H\nousing \nBenefit has not \nbeen \npaid \ndirectly to \nthe vast majority of \nbenefit claimants in recent years, \nso \nit has been difficult to obtain consistent and reliable evidence on the likely magnitude of \npotential \nloss of rent\n revenue from switching to payment to claimants \nwhen Universal Credit is rolled out. \nWhile \nthe direct payment demonstration projects were set \nup\n to provide such guidance\n, it has become apparent that there are many variations by location\n, the nature of the stock\n and \ndemographics\n. \nT\nhe guarded \nculture around the projects \nhas not \nassisted \nlandlords to \nobtain \na feel for \nthe magnitude of\n \ndirect payments’ likely \nimpact\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nGathering meaningful information has been \nfurther complicated by changes to the \nUniversal Credit \nroll out programme\n. If the roll\n \nout timescale, geographical spread and complexity of the claims allowed\n \nis not known, provide\nrs cannot model the rate at which the effects of direct payment will be felt\n without a large margin of error\n.\n \nWhg\n has therefore erred on the side of prudence by \nsubstantially increasing \nits bad debt provision.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.3 \nOverall Benefit Cap\n&#xa0;\nThe benefit cap may\n lead to a loss of rent income\n where \nfamilies \nhave to adjust to \nreduced budgets\n. \nC\napped households are being asked to prioritise their \nspending \nfrom a shrinking budget and th\nerefore\n housing providers are in competit\ni\non with other\n demands on the household p\nurse\n. \nAdvice agencies \noften \nexpress the idea t\nhat \ncustomers \nshould prioritise the roof over \ntheir heads, \nbut the fact that excess\n awards are \nsliced off \nbenefit to pay for housing \nsends a subliminal message to tenants that housing \nis their \nleast priority\n. \nThis w\nill \ninevitably lead to rent payments being missed, arrears being built up and tenancies at risk of not being sustained.     \n&#xa0;5.0 whg Mitigation against the impacts of reformAs a result of the impacts to the organisation and its customers, \nwhg\n \ndeveloped a\n comprehensive \naction plan to mitigate the \nmajor \neffects of the reform measures with the aim\ns\n of \nmitigating the impacts on its customers \nand \nmaximising \nits ability to \ncontinue to \nprovide \nexcellent \nhousing and related \nservice\ns. \nSome \ninitiatives from \nthe plan are set out \nbelow\n.\n5.1 Customer Services Training and Scripting\nThe impact of the reforms across \nwhg’s\n customer base meant that as many colleagues as possible needed to be given relevant \ntraining \nabout the reforms so that a triage\n service was viable\n. Training enabled \nwhg\n colleagues to help as many customers as possible with queries at the first point of contact, whilst more complex issues were referred to specialist\n colleagues\n. In addition, scripts were developed and available for \nanyone in the business to access via the internal computer network to use to guide responses to incoming queries. \n5.2 Communications Strategy\nThe broad impact also governed \nwhg’s\n communications strategy. With a large number of affected customers, a variet\ny of\n methods of contact was adopted\n for \nour diverse customer base. Methods adopted included personal contact, \nmail shot\n, customer leaflets, website information, social media such as Twitter and \nFacebook\n as well as engaging customers to talk about welfare r\neform issues in the course of everyday business.\n5.3 Financial Inclusion Review\nF\ninancial inclusion provision was reviewed\n and the \ndecision was taken to recruit three money mentors to supplement the Welfare Benefit and Debt Advice function and provide a tr\niage service to customers \nlikely to be af\nfected by under-occup\nation deductions and \nthe benefit cap. It is expected that this work will continue for Universal Credit\n claimants who may be vulnerable and need help to cope with direct benefit payment to them.\n5.4 Direct Debit as Preferred method of Payment\nThe replacement of \nlandlord direct \npayment with \ndirect \npayment \nto claimants of \nUniversal Credit \nwill \nmean that customers \nwill \nhave \na responsibility to pay rent where th\ne fact that they pay rent \nmay not necess\narily be apparent to them under the current Housing Benefit system. The consequence will be that at least some proportion of rent payments will not be made because of the switch.\n \nTo minimise loss\n of rent income from direct payment\n, \nwhg\n adopted direct debi\nt as its preferred method of \npa\nyment. All new tenants since September 2012 have been required to set up direct debits or find a suitable \nproxy \nmethod\n such as via a budgeting or jam jar account. Extensive work has been done to incorporate affordability and \nmoney management training into the pre-tenancy customer experience.\n This training is also available to those \ncustomers who approach \nwhg\n to give notice on their tenancy because they are experiencing affordability issues.\nT\nhe \nadditional \ngoal was set to get a\nll existing customers \nto go on \nto direct debit. To support this\n, \na choice of only two direct debit payment days per month has been replaced with ‘any day’ direct debit so that customers can synchronise their rent payment with the date that they receive ben\nefit payments.\n Our latest figures from August 2013 show that direct debit take up is increasing at roughly 400 customers on average each month.\n5.5 \nBudgeting or Jam Jar Accounts\nIf a customer does not have a\n bank account or is unsuitably banked, \nwhg\n signpo\nsts its customers to the local \nWalsave\n credit union\n. \nWalsave\n \noffers a budgeting account w\nhich has the \nfacility to mimic a direct debit payment\n. To encourage take up, \nwhg\n pays the first year’s set up and administration costs of £23, which means that \ncustomers do not have to pay transaction charges in the first year.\n A personal spending pot is set up and \nwhg\n adds ten pounds to it on setting up the account with the ability to add another five pounds if the customer maintains a clear rent account for six\n months.\n \nTo make it as easy as possible for customers to sign up for a budgeting account, \na\n \nwhg\n colleague has been seconded to \nWalsave\n to be available in the main \nwhg\n reception area \nso that \nimmediate help\n is available if customers decide that a jam jar acc\nount is beneficial to them\n. \nThe requirement for customers to pay by direct debit or ‘jam jar’ account attempts to mitigate the \neffects \nof customers no longer pa\ny\ning by benefit direct. \nwhg\n believes that \nhousing should be considered as a\nn essential househol\nd expenditure\n along with council tax\n, utilities\n and food\n. In an ideal world, it would \nprefer\n \npayment \nunder Universal Credit to be made direct from benefit\n. \n I\nn the medium to long term\n, this \nwould result in lower \npublic sector \ncosts as there would be less h\nomelessness and finance\n-\nrelated household stre\nss\n.)\n5.6 \nWincred\n (\nWalsall\n in Credit)\nAs planning for reform proceeded, \nwhg\n was \nwholly \naware that it could not do all of the work necessary to mitigate reform on its own. Partnership working was therefore of \nvital importance\n. \nIn Walsall, financial inclusion work is co-ordinated through the \nWincred\n partnership, an umbrella organisation for all partners with an interest in the financial wellbeing of Walsall residents. Members include various department of the lo\ncal authority, \nWalsave\n, Citizens Advice Bureau and various advice and third sector bodies. \nThe partners\n have undertaken campaigns such as one warning vulnerable tenants against the threat of loan sharks and doorstep lenders.  \n5.7 I.T.’s Your Life\nPartners\nhip between \nwhg\n and Walsall Adult and Community College (WACC) brought a \nnew \ndigital inclusion \ninitiative \ninto being\n. A small sample survey early in the process of welfare reform planning showed that only 58% or residents had suitable home-based internet a\nccess for the purpose of claiming Universal Credit in line with the government’s stated wish for people to claim online.\n The “I.T.’s Your Life” programme was born from th\ne partnership\n with WACC\n. The programme uses public facilities \nsuch as public libraries\n \nto run short courses which enable \npeople to get access to computers, develop skills to use online services and to set up an email address. \nCrucially, \nthose finishing the course are enabled to \nm\nake and manage benefit claims digitally.\n5.8\n Independent Livin\ng Team workshops for external organisations\nAside from formal partnerships, \nwhg’s\n Independent Living Team organised a series of free workshops \nat which \npartner organisations, stakeholders\n, \nNHS and other health and social services\n were \ngiven a \npresent\nation \nto engage them and make them more aware of welfare reform issues\n. This\n knowledge inform\ned\n their\n subsequent \ninteractions with \nthe \nmore vulnerable\n customers\n affected by the changes\n. The\n series of eight\n workshops w\nas\n \nover-subscribed and feedback rated the \nsessions as excellent\n. The sessions were\n replicated regionally a\nt the request of the \nWest Midlands Best Use of Stock partnership\n.\n6.0 Conclusionwhg’s\n approach to welfare reform recognises that the organisation and our customers will face difficult times a\ns the welfare reforms come into effect and beyond. Plans were developed to include as many mitigating interventions as possible to help sustain tenancies and to maintain services. \nThe mitigations have been positively received in Walsall and it is hoped tha\nt they will help to inform the debate on how tenants, especially vulnerable ones, can be helped\n nationally\nWhilst we cautiously look forward to the introduction of Universal Credit the issue of \ndirect payment of the housing element of Universal credit is o\nne that should be reviewed. The greater benefit of household stability far outweighs the desire to replicate the household budget of working households.\n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
