Written evidence submitted by Dr Peter Dean MA, DSC, DPhil, FRSC [bold]cchem[bold] (FFS005)[bold]Preamble: 
[normal]It is worth saying at the outset that 
[normal]Chi Onwurah
[normal],
[normal] MP received a number of these points 
[normal]from myself 
[normal]just 
[normal]pri
[normal]or to the decision to close FSS.
[normal] For the record, I am a scientist, inventor and chairman of a small British biotech company (Cambio Ltd)
[normal] who offer tools for research in molecular biology including DNA for forensic analysis.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My answers to the specific questions in your brief:
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The government
[normal] does not seem to have an effective strategy for forensic science and even that which was working has been closed down for trivial advantages in cost-cutting.
[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The closure was done in such haste that the equipment was 
[normal]probably not sold to the best people
[normal]3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The impact on the CJS is discussed above and the closure has put a halt to basic forensic research because university departments offering forensic training are not adequately funded to support research programme
[normal]s
[normal]4)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The role of the regulator should be to monitor and deal with conflicts of interest as discussed above
[normal]5)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I have no knowledge of the size of the forensic market 
[normal](except to say our share of the market is small (less than £2M) 
[normal]but the following companies should give the committee a reasonable idea; 
[normal]LGC, 
[normal]PFS; K
[normal]ey forensics
[normal], 
[normal]Cellmark
[normal]; I gather that several are unable to sustain their employee base at present levels and are 
[normal]making staff redundant so tha
[normal]t I would think there is likely to be a shake up in this sector
[normal]6)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I have n
[normal]o working knowledge
[normal] of procurement of forensics services by police forces
[normal]7)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is no doubt in my mind that the loss of the FSS workforce will result in a continued erosion of justice in this country simply because data bases are now unavailable, the specimen libraries are just one example. The lack of support for cold case reviews is deeply troubling.
[normal]8)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I cannot comment on the archive since we do not access them – all we have been doing is to assist in the PCR amplification of forensic samples and this market has been 
[normal]seriously eroded
[normal] as a result of the FSS closure
[normal]January 2013
