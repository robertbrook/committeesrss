[[[Introduction.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Each of the issues identified by the Committee are answered in turn below.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[1. ]]]

[[[How do Government and local ]]]

[[[authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?]]]&#xa0;1.1. People often make decisions on where they live and where they work based on current provision, so there is a need to produce a degree of stability in the provision of the public transport network. It is more difficult to identify unmet demand, and this will often take a long period of time to translate into significant passenger flows. Most focus on potential new services relates to new housing and business developments. In Devon the means of identifying demand includes through:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport]]]

[[[ to isolated communities?]]]&#xa0;2.1. In Devon most bus services are now low floor/ accessible. Conventional bus services are augmented by:&#xa0;2.2. In Devon 27% of passenger journeys on supported bus services are to/ from work (Passenger Focus survey 2013). While it is difficult to provide empirical evidence, it would appear safe to assume that there is low time-elasticity for people travelling to work (little ability to continue in work if times change significantly). This compares to essential access to other services - e.g.  town centre services, shopping, chemists, and other services people need to use - which can often be expected to be more flexible (high time-elasticity) enabling these needs to be broadly met within wider service time bands.   &#xa0;2.3. It is often stated that the travel needs of young people are not well served by pre-booked Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) services – and are therefore better served by regular timetabled services as there is a high degree of “turn-up-and-go” in their travel patterns.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services ]]]

[[[to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?]]]&#xa0;3.1. In relation to meeting need, to perhaps state the obvious, cost-efficient public transport requires significant passenger flows to provide the fares income to offset costs. Rural areas have flows which are diverse and often cannot easily be aggregated together into cost-efficient routes.&#xa0;3.2. Transport in rural areas is often characterised by diverse demands to many different locations. The rural economy is often made up of many different employers (SMEs) in different locations. Significant and established flows are therefore often difficult to find.&#xa0;3.3. It is difficult to provide for all the interchange needs of people living along a route, as many interchange opportunities can conflict. And different interchange needs at e.g. a station from bus to train or vice versa, or in different directions, may not be compatible – unless the vehicle waits at the station thereby increasing journey time (and inconvenience for other passengers) and operating costs through less efficient vehicle utilisation. As with many decisions on shaping the public transport network, the decision tends to favour “the greatest benefit for the greatest number” – which will mean that not all needs can be met.&#xa0;3.4. In meeting demands, much depends on local geography. Therefore different service types and models fit different areas best, and a single service model is unlikely to meet all rural needs. Depending on population, where there are fewer roads there may tend to be a greater concentration of travel demand on a corridor, and a greater number of people travelling on a public transport route. &#xa0;3.5. Devon County Council (DCC) has operated 12 Fare car schemes – a taxi-bus DRT service -  across the county with very different costs/ passenger resulting. DRT often has higher costs per passenger than conventional bus services, and again geography is a key influence on whether this is the case. There is not a continuum of reducing service levels and reducing costs from high frequency buses to low frequency buses to DRT: when replacing low frequency buses with DRT costs may therefore rise. Where DRT schemes have been introduced with reduced overall costs this tends to be as a result of losing significant passenger numbers on the change from timetabled to pre-booked services.&#xa0;3.6. The council also believes that key success factors are for Local Transport Authorities to:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[4. ]]]

[[[How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?]]]&#xa0;4.1. Community Transport (CT) may be well placed to cater for the needs of isolated communities on grounds of cost and responsiveness to small scale local needs. &#xa0;4.2. The capacity to expand community transport services depends substantially on the volunteer base. Much has been said about reducing levels of volunteering in recent decades, which is seen to be a constraint on the ability of sector to operate a greater range of services or cater for the travel needs of more people. The driving licence restrictions introduced in 1997 regarding category D1 also provide an increasing constraint to sourcing drivers for minibuses as time goes by. &#xa0;4.3. DCC has supported the Community Transport sector for more than 25 years, and sees its own role as supporting and working with the sector to capacity-build the sector. Maintaining grant support to our CT can also help groups lever in matched funding from other sources, helping the constant challenge for the sector of fundraising. &#xa0;4.4. This role has evolved as groups grow in professionalism and become more self-reliant, and with reduced council budgets seeking a more focussed approach to outcomes sought from funding. This has also included encouraging CT groups to operate local bus services under Section 22 provisions, which has happened only to a limited extent. CT tenders are often no more competitive than those of commercial operators. &#xa0;4.5. Community transport tends to focus well on certain needs in their communities, in particular the needs of the frail elderly and disabled – which has been a key aim of groups generally. This chimed well with the provisions of the 1985 Transport Act which allowed local authorities to make provision for this sector. Community Transport does not tend to cater so well for people in their communities who need transport to get to work, or the travel needs of young people and the opportunities that this travel can bring them.&#xa0;4.6. Scope for CT to address needs currently provided by local authority funded bus services is limited, due to:&#xa0;(i) rural needs are spread thinly; rural poverty and deprivation, and any lack of rural opportunities, even though this may be significant across a rural area, are often therefore invisible;&#xa0;(ii) most local bus services funded by DCC are routes that serve many communities, often relatively strategic rather than local in nature, and operated with large buses;&#xa0;(iii) Devon’s CT sector is strong and widespread, but generally comprises many small groups serving their own locality – e.g. the 16 Ring &amp; Ride schemes operated by different groups;&#xa0;(iv) the change from local minibus operation to large scale sub-regional large bus operation is a large step to take for most groups; premises and operating centres will be required which are not required for minibus operation;&#xa0;(v) the willingness of volunteer organisations to operate, often with unpaid drivers, to take people to work, is seen to be limited as it is very different from operating to meet the needs of the frail elderly and disabled;&#xa0;(vi) The cost of running large buses is as great for the CT sector as it is for commercial operators. Devon’s supported services tend to be operated by smaller bus operators at keen prices – but these costs are unlikely to be further reduced by CT operation – evidenced in DCC tender results;&#xa0;(vii) CT groups are often fundraising at full stretch; they are likely to find fundraising for multiple large bus operation unsustainable.&#xa0;4.7. The need for support for rural services needs to be seen as a given; there are clearly exceptions that geography etc. may help, but on the whole there is little scope for making rural services sustainable. Kick-starting CT schemes with short-term funding is unlikely to make new services financially sustainable long-term as the shortfall between cost and revenue will continue. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?]]]&#xa0;5.1. The passenger’s need and priority is an available, reliable, affordable service, irrespective of how this is provided. There is no reason to assume this should be by any particular mode. From the viewpoint of the funding local authority, provided the appropriate service standards are met, the aim is to achieve best value. The mode will therefore be determined by circumstances, not from any inherent bias towards any one particularly mode.&#xa0;5.2. In rural areas taxis cannot be regarded as more or less universally available; in some market towns, let alone villages, there are still no accessible taxis available at all for those that need their more specialist support; where they are available the cost is clearly prohibitive for regular use for many people. Joseph Rowntree Foundation (2010) identified that Transport Poverty is a greater factor in rural areas than Fuel Poverty: nationally we hear much about the latter whilst, even now, the importance of Transport Poverty is not widely recognised.&#xa0;5.3. DRT services are often unsuitable for regular commuting to work. For understandable reasons including juggling balance the need to meet diverse demands, schemes often only allow for booking up to a week/ fortnight ahead, which in itself is a barrier to meeting workers’ travel needs. Therefore DRT, when it is cost-effective, is likely to work better for off-peak accessibility needs to shopping/ town centre facilities and services.&#xa0;5.4. Off-peak rural services in Devon tend to be more cost-effectively operated, on the margin, by buses that are fully used in the peak for commuting etc., rather than those buses being parked in the off-peak and using additional other smaller vehicles for off-peak DRT services.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these s]]]

[[[ervices be made more affordable?]]]&#xa0;6.1. Relative CostThe overriding challenge is the unchangeable defining feature of isolated rural communities: low population and long distances from centres that provide essential services and employment. Transport will therefore always be expensive to provide in terms of cost per passenger; this is inescapable, and the main challenge will therefore always be funding, and what is deemed worth funding. &#xa0;Rural high cost/ passenger services will always compete unfavourably for shrinking council funding with lower cost/ passenger urban and inter-urban services. Cost/ passenger is a prime assessment tool, as applying it to decisions on service cuts provides the means of minimising the number of people affected by service reductions. &#xa0;6.2. Network EfficiencyDevon County Council has reduced the amount needed to support the local bus network through growing supported bus services to commercial operation and through working with operators of failing commercial services to make them fully commercial and financially sustainable in the long term. This reduction in funding that would otherwise be needed to continue to support the current network amounts to £2m annually, or 40% of the current bus support budget. I.e. without growing these services the cost to the public purse of the current bus network would be 40% higher.&#xa0;But in spite of Devon’s success in growing network efficiency and effective management of the network in this way, and in achieving passenger growth in the last decade in contrast to the national trend outside London, it has become clear that bus services which require a significant amount of funding support tend to be both difficult to grow and unlikely to ever become financially viable if funding support ended. &#xa0;6.3. The “myth of the empty bus”. In Devon all supported bus services use buses that are fully used in the peak hours. Using these buses in the off-peak will at times mean they are perhaps largely empty, but it is still more cost-effective to provide rural services using these vehicles on the margin than to use other (additional) vehicles for lower demand off-peak travel, with the added costs that would bring. Many commercially viable bus services are also empty at times – to see a bus empty at times does not mean that resource is being wastefully used. Nevertheless this misperception may be in danger of distorting how society generally may value rural bus services as funding shortfalls result in increasing competition for dwindling funding resources across councils.&#xa0;6.4. The Non-Statutory Nature of Public Transport FundingThe non-statutory nature of council bus service support relative to e.g. social care, school transport, and the need to maintain roads, means that no matter how sympathetic a council may be towards maintaining bus support, the size of the Spending Review funding cuts will inevitably mean that there will be little funding left for non-statutory services.&#xa0;6.5. ENCTS Scheme CostsIn Devon the cost of the statutory English National Concessionary Travel Scheme (ENCTS) is double that of the cost of supporting rural bus services. Whilst Devon sees the benefits of the scheme to eligible passholders, given the acute pressure on revenue budgets from the Spending Review, it has to be questioned nationally whether it is sensible to continue to fund statutory free travel when this is at the expense of a reduced ability to travel through cuts to council funded routes.  &#xa0;6.6. Cross-Sector Benefits A significant element of the value of bus services lies in other organisations or in wider policy aims, e.g.:&#xa0;It is difficult to fully engage with local public sector departments on this while government is not joined-up and does not provide joined-up targets and messages on this to the local agencies. Agencies are not keen to work with the council to part-fund transport, even where this may reduce their overall net costs,  as their aims handed down from central government do not encourage this. As a result it is difficult for local government to successfully engage in joined-up service and budgetary planning with other public sector agencies when central government departments are not working together sufficiently on these issues. &#xa0;6.7. Long Term Benefits vs. Short Term Funding NeedsA significant element of the known significant benefits of public transport would also only be realised in the long term. The contribution of council public transport funding towards the economy, employment, youth opportunities is critical. Transport is a key component of action required to succeed on the Prevention Agenda – reducing dependence on benefits through enabling employment; reducing dependence on bespoke care services through increased independence in life at all ages; reducing ill-health through improving healthy lifestyles.  &#xa0;The payback is long term, and budget cut targets need to be met this year or next. So no matter how much it would be sensible to continue to provide funding for public transport, as the payback is (a) often not within the council, and (b) not short-term or immediate, these immediate pressures are understandably greater than the long-term need to continue public transport funding.   &#xa0;6.8. SummaryTo summarise, the significant cross-sector benefits that bus services provide, across society and policy aims, need to be reflected in national policies to enable these linkages to be made locally - by recognising the need to treat transport funding as wider than a purely transport budget issue. Only through such a new approach will the public sector achieve the benefits that will accrue and grow from continued public transport funding and will it avoid increasing future costs and problems that would result if this is not addressed urgently. &#xa0;&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;
