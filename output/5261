default&#xa0;defaultWritten evidence from Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (defaultUEC0007)default&#xa0;
defaultThe Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (“the College”)
default has 50% of its UK Fellows and M
defaultembers working in the NHS in England, and welcomes the opportunity to respond to this call by the Health Committee for written submissions on the allocation and use of the additional funding made available to support 
defaultthe emergency and urgent care system ov
defaulter winter 2013–14 and the performance of emergency departments in this period.
defaultFellows of the College have reported that funding has largely been spent on sessional and locum payments to doctors and nurses to fill rota gaps and increase cover, mostly in th
defaulte Emergency Department (ED) and less at the interface between ED and the Acute Medical Unit (AMU) or the interface to support safe discharge back to the community.
default  
defaultThe weather this winter has been mild to date and this impacts on the ability to assess eff
defaultectiveness.
defaultExperiences were mixed as to the effective
defaultness of the additional funding.  
defaultSome Fellows found that there was no difference and crises were only averted by all members of the team working hard to keep the system afloat; while others found that t
defaulthe additional staff could provide supplementary useful support
default,
default particularly the deployment of additional therapy staff in the AMU and additional weekend cover especially in in-patient medical wards.
default  
defaultOther examples of use of the funding included improved 
defaultaccess to diagnostics, particularly radiology; real time bed management white boards; and improved use and access to discharge lounges.
defaultFellows have advised the College that additional funding for winter would be more effectively spent and beneficial to pa
defaulttients if there was greater opportunity to plan and arrange how to allocate the money in advance, rather than the current reactive response which inevitably uses up funding on high rates of pay and agency fees at short notice. 
defaultAdditionally
default,
default the College feels that there should be more focus on primary and social care planning during the winter months and holiday periods and an increased emphasis on 7 day working, and their role in reducing patient admissions to hospital and facilitating timel
defaulty discharge which would ease pressure on secondary care considerably.
