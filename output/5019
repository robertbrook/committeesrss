defaultNational Federation of Retail Newsagents 
default[PCC Progress 11]
default&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;default1. The National Federation of Retail Newsagents (NFRN) would like to thank the
default Home Affairs
default Committee for the invitation to make a written submission on the
default performance 
defaultof 
defaultPolice and Crime C
defaultommissioners
default (PCC
defaults
default)
default.
default&#xa0;default2. The NFRN is one of Europe’s largest trade associations, representing over 16,000 fee paying members from approximately 18,000 independent newsagents and convenience stores across the UK, Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland. We are a membership led organisation that is democratically structured; policy is made by annual conference and its implementation is overseen by National Council.
default&#xa0;
default3. The NFRN assis
defaultts the independent retailer to 
defaultcompete more effectively in today’s highly competitive market through the provision of practical help and assistance, commercial support, deals and buying opportunities, training, expert
defaultise and services. I
defaultt also represents its members’
default interests at governmental and p
defaultarliamentary level, as well as within the news and magazine industry. 
default&#xa0;
defaultGeneral Remarksdefault&#xa0;default4.
default The NFRN understands the importance of the
default role of
default 
defaultPCC
default 
defaultto both the police and local communities. 
default&#xa0;
default5. With this in mind, the NFRN is working towards its aim of meeting all 
defaultPCCs
default over the course of the coming year.
default&#xa0;
default6. NFRN engage
defaultment with PC
defaultCs has already started. We recently wrote a letter to all PCCs regar
defaultding our concerns about shoplifting and the impact it ha
defaults on our members
default’ businesses
default. Going forward
defaults
default, we
default will continue to engage with
default P
defaultC
defaultCs
default through regular contact and our newsletter, to keep
default 
defaultthem
default informed
default about the key crime issues facing the independent retail sector
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default7. However it is important to note that one year is not long enough to be able to fully judge the performance of PCCs.
default&#xa0;
default8
default. In our submission to the committee’s inquiry, 
defaultthe NFRN will focus on the two following areas
default, from the Federation’s perspective of their handling of the issue of shoplifting
default and anti-social behaviour
default:
default&#xa0;
default- The 
defaulteffectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area
default&#xa0;
default- 
defaultThe effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing priorities
default&#xa0;
defaultDeclaration of Interestdefaultsdefault&#xa0;default9. 
defaultWhilst we 
defaultwork
default to engage with PCCs on beh
defaultalf of our members, we have no further
default relationship with them.
default&#xa0;defaultThe effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force areadefault&#xa0;default10. 
defaultIn the 
defaultperiod
default since c
defaultommissioners were elected, 
defaultthere have been a number of notable achievements delivered by various PCCs. 
default&#xa0;
default11. 
defaultW
defaulte welcomed news that the PCC for West Yorkshire Mark Burns-Williamson had launched a petition with the intention of persuading the government to ensure that the funds generated from seized criminal assets are spent on community and anti-crime initiatives in the same areas where the crimes were committed
default. 
default&#xa0;
default12. 
defaultIn addition
default, a number of PC
defaultCs have launched community crime funds in their areas to help 
defaulttackle
default problems. PCC for Avon and Somerset 
defaultSue Mountstevens
default 
defaulthas allocated £2.4m to various organisations in the area to help reduce crime and disorder. The fund will also provide support for victims of crime
default, a move supported by the NFRN
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;default13. 
defaultHowever, there is still room for improvement 
defaultin terms of the effectiveness with which commissioners are reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within thei
defaultr areas.
default 
defaultFor example, the way in which
default business crime, specifically shoplifting
default, is dealt with is of concern to the Federation
default’s members
default.
default&#xa0;
default14. 
defaultDiscussions with our members and recent media reports have
default raised concerns amongst the NFRN that 
defaultshoplifting is not being 
defaultdealt with
default seriously enough by police and police and crime commissioners.
default&#xa0;
default15. 
defaultAn investigation by the Birmingham Mail for example, discovered that police had failed to investigate or record more than 60% of shoplifting incidents that had taken place in Birmingham’s city centre
default. 
default&#xa0;
default16. 
defaultFurthermore, it was reported in August 2013 that 
defaultHammersmith and Fulham police
default had dropped a proposal to 
defaultnot arrest
default those who
default shoplift goods under £50
default. 
defaultWhilst it is fortunate the proposal was not adopted, 
defaultthe NFRN considers that 
defaultit should not have been considered in the first place as it would have undermined the businesses of our members.
default&#xa0;
default17. 
defaultT
defaulthe NFRN appreciate
defaults
default that PCCs are not in operational control of the 
defaultpolice; however
default they do set their priorities. 
defaultTherefore we feel that more work needs to be done to ensure that this important issue is not 
defaultallowed to slip down the policing agenda in terms of performance.  
default&#xa0;
default18. 
defaultAnother issue where improvements could be made is anti-social behaviour against retail workers more generally.
default&#xa0;
default19. 
defaultUnfortunately, newsagents and convenience stores are easy targets for such behaviour
default in light of their late opening hours and the
default relatively
default few members of staff on duty in comparison to the large supermarkets
default. 
default&#xa0;
default20. 
defaultIn a survey we conducted recently of our membership, 
default35.7% of respondents had been a victim of crime or anti-social behaviour 
defaultin
default the last 12 months
default.
default&#xa0;
default21. 
defaultFurthermore, research published recently by the Union 
defaultof Shop Distributive and Allied Workers
default (Usdaw)
default revealed that of their shop worker respondents, 
default1 in 5 report verbal
default 
defaultabuse on a daily or weekly basis
default, almost 1 in 10 report a threat of violence at least once a month.
default 
default&#xa0;
default22. A survey carried out for Independent Retail News also showed that the number of independent retailers who had been a victim of violent crime had increased from 8%in 2010 to 15% in 2011.
default&#xa0;
default23
default. 
defaultAnti
default-social behaviour, violence 
defaultand threatening behaviour 
defaultare
default problem
defaults
default that 
defaultare
default c
defaultontinuing to blight our members’ livelihoods.
default&#xa0;
default24
default. 
defaultWe are appreciative of work already done on this issue by PCC’s. For example, in October 2013 the NFRN was pleased to learn that Commissioners had joined Chief Constables to support a campaign week seeking to tackle the problem
default.
default&#xa0;
default25
default. 
defaultHowever in light of this continuing problem, we feel that more attention needs to be placed on the issue
default to help protect retailers and their staff from this behaviour
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing prioritiesdefault&#xa0;default26
default. 
defaultThe NFRN will focus its response
default to this question on its knowledge of the priority PCCs place on the issue of shoplifting.
default&#xa0;
default27
default. 
defaultAs noted previously in this submission, the Federation wrote to all PCCs asking them to clarify their approach to this form of crime. 
default&#xa0;
default28
default. 
defaultT
defaulthe responses we have received from
default Police and Crime Commissioners regarding shoplifting, have all sought to reassure the NFRN that the issue of shoplifting remains high in the list of policing priorities.
default&#xa0;
default29
default. 
defaultIn practice, PCCs have gone to varying lengths in their promotion of policing priorities. Whilst some have simply provided assurance that they understand the importance of the issue, others have taken steps to demonstrate that this is 
defaulttruly 
defaultthe case.
default&#xa0;
default30
default. 
defaultClive Grunshaw, PCC for Lancashire advised us that a business crime lead for the 
defaultConstabulary
default had been appointed and that he personally holds the Chief Constable to account for performance in this area.
default&#xa0;
default31
default. 
defaultFurthermore, Bill Longmore the PCC for West Mercia revealed that he was in the process of developing a Business Crime strategy for both West Mercia and Warwickshire police and Essex PCC Nick Alston 
defaultheld a business crime forum to discuss the issue.
default&#xa0;
default32
default. 
defaultHowever, the issue is not being as demonstrably prioritised in other areas of the country. Mark Burns-Williamson OBE, PCC for West Yorkshire recognised the importance of the issue but admitted it was “not specifically a priority within the Police and Crime Plan”. 
default&#xa0;
default33
default. 
defaultIt is evident that the effectiveness of PCCs in promoting this issue varies considerably in different areas.
default&#xa0;
default34
default. 
defaultThe NFRN appreciates the hard work many PCCs have put into dealing with this matter but would encourage all commissioners to do the same, in order for this type of behaviour to be tackled effectively. 
default&#xa0;default35
default. 
defaultWe would welcome the issues
default of shoplifting and anti-social behaviour becoming priorities in all Police and Crime Plans
default and the NFRN will seek to engage with PCCs as they develop these plans
default.
