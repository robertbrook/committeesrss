[[[Written evidence from David Carroll (GMC0012)]]]&#xa0;My name is David Carroll and I am a medical student in Queen’s University Belfast. &#xa0;I have previously written in the British Medical Journal[1] on relevant topics, I am co-founder of Bad Guidelines, a sucessful campaign for guidance on interactions between healthcare professionals and the pharmaceutical industry to be evidence based[2], and part of a campaign for medical education accredited free from industry influence called Conflict Free Conferences[3].My concerns are that to date, the General Medical Council (GMC) has not compiled a publicly accessible register of all conflicts of interest (COI) of all doctors practising in the United Kingdom. Patients are unable to find these COIs easily or at all. Ultimately, the GMC has to act because it is a patient safety organisation, and this is a patient safety issue.Ideally, the GMC would be the ideal organization to host a public, searchable list of declarations of COIs. This is because the GMC has annual reregistration which entails contacting doctors in order for them to pass appraisals each year. The GMC, with its complete list of all doctors is where patients can look us up to ensure that their healthcare practitioner can be trusted and have all the qualifications they say they do. If, for any reason, this is not possible, the best possible scenario would be for the GMC to share this list of doctors so that others can use them to compile a register of conflicts of interests. &#xa0;The value of this is to provide a window for the public to look in to make up their own mind about any doctor’s potential COI. As a medical student, I am taught by academics and clinicians, both internally at the university and externally at peripheral hospitals. I have a right to know the conflicts of interest of the people that teach me so I can make up my own mind about the information that they provide to me to make sure the medical education I receive is evidence-based rather than marketing-based.&#xa0;This is important because conflicts of interest are potentially harmful. Looking at the pharmaceutical industry, the best available evidence [4] suggests that exposure of doctors to information provided to the pharmaceutical industry results in higher prescribing frequency, higher costs, or lower prescribing quality or have not found significant associations. There is no evidence to suggest any improvement in prescribing.The Ethical Standards in Health and Life Sciences Group have declared intentions [5] to publicly disclose conflicts of interest. We know from the group’s history [1] of providing false claims about important matters that pertain to patient safety that we cannot have confidence in their ability to do this. Voluntary COI registration is also not enough as voluntary agreements have a notorious history of failure. I strongly recommend that the GMC implement a publicly accessible register of all conflicts of interest of all doctors practising in the United Kingdom or provide a list of all doctors currently registered in the United Kingdom so that others can carry out this important work. I as a medical student deserve to know this information to protect the integrity of my education and our patients surely deserve this in order to make sure they are getting the best care possible.
