[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1               Suffolk County Council is the Highway Authority for Suffolk and liaises regularly with the Highways Agency, particularly to discuss issues relating to the A14, the main trunk road between the port of Felixstowe and the Midlands and a key route for road hauliers. The county council believes that investment in the A14 urgently required and is vital to the future economic prosperity of the county.

[[[environment?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1              Suffolk County Council welcomes the Department of Transport’s statements that it will be investing £15 billion on adding additional capacity to the UK’s strategic road network by 2021. It also welcomes the DfT’s intention to spend £12 billion on maintenance and £6 billion on resurfacing. It also welcomes the ambition to bring the UK’s trunk road network up to clearly defined national standards.&#xa0;2.2              However, while the council recognises that these are significant amounts of funding, they should not be allocated at the expense of funds like the Local Sustainable Transport Fund and the Cycle Safety Fund. Both of these funds enable local transport authorities to find ways of ensuring that the addition of capacity to the trunk road network will have minimal negative effects on local communities in the form of community severance, noise, light, and air pollution. They also help councils encourage use of modes of travel other than the private car which are safe and have significant public health benefits as well as reducing intra-urban traffic congestion. For example, Suffolk County Council is using £1.5 million of the DfT’s Cycle Safety Fund to construct a pedestrian and cycle bridge across the A14 to reduce community severance and increase walking and cycling within Bury St. Edmunds. It is these funding streams that ensure the UK trunk road network is appropriately pedestrian and cyclist-friendly and they must not be stopped or reduced at the expense of investment that just benefits motorists.&#xa0;

[[[How does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1              Suffolk County Council welcomes the additional capital and revenue investment in the UK’s trunk road network. However, the council feels that this must be embarked upon as part of a coherent inter-urban UK transport strategy for all modes with the aim of using transport as a tool to help facilitate economic growth, but also to ensure the UK meets its environmental obligations and improves the quality of life for local communities. The council feels that a crucial part of this is to provide high quality rail services between key urban centres and to provide high quality walk and cycle facilities within all urban centres. It also believes the government should increase the volume of freight moving on to rail. These measures will help free up capacity on the strategic road network for the motorists that have no choice but to use it.

[[[How reliable is the Government’s forecast for growth in demand]]]

[[[ for the strategic road network? How should the Government deal with uncertainty in its forecast?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1              The Authors of this paper state that, because of improvements in technology and a reduction of insurance costs (in real terms), the cost of motoring will fall in real terms over the next 30 years. Consequently, motor traffic, particularly on the strategic network, will continue to increase as strong economic growth returns. The Council agrees that there are many uncertainties when forecasting traffic growth over the longer term (e.g. the way population age composition might mean a change in where different groups of people will live). The government can deal with the many uncertainties by preparing, monitoring and updating a multi-modal transport strategy with focused and relevant objectives, rather than relying on the “predict and provide” approach of past governments.&#xa0;4.2              Suffolk County Council also supports the investment of an extra £500 million between 2015 and 2021 in infrastructure to enable greater use of electric vehicles. However, while these vehicles are affective for shorter intra-urban journeys, they might not be as suitable for longer-distance inter-urban journeys. The Council believes that this could add further uncertainty to the department’s forecasts. Also, technological advancements within the motor car industry should not be used as a reason to reduce support for longer distance travel by sustainable modes of transport.

[[[How can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network? What impact will new technology have?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1              Suffolk County Council welcomes the DfT’s intentions to invest in the different technological solutions mentioned in this document. However, it also feels that the reliability and efficiency of the strategic road network can be improved through The Highways Agency being more proactive than in the past in its engagement with local Highway Authorities and their local stakeholders. For example, Suffolk County Council’s own Highways team has found it difficult in the recent past to share with the Highways Agency its proposals to improve signage at or in the vicinity of junctions connecting local roads with the A14 in the county.&#xa0;5.2              Suffolk County Council feels that greater use of technology and more proactive liaison between The Highways Agency and local Constabularies would enable quicker and more effective responses to accidents and faster clear-up times which would reduce the length of delays.

[[[What mechanisms are there for Government to increase investment in strategic roads and attract new investors? Are there good examples from other countries that could be applied in the ]]]

[[[UK]]]

[[[?]]]&#xa0;6.1              Suffolk County Council welcomes the aim of increasing investment in the strategic network and welcomes the intention to attract investment from sources other than the public sector at a time of public expenditure constraint. It agrees that the move towards 5-year road investment strategies will give the Highways Agency, its suppliers, and contractors the financial certainty to commit to innovative ways of working together that could generate operational efficiency savings.&#xa0;6.2              Looking at the examples of other countries and how their governments have attracted investment in their strategic road networks, the council realises that some form of direct road user charge, shadow toll, concession agreement, and/or availability payment is part of this. However, it feels that direct road user charging should only be implemented as part of a clear, well thought out, national trunk road network investment strategy and must apply to all parts of the UK network so as not to put businesses in one region at a competitive disadvantage to those in another. There must also be a full cost benefit analysis undertaken before any of the above arrangements are introduced. &#xa0;6.3              The Council believes that a direct road user charge is the most effective and fair way to manage the demand placed on the strategic road network, but it must be implemented throughout the UK on a universal pay-as-you-use basis. All routes containing a direct road user charge must also have untolled alternative routes that are suitable for Heavy Goods Vehicles, as many haulage companies have a policy of not paying road user charges.&#xa0;6.4              Should direct road-user charging be introduced across the strategic road network, how will the DfT ensure equitable treatment for all road users in terms of charging policy? What mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that prices and price increases are fair and justified when there might be different financing and contractual agreements across the network? For example, arrangements for the M6 toll road might be different to those of the Dartford Crossing, which might affect the price charged to the user over time.&#xa0;6.5              It is partly for this reason that Suffolk County Council suggests that the performance of the new Strategic Highways Company be monitored by a full economic regulator with a similar remit to the Office for Rail Regulation over Network Rail.

[[[How should the Highways Agency be reformed]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? What roles should Government and the private sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road ]]]

[[[network?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1              Should the Highways Agency be given greater operational independence from government, it needs to be properly regulated and held to account by a full economic regulator. This would be particularly important should the organisation adopt one of the operating models mentioned on pages 71-73 of the Action for Roads paper in the long term. This organisation must have the appropriate powers to ensure that the company consults sufficiently with local authorities and local businesses before embarking on any investment project. For example, Suffolk County Council feels, along with other stakeholders, that the recent consultation over the A14 Cambridge – Huntingdon investment package could have been more effective. The tone of the Technical Review and Options document, published in September 2013, the very short consultation time, and the lack of engagement with representatives in Suffolk, made it appear that The Highways Agency and the DfT considered the problem and possible solution to be unique to Cambridgeshire and gave scant regard to the views of strategic road users from outside the county. This is in spite of the considerable financial impact a road user charge would have on them. &#xa0;7.2              If the Strategic Highways Company were regulated by an organisation with similar powers to the Office for Rail Regulation, it would at least have to show that it published market studies and business plans and gave an appropriate time for stakeholders to read and respond to them, either in writing or within a workshop environment.&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0; Highways Agency (2013), A14 Cambridge – Huntingdon Improvement Scheme: Technical Review of Options, (accessed online), https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/243999/a14-technical-review-of-options.pdf
