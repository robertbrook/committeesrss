[[[Written evidence submitted by RenewableUK (LCI14)]]]RenewableUK is the UK’s leading renewable energy trade body, representing more than 600 members in the wind, wave and tidal sectors. These industries will provide the majority of the renewable electricity required to meet the UK’s legally binding energy and emissions targets, create thousands of jobs across the supply chain, revitalise the economy and stabilise consumer energy bills.&#xa0;

[[[Summary]]]&#xa0;Key issues:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;As key contributors to the UK’s energy mix in years to come, efficiencies bought to renewables via innovation across the supply chain will play a vital role in the success of lowering the cost of energy, and therefore, Government support for innovation in wind, wave and tidal renewables will be welcomed at all stages of the technology development lifecycle. At present, the Government’s support of innovation for offshore wind, wave and tidal renewables has been widespread, with a number of support schemes.  The general approach to low carbon innovation via the LCICG has been perceived as somewhat fragmented, although the renewables industry has benefited from government support in the advancement and development of technology.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/media/305094/offshore-wind-cost-reduction-pathways-study.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/66776/5584-offshore-wind-cost-reduction-task-force-report.pdf https://www.nao.org.uk/report/public-funding-innovation-low-carbon-technologies-uk/
