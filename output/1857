[normal]Chief Fire Officers Association and the [bold]Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Draft Deregulation Bill – Amendments to the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 – Schemes for combining Fire and Rescue Authorities[bold]I present this evident in my capacity as both Vice President of the Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) and Chief Fire Officer Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the first part and in principal the Chief Fire Officers Association believes that legislative barriers to innovation should be removed provided that sufficient Central Government control remains in place to ensure proper scrutiny, overview and consultation.  We believe that the proposed amendments provide that freedom, but have been risk assessed to ensure that the risks of greater freedom are still met within the legislation and that the requirement for proper consultation and involvement are still maintained by the proposed amendment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CFOA further believes that it is entirely a matter for local Fire and Rescue Services to determine their structure and arrangements and where that means combination, or closer working with others they should be able to make that decision without having to go through a lengthy and largely superfluous statutory application process.  Any such decision should be subject to proper consultation and involvement but will remove an unnecessary regulatory burden.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CFOA is also assured that in the extreme circumstances in which the Secretary of State feels compelled to impose a combination there remains a clear process in place to ensure the appropriateness of that intervention. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]By way of a brief “case study” I describe below the circumstances which transpired in Bedfordshire:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following local Government review the Fire Authority felt that its name and that of the Fire and Rescue Service was no longer representative of the communities which it represented.  As a result they decided to change the name to represent the ceremonial name of the sub region as Bedfordshire and as such match the description of the coterminous police force.  The county of Bedfordshire was effectively abolished with the creation of the two additional unitary Authorities in Bedford and Central Bedfordshire. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recognising the potential friction which may have arisen by not representing the names of the new 
[normal]unitaries
[normal] and removing the existing reference to Luton, the Fire Authority engaged widely both verbally, at meetings and in writing with a wide range of stakeholders and received letters of support from those particularly affected.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Pursuant of the existing legislation the Authority then wrote to the Secretary of State requesting the change and attaching the letters of support from our own consultation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The existing legislation requires that before approving such a change the Secretary of State should carry out consultation with a wide range of potentially interested 
[normal]parties.  This consultation was launched to the effect that those people who had already agreed were asked again for their view, and some who had absolutely no tangible interest were asked and then contacted the Chief Fire Officer for guidance on how to answer!
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clearly such a simple change to introduce has involved a process which is a completely unnecessary regulatory burden and as Chief Fire Officer of Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service I completely support the proposed changes.  My attitude to risk and appropriateness are consistent with the earlier paragraphs included on behalf of the Chief Fire Officers Association.
