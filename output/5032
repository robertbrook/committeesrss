defaultWritten evidence from the 
defaultCommittee on Standards in Public Life
default [PCC Progress 23]
default&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefault1. The Committee on Standards in Public Life is an advisory Non-Departmental Public Body (NDPB). The Committee was established in October 1994, by the then Prime Minister, with the following terms of reference:
default&#xa0;
default“To examine current concerns about standards of conduct of all holders of public office, including arrangements relating to financial and commercial activities, and make recommendations as to any changes in present arrangements which might be required to ensure the highest standards of propriety in public life
default.”
default&#xa0;
default2. The Committee on Standards in Public Life is defined by its Seven Principles of Standards in Public Life which are Selflessness, Objectivity, Integrity, Accountability, Openness, Honesty and Leadership. 
default&#xa0;
default3. The Committee’s terms of reference were updated in 2013 
defaultto include “anyone who works as a public office-holder. This includes all those who are elected or appointed to public office, nationally and locally, and all people appointed to work in the civil service, local government, the police, courts and probation services, NDPBs, and in the health, education, social and care services.”

default 
default&#xa0;
default4.
default 
defaultFor some time the Committee has been interested in the debate around the application of the Seven Principles of Public Life to policing
default. 
defaultWe made clear our intention to monitor the extent to which 
defaultPolice and Crime Commissioners (
defaultPCC
default)
defaults are genuinely open and accountable and how successfully any ethical risks arising from their role are addressed in our Annual Report,
default which said the Committee will keep a watching brief on “Ethical standards in the police, including Police and Crime Commissioners.” 
defaultThe Committee has responded to the College of Policing’s draft code of ethics
default where the Committee welcomed the introduction of a code of ethics in principle and emphasised the importance of properly embedding a code of ethics into an organisation. 
defaultAs part of our work plan, the Committee has met with Police and Crime Commissioners to discuss how it can best assist them in pre-empting any ethical risks they may face in their new roles
default, although the Committee is keeping open the
default possibility of conducting an i
defaultnquiry if it is warranted
default. The Committee therefore welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Home Affairs Committee call for evidence on Police and Crime Commissioners. 
defaultThe Committee’s response focuses on two questions:
default&#xa0;
default5. Recent news stories, such as the “plebgate” incident, have contributed to the growing concern around standards in policing. R
defaultecent surveys have found that public trust in police is declining. In a poll conducted by YouGov, the number of respondents who trust senior police officers has decreased from 72% in 2003 to 49% in 2012
default. A quarter (26%) of those surveyed by ComRes in 2013 said the “plebgate” affair has made them less likely to trust the police.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6. The role of Police and Crime Commissioner was introduced last year as part of a package of measures to improve accountability and standards in policing. Individuals are elected rather than appointed but have to be as politically impartial as any other public servant. Each PCC is responsible for holding their local police force to account and is directly accountable to the voters in their locality. 
defaultPCCs are 
defaultalso accountable to 
defaultPolice and Crime Panels (PCPs), who have a veto over the appointment of chief constables
default 
defaultand the setting of the pre
defaultcept (with a two thirds majority). 
defaultAs the Home Secretary recently said “the purpose of directly-elected police and crime commissioners was clear. They’d be elected, visible, well-known in their communities and accountable to the electorate.”
default In an assessment of progress, Lord Taylor of Holbeach said in a recent debate “
defaultDespite only being in post for a year, PCCs are already more visible than anonymous police authorities. Seven out of 10 members of the public are aware of PCCs.
default”
default 
default&#xa0;
default7. The role of Police and Crime Commissioner is subject to legislation. The Policing Protocol Order 2011
default “sets out how the new policing governance arrangements will work and clarifies the role and responsibilities of police and crime commissioners.”
default The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 
default(PRSR) 
default2011
default makes provision for the administration and governance of police forces and
default includes detailed requirements 
defaulton PCCs. The Schedule to the Local Policing Bodies (Specified Information Order) 2011 (as amended in 2012) requires PCCs to publish “a statement of the policy of the elected local policing body in relation to the conduct of relevant office holders, including procedures for the handling of qualifying complaints and conduct matters.”
default There is currently an obligation for PCCs to publish information under the following headings:
default&#xa0;
default8. 
defaultA culture of transparency should include being transparent about standards of behaviour of PCCs and their staff. 
defaultThe C
defaultommittee believes that PCCs are facing
default ethical challenges in their new role
default as ethical leaders
default, particularly around
default: 
default&#xa0;
default9. The PRSR Act allows 
defaultPCCs t
defaulto appoint a deputy PCC and 
defaultoth
defaulter staff as thought appropriate. 
defaultThe Act states that 
defaultappointment of staff of merit
default does not apply to th
defaulte appointment of a deputy PCC
default.  The 
defaultPolice and Crime Panel is required to 
defaultmake a recommendation to the PCC as to whether or not the candidate should be appointed
default after reviewing information on 
defaultthe criteria 
defaultthe PCC 
defaultused to assess suitability and how those criteria were satisfied.  The PCC may choose to accept or reject the recommendation of the Panel.
default The Committee considers appointments an area of risk for PCCs as they are not bound by p
defaultrinciples of good practice for public appointments formulated by the Commissioner for Public Appointments
default. There have already been
default all
defaultegations and
default perceptions of 
defaultcronyism, lack of accountability and misuse of money that 
defaultit has been argued could 
defaultinstead have been spent
default on frontline policing services.
default 
defaultTransparency is essential throughout the appointme
defaultnts process and as far as possible
default it should adhere to the principles and guidance set out by the Commissioner for Public Appoin
defaultt
defaultments.
default&#xa0;
default10. 
defaultThe Committee defined integrity to mean public office holders “not placing themselves under any obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence them in their work.”
default To satisfy this principle and avoid conflicts of interest, the Committee considers the retention of registers of interests, 
defaultdetails of 
defaultme
defaultmbership of organisations,
default 
defaultbusiness interests and gifts and hospitality essential. The Committee agrees with the Home Affairs Committee report ‘Leadership and Standards in Police’ that said “Where hospitality is accepted, an up-to-date register should be kept by all police forces, with full details of those providing such hospitality, dates, and other relevant details. The register should at all times be in the public domain, including online, with additional entries being made immediately available.”
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default11. In order to preserve high ethical standards and assure the public that decision
defaults
default are being made fairly and free from influence, it is important that procurement and decision making is done in 
defaultan 
defaultopen and transparent way. PCCs should also consider how lobbying activities may bring about conflicts of interest in respect of procurement and decision making. As we said in our lobbying report “
defaultAt the heart of the concern is the confluence of money, influence and power an
defaultd vested interests: it is often 
defaultnot known who is influencing decisions or what may have been done to achieve the influence.
default”
default A publicly available register of meetings held with external stakeholders could 
defaultincrease 
defaulttransparency and openness around these issues. As we recommended in our lobbying report “
defaultPublic bodies should routinely publish information about all significant meetings and hospitality involving
default 
defaultexternal attempts to influence a public policy decision.
default”
default&#xa0;
default12
default. 
defaultThe Committee believes the ethical risks identified above are best dealt with 
defaultby 
defaultthe introduction of a code of conduct which would 
defaultprovide 
defaultthe public with 
defaulta common unde
defaultrstanding of expected standards for PCCs
default. 
defaultThe code should be based on the Seven Principles, adaptable to local needs, have clear links to any existing and new codes of conduct and be published. However,
default 
defaultit is not only important to introduce a code of ethics but also to implement it in such as way as to embed high ethical standards into the culture of the police force and its day to day processes.  PCCs need to hold chief constables to account in this area in a meaningful and systematic way, recognising that recent evidence shows there is much to be done before the high standards in public life to which we all aspire are fully internalised in the cultures of all our public institutions.
default&#xa0;
default12. 
defaultThe Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 and the Elected Local Policing Bodies (Spe
defaultcified Information) Order 2011
default 
defaultlegally 
defaultrequire 
defaultPCCs
default to publish information
default such as a register of interest. A 
defaultHome Affairs 
defaultCommittee report entitled ‘
defaultPolice and Crime
default 
defaultCommissioners:
default 
defaultRegister of Interests
default’ 
defaultnoted
default that
default:
default “
defaultA number of PCCs have so far failed to publish the required financial information, or disclose the details of their own interests and allowances. The Home Office must monitor compliance with legal responsibilities to publish information and publish a list of non-compliant PCCs.
default”
default The Committee agrees with the recommendation of the Home 
defaultAffairs 
defaultCommittee and notes that 
defaultcodes and standards are only effective if they are embedded into the culture of an organisation and its everyday business. 
default&#xa0;defaultThe role of Cdefaultommissioners in holding their chief constables to accountdefault13
default. The Committee believes 
defaultthat as well as fulfilling their obligations locally, it is also important for PCCs to consider their responsibilities to national policing beyond their local commitments. 
defaultPart of this includes being held to account by the Police and Crime Panel in accordance with the requirements of a code of conduct, as well as publishing information such as registers of interest. The Committee agrees with the Home Affairs Committee who 
defaultwrote
default in their report ‘
defaultPolice and Crime
default 
defaultCommissioners:
default 
defaultRegister of Interests
default’
default 
default“
defaultWe do not accept that a national register of PCCs’ interests is not necessary. There was
default 
defaultunanimous agreement among the Police and Crime Commissioners we called for evidence
default 
defaultthat such a register would be a fair and helpful way to hold PCCs to account. If a national
default 
defaultregister is being compiled for chief constables, it makes clear sense to do the same for their
default 
defaultelected counterparts
default”
default. 
default&#xa0;
default14
default. The Home Secretary has sa
defaultid the picture of PCCs holding chief c
defaultonstables to account was “a little mixed.”
default 
default As we said in our response to the Public Administration Select Committee’s consultation on crime statistics 
default“One of the main roles of a PCC is to open their police force to greater transparency.  Just as important is for PCCs to be (and be seen to be) transparent and open. PCCs have a duty to engage regularly with the public and local communities. This means striving for ‘intelligent accountability’ which may be easier to talk abou
defaultt than to achieve, but implies: “
defaultbuilding up a degree of trust over time that creates a virtuous feedback
default loop in which stakeholders can 
defaultsee policies being influenced and changed
default as a result of their input and 
defaultbeing open, particularly in relation to reporting problems to
default avoid a culture of blame
default.”
default 
default&#xa0;
default15. 
defaultPCCs are ultimately held accountable at the ballot box and a PCC who has lost public trust and confidence may not be re-elected. 
defaultIndividual behaviour that falls below the standards the public expects could also affect the reputation of, and trust in, the police as a whole.  
defaultThe Public Attitudes Survey carried out on behalf of the Committee demonstrates that levels of trust are not static, trust can be lost and restored but it is a long and difficult process
default.
default 
defaultAs we said “
defaultpublic
default 
defaultconfidence has not yet returned to its 2004
default 
defaultlevel, let alone to the level reached in 2008,
default 
defaultwhen only 18 per cent of the population held
default 
defaultsystematically sceptical views about those i
defaultn 
defaultpublic office.
default”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultConclusiondefault16
default. The Committee welcomes the Government’s commitment to increase accountability in policing. 
defaultT
defaulthe Committee believes
default that PCCs
default should be subject to their own code of ethics based on 
defaultthe 
defaultSeven Principles that is applicable to their own experience. 
defaultThey must be clear about how they themselves are accountable
default 
defaulti
defaultn order to secure public confidence
default that they are fu
defaultlfilling their role of holding chief c
defaultonstables to account. 
defaultAs highlighted in the Committee’s 
default“
defaultStrengthening transparency around lobbying
default”
default report, increasing transparency 
defaultleads to greater accountability
default. Openness and transparency exposes and deters malpractice, improves accountability, encourages the highest standards of integrity and promotes public trust. PCCs need to promote and sustain these principles, leading by example, 
defaultsince
default as
default leaders of local policing bodies, they are critical to setting the culture of transparency and ethical behaviour in which the public can have trust across the criminal justice system in their area
