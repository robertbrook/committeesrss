[[[Declaration of Interests]]]

[[[  ]]]I graduated with a BSc (Hons) degree in Biomedical Sciences, and&#xa0;have been a forensic scientist for over twenty four years. Over the last ten years I have specialised in the area of historic case reviews (cold cases), and was the National Lead in case reviews for the Forensic Science Service prior to its closure.&#xa0;In this field, I am co-author of the Home Office ‘Good Practice Guide: Cold Case Reviews of Rape and Serious Sexual Assault’, published in 2005. In May 2012 I joined LGC Forensics as a specialist in forensic case reviews. I was awarded an OBE for my work within forensic science in the Queen’s New Years Honours list 2013, and have received twelve Commendations from within the Criminal Justice System - eight Crown Court Commendations and four Police Commendations. I was also part of the Police/forensic/CPS team nominated for the South Yorkshire Justice Awards 2009.
