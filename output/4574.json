Even when \nthe exploita\ntion\n of alternatives\n \nto GCSE had become a public scandal, PwC reports continued to take \n‘\nequivalence\n’\n at face value. \nMoveover\n, whilst recognizing \nth\nat th\ne\n \nproportion\n \nof\n disadvantaged pupils\n had reduced\n, \nthese\n reports\n failed to factor this into calculation\ns\n on attainment and improvement\n. \nEven so, the later reports raise\nd \nsome \nserious doubts\n, concluding\n that ‘\nrather than a simple uniform Academy effect, there has been a more comple\nx and varied process of change.’\n \nThe\n \nfinal\n \n(2008) \nreport recommended that acad\nemies should report attainment for sub-groups of pupils such as FSM or EAL. \n2\n) \nComparisons\n with the predecessor school in the \nmonth before\n closure\n, often \naffected by\n \ndemoralisation\n, also \nexaggered\n improvement claims\n; \ncomparisons \nwith earlier years\n would h\nave been more \nvalid\n. \n3\n) \nThe \n2007 National Audit Office report\n \nhad similar flaws\n. \nNevertheless\n, \nhidden \nbehind the \npositive style and presentation\n, it\n \nconceded \nthat academy stat\nus had had less impact than \nother \nprogrammes\n such as\n Excellence in Cities. \nOne\n chart showed that academies \nhad \nimproved no faster than the predecessor schools had in the three years \nbefore\n closure\n. \n4\n) \nThe \n2010 \nNational Audit Office report\n \nadmitted an inability\n to identify \nwhich features of academies might be causing improvement\n (p2\n0)\n,\n \nsimply\n \nwide variations\n (p18). I\nmproved attainment had\n not come from \nacademies’\n \ndisadvantaged pupils  \n(\npp27-8);\n  \nin fact the gap had risen (p6).\n \nT\nhe apparent success of academies \ndepended\n largely \non alternative qualifications (pp21-2).\n \n5\n) \nThe most rece\nnt official report \n(\nRutt\n and Styles\n, NFER\n, 2013\n) \nalso\n acknowledged\n that academies’ success depends substantially on \n‘\nequivalents\n’\n. \nIt \nconcluded\n that\n, for\n \nGCSE-only data \nwithout\n ‘equivalents’, \nacademy \npupils made less progress \nbetween KS2 and\n KS4\n.\n.\n  \n \n \n6\n) \nMost of the \ncommissioned \nresearch has been flawed\n because it failed to take into account the exceptionally high use of alternative qualifications (‘equivalents’) \nor\n the reduction in disadvantage. \n \n‘\nEquivalents\n’\n \n7\n) \nIn order to\n \nencourage\n vocational qualifi\ncations \nin a \ntarget-driven\n \nschool system\n, they had to be\n \nmatched\n with \nGCSE grades\n.\n \nIn the process, c\nonsiderable distortion\n was \ncreated\n by declaring\n that GNVQ \nIntermediate \nequate\nd\n \nin quality\n to a C\n grade\n, and, \nin quantity\n, that \none \nGNVQ \nwas\n worth\n four times as much as a GCSE\n. \n(From now\n, I use GNVQ as shorthand for GNVQ Intermediate.\n \nGNVQ has \nsince \nbeen replaced but the\n prob\nlem \nrepeated\n \nwith\n BTEC\ns\n.\n)\n8\n) \nGiven \nthat \n‘\nfive or more A*-C grades\n’\n \nw\nas \nthe key \nperformance \nindicator\n, this \nenabled\n schools to \nsubstitute \none GCSE plus one GNVQ\n for five GCSEs\n. \nAcademies have exploited this far more than other schools. \nEven \nwhen it was decided\n that \nthis\n \nshould include English and \nMaths\n, schools \nwere able \nto count English, \nMaths\n and \none \nGNVQ as five GCSEs. G\nNVQs were eventual\nly phased out but\n the 1=4 problem \ncontinued\n with\n BTEC. \n9\n) \nThe problem was evident from\n the \nstart. M\nany pupils \nin the \nearliest\n academies \nwere \ncategorised\n as \n‘\nfive A*-Cs\n’\n on the basis of a GNVQ in computing plus a grade C in art or PE\n, for example\n. This \nwould no\nt\n count as success\nful secondary education\n in other European countries. \nAlthough the \ninclusion of\n English and \nMaths\n \nmade\n the indicator\n more reliable\n, pupils \nwith English, \nMaths\n and one other subject \ncontinued to \nclassify \nas \nsuccessfully \neducated. Ac\nademies in particular expanded the teaching time for English and \nMaths\n and \nnarrowed the\n curriculum.\n10\n) \nEnquiries \nrevealed that\n \neven \nOfs\nted \nhad made\n no attempt \nto \nascertain whether the \n‘\nequivalence\n’\n was well founded, \nin terms of quality\n (C equivalence) or \nquantity (\n1=4\n). \nMy\n investigation showed that half of pupils passing GNVQ Science, supposedly \nworth\n C or above\n at GCSE\n, \nonly \nobtained D or E grades in GCSE \nMaths\n; b\ny comparison, over 90% of pupils \nwith\n a C or above in GCSE Science achieve\nd\n a C or above in \nG\nCSE \nMaths\n. \nThe result was similar when \nGNVQ \nComputing was compared with GCSE \nMaths\n. \n11\n) \nSubstituting\n spuriously ‘equivalent’ qualifications is damaging to pupils for various reasons. They \nprobably\n have less \n‘street value’ than GCSEs, both in terms of \nemploymen\nt and continuing education, and\n provide a poorer foundation for A-level. \n \nChanging pupil populations\n12\n) \nWhatever the reasons, it\n is statistically irrefutable that\n \npoverty \nis associated with\n lower\n academic achievement\n. One imperfect but \nconvenien\nt\n measure of poverty is free school meal\n entitlement\n (FSM). T\nhe statistics show that FSM pupils are only \nhalf as likely\n to achieve five or more A*-Cs or equivalent \nwith \nEnglish and \nMaths\n. \n(In 2011, the off\nicial measure of disadvantage\n was expanded to inclu\nde looked-after children, \nthough statistically \nthes\ne are few of these compared to FSM\n.)\n13\n) \nSome of the \nearly\n \nacademies \nvigorously \nremoved\n pupils who \nseemed\n \nun\nlikely to achieve five A*-Cs\n,\n \neven with\n equivalents\n. Some academies excluded l\narge numbers \nof pup\nils\n,\n or p encou\nrag\ned \nparents \nto take their children elsewhere\n to avoid exclusion\n. In\n other cases, \nexpensive school uniform \ndrove poorer families away\n. \nO\nne of\n the first 12 academies \nreduced its FSM pupils from 51% to 11%; \nthe\n sports \nequipment\n alone\n cost £130\n and \nfamilies were told\n \nthat\n computers with broadband\n were required\n.  \nTh\nough th\nis was an extreme case, \nmany academies \nsubstantially \nreduced\n the proportion of FSM pupils. \n14\n) \nIn other cases, the change in pupil population was achieved through exp\nansion: the academy was able to \nattract \nnew pupils from outside its traditional catchment\n, partly as a result of impressive new buildings\n. Parents \nwho \ndeliberately \nchange their child’s school\n \nare\n likely \nto be supportive and \naspirational\n. T\nhis is impossible\n to register statistically. However, whe\nn\n \nadditional pupils are non-\nFSM, one \ncan \nreasonably\n \nexpect them\n to \nbe as successful\n as non-FSM pupils nationally: it is \ninappropriate \nto \ncontinue \ncompar\ning\n the academy’s results with those of the predecessor schools \nas if the pupil population w\nere\n \nunchanged\n. \n15\n) \nOfficial evaluations, while recording the \nfall \nin FSM pupils\n, have failed to factor this in\nto their \nevaluations of attainment, i.e.\n they \nhave not \ncompar\ned\n like with like\n, falsely attributing improved performa\nnce to academy governance\n. \n16\n) \nIt should also be noted that\n, by around 2007,\n \nmore \nschools with modest levels of disadvantage \nwere becoming\n academies\n, and the\n prior \n(KS2) \nattainment \nof academy entrants was rising towards the\n national \naverage\n.  \nMy own research: emerging problems17\n) \nDrawing on official data, \nmy research has\n \nscrutinised\n \nattainment figures\n \nregularly\n \nfrom 2006 to 2012\n. Like \nPwC, I \nconsistently \nexcluded academies in their first year of operation, as \none can \nscarcely\n ascribe GCSE results \nsat\n in June to the \nfact that the pupils’ school has\n been \nan academy for 10 months. \nU\nnlike\n PwC and \nmost \nother officially commissioned evaluations, I have attempted to take into account the impact of Academies’ heavy use of \nalternative\n qualifications. \nIn \none st\nudy\n I \nestimated\n how much of an academy’s apparent improvement \nresults from\n having fewer disadvantaged pupils than \nits\n \npredecessor school.  \n18\n) \nSince\n GCSE results \nacross England have increased annually,\n \nI have adjusted \nthe r\naw data \nfor academies and \nnon-academies\n alike\n in order to measure real improvement.\n \n(\nThis is \nrather \nlike \nan economist explaining\n what £100 in 1990 is worth \n‘\nin today’s money\n’\n.\n)\n \n19\n) \nMy research began with the \nJune \n2005 results\n, i.e. \nthe 12 \nacademies which opened in September 2002 \no\nr \n2003. \nIt\n was already apparent\n that official claims were \nmisleading\n: t\nhe dramatic increase in five A*-Cs \n‘\nor equivalent\n’\n was almost entirely due to non-GCSE \ncertificates\n. \nOne indicator was\n how many pupils \nactually \nhad \nC or ‘equivalent’ \nqualifications in f\nive or more \nsubjects\n. \n2002 predecessor schools\n:\n \n24% \nshown as \n5 or more A*-Cs \n‘\nor equivalent\n’\n \nwhilst \n20% qualified in five or more subjects. \n              \n2005 academies\n:\n 37% \nshown as \n5 or more A*-Cs \n‘\nor equivalent\n’\n \nwhilst \nonly \n22\n% qualified in five or more subjects. \n              \n              \n              \n              \n \n \nIn other words, very little \nreal \nimprovement\n (20% to 22%)\n. \nE\nmphasis was beginning to be placed on the inclusion of English and \nMaths\n, but\n this \nalso showed very little improvement\n - \nfrom 14% \nin \n2002 to 15% \nin \n2005.\nA\ncademies did considerably better a\nt English and \nMaths\n \nin \nthe \n2006 results\n, reflecting a \nconcerted \ndrive\n, but \nreliance on \n‘equivalents’\n remained high. \n20\n) \nC\nlose analysis \nshowed that even \nthe \nhigher achieving pupils \nin academies tended \nto have a narrow curriculum. For example, \nlooking at\n th\neir most successful 42 percent\n of pupils\n (\ni.e. those gaining five or more A*-Cs or equivalent\n)\n: \nThis loss of breadth \nappears\n much greater than in most other schools. \n21\n) \nAcademies entered 13 times as many pupils for GNVQ as their predecessor schools: on average 1.3 entries per pupil compared with 0.1 per pupil. Some pupils \nwere\n entered for \nthe notional equivalent of 20 different subjects. \n \n22\n) \nBased on the 2007 results,\n \nI\n \nscrutinised\n the changing pupil populations. \nR\neduced numbers of FSM pupils \nwere \nfactored into the analysis. \nAlternatively\n, w\nhere academies had attracted more non-FSM pupils than their predecessor schools\n – the \nconsequence \nof new buildings, recruitment driv\nes \nin\n surrounding areas, etc. - \n an assumption was made that these \npupils \nshould be \nas successf\nul as non-FSM pupils nationally, since\n there was no \ngood \nreason to judge their performance \nin terms of the\n pupils \nwho had \nattend\ned\n the predecessor schools. \n23\n) \nThis produced \na \nmore accurate\n evaluation of gains linked to academy status\n – ‘academy effect’\n. In the most extreme case, an apparent improvement of 22 percentage points \nwas \nentirely \naccounted for\n \nby factoring in the change in pupil population. A\ndjusted \nimp\nrovement statistics ranged from \n+\n19 percentage points to -27, averag\ning\n at 0. \nIt should be noted that this \nwas a separate \ncalculation \nand \ndid not take into account the impact of replacing GCSEs with GNVQs.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe current situation24\n) \nAs noted above, recent NFER research \nbased on 2012 results\n \nhas \nrecently \nconfirmed that academies rely substantially for their \napparent \nimprovement on ‘equivalent’\n qualifi\ncations\n. \nI\nmproved \nDfE\n \nstatistical\n presentation had already ena\nbled me to do so \nbased o\nn the 2011 examination entry. The \nDfE\n \nnow provide\n \nGCSE-only figures \nand \nalso \ndiscrete\n data\n for\n disadvantaged\n pupils. \n184 academies \nwere \nopen by September 2009\n \ni.e. long enough for a cohort of pupils to have completed Key Stage 4 \nwhile \nat \nthe \nacademy\n before\n taking GCSEs in June 2011\n. \nUnless\n otherwise stated, \nthe \nfollowing \nanalysis is \nbased on these 184 academies. \n(This date\n also mean\ns\n, of course, that Coalition academies\n, \nwith\n different characteristics,\n are not included.)\nAcademies, failing schools and disad\nvantage\n25\n) \nFirst \nof all, it is important to question the \nstereotype\n that pre-Coalition academies \ngenerally\n replace\nd\n low achieving schools in \ndisadvantaged \nareas. \nT\nhe earliest \n and most disadvantaged, \n44 opened by September 2006\n,\n have an average 33% of pupils with FSM entitlement\n -\n well above \nnational \naverage\n but \naverage for major conurbations\n \nsuch as \nManchester, Birmingham or inner London. \nOf\n all \npre-Coalition academies (open by September 2010),\n only half can claim to replace ‘fa\niling schools\n’\n, \naccording to\n \nthe \npredecessor schools’ results a year \nbefore closure\n and\n on the \n‘floor target’ \nc\nriterion\n; a\nround a third do not fit the \ndisadvantage \nstereotype,\n \ndue to\n a selective intake or\n few FSM\n pupils\n. \nGCSE and ‘equivalent’ qualificatio\nns\n26\n) \nIn 2011, \n48\n% of academy pupils (i.e. academies open by Sept 2009) \ngained five or more A*-C grades \nor equivalents\n including English and \nMaths\n, but only 3\n5\n% based on\n \nGCSEs only\n -\n a \ndifference \nof 13\n percentage points. In mainstream maintai\nned schools a\ncross England, the comparative figures are 59% ‘with equivalents’, 53% by GCSEs alone, a \ndifference \nof 6 percentage points. In other words, academies rely \ntwice as much on alternative qualifications\n. \nT\nhe \ndifference\n between ‘with equivalents’ and ‘GCSEs only’ \nin individual academies \nspreads evenly from 0 to 45 percent points\n (\neven 70 \nin one case\n)\n. \nThe difference is more than 20 percentage points i\nn \na fifth of\n academies\n. \n27\n) \nThe\n current Secretary of State has \nloudly \ndenounced\n ‘gaming’ (i.e. exploitation of \nalternative qualifications) to inflate exam success. It \nseems \nironic that academies are the worst offenders. \n28\n) \nIt is evident\n that ‘equivalent’ qualifications do not \nequate with\n good GCSE grades. \nMany\n academy \npupi\nls with\n E-\nG grades \nin \nGCSE Science or \nMaths\n \nare\n deemed to have obtained the ‘equivalent’ of A*-C via an alternative qualification. \nAlthough some\n awards\n (e.g. Engineering) do signify a \nwider\n \nvocational \ncurriculum, most are easier versions of \npopular\n GCSE su\nbjects (Science and ICT\n \nare the most \nfrequent\n, followed by Business\n.\n)   \nDisadvantaged pupils\n29\n) \nDfE\n statistics from summer 2011 \nanalyse\n attainment specifically for disadvantaged pupils. These are \nalmost all\n FSM\n-\nentitled pupils but also include looked-after children. \n34\n% of  disadvantaged pupils \nin academies \nobtained five or more A*-C grades or equivalent with English and \nMaths\n \n–\n \nthe same proportion as\n \nin \nnon-academy \nschools. \n30\n) \nHowever a\ncademies are less succe\nssful \non GCSEs-only \n(\n24%, compared with national average 28.6%.) \nAlthough academies tend to have more disadvantaged pupils than other schools, disadvantaged pupils gain little from attending an academy. \n \n31\n) \nOnly i\nn \nthe oldest \nacademies \n(\nopen five years o\nr more\n)\n \nis \nGCSE-only attainment better than national average\n,\n \nbut marginally \n(\n30% as opposed to \n28.6%\n, i.e. a benefit to \nonly\n 1 disadvantaged pupil in 100\n)\n. There is also enormous variation \namong \nthese \nolder \nacademies \n(\na third score less than 20%)\n. \nPupils\n with low prior attainment\n32\n) \nA separate analysis \nlooks at \npupils entering secondary school with KS2 attainment below level 4 (the \nbottom\n fifth by prior attainment). \nEven \nwith \n‘\nequivalents’\n,\n only 6.9% of them reach 5 A*-C\n nationally\n, 7.6% in academies. This \nsuggests \nthat attending an academy helps only 1 in 100 \npupils \nwith low prior attainment \nto catch up. \nData for pupils with Level 4 KS2, and those with above Level 4, \nare slightly wor\nse in academies than elsewhere. I\nn other words, a\nchievement at age 16 relates almost entirely to achievement at age 11, \nregardless of\n \nthe type of school\n. \nChains\n33\n) \nMajor\n sponsors \ndo not appear\n to be any more\n effective\n. \nFirstly there is considerable variation, between major sponsors and within each chain. \nSecondly, although \ndisadvantaged pupils\n tend to do \nslightly\n \nbetter under \nmajor \nsponsors than in other academies, their attainment \nis still\n \nlower\n than in non-academie\ns. \nThirdly, the \nreliance on\n ‘equivalents’ is high, \nand very high\n in some chains and \nacademies\n. In \nhalf the chain academies,  20% or fewer disadvantage pupils achieved five or more A*-Cs with English and \nMaths\n by GCSE only. \nThe floor target\n34\n) \nAn arbitrary \nfigure, the ‘floor target’ (now being raised annually)\n,\n has been \nused\n to \nsignal\n potential closure and \nacademi\ns\nation\n. \nOn this criterion,\n one ou\nt of seven existing academies \nshould be considered for closure\n. \nThis is\n \nalso \ntrue \namong\n longer established academies. \nFurthermore, m\nany other academies \nwould only escape\n because of their heavy reliance on ‘equivalents’. \n \nWithout this\n, more than 1 in 3 academies \nmight\n be \na candidate for closure\n. \nDo academy pupils receive a rounded education\n?\n35\n) \nOver\n-\nreliance on ‘equivalents’ is \nlimiting\n the curriculum\n. Of a smaller sample chosen for close scrutiny, o\nnly 12% sat History or Geography (\ncf\n 57% \nin other schools\n). Only half as many pupils \nas elsewhere took a \ncreative art\ns subject\n. Only \na third as\n many \nas elsewhere \ntook a language (14% \ncf\n 40%). Only 10% took a Design and Technology option. \nIn order to meet English and \nMaths\n targets, \nthese academies \nwere entering\n \nmost of their pupils twice each\n year starting in Year 9. \n \n36\n) \nUsing the newly announc\ned \nEbac\n as \na\n \ncriterion\n \n(albeit problematic)\n, only 8% of academy pupils \npassed\n \nthis\n, \nhalf as many as in non-academies. In \na third of \nacadem\nies\n \nnobody\n achieved \nEbac\n in 2011.  \nIs the situation improving? \n37\n) \nT\nhree in five academies \nappeared to have improved\n more than other schools\n; \na fifth show\ned\n no trend and another fifth a decline. \nHowever\n in most of these \ncases\n the \napparent \nimprovement \nwas \ndue to ‘equivalents’\n,\n or was already \noccurring \nin the ye\nars before academy conversion. Consequently o\nnly one in five \nacademies\n could\n attribute improvement to being an academy – the elusive ‘academies effect’.\n \nAlternativesThere is a considerable literature on under\nachievement related to disadvantage\n (see Smyth and Wrigley 2013)\n.
