"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Onevoice Europe&#xa0;Summary: &#xa0;\nThe British government has played a key role in Israel/Palestine at a diplomatic level, and at the institutional level—assisting the Palestinian Authority (PA) in its critical state-building work—as well as supporting the work of important human rights org\nanisations. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, over my five years of working closely with HMG on this issue, one glaring omission has been funding for civil society peace building efforts; particularly those that seek to make progress on both sides of the Green Line. \n&#xa0;\nOne of fai\nlures of Oslo, and much that has followed, has been a lack of investment in Israeli and Palestinian youth, and in giving them a stake in peace, a role to play in achieving it, and a sense of optimism and dynamism. Hundreds of elite-level conferences take p\nlace every year, where the same cast of characters from both “sides” avail of business class flights and come and stay in European or American cities to discuss the same contours and proposals that have been on the table since 1993. Yet very little time, a\nttention or resources seem to be expanded by HMG, the FCO or DfID on investing in civil society and its role in securing peace. This is despite, in my experience, the existence of substantial goodwill and enthusiasm for such a method at ambassadorial and d\niplomatic level within the region. \n&#xa0;\nFurthermore, money spent in this area would, in my opinion, go much further; providing a key return on investment. Imagine, for a moment, what would happen if we saw the mobilisation of 20,000 Israelis and 20,000 Palest\ninians simultaneously, either side of the Wall, behind a common message and platform. Such an outcome is not impossible, it just requires the prerequisite resources; much more modest resources than those that are spent on big infrastructural or institution\nal projects. \n&#xa0;\nLess than 2 percent of the UK's £90 million annual budget for the area goes towards projects that promote peace; despite the fact that peace remains the UK government’s overarching goal, and its absence the region’s primary challenge. \nFurth\nermore, the Middle East is a disproportionately “young” region. Investment in youth can and must be at the foundation of HMG’s approach. They are the best hope for a new paradigm to created, and remain unencumbered by the failures of previous generations, \nor the fatalism that often dogs efforts at peace in particular. \n&#xa0;\nRecommendations:-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCreation of a restricted fund, aimed at empowering moderate elements in conflicting societies toward conflict resolution\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFunding of a flagship project in Israel/Palestine th\nat is focused on empowering young people in order to achieve peace. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCreation of a parallel fund directed at youth empowerment, including economic investment and job creation projects\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHighlighting of this sort of work by ambassadors, diplomats and FCO staf\nf so as to promote those working in this area, and foster a sense of optimism \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDonation of Embassy facilities to projects that seek to foster conflict resolution, creating a “safe space” within which people can meet. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMeeting with such groups whenever Mini\nsterial/Parliamentary visits take place.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA \nproject that I would like to highlight is OneVoice’s Y\nouth Leadership Programme (YLP)\n, which I believe is perfectly tailored to the sort of work that HMG sorely needs to invest in. \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nActivity 1: Youth Leadership Training (YLP). \n&#xa0;\nSome important \nimprovements and changes to the curriculum over last year include:\nActivity 2: \nCitizen Negotiations \n&#xa0;Activity 3: Campaigning and Advocacy Activity 4: Empowering Women. \n&#xa0; Women in Politics in Israel: \nWomen in Politics in Palestine: \nThe results were:\nA.              Training in the field of politics &amp; political participation.B.              Training in the field of social &amp; community participation.C.              Training in technical &amp; practical skills, including artistic and literature.  \n&#xa0;\n \n \nBUDGET SUMMARY &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Budget Categories \n&#xa0;\n Total  1.
