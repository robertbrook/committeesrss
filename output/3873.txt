&#xa0;&#xa0;                            RCH0021                            &#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Northern Care1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The stability of the independent residential care sector is precarious and coming under intense pressures with regard to costs of placements within children’s Homes whilst maintaining the quality of care required to support the young people as they deserve.  This is allied with an inspection process quite rightly, concentrating on progress and outcomes for young people and which has become even more intense in its scrutiny over the last few months.&#xa0;&#xa0;2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The unwavering expectation that young people are working towards meeting aspirational objectives is something that anyone who works within a residential care setting is passionate about and highly motivated to strive towards. &#xa0;3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is well recognised, that in Good and Outstanding provisions, this is integral to the culture of the care provided and competent, well qualified, stable teams who are well led by a forward thinking and compassionate manager are evident in these Homes as a general rule.&#xa0;4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As a specialist independent provider we see the above as the benchmark to achieve and work hard for this through a dynamic and flexible approach. We value the potential for working in realistic partnerships with our local authority partners and recognise that the way forward is to have an open and honest relationship which allows for better provisions offering optimum quality care in the right locations. To this end it would mean that issues of sufficiency and cross boundary placements can be managed according to the needs of the young people who are placed in our care.&#xa0;5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The current climate is turbulent and uneasily balanced and whilst we accept our requirements to provide good quality, aspirational care for the young people we look after, there are certain barriers which we are striving to overcome and which do affect the long term stability of the quality of care for many young people.&#xa0;6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whilst Residential Care is seen as a last resort for the young people, as is so often the case in the current climate, the expectations of real progress and real long term positive outcomes are often completely compromised. It is so often just too late to be able to work in a meaningful way with a young person who has been subject to multiple placement breakdowns leading to difficulties in maintaining relationships and trust. It is compromised but not impossible and given stability and a chance to make good long term relationships with a competent and compassionate staff team, there is plenty of evidence of real success for the young people as they leave into independence.&#xa0;&#xa0;7)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The reality however is that until there is an acceptance that a long term approach is viable and valued, the chances of positive outcomes are difficult to achieve.&#xa0;8)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The right placement offering the right level of needs led care is not a difficult concept and many providers are offering this in many different types of Homes with many different competencies and specialisms but until there is an acceptance that residential care is the right option for some clearly identified young people through a process of assessment of need and this is acknowledged earlier on in the young person’s life, then we will always be playing catch up for some young people. Consequently, they will not develop the level of independence and life skills required for when they are out in the community taking care of themselves.&#xa0;9)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The onset of the single inspection framework and the concurrent tracking of individual young people who are placed in residential care is welcomed by us and this will ensure that responsibilities are maintained if the decision is made to place young people across boundaries. It must be pointed out that this can be a positive action and for many well - documented reasons, some young people thrive away from their placing authority but only with access to the required support and access arrangements built in.&#xa0;&#xa0;10)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I firmly believe that the proposed reforms with regard to inspection frameworks and regulation will have a positive impact upon this&#xa0;11)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The above will ensure that young people are not placed in Homes which cannot meet their needs because there will be a greater requirement to ensure that the care planning approach is much more robust and accountable. It will also ensure that the Home’s Statement of Purpose is adhered to and that any issues of information and care planning are highlighted and corrected before a young person takes up residence. Again, this means that the Home will be able to work very closely with the LA and be very comfortable that the young persons needs and outcomes can be supported.&#xa0;12)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This will only work where there is a recognition that a place in residential care is not a last resort as mentioned before, but is the right place for the young person to live, grow up and develop. &#xa0;13)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Likewise, as the young person moves towards independence; it is crucial that this is planned and well thought out by the professionals concerned. Moving unsupported out into independent living can completely wipeout any positive outcomes and progress made whilst in the care of the Home’s teams and relative security. If a young person is to leave the regulated residential care provision on their 16th birthday, they must be well supported and there must be a strong belief that this is in their best interests. &#xa0;&#xa0;14)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The current consultation on the workforce is also encouraging .The ongoing long term aim is definitely to be a provider where our workforce is highly experienced, has the necessary skills and has overall stability within a culture of personal and professional development. The expectation is that they should receive a professional wage for this skill set. However, the figures need to add up salary wise and hence ensure the quality of care is that which is required. This means an understanding that where a specific set of skills are required with regard to “upbringing” tied into the young person needs, this has to be funded appropriately. &#xa0;15)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I fully agree that it is important that a residential care team has all of the relevant status, competency and experience to understand the intricacies of how to support a young person’s journey through care without constantly having to look for outside support and this means that they are going to have to have access to continuing learning and development whilst in post, as well as the motivation to access this and the recognition that this is a career path which has merit.&#xa0;16)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I make this point because it won’t matter what qualifications or experience a worker has if there is no stability or continuity for the young person in the care placement and the opportunity to work to affect change is very limited. Continuity and appropriateness of placement is the only answer to better outcomes and this is proved again and again where we do have young people placed for optimum lengths of time where relationships can build and affect positive changes to young people’s life chances. &#xa0;17)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition to this, the present feeling of vilification of the sector as interpreted by the popular press is unhelpful with regard to raising the status of the residential care worker, as is the unhelpful stance that all private providers are only in it for the money and don’t care about the level of care they offer which is patently untrue. &#xa0;18)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This is particularly unhelpful when trying to recruit staff into positions which hold huge levels of responsibility and accountability. They are working with some of the most vulnerable young people in our society, in one of the most heavily regulated sectors. &#xa0;&#xa0;19)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; All of this must be swept away before there is any hope that a residential worker will step onto this career path and work towards specific vocational qualifications with an eye to their future, notwithstanding the issue of appropriate wages.&#xa0;20)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In conclusion therefore, for those young people who are identified as needing the care and support from a nurturing and supportive environment within a children’s Home, this must be viewed positively by those with responsibility, as a means to help to build resilience and a way to move forward positively with the realities of life in the community and wider society. &#xa0;&#xa0;21)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Relationships are key and where young people in our care have positively achieved; this has been scaffolded by strong, nurturing environments with boundaries and carers with aspirational expectations. This can only be achieved with stability from placement length and staff teams and an understanding of the value that such a place to live and develop can be a positive and motivating experience not just a final attempt at making it work with all its associated barriers.&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
