"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Tim Yeo MP, Chair,Energy and Climate Change Committee (FTF 11)&#xa0;\nThank you for your letter of 16 December.\n&#xa0;\nI am replying in a personal capacity rather than on behalf of the Energy and \nClimate Change Committee. I draw in particular on my experience as Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee in the last Parliament. I was conscious of \nthe difficulty of maintaining the focus of the Committee as the date for a \npossible General Election drew nearer.\n&#xa0;\nAgainst this background I believe that fixed-term Parliaments and the \nconsequent greater certainty about the dates of General Elections will be helpful \nto the work of Select Committees.\n&#xa0;\nIn the current Parliament it will be easier for the Energy and Climate Change \nCommittee to plan its work \nprogramme\n right through until the spring of 2015 in the clear knowledge that the House of Commons will still be in session at that \ntime. This will mean that both Members and Committee staff can remain \nfocused on completing a fuller \nprogramme\n than would be possible if there was \nuncertainty about the date of the General Election.\n&#xa0;\nInevitably the ability to achieve consensus in Committee reports may be eroded \nas election campaigning begins in earnest but even this consideration will be \nmade somewhat easier by the removal of uncertainty about the election date. \nAs Members and Committee staff become accustomed to fixed term \nParliaments, there may be greater scope for better strategic planning, right at the start of a Parliament, on what the Committee wants to achieve over five \nyears. This may, for example, help Committees to take a proactive approach to \nscrutiny and help set the agenda in its policy area.\n&#xa0;\n9 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
