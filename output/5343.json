"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Margaret Thomas (TWR0010)\nDear Sir\n/Madam\n,\nGatwick Airport – Dec 24\nth\n 2013.\n1.\nAlthough we appreciate these were clearly exceptional circumstances\n,\n it is abundantly clear that NO provision or fore-thought had ever been given to an event of this magnitude, no man\nual override for computer and power failure had ever been perceived, no alternative announcement facilities had been put aside to cover such an event and personnel were not aware or trained to deal with such an event and had no idea what to do next.\n2.\nAt t\nhe time of writing this letter you find me and my family \nat home at 19:00 on Christmas Eve, but unfortunately for my children, \nWITHOUT, the provision for making their Christmas a memorable and special occasion\n,\n as we had planned and hoped for.\n3.\nWe started\n our day at 03:00am\n.  Santa’s special presents duly packed and ready for the next day for Matthew 7 and Owen 8. \n \nW\ne \narrived at \nthe airport \nat 04:45 in plenty of \ntime for our scheduled 09:00 take off flight to Sham \nE\nl \nSheikh\n on EZY8851\n.\n  E\nven with the \ndelay\n for the \nroad traffic accident on the M25\n/M23\n just outside the airport\n and the extreme weather conditions\n,\n \nWE\n had managed to plan ahead and anticipate all\n the \nlikely problems\n.  The car \nparking \nvalet company were as good as their word and\n met us on time \nto \ncollect our car and take\n it\n to a place of safety for the \nfull \nduration of our holiday.\n  ALL PLANNED AND PERFECTLEY EX\nE\nCUTED SO FAR……………YES!!!!!\n?\n  \nTHEN…………………\nIn steps\n Gatwick Airport and\n Easy Jet. \n4.\nAt 05:\n30 we joined the \nhordes\n in the \nNorth terminal,\n w\ne\n are advised through\n a \ngarbled message delivered by a” foreign tongued” person wearing what we presume to be a uniform and therefore representing the \nairport \ncompany a message, saying that the” power is down” but they will have it fixed shortly.\n \nWe wait.\n5.At 08:00 we are advised that the \nNorth terminal is \ninoperable and\n we are advised to \nproceed to the \nSouth terminal, by internal train, where the whole operation will be managed and we will be “on our way soon.”\nWe wait\n6.At 12:44 we are asked to check in \nour luggage at a make-shift Virgin Atlantic check in desk, run by Easy Jet.  Once checked in we ask our Easy Jet representative “What next\n?\n” he replied\n. \n “Your \ng\nuess is as good as mine, “Listen out for announcements\n”.\n \nWe wait.\n7.At 13:50 we make our way t\no departures lounge in the \nSouth terminal.  Nobody in the \nSouth terminal has any idea on the \nNorth terminal Easy Jet flight situation.  By chance, we are informed by \na fellow passenger  “all Easy Jet \nNorth terminal passengers should head for gate 95” -  to make their way back to the original starting point - \nNorth terminal……………..\nwhere we started\n at 05:30am!!!!!\nWe embark on to the coach, duly allocated\n and \nas instructed by the uniformed airport perso\nn\nne\nl at\n gate 95\n. \n8.We disembark the coach and are directed though the \nterminal buildings to the North terminal departure lounge\n.\nWe wait.\n9.\nAt \n14:55 we happen to be in the \nvi\ncinity\n of a loud speaking \nEasy Jet \nrep.\n -\n she announces that our flight is now CANCELLED\n and that we should make our way to the Sea food counter \nto\n await further instructions from a\n “\nGatwick \nServis A\nir\n”\n representative.  At this point we are told to exit the building through a STAFF ONLY EXIT\n, this we do\n.  We join another extensive queue for w\nhat we discover\n is \nan\n \nincoming \nPassport Control \narea.\n  After 45 minutes in this queue we are directed to a baggage reclaim area.\n  An “Evacuation Marshall” is waiting at the baggage carousel.  \nWhen asked what procedure we should follow to retrieve our lugga\nge she responds with” I have NO IDEA! \n-t\nhere is no plan or procedure in place to resolve this type\n \nof situation and there are no representatives of Easy Jet available to help with retrieving our LOST luggage\n”\n.\n  With nobody available to turn to we, exhauste\nd, \nresolve to exit the building retrieve our \ncar and go home…………….without our luggage.  It is obviously “lost in the system”\n&#xa0;\n10.Starting on the laptop in the car before returning home\n \nwe\n Check Online\n:-\n11. \nYou are our holiday/dream makers.\nWhat do we do \nnow?\n&#xa0;\n12. We await, with much anticipation, your response.\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
