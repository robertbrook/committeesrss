[normal]Q195 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Thank you very much for coming. You know why we are here and why we have invited you to give evidence. The House of Lords report that we intend to make on youth unemployment will be published in April. We have had a range of witnesses, including youth, and today we have had two very good sessions, with the Director-General and then with the Commissioner, which helped us to put the jigsaw together more. You are very important here, because we have had questions about trade unions for most of our witnesses but 
[normal]now 
[normal]we will hear it from the horse’s mouth, as we say
[normal]—t
[normal]hat expression means, “The people who actually know”. We are looking forward to this session.
[normal] 
[normal]You have met everyone, but I think it would be good idea if we said what our experience is, starting from the Member on your right.
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] I am Clive Brooke—Lord Brooke. I have been in the House of Lords for 16 years, prior to which I was in the 
[normal]l
[normal]abour movement as General-Secretary of a union that was affiliated to the TUC, and I was a close friend of John Monks as well.
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn: [bold]I am David Wilson. I am 
[normal]what we call a Cross-Bench Peer—an independent Peer
[normal]. I have been in the House of Lords for 22-odd 
[normal]years
[normal]. I have had a career mostly in public service, including that unfashionable thing, being
[normal] 
[normal]a colonial governor—quite an experience.
[normal]The Chairman[bold]:[bold] I am Detta O’Cathain. I am a Conservative Member of the House of Lords. I have been in the House of Lords for 22 years. I came to the House of Lords through the business route rather than the political route, but I am a Conservative Peer.
[normal]Lord Freeman:[bold] 
[normal]I am Lord Freeman. I was formerly House of Commons, and now I am in the House of Lords. I have been in the House of Lords now for quite a number of years. I am very 
[normal]grateful from my 
[normal]standpoint
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]you have come to see
[normal] us, because some of these questions are really, really important. 
[normal] 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Thank you. 
[normal]I shall start.
[normal] There is a general consensus that youth unemployment across 
[normal]Europe
[normal] is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis, and while things like banking seem to be getting a lot of push and business is beginning to pull up, w
[normal]e are still worried about the effect 
[normal]particularly 
[normal]on the young of 
[normal]the crisis in 
[normal]finding jobs.
[normal] Could you summarise for us your own view of the exact nature of the current problems and the issues that you are most concerned about?
[normal]Cinzia Sechi:[bold] 
[normal]I will say just a few words. I t
[normal]hank you for 
[normal]this 
[normal]invitation. 
[normal]It is an honour for us to be able to share our views on 
[normal]youth unemployment
[normal] in 
[normal]Europe
[normal], 
[normal]because that has been 
[normal]one of the biggest concerns of 
[normal]the 
[normal]European trade 
[normal]union 
[normal]movement over 
[normal]the 
[normal]past five years. 
[normal]It is a great opportunity to present you with some of the 
[normal]achievements
[normal] that we have made with employers’ organisations, because we really believe in the social dialogue at the European level and we will share with you the specific positions of the trade union movement in order to enrich
[normal] your thinking on this issue.
[normal]The questions will be addressed 
[normal]mainly 
[normal]by 
[normal]my colleague 
[normal]Ignacio Doreste. 
[normal]I am Cinzia Sechi. 
[normal]I deal mainly with 
[normal]the 
[normal]European 
[normal]social 
[normal]dialogue
[normal], general equality issues and precarious work, while 
[normal]Ignacio is our adviser on youth policies. 
[normal]We will try to complement each other as much as possible, and hopefully will answer your questions in a meaningful manner.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]I should have said to you that the witnesses receive a transcript of this session to check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. 
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] 
[normal]The nature of 
[normal]youth unemployment is 
[normal]actually 
[normal]not that different from what 
[normal]is happening 
[normal]in the banking 
[normal]system and the financial 
[normal]sector. 
[normal]First, we would like to point out that the youth unemployment rate 
[normal]was 
[normal]already 
[normal]high before the 
[normal]outbreak of the 
[normal]crisis. 
[normal]In 
[normal]Europe
[normal], this is d
[normal]ue to 
[normal]the 
[normal]lack of investment 
[normal]in the productive sectors, which are sustainable both in terms of respecting the environment and in terms of 
[normal]creating quality jobs. 
[normal]That is our main point. 
[normal]Before the crisis—during the golden years, so to speak—
[normal]many 
[normal]EU countries 
[normal]were investing a huge percentage of 
[normal]their gross national product in 
[normal]speculative rather than productive sectors. 
[normal]In 
[normal]Spain
[normal], for 
[normal]example, the situation is quite dramatic when it comes to unemployment in general but to youth unemployment in particular. 
[normal]I 
[normal]do 
[normal]not 
[normal]want 
[normal]to stick 
[normal]only 
[normal]to my own experience, but 
[normal]Spain
[normal] is a good example
[normal] to look at
[normal].
[normal] In 
[normal]Spain
[normal], a
[normal] lot of 
[normal]investment was 
[normal]allocated to the construction sector. 
[normal]It was growing a lot because of the real estate bubble, so with the outbreak of the crisis there was a huge increase in youth unemployment and in unemployment in general. From that moment on
[normal], 
[normal]there has been 
[normal]no macroeconomic policy to tackle 
[normal]the origin of the crisis
[normal]. 
[normal]Even though I have focused on my country, it is 
[normal]applicable to 
[normal]the 
[normal]other 
[normal]27 EU 
[normal]countries. 
[normal]It might be timely for us to share with you an investment plan, which was approved by the Executive Committee of the European Trade Union Confederation a 
[normal]couple of months ago
[normal], through which we are trying to apply pressure to national Governments but 
[normal]especially the European Commission in order to shift from the current situation
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in which we are 
[normal]focusing 
[normal]much more 
[normal]on 
[normal]the 
[normal]labour market 
[normal]and the reduction of the public deficit, 
[normal]to a new trend 
[normal]in 
[normal]which 
[normal]we are applying to invest in strategic sectors. We are actually allocating 2% of the European 
[normal]domestic product
[normal] to this strategy. Maybe Cinzia can
[normal] complete the presentation
[normal] of this strategy
[normal].
[normal]Cinzia Sechi:[bold] 
[normal]Yes. It is an investment plan and it is a political document belonging to the 
[normal]ETUC
[normal]. However, on investments at the European level there are some shared views with employers. We recently addressed a letter
[normal] to President Bar
[normal]ro
[normal]so and 
[normal]President V
[normal]an Rompuy 
[normal]on the need for Europe to direct more resources to our industries—this is very much a concern in the business sector and the strategic and public sectors, where it is a specific demand of the ETUC—to 
[normal]boost research into different sectors that could be much more productive
[normal], 
[normal]and
[normal] to boost demand and the number of quality jobs in the near future
[normal]. We have copies of the document with us 
[normal]and we can provide 
[normal]electronic versions. It is the ETUC
[normal]’s main 
[normal]campaign 
[normal]and involves
[normal] 85 
[normal]confederal 
[normal]organisations across 36 
[normal]European 
[normal]countries
[normal], including of course the TUC in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. 
[normal]We also have members beyond Europe, in 
[normal]Turkey
[normal].
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]That would be most helpful. 
[normal]Thank you
[normal] very much indeed.
[normal]Q196 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Freeman:[bold] To what extent is the crisis that affects most European Union members a function of the lack of industrial and commercial demand? We have just heard evidence about the l
[normal]ack of skills
[normal], 
[normal]and 
[normal]in some cases the 
[normal]lack of 
[normal]proper 
[normal]education and experience
[normal] for young people in the sense that they are not qualified or available in the practical sense for work. What 
[normal]is
[normal] the balance between the demand from 
[normal]industry and 
[normal]the supply of 
[normal]quality and experience of young people?
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] 
[normal]That is q
[normal]uite a 
[normal]timely 
[normal]question
[normal], which I think completes the previous one
[normal]. 
[normal]We have been talking about the lack of demand and the lack of investment in strategic sectors, but when it 
[normal]comes to 
[normal]the 
[normal]lack of skills
[normal] we would point out first that it is agreed worldwide that 
[normal]current
[normal]ly, especially at the European level, the 
[normal]young 
[normal]generation are 
[normal]the most trained 
[normal]and well prepared 
[normal]in 
[normal]European 
[normal]history. 
[normal]T
[normal]here has been a lot of focus on the 
[normal]lack of skills
[normal] among young people that are needed to meet the demands of the private sector, because this is something that we constantly 
[normal]see 
[normal]when we 
[normal]meet 
[normal]our partners and have conversations with them. Even though we 
[normal]understand that there is room for improvement
[normal],
[normal] especially in 
[normal]the 
[normal]vocational system, we want
[normal]ed
[normal] to point out that 
[normal]in the crisis 
[normal]we 
[normal]are facing 
[normal]a lack of demand
[normal] and investment in strategic sectors
[normal].
[normal] As Cinzia said, this also affects domestic demand.
[normal]Again, o
[normal]n skills, together with employers and 
[normal]many 
[normal]other 
[normal]important 
[normal]stakeholders
[normal], we have 
[normal]signed up to 
[normal]the European Alliance for Apprenticeships, since we believe that apprenticeships are a compelling way of 
[normal]tailoring 
[normal]the demands of certain sectors to prepare students when they leave the education sector. We have also 
[normal]signed a European charter of apprenticeships
[normal], together with employers. This is actually one of the 
[normal]most important milestones of the past 
[normal]eight 
[normal]years
[normal] when it comes to youth unemployment. We signed up to a framework for action on youth employment, which was divided into 
[normal]four chapters
[normal], one of which was training
[normal]. 
[normal]We are aware that there is room for improvement, even though we considered that the main 
[normal]problem is 
[normal]the 
[normal]lack of demand 
[normal]and the 
[normal]industrial 
[normal]and 
[normal]macroeconomic
[normal] problem
[normal]. 
[normal]It has been said that it is also important to remind ourselves that in 
[normal]the past companies 
[normal]were considered 
[normal]somehow 
[normal]to have 
[normal]an obligation to train their employees. 
[normal]Now, what we hear from our partners is that they are demanding that young 
[normal]people 
[normal]leave the education system with 
[normal]specific skills 
[normal]that are required by these companies
[normal]. 
[normal]We also think that the
[normal]re should b
[normal]e a balance of responsibilities when it comes to training their employees.
[normal]Cinzia Sechi:[bold] 
[normal]Briefly, I will 
[normal]complete
[normal] what Ignacio has just said in answer to Lord Freeman’s question. 
[normal]We have always 
[normal]had
[normal] mismatches between 
[normal]the 
[normal]supply 
[normal]side 
[normal]and 
[normal]the 
[normal]demand side. What 
[normal]is very 
[normal]concern
[normal]ing in 
[normal]Europe
[normal] is 
[normal]that 
[normal]the size of 
[normal]this 
[normal]mismatch is increasing. The risk is that we will lose a 
[normal]good 
[normal]proportion of 
[normal]the well educated young 
[normal]if we do not 
[normal]re
[normal]act in a timely manner.
[normal] The so-called NEET generation is probably one of the main concerns at the moment, because it is as Ignacio said: people have probably never been so well educated at the European level across countries, but we are not fully exploiting their potential. This might also explain why the 
[normal]long-term 
[normal]youth unemployment rate is
[normal] increasing
[normal] in a number of member states. That will also mean that
[normal] more resources 
[normal]will have to be spent 
[normal]in the future if we want to 
[normal]attract and retain these people in the labour market. 
[normal]What is not helping 
[normal]at all 
[normal]is the proliferation of typical contractual arrangements. In 
[normal]a country like 
[normal]Spain
[normal], the 
[normal]flexibilisation of the 
[normal]labour market 
[normal]has not 
[normal]shown 
[normal]itself able 
[normal]to 
[normal]att
[normal]ract or retain young people in a direct manner.
[normal]Lord Freeman:[bold] 
[normal]I have a brief supplementary question. 
[normal]There are 
[normal]so 
[normal]many 
[normal]things 
[normal]that 
[normal]you can do 
[normal]in 
[normal]relation to 
[normal]industrial and commercial demand. Should there be greater direction in 
[normal]the 
[normal]balance of skills
[normal] that young people need to acquire?
[normal] We live in a 
[normal]digital age, a 
[normal]computer age
[normal], but s
[normal]ome jobs are
[normal] more prosaic and 
[normal]less glamorous and are not being filled
[normal] or are being filled from outside the European Union. 
[normal]Do you feel that 
[normal]not direction but 
[normal]education of young people 
[normal]at school is a 
[normal]more realistic
[normal] thing to do in terms of employment
[normal]?
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] 
[normal]That is included in the framework of action: that we 
[normal]negotiate with employers. 
[normal]We should 
[normal]identify 
[normal]exactly 
[normal]the sectors
[normal] where there is no demand and the reasons for the lack of attractiveness for young people, because if it is because of bad conditions, instead of encouraging young people to go into these sectors 
[normal]we have to improve the
[normal]ir
[normal] 
[normal]working 
[normal]conditions.
[normal] That is our position. Any assessment and policy following that assessment should be done in a way that ensures that all citizens are included when launching the policy.
[normal] 
[normal]This framework of action on youth unemployment is something that we are going to provide.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Thank you very much. This is the European charter on apprentices.
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] It is kind of messy because there are so many different things that we are dealing with, but yes, we have that European charter on apprenticeships and the European Alliance for Apprenticeships. 
[normal]Q197 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] 
[normal]We now m
[normal]ove on to 
[normal]talk about 
[normal]how trade unions can work with national Gove
[normal]rnments to reduce unemployment and how you can work with the EU. There is not as much evidence of the social partnership in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] as you might find in some European countries. Perhaps you might care to comment generally on what the relationships are like in different countries and how that helps or does not help to solve youth unemployment.
[normal]Back at home, I will be very frank
[normal], people would say that the
[normal] unions 
[normal]may speak 
[normal]about youth unemployment but they do not 
[normal]actually 
[normal]represent the young
[normal] unemployed
[normal]. 
[normal]They represent increasingly a group of p
[normal]ublic sector workers and 
[normal]a diminishing number of private sector employees, and in 
[normal]a sense 
[normal]the 
[normal]unemployed are excluded 
[normal]from them and cannot get into these jobs, particularly 
[normal]as 
[normal]the 
[normal]public sector is declining. 
[normal]Yet the unions wish to speak on behalf of the unemployed. I wonder if you would care to 
[normal]comment on that
[normal],
[normal] because 
[normal]those 
[normal]criticism
[normal]s are 
[normal]levelled in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. 
[normal]I would like you to give us a European view generally of how you see the 
[normal]nature of the relationship 
[normal]between the EU and 
[normal]the unions
[normal] and how they would solve the problem
[normal]. 
[normal]I would like an insight into what may be happening elsewhere, and then, if you like, you are free to comment on the specific 
[normal]UK
[normal] issues.
[normal] 
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] 
[normal]That is quite interesting. 
[normal]In order to prepare for 
[normal]some of the 
[normal]questions
[normal],
[normal] we 
[normal]contacted our 
[normal]colleagues in 
[normal]the 
[normal]TUC. 
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] 
[normal]We have taken some evidence from them about these issues. They were very good.
[normal]The Chairman[bold]:[bold] And it was excellent evidence.
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] How can 
[normal]trade unions at the national level interact with 
[normal]Governments to tackle unemployment? This is not only about the trade unions themselves. Of course we can do a lot at 
[normal]company and sector
[normal]al levels, and when it comes to negotiating with Governments not only the unions but employers are engaged through social dialogue. That is our point. As I just said, we talk with our colleagues from the TUC, and with them we acknowledge the unfortunate lack of 
[normal]social dialogue in the 
[normal]UK
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]When it comes to the criticisms of the 
[normal]lack of unions
[normal]’ 
[normal]representativeness 
[normal]of cash workers, 
[normal]young workers
[normal], unemployed people, first of all we would like to point out that a lot has been done over the past year within the trade union movement. Right now we have, I think, youth 
[normal]committees in almost 
[normal]every trade union organisation
[normal] 
[normal]affiliated to the ETUC. We have 85 trade union organisations 
[normal]from 
[normal]3
[normal]6 
[normal]European 
[normal]countries, 
[normal]even though 
[normal]there is room for improvement
[normal]—that is for sure
[normal]. 
[normal]We also have a youth committee at the European level. 
[normal]I had the opportunity to attend an a
[normal]ssembly of young workers at 
[normal]the TUC headquarters in 
[normal]London
[normal] a couple of months ago. They t
[normal]ackle the situation from a different perspective
[normal], and there are many different things that they are studying
[normal]—we are studying them 
[normal]also at the European level
[normal]—
[normal]in order to improve the affiliation rates of young workers.
[normal] 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] is a good example
[normal], where they are increasing the 
[normal]affiliation rates
[normal] of young people. We are studying many different ways, and considering not only campaigning but how to organise
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]different branches of 
[normal]the 
[normal]unions
[normal] to better represent precarious workers. There are different systems. 
[normal]Italy
[normal], for example, has a 
[normal]confederation 
[normal]that represents all the 
[normal]workers
[normal], a federation for the
[normal] regions and a
[normal] federation for the sectoral
[normal], so they have 
[normal]a federation only for precarious workers. So there are d
[normal]ifferent ways to proceed in o
[normal]rder to improve representativeness of these types of workers, and we are constantly examining the different possibilities and interchanging good practices to organise young people better.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Can I interject there? 
[normal]Which EU member states do not have youth committees? 
[normal]Perhaps you 
[normal]need notice
[normal] of that question, and if you could answer it that would be useful.
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] 
[normal]For sure, t
[normal]he 28 member states have youth
[normal] committees
[normal]. 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]All of them?
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] 
[normal]Yes.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Then that is okay.
[normal]Cinzia Sechi:[bold] 
[normal]There might be a difference within the same country. In a country like mine—I am Italian, as you can tell from my accent—there are 
[normal]three confederations
[normal]. One 
[normal]has a youth structure
[normal] in place. Others deal with youth issues, not through a specific structure of young trade unionists but through different bodies.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] So it is not the trade unions that actually have the other two.
[normal]Cinzia Sechi:[bold] 
[normal]It really depends on the structures of the confederation. But as Ignacio said, since we have members in all 28 EU member states, you will find at least one confederation with a you
[normal]th 
[normal]structure in place.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] I see. I am sorry to interrupt you, Lord Brooke. Carry on if there is anything else that you want to ask. 
[normal]Q198 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] We as a Committee have found it difficult to 
[normal]arrange 
[normal]meetings with unemployed people. 
[normal]We have managed to arrange some, but I suspect that there are s
[normal]ome groups 
[normal]that 
[normal]are hard to reach. You 
[normal]probably h
[normal]ave the
[normal] same problems. With the unions you can have youth groups and youth conferences, but I think they are probably mainly 
[normal]conferences of people who are in employment rather than out of employment. 
[normal]Do you have any special means of making connections so that you can speak representatively on their behalf 
[normal]and fend off the criticism that you are defending the inte
[normal]rests of people who are already in work and that you are not really able to speak on behalf of those who are not in work?
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] 
[normal]I take your point. Indeed, w
[normal]e represent employed people
[normal], but when negotiating better employment benefits with the Government we are
[normal] defending 
[normal]the 
[normal]rights 
[normal]and interests 
[normal]of unemployed people. 
[normal]It really is a question many times of image and 
[normal]advertising
[normal] our own actions, but we have to acknowledge that trade unions all over Europe are suffering attacks from certain sectors of the media, which are really not helping us 
[normal]in 
[normal]integrating into society. We 
[normal]are tackling h
[normal]uge problems in many countries. Also, when it comes to o
[normal]rganising, we have 
[normal]very 
[normal]good examples of creating platforms
[normal] with civil society 
[normal]organisations. That 
[normal]is also a very wise way of exchanging views with
[normal] other stakeholders in
[normal] society such as NGOs, and even 
[normal]non-
[normal]o
[normal]rganised groups
[normal], such as those in my country with all these movements 
[normal]that 
[normal]were created after what happened in Puerta del Sol in May 2011. That is another good example. Actually we are thinking about having a European 
[normal]pathway to deal with civil society organisations
[normal].
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Just for clarification, would those civil society organisations be 
[normal]NGOs
[normal]?
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] NGOs, yes. They are talking about creating a new pathway.
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] 
[normal]Actually, it is not a pathway, but it is common ground: a document, a joint strategy—something in that class. 
[normal]Q199 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] You mentioned 
[normal]earlier 
[normal]that you have done some work on apprenticeships
[normal] and on training. Can I just follow up on that, please? 
[normal]A
[normal]s we have gone around talking to people, we have found it a bit difficult to define precisely what different people in different countries mean by 
[normal]apprenticeships
[normal]. That is question one. The other 
[normal]question 
[normal]is on training. Do you think that the quality, content and type of training across 
[normal]Europe
[normal] are what is needed? If not, are there things that should be done about that at a European Union level?
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] First
[normal] of all
[normal], 
[normal]it is not only people in general who are finding problems in defining an apprenticeship and an internship but the 
[normal]European Commission 
[normal]itself, because although it launched the proposal for a quality framework for apprenticeships, in that document, which is currently under discussion, it tackles
[normal] 
[normal]what it referred to before as 
[normal]open market internships. For many years when 
[normal]we were 
[normal]negotiating with employers 
[normal]and talking to the European Commission, 
[normal]we referred to apprenticeships as 
[normal]training schemes 
[normal]within 
[normal]the framework of the 
[normal]education system
[normal] and to internships as any kind of scheme that is after the education system, more or less. Before negotiating the framework for action on youth unemployment, we
[normal] set up a
[normal] joint definition of the different schemes with employers to avoid misunderstandings. 
[normal]At 
[normal]the European level, it is true that there are 
[normal]wide differences 
[normal]i
[normal]n 
[normal]the 
[normal]quantity
[normal] and the quality of apprenticeship schemes
[normal]. In 
[normal]countries like 
[normal]Germany
[normal], 
[normal]Austria
[normal] and 
[normal]Denmark
[normal], where they have a very 
[normal]well
[normal] 
[normal]developed 
[normal]training system, the quality and quantity of apprenticeships provided, especially within the 
[normal]vocational training 
[normal]system, are pretty well 
[normal]recognised
[normal] by society as a whole. They are quite proud. T
[normal]rade unions and employers’ organisations 
[normal]are also in many cases members of the bodies identifying the companies where students 
[normal]can 
[normal]have apprenticeships. They also 
[normal]assess 
[normal]the 
[normal]quality of 
[normal]the 
[normal]schemes. It is not only 
[normal]a 
[normal]qu
[normal]estion in many cases of the industrial fabric—what we can find in 
[normal]Germany
[normal] is completely different from what we can find
[normal] in
[normal], for example, 
[normal]Cyprus
[normal]—but it is also a question of how these bodies are conformed. 
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] Just to clarify
[normal], what would the definition of an apprenticeship be now in, let us say, 
[normal]Spain
[normal] or 
[normal]Italy
[normal]? What would “apprenticeship” mean?
[normal]Cinzia Sechi:[bold] 
[normal]We at the ETUC 
[normal]have just finished 
[normal]a project at the European level. W
[normal]e 
[normal]looked at the 
[normal]quality framework
[normal] for apprenticeships, and it showed that the definition was a common concern. If you want to find a shared definition at the European level, 
[normal]I advise you to look 
[normal]at what Cedefop
[normal] 
[normal]has provided as a definition of apprenticeships. 
[normal]Cedefop
[normal] is a tripartite agency of government, trade unions and employers, and we have 
[normal]expressed our agreement 
[normal]on that specific definition. You 
[normal]will find details 
[normal]such as the fact that 
[normal]apprenticeships 
[normal]should be provided at workplace level, that some education should also be given by public institutions
[normal] and 
[normal]that a 
[normal]contract should be att
[normal]ached to apprenticeship schemes
[normal]. There is also 
[normal]a reference to payment, which is not the case for apprenticeship schemes in some member states
[normal]. 
[normal]Cedefop
[normal] could be a good starting point. However, as Ignacio said, there is 
[normal]proliferation 
[normal]and 
[normal]a lot of political attention
[normal] on apprenticeship schemes at the European level, so in different documents
[normal] 
[normal]and publications 
[normal]unfortunately the 
[normal]definition used is 
[normal]not
[normal] 
[normal]Cedefop
[normal]’s
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]There should be a political commitment on the part of member states and social partners to work together towards a shared definition not only at 
[normal]Cedefop
[normal] level but at a higher level. 
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] I am sorry to interrupt, but what was the name?
[normal]Cinzia Sechi:[bold] [bold]Cedefop
[normal].
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]That sounds very useful. 
[normal]How many other 
[normal]member 
[normal]states
[normal] would have that and have bought into that, as they say—they have adopted this?
[normal]Cinzia Sechi:[bold] 
[normal]It has not been formally adopted, but 
[normal]it 
[normal]is 
[normal]common
[normal] ground, and it is 
[normal]one of the oldest agencies in 
[normal]Europe
[normal]. It is based, unfortunately, 
[normal]far away
[normal] in 
[normal]Thessaloniki
[normal] in 
[normal]Greece
[normal]. 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]And “encourages” employment, which they need. 
[normal]Cinzia Sechi:[bold] Yes, indeed. Apprenticeship schemes vary too much at the European level, so, again, our political demand is that we should find a common meaning.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]This 
[normal]is what we 
[normal]really 
[normal]believe. 
[normal]I am just interested to know how wide the acceptance has been of the 28 member states. 
[normal]How ma
[normal]ny people know of its existence and how many of them have agreed that it is a good thing?
[normal]Cinzia Sechi:[bold] I will turn your question around. 
[normal]First of all, the 
[normal]definition of apprenticeships is not codified in 
[normal]all 
[normal]member states.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Yes, we know that.
[normal]Cinzia Sechi:[bold] 
[normal]Sometimes it is in law, sometimes it is in regulations or 
[normal]collective agreements.
[normal] It would be interesting to see how many definitions match the 
[normal]Cedefop
[normal] definition, which matches what they have 
[normal]in 
[normal]Denmark
[normal] and 
[normal]Germany
[normal] but not 
[normal]what they have in a number of 
[normal]eastern European countries
[normal], for example, where the schemes have not been developed very much. The other main issues with apprenticeship schemes are the
[normal]ir
[normal] quality and 
[normal]their 
[normal]increased 
[normal]attractiveness
[normal] to young people.
[normal] We hear a lot 
[normal]from our members that there is a lack of places for apprentices in a number of member states, including member states with a very strong dual system, such as 
[normal]Germany
[normal] and 
[normal]Denmark
[normal]. That, again, could have an impact on the schemes in the long term but especially in the short term. 
[normal]Q200 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] I 
[normal]really 
[normal]do not want to hog the conversation
[normal], but I am very interested in what you have said
[normal]. 
[normal]You have said that the d
[normal]efinition of apprenticeships 
[normal]probably differed 
[normal]from 
[normal]the 
[normal]definition 
[normal]of apprenticeships 
[normal]that other member states 
[normal]have
[normal]. Is there 
[normal]such a thing as 
[normal]a document that shows 
[normal]the definition of the word “
[normal]apprenticeship
[normal]” in each of the 28 member states? We cannot get our heads around that.
[normal]Cinzia Sechi:[bold] 
[normal]Could you 
[normal]repeat the question
[normal], please?
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]We would like a definition of an apprenticeship. Is there a definition of what an apprenticeship is in each of the 28 member states?
[normal]Cinzia Sechi:[bold] We surveyed 10 member states and we 
[normal]found that almost all of them had 
[normal]a definition. 
[normal]I was not directly involved, but we found a definition in most of them. This definition is made either under the labour code or 
[normal]by 
[normal]collective agreements. The nature of the instrument codifying the definition differs from member state to member state.
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] 
[normal]We worked on this in the final conference that we had in November, so we will provide you with the final document, which is quite handy when it comes to apprenticeships.
[normal]I 
[normal]would like 
[normal]to 
[normal]complete this 
[normal]question 
[normal]on apprenticeships, because we may have focused too much 
[normal]on good practice in 
[normal]Germany
[normal] and 
[normal]Denmark
[normal]. There are also very good examples in 
[normal]Italy
[normal], for example, where e
[normal]mployers 
[normal]signed 
[normal]an agreement
[normal] 
[normal]with three trade union confederations, I think three years ago. 
[normal]I can 
[normal]also 
[normal]provide 
[normal]you with a brief explanation of this scheme, because it was presented as evidence of good practice for the negotiation on the framework for action 
[normal]at the European level. 
[normal]They defined in a very 
[normal]clear way three different apprenticeship schemes. 
[normal]The n
[normal]ational framework 
[normal]was 
[normal]completed six m
[normal]onths ago, with another agreement reached between employers and the 
[normal]unions on a basic salary 
[normal]of 
[normal]€400 
[normal]for every apprenticeship, which can be improved at regional level. The €400 is the 
[normal]minimum floor
[normal] for the company. In some regions, it even reaches €600 or something like that. We w
[normal]ill provide 
[normal]you with 
[normal]more information
[normal] on that
[normal]. 
[normal]In 
[normal]order to tackle 
[normal]the 
[normal]wide variety of 
[normal]apprenticeship 
[normal]schemes 
[normal]and internships all over 
[normal]Europe
[normal], the European Commission 
[normal]launched 
[normal]the 
[normal]quality framework for apprenticeships. 
[normal]It was presented last December, on the 5th I believe. 
[normal]We 
[normal]can also provide you with the statement that we launched the day after. We 
[normal]agree with 
[normal]the European Commission’s evaluation 
[normal]on 
[normal]the 
[normal]quality and quantity of apprenticeships 
[normal]all over 
[normal]Europe
[normal], 
[normal]but we were 
[normal]really 
[normal]disappointed
[normal] with the measure that it was recommending, because it is 
[normal]a 
[normal]recommendation to the Council. 
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] What was their recommendation?
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] 
[normal]Actually their recommendation is as basic as saying that a
[normal]ny training 
[normal]apprenticeship will do. The 
[normal]only thing 
[normal]they are asking for 
[normal]is for e
[normal]mployers to provide a contract, so they are definitely not tackling the quality. R
[normal]egardless of 
[normal]the 
[normal]conditions of 
[normal]the 
[normal]apprenticeship
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]they should be registered in a written contract where 
[normal]all 
[normal]these 
[normal]conditions should be kno
[normal]wn by trainee
[normal]s
[normal] before they start the apprenticeship.
[normal] 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Lord Brooke, did you want to ask question 5?
[normal]Lord [bold]Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] I think it has been covered.
[normal]Q201 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] You touched on the question of best practice, which has interested us quite a lot. How could, and how should, the Commission publicise best practice? One example that has come to us is the various bids for the employment initiative. We are told that every country, except one, which we happen to represent, has put in their bids, but these are not public documents yet, so the question is: do you think that the Commission could do more to publicise best practice? Would you support that, or is it being done enough already?
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] First
[normal] of all
[normal], the E
[normal]uropean 
[normal]T
[normal]rade 
[normal]U
[normal]nion 
[normal]C
[normal]onfederation
[normal] 
[normal]firmly 
[normal]believes that 
[normal]the 
[normal]European Commission should go 
[normal]far 
[normal]beyond 
[normal]exchanging practices in member states when it comes to promoting policies. We firmly believe that a c
[normal]ommon 
[normal]background that is obligatory for 
[normal]28 member states is necessary. 
[normal]We are n
[normal]ot talking about direct implementation. 
[normal]The best way to tailor a European initiative is through s
[normal]ocial dialogue.
[normal] 
[normal]We have identified 
[normal]many interesting 
[normal]instances of good practice
[normal], which were used, for example, in the negotiations on the framework for action and in the negotiations with the European Commission on the implementation plans of the 
[normal]Youth Guarantee
[normal]. 
[normal]Many member states are supposed to have 
[normal]already 
[normal]sent
[normal] their implementation plan to the European Commission. All that documentation is private so far. The European Commission is not discussing those plans even with the member states, as far as 
[normal]we 
[normal]know, or with the European social partners. 
[normal]We can provide 
[normal]you with 
[normal]some 
[normal]examples of good practice, which 
[normal]were used 
[normal]as common ground 
[normal]to negotiate the four 
[normal]different 
[normal]chapters
[normal] of the framework for action on youth employment
[normal]. 
[normal]We 
[normal]can give 
[normal]you s
[normal]ome good examples 
[normal]of current good practice on the 
[normal]Youth Guarantee
[normal], for example, 
[normal]in 
[normal]Finland
[normal] and in 
[normal]Denmark
[normal], 
[normal]Austria
[normal] and 
[normal]Sweden
[normal]. 
[normal]That is a great example because it has been t
[normal]ransposed to other European countries. 
[normal]The same applies to the dual training system, which was i
[normal]nitially created in 
[normal]Austria
[normal] and in 
[normal]Germany
[normal]. We also gave you the example of the 
[normal]Italian agreement for apprenticeships. 
[normal]We have an 
[normal]annex
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]with something like 20 good practices listed in it, which were presented in the negotiations on the framework for action. I always say that 
[normal]five 
[normal]examples should be selected for evidence sessions, but if it is possible I can send you the whole document. 
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] Let me get this right. 
[normal]When I ask whether the Commission should be doing more, you are doing it. 
[normal]Where are you getting 
[normal]all 
[normal]the information
[normal] from
[normal]?
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]And 
[normal]who is paying you
[normal] to do it?
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] 
[normal]Actually we obtain all this information from our affiliates. During the negotiations on the framework for action on youth employment, the 
[normal]European Commission 
[normal]functioned as a vehicle. It was the 
[normal]employers and 
[normal]the 
[normal]unions 
[normal]themselves that wanted to 
[normal]negotiate 
[normal]the different courses of action, which are included in the agreement.
[normal]Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:[bold] Should there be more collection of
[normal] data by member states? Should member states be doing this? Are you really doing this job, and is everyone else aware that you are doing it? Does it get out?
[normal]Cinzia Sechi:[bold] This is 
[normal]very much 
[normal]part of the European social dialogue. 
[normal]In order to reach that agreement with employers, we first collected evidence that social partners at the national level and at the 
[normal]sectoral level
[normal] were active in addressing youth concerns
[normal]. We collected 
[normal]that 
[normal]evidence 
[normal]first, 
[normal]and 
[normal]then 
[normal]negotiated 
[normal]a framework for action consisting of five priorities which we committed ourselves to looking 
[normal]at
[normal] in the next three years and to continuing to monitor
[normal] our members 
[normal]and see 
[normal]what they are doing
[normal], either together or unilaterally,
[normal] to address youth unemployment. 
[normal]So to answer your question, we will indeed continue to look at good practice, and at
[normal] the end of the process we will make an assessment.
[normal] Hopefully we will also be confronted with a better situation.
[normal]The Commission and the institutions are looking 
[normal]at good practice on youth unemployment 
[normal]from a different angle. 
[normal]Of course, they are very much involving Governments, whereas o
[normal]ur focus is 
[normal]more 
[normal]on social partners. Yes, we should continue to look at good practice
[normal], but we should make sure that this is not only a top-down approach. I agree very much with what you said: member states themselves should start not only putting these good practices into practice but sharing them at the local and the national level. Otherwise this European feeling will be lost. In a top-down approach, the impact of what we were doing would be limited.
[normal]Q202 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]That is very interesting. 
[normal]We have asked
[normal] about your view as to how the EU initiatives are being used in different states. How do you see the 
[normal]UK
[normal]’s response 
[normal]in comparison to others? You talked about the youth employment programme, the 
[normal]Youth Guarantee
[normal] and the youth employment initiative.
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] 
[normal]T
[normal]o answer this question we 
[normal]contacted 
[normal]the TUC
[normal] and asked for ideas
[normal]. The TUC is not happy 
[normal]at all 
[normal]with the fact that 
[normal]UK
[normal] has decided that 
[normal]the 
[normal]Youth Guarantee 
[normal]will not be implemented in the 
[normal]U
[normal]nited 
[normal]K
[normal]ingdom
[normal] as the 
[normal]Youth Contract 
[normal]initiative already covers 
[normal]the same
[normal] objectives
[normal]. The TUC produced a
[normal] very 
[normal]interesting statement on 
[normal]its 
[normal]position
[normal] on the 
[normal]Youth 
[normal]Contract
[normal]. During the negotiations on the framework for action
[normal],
[normal] the 
[normal]Youth Contract 
[normal]was presented by 
[normal]representatives 
[normal]of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] employers’ organisations
[normal] as a good practice. The 
[normal]TUC had a sound argument against 
[normal]that 
[normal]proposal
[normal], because all the 
[normal]different good practices
[normal] included in the framework for action on youth employment at the European level did not 
[normal]necessarily 
[normal]have to be 
[normal]agreed
[normal] between the social partners at the national level
[normal]. The TUC disagreed
[normal] with implementing the 
[normal]Youth Contract as
[normal] a good example. Correct me if I am wrong but I think the 
[normal]Youth Contract
[normal] was launched two years ago, so the TUC has already been able to 
[normal]assess
[normal] its 
[normal]outcomes
[normal]. It has not generated youth employment at all. 
[normal]There is n
[normal]o way 
[normal]of 
[normal]assess
[normal]ing the 
[normal]extent 
[normal]to which 
[normal]companies
[normal] are using the 
[normal]Youth Contract
[normal] to replace other 
[normal]formal jobs
[normal]. Even though it is stated in the political proposal at company level, since it is very difficult to guarantee that formal jobs are not going to be replaced 
[normal]by 
[normal]the 
[normal]Youth Contract
[normal], there is n
[normal]o statistical evidence 
[normal]of how 
[normal]net employment 
[normal]is going to be 
[normal]created solely by investing money in the private sector 
[normal]in order to subsidise jobs rather than by investing 
[normal]in economic activity itself. 
[normal]The TUC was also quite critical about the fact that the 
[normal]Youth Contract
[normal] also makes it possible for companies to 
[normal]have 
[normal]young people 
[normal]in 
[normal]unpaid
[normal] positions
[normal].
[normal] It also related the fact that the 
[normal]scheme 
[normal]meant that 
[normal]the Future Job
[normal]s
[normal] Fund 
[normal]was 
[normal]set aside when 
[normal]the Youth Contract
[normal] was 
[normal]launched by the Government.
[normal]Q203 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Freeman:[bold] You have been extremely helpful
[normal]. Over the last two days we
[normal] have heard a great deal 
[normal]and had some helpful advice 
[normal]about the supply side coming from the European Commission
[normal] and from companies
[normal]. 
[normal]I would like to ask you about t
[normal]rying to understand 
[normal]better 
[normal]the demand side 
[normal]from 
[normal]young people. 
[normal]In your judgment, are there a
[normal]ny initiatives 
[normal]that could be taken by member states to understand attitudes to work and 
[normal]how much knowledge 
[normal]there is 
[normal]about employment opportunities
[normal] or lack of them? Can you think of any initiatives that would help both to educate and to understand the p
[normal]re
[normal]dicament that many young people find themselves in?
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] We identified 
[normal]the 
[normal]good practice in the 
[normal]Czech Republic
[normal] of both employers and trade unions visiting 
[normal]schools 
[normal]at a very basic level in order to share with the students the different prospects that they might expect in their 
[normal]working lives
[normal]. They tackled the 
[normal]different youth opportunities, mainly in sectors 
[normal]that were 
[normal]identified as being 
[normal]particularly un
[normal]attractive, such as the energy sector
[normal] in the 
[normal]Czech
[normal] 
[normal]Republic
[normal]. At least, that is what they presented in the papers. They also presented the u
[normal]nion side
[normal] on completing training schemes for students. The unions talked about the 
[normal]specific condition
[normal]s
[normal] of those sectors
[normal], the 
[normal]collective agreements
[normal] covering those sectors
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]health and safety issues
[normal], the
[normal] work/life balance in general
[normal], and the sectors that were strong for the students in particular.
[normal] The European social partners agreed on the importance of that
[normal], even though they do not think it is going to be 
[normal]a magic solution for the crisis 
[normal]that 
[normal]we are facing. 
[normal]That is why it was included as a good example in the framework for action.
[normal]Lord Freeman:[bold] Is that information readily available
[normal] to us?
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] I have it here.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]You are absolutely brilliant. 
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] I 
[normal]forgot to add the annexes, but I will send them to you if it is possible, because you will find all the examples of good practice in them.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]You are absolutely brilliant. Thank you so much. Lord Brooke, your question is the final one but I want to ask one afterwards.
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]You can ask yours now, if you want.
[normal]Q204 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] Right. 
[normal]I am going back to the money. 
[normal]Do you think that the ESF and the additional youth initiative 
[normal]money
[normal] 
[normal]will be used in the right way? A lot of money is involved and 
[normal]we do not want to throw money at things and find that that has been such a waste, because 
[normal]we
[normal] will never recover from 
[normal]the
[normal] opportunity that 
[normal]we
[normal] have now. 
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] 
[normal]First of all, when it comes to the money, you are talking about the 
[normal]Youth Guarantee
[normal] scheme, so I will focus on that
[normal]. The 
[normal]International Labour Organisation carried out deep research 
[normal]on the funding 
[normal]necessities at 
[normal]the European level of the effective implementation of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Youth Guarantee
[normal]. 
[normal]It f
[normal]ound that more than 
[normal]€20 billion
[normal] 
[normal]w
[normal]ould be needed. It is important to say that Eurof
[normal]o
[normal]und states in research, which it launched in 2011 on the NEETs situation, that the cost 
[normal]of NEETs at the national 
[normal]and European 
[normal]level 
[normal]is actually the cost of not acting. If 
[normal]you have people who 
[normal]ar
[normal]e neither 
[normal]working 
[normal]n
[normal]or 
[normal]attending any kind of 
[normal]training
[normal], that is the cost to the 
[normal]Government and the 
[normal]European Commission of not acting
[normal], which 
[normal]amounts to €160 billion a year, but I still think there is room for improvement in investment. The European Commission has allocated €6 billion for the 
[normal]youth employment initiative
[normal], which is a lot and we firmly consider that that
[normal] money should be 
[normal]spent in a very effective way.
[normal] 
[normal]From what we 
[normal]have heard from Ma
[normal]nuel
[normal] Huber
[normal]t
[normal] from the European Commission
[normal], the Commission is going t
[normal]o revisit that aspect when it assesses 
[normal]all 
[normal]the 
[normal]implementation plans 
[normal]and allocates the money to the member states to implement the 
[normal]Youth Guarantee
[normal]. But it is a question 
[normal]not only 
[normal]of the European Commission
[normal] auditing the money sent to the member states but of the importance of social partners designing, together with the Governments, the different schemes that are implemented at the national level
[normal].
[normal] That is also going to be a very effective way of ensuring that the money is well spent.
[normal]Q205 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] You raised the issue of zero-hours contracts
[normal] earlier in one of your replies
[normal]. 
[normal]You indicated that you were not happy about them. Certainly the t
[normal]rade union movement back in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] 
[normal]has been un
[normal]happy about them. 
[normal]We have also had evidence from some quarters that
[normal],
[normal] while people may not be enthusiastic about them, they are sometimes a 
[normal]means 
[normal]whereby people can find an 
[normal]entry into the labour market who would otherwise remain unemployed. 
[normal]We heard this morning from the Commissioner that they wanted a meeting with you to discuss their 
[normal]ideas 
[normal]about how they might produce a 
[normal]framework 
[normal]that 
[normal]could be suggested across 
[normal]Europe
[normal] and that should form a basis for embracing zero hours to some degree
[normal]. 
[normal]You 
[normal]prefer 
[normal]to have 
[normal]a wider discussion
[normal] on youth unemployment, rather than focus simply on that topic. Could we come back to it, and could you give us the strongest argument you can that we should in principle be totally opposed to it when some have been advocating them, albeit not with enthusiasm, given the right conditions surrounding 
[normal]them
[normal], as a means of getting people into employment? I got the impression that you were saying, “No, we just do not want to embrace them”—unless I am being unfair to you.
[normal]Ignacio Doreste:[bold] First
[normal] of all
[normal], a framework agreement was signed 
[normal]by the European employers’ organisation and the ETUC, which was later converted into 
[normal]a 
[normal]D
[normal]irective on temporary contracts. In that legal statement, we both agreed that indefinite contracts should be the rule rather than the exception. Both parties 
[normal]acknowledged 
[normal]that certain forms of temporary contract could be a stepping stone to
[normal]wards
[normal] entering the labour market. That is something on which there is an agreement between 
[normal]employers and
[normal] the ETUC
[normal]. 
[normal]Having said that
[normal], examples of zero
[normal]-
[normal]hour contracts are practices 
[normal]that are not the outcome of 
[normal]social dialogue
[normal]. It 
[normal]is our opinion that w
[normal]henever we investigate whether a practice might be good or bad
[normal] for helping workers to enter the labour market
[normal], the first thing 
[normal]we should look at is whether that 
[normal]practice 
[normal]was 
[normal]the outcome of social dialogue
[normal] and whether there was an agreement between the social partners at the national or European level. Fundamentally, in the two cases in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] that you mentioned, there was no agreement. A t
[normal]raineeship or internship
[normal], which is a scheme for when you leave the education system, is definitely not 
[normal]going to be the most qualified job experience of a young person’s life
[normal]. The 
[normal]trade unions are supporting 
[normal]the schemes, but in order to e
[normal]nsure that they are stepping stones 
[normal]and to ensure that 
[normal]people 
[normal]are not stuck 
[normal]in a vicious circle
[normal] it is important to define the floor conditions to ensure that it is not going to be possible for 
[normal]companies to make use of 
[normal]th
[normal]at kind of 
[normal]formula
[normal], with 
[normal]the same person 
[normal]in that position for a long 
[normal]period. 
[normal]It is a
[normal]lso important that 
[normal]these kinds of 
[normal]contracts are covered by the social security syste
[normal]m and many other standards.
[normal]The Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Let me 
[normal]say a very big 
[normal]thank you 
[normal]to both of you 
[normal]on behalf of us all. 
[normal]I am sure you will all agree that it has been v
[normal]ery informative
[normal]. It certainly makes me realise that 
[normal]we were absolutely right to come h
[normal]ere and seek your co-operation, which has been very graciously and generously given. W
[normal]e will send you a copy of the report
[normal] once we publish it. You will have the transcript to correct or whatever you want to do. Also, t
[normal]hank you in advance for 
[normal]your co-operation in sending us a lot of 
[normal]background data
[normal], which 
[normal]will help
[normal] us to give some measure of solidity to parts of the report 
[normal]that 
[normal]we might not have been able to do without them
[normal].
[normal] Thank you very much.
