defaultQ195 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much for coming. You know why we are here and why we have invited you to give evidence. The House of Lords report that we intend to make on youth unemployment will be published in April. We have had a range of witnesses, including youth, and today we have had two very good sessions, with the Director-General and then with the Commissioner, which helped us to put the jigsaw together more. You are very important here, because we have had questions about trade unions for most of our witnesses but 
defaultnow 
defaultwe will hear it from the horse’s mouth, as we say
default—t
defaulthat expression means, “The people who actually know”. We are looking forward to this session.
default 
defaultYou have met everyone, but I think it would be good idea if we said what our experience is, starting from the Member on your right.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default I am Clive Brooke—Lord Brooke. I have been in the House of Lords for 16 years, prior to which I was in the 
defaultl
defaultabour movement as General-Secretary of a union that was affiliated to the TUC, and I was a close friend of John Monks as well.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn: defaultI am David Wilson. I am 
defaultwhat we call a Cross-Bench Peer—an independent Peer
default. I have been in the House of Lords for 22-odd 
defaultyears
default. I have had a career mostly in public service, including that unfashionable thing, being
default 
defaulta colonial governor—quite an experience.
defaultThe Chairmandefault:default I am Detta O’Cathain. I am a Conservative Member of the House of Lords. I have been in the House of Lords for 22 years. I came to the House of Lords through the business route rather than the political route, but I am a Conservative Peer.
defaultLord Freeman:default 
defaultI am Lord Freeman. I was formerly House of Commons, and now I am in the House of Lords. I have been in the House of Lords now for quite a number of years. I am very 
defaultgrateful from my 
defaultstandpoint
default 
defaultthat 
defaultyou have come to see
default us, because some of these questions are really, really important. 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThank you. 
defaultI shall start.
default There is a general consensus that youth unemployment across 
defaultEurope
default is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis, and while things like banking seem to be getting a lot of push and business is beginning to pull up, w
defaulte are still worried about the effect 
defaultparticularly 
defaulton the young of 
defaultthe crisis in 
defaultfinding jobs.
default Could you summarise for us your own view of the exact nature of the current problems and the issues that you are most concerned about?
defaultCinzia Sechi:default 
defaultI will say just a few words. I t
defaulthank you for 
defaultthis 
defaultinvitation. 
defaultIt is an honour for us to be able to share our views on 
defaultyouth unemployment
default in 
defaultEurope
default, 
defaultbecause that has been 
defaultone of the biggest concerns of 
defaultthe 
defaultEuropean trade 
defaultunion 
defaultmovement over 
defaultthe 
defaultpast five years. 
defaultIt is a great opportunity to present you with some of the 
defaultachievements
default that we have made with employers’ organisations, because we really believe in the social dialogue at the European level and we will share with you the specific positions of the trade union movement in order to enrich
default your thinking on this issue.
defaultThe questions will be addressed 
defaultmainly 
defaultby 
defaultmy colleague 
defaultIgnacio Doreste. 
defaultI am Cinzia Sechi. 
defaultI deal mainly with 
defaultthe 
defaultEuropean 
defaultsocial 
defaultdialogue
default, general equality issues and precarious work, while 
defaultIgnacio is our adviser on youth policies. 
defaultWe will try to complement each other as much as possible, and hopefully will answer your questions in a meaningful manner.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultI should have said to you that the witnesses receive a transcript of this session to check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. 
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default 
defaultThe nature of 
defaultyouth unemployment is 
defaultactually 
defaultnot that different from what 
defaultis happening 
defaultin the banking 
defaultsystem and the financial 
defaultsector. 
defaultFirst, we would like to point out that the youth unemployment rate 
defaultwas 
defaultalready 
defaulthigh before the 
defaultoutbreak of the 
defaultcrisis. 
defaultIn 
defaultEurope
default, this is d
defaultue to 
defaultthe 
defaultlack of investment 
defaultin the productive sectors, which are sustainable both in terms of respecting the environment and in terms of 
defaultcreating quality jobs. 
defaultThat is our main point. 
defaultBefore the crisis—during the golden years, so to speak—
defaultmany 
defaultEU countries 
defaultwere investing a huge percentage of 
defaulttheir gross national product in 
defaultspeculative rather than productive sectors. 
defaultIn 
defaultSpain
default, for 
defaultexample, the situation is quite dramatic when it comes to unemployment in general but to youth unemployment in particular. 
defaultI 
defaultdo 
defaultnot 
defaultwant 
defaultto stick 
defaultonly 
defaultto my own experience, but 
defaultSpain
default is a good example
default to look at
default.
default In 
defaultSpain
default, a
default lot of 
defaultinvestment was 
defaultallocated to the construction sector. 
defaultIt was growing a lot because of the real estate bubble, so with the outbreak of the crisis there was a huge increase in youth unemployment and in unemployment in general. From that moment on
default, 
defaultthere has been 
defaultno macroeconomic policy to tackle 
defaultthe origin of the crisis
default. 
defaultEven though I have focused on my country, it is 
defaultapplicable to 
defaultthe 
defaultother 
default27 EU 
defaultcountries. 
defaultIt might be timely for us to share with you an investment plan, which was approved by the Executive Committee of the European Trade Union Confederation a 
defaultcouple of months ago
default, through which we are trying to apply pressure to national Governments but 
defaultespecially the European Commission in order to shift from the current situation
default,
default 
defaultin which we are 
defaultfocusing 
defaultmuch more 
defaulton 
defaultthe 
defaultlabour market 
defaultand the reduction of the public deficit, 
defaultto a new trend 
defaultin 
defaultwhich 
defaultwe are applying to invest in strategic sectors. We are actually allocating 2% of the European 
defaultdomestic product
default to this strategy. Maybe Cinzia can
default complete the presentation
default of this strategy
default.
defaultCinzia Sechi:default 
defaultYes. It is an investment plan and it is a political document belonging to the 
defaultETUC
default. However, on investments at the European level there are some shared views with employers. We recently addressed a letter
default to President Bar
defaultro
defaultso and 
defaultPresident V
defaultan Rompuy 
defaulton the need for Europe to direct more resources to our industries—this is very much a concern in the business sector and the strategic and public sectors, where it is a specific demand of the ETUC—to 
defaultboost research into different sectors that could be much more productive
default, 
defaultand
default to boost demand and the number of quality jobs in the near future
default. We have copies of the document with us 
defaultand we can provide 
defaultelectronic versions. It is the ETUC
default’s main 
defaultcampaign 
defaultand involves
default 85 
defaultconfederal 
defaultorganisations across 36 
defaultEuropean 
defaultcountries
default, including of course the TUC in the 
defaultUK
default. 
defaultWe also have members beyond Europe, in 
defaultTurkey
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThat would be most helpful. 
defaultThank you
default very much indeed.
defaultQ196 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Freeman:default To what extent is the crisis that affects most European Union members a function of the lack of industrial and commercial demand? We have just heard evidence about the l
defaultack of skills
default, 
defaultand 
defaultin some cases the 
defaultlack of 
defaultproper 
defaulteducation and experience
default for young people in the sense that they are not qualified or available in the practical sense for work. What 
defaultis
default the balance between the demand from 
defaultindustry and 
defaultthe supply of 
defaultquality and experience of young people?
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default 
defaultThat is q
defaultuite a 
defaulttimely 
defaultquestion
default, which I think completes the previous one
default. 
defaultWe have been talking about the lack of demand and the lack of investment in strategic sectors, but when it 
defaultcomes to 
defaultthe 
defaultlack of skills
default we would point out first that it is agreed worldwide that 
defaultcurrent
defaultly, especially at the European level, the 
defaultyoung 
defaultgeneration are 
defaultthe most trained 
defaultand well prepared 
defaultin 
defaultEuropean 
defaulthistory. 
defaultT
defaulthere has been a lot of focus on the 
defaultlack of skills
default among young people that are needed to meet the demands of the private sector, because this is something that we constantly 
defaultsee 
defaultwhen we 
defaultmeet 
defaultour partners and have conversations with them. Even though we 
defaultunderstand that there is room for improvement
default,
default especially in 
defaultthe 
defaultvocational system, we want
defaulted
default to point out that 
defaultin the crisis 
defaultwe 
defaultare facing 
defaulta lack of demand
default and investment in strategic sectors
default.
default As Cinzia said, this also affects domestic demand.
defaultAgain, o
defaultn skills, together with employers and 
defaultmany 
defaultother 
defaultimportant 
defaultstakeholders
default, we have 
defaultsigned up to 
defaultthe European Alliance for Apprenticeships, since we believe that apprenticeships are a compelling way of 
defaulttailoring 
defaultthe demands of certain sectors to prepare students when they leave the education sector. We have also 
defaultsigned a European charter of apprenticeships
default, together with employers. This is actually one of the 
defaultmost important milestones of the past 
defaulteight 
defaultyears
default when it comes to youth unemployment. We signed up to a framework for action on youth employment, which was divided into 
defaultfour chapters
default, one of which was training
default. 
defaultWe are aware that there is room for improvement, even though we considered that the main 
defaultproblem is 
defaultthe 
defaultlack of demand 
defaultand the 
defaultindustrial 
defaultand 
defaultmacroeconomic
default problem
default. 
defaultIt has been said that it is also important to remind ourselves that in 
defaultthe past companies 
defaultwere considered 
defaultsomehow 
defaultto have 
defaultan obligation to train their employees. 
defaultNow, what we hear from our partners is that they are demanding that young 
defaultpeople 
defaultleave the education system with 
defaultspecific skills 
defaultthat are required by these companies
default. 
defaultWe also think that the
defaultre should b
defaulte a balance of responsibilities when it comes to training their employees.
defaultCinzia Sechi:default 
defaultBriefly, I will 
defaultcomplete
default what Ignacio has just said in answer to Lord Freeman’s question. 
defaultWe have always 
defaulthad
default mismatches between 
defaultthe 
defaultsupply 
defaultside 
defaultand 
defaultthe 
defaultdemand side. What 
defaultis very 
defaultconcern
defaulting in 
defaultEurope
default is 
defaultthat 
defaultthe size of 
defaultthis 
defaultmismatch is increasing. The risk is that we will lose a 
defaultgood 
defaultproportion of 
defaultthe well educated young 
defaultif we do not 
defaultre
defaultact in a timely manner.
default The so-called NEET generation is probably one of the main concerns at the moment, because it is as Ignacio said: people have probably never been so well educated at the European level across countries, but we are not fully exploiting their potential. This might also explain why the 
defaultlong-term 
defaultyouth unemployment rate is
default increasing
default in a number of member states. That will also mean that
default more resources 
defaultwill have to be spent 
defaultin the future if we want to 
defaultattract and retain these people in the labour market. 
defaultWhat is not helping 
defaultat all 
defaultis the proliferation of typical contractual arrangements. In 
defaulta country like 
defaultSpain
default, the 
defaultflexibilisation of the 
defaultlabour market 
defaulthas not 
defaultshown 
defaultitself able 
defaultto 
defaultatt
defaultract or retain young people in a direct manner.
defaultLord Freeman:default 
defaultI have a brief supplementary question. 
defaultThere are 
defaultso 
defaultmany 
defaultthings 
defaultthat 
defaultyou can do 
defaultin 
defaultrelation to 
defaultindustrial and commercial demand. Should there be greater direction in 
defaultthe 
defaultbalance of skills
default that young people need to acquire?
default We live in a 
defaultdigital age, a 
defaultcomputer age
default, but s
defaultome jobs are
default more prosaic and 
defaultless glamorous and are not being filled
default or are being filled from outside the European Union. 
defaultDo you feel that 
defaultnot direction but 
defaulteducation of young people 
defaultat school is a 
defaultmore realistic
default thing to do in terms of employment
default?
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default 
defaultThat is included in the framework of action: that we 
defaultnegotiate with employers. 
defaultWe should 
defaultidentify 
defaultexactly 
defaultthe sectors
default where there is no demand and the reasons for the lack of attractiveness for young people, because if it is because of bad conditions, instead of encouraging young people to go into these sectors 
defaultwe have to improve the
defaultir
default 
defaultworking 
defaultconditions.
default That is our position. Any assessment and policy following that assessment should be done in a way that ensures that all citizens are included when launching the policy.
default 
defaultThis framework of action on youth unemployment is something that we are going to provide.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThank you very much. This is the European charter on apprentices.
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default It is kind of messy because there are so many different things that we are dealing with, but yes, we have that European charter on apprenticeships and the European Alliance for Apprenticeships. 
defaultQ197 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default 
defaultWe now m
defaultove on to 
defaulttalk about 
defaulthow trade unions can work with national Gove
defaultrnments to reduce unemployment and how you can work with the EU. There is not as much evidence of the social partnership in the 
defaultUK
default as you might find in some European countries. Perhaps you might care to comment generally on what the relationships are like in different countries and how that helps or does not help to solve youth unemployment.
defaultBack at home, I will be very frank
default, people would say that the
default unions 
defaultmay speak 
defaultabout youth unemployment but they do not 
defaultactually 
defaultrepresent the young
default unemployed
default. 
defaultThey represent increasingly a group of p
defaultublic sector workers and 
defaulta diminishing number of private sector employees, and in 
defaulta sense 
defaultthe 
defaultunemployed are excluded 
defaultfrom them and cannot get into these jobs, particularly 
defaultas 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic sector is declining. 
defaultYet the unions wish to speak on behalf of the unemployed. I wonder if you would care to 
defaultcomment on that
default,
default because 
defaultthose 
defaultcriticism
defaults are 
defaultlevelled in the 
defaultUK
default. 
defaultI would like you to give us a European view generally of how you see the 
defaultnature of the relationship 
defaultbetween the EU and 
defaultthe unions
default and how they would solve the problem
default. 
defaultI would like an insight into what may be happening elsewhere, and then, if you like, you are free to comment on the specific 
defaultUK
default issues.
default 
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default 
defaultThat is quite interesting. 
defaultIn order to prepare for 
defaultsome of the 
defaultquestions
default,
default we 
defaultcontacted our 
defaultcolleagues in 
defaultthe 
defaultTUC. 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default 
defaultWe have taken some evidence from them about these issues. They were very good.
defaultThe Chairmandefault:default And it was excellent evidence.
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default How can 
defaulttrade unions at the national level interact with 
defaultGovernments to tackle unemployment? This is not only about the trade unions themselves. Of course we can do a lot at 
defaultcompany and sector
defaultal levels, and when it comes to negotiating with Governments not only the unions but employers are engaged through social dialogue. That is our point. As I just said, we talk with our colleagues from the TUC, and with them we acknowledge the unfortunate lack of 
defaultsocial dialogue in the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultWhen it comes to the criticisms of the 
defaultlack of unions
default’ 
defaultrepresentativeness 
defaultof cash workers, 
defaultyoung workers
default, unemployed people, first of all we would like to point out that a lot has been done over the past year within the trade union movement. Right now we have, I think, youth 
defaultcommittees in almost 
defaultevery trade union organisation
default 
defaultaffiliated to the ETUC. We have 85 trade union organisations 
defaultfrom 
default3
default6 
defaultEuropean 
defaultcountries, 
defaulteven though 
defaultthere is room for improvement
default—that is for sure
default. 
defaultWe also have a youth committee at the European level. 
defaultI had the opportunity to attend an a
defaultssembly of young workers at 
defaultthe TUC headquarters in 
defaultLondon
default a couple of months ago. They t
defaultackle the situation from a different perspective
default, and there are many different things that they are studying
default—we are studying them 
defaultalso at the European level
default—
defaultin order to improve the affiliation rates of young workers.
default 
defaultIreland
default is a good example
default, where they are increasing the 
defaultaffiliation rates
default of young people. We are studying many different ways, and considering not only campaigning but how to organise
default 
defaultthe 
defaultdifferent branches of 
defaultthe 
defaultunions
default to better represent precarious workers. There are different systems. 
defaultItaly
default, for example, has a 
defaultconfederation 
defaultthat represents all the 
defaultworkers
default, a federation for the
default regions and a
default federation for the sectoral
default, so they have 
defaulta federation only for precarious workers. So there are d
defaultifferent ways to proceed in o
defaultrder to improve representativeness of these types of workers, and we are constantly examining the different possibilities and interchanging good practices to organise young people better.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultCan I interject there? 
defaultWhich EU member states do not have youth committees? 
defaultPerhaps you 
defaultneed notice
default of that question, and if you could answer it that would be useful.
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default 
defaultFor sure, t
defaulthe 28 member states have youth
default committees
default. 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultAll of them?
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default 
defaultYes.
defaultThe Chairman:default Then that is okay.
defaultCinzia Sechi:default 
defaultThere might be a difference within the same country. In a country like mine—I am Italian, as you can tell from my accent—there are 
defaultthree confederations
default. One 
defaulthas a youth structure
default in place. Others deal with youth issues, not through a specific structure of young trade unionists but through different bodies.
defaultThe Chairman:default So it is not the trade unions that actually have the other two.
defaultCinzia Sechi:default 
defaultIt really depends on the structures of the confederation. But as Ignacio said, since we have members in all 28 EU member states, you will find at least one confederation with a you
defaultth 
defaultstructure in place.
defaultThe Chairman:default I see. I am sorry to interrupt you, Lord Brooke. Carry on if there is anything else that you want to ask. 
defaultQ198 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default We as a Committee have found it difficult to 
defaultarrange 
defaultmeetings with unemployed people. 
defaultWe have managed to arrange some, but I suspect that there are s
defaultome groups 
defaultthat 
defaultare hard to reach. You 
defaultprobably h
defaultave the
default same problems. With the unions you can have youth groups and youth conferences, but I think they are probably mainly 
defaultconferences of people who are in employment rather than out of employment. 
defaultDo you have any special means of making connections so that you can speak representatively on their behalf 
defaultand fend off the criticism that you are defending the inte
defaultrests of people who are already in work and that you are not really able to speak on behalf of those who are not in work?
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default 
defaultI take your point. Indeed, w
defaulte represent employed people
default, but when negotiating better employment benefits with the Government we are
default defending 
defaultthe 
defaultrights 
defaultand interests 
defaultof unemployed people. 
defaultIt really is a question many times of image and 
defaultadvertising
default our own actions, but we have to acknowledge that trade unions all over Europe are suffering attacks from certain sectors of the media, which are really not helping us 
defaultin 
defaultintegrating into society. We 
defaultare tackling h
defaultuge problems in many countries. Also, when it comes to o
defaultrganising, we have 
defaultvery 
defaultgood examples of creating platforms
default with civil society 
defaultorganisations. That 
defaultis also a very wise way of exchanging views with
default other stakeholders in
default society such as NGOs, and even 
defaultnon-
defaulto
defaultrganised groups
default, such as those in my country with all these movements 
defaultthat 
defaultwere created after what happened in Puerta del Sol in May 2011. That is another good example. Actually we are thinking about having a European 
defaultpathway to deal with civil society organisations
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultJust for clarification, would those civil society organisations be 
defaultNGOs
default?
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default NGOs, yes. They are talking about creating a new pathway.
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default 
defaultActually, it is not a pathway, but it is common ground: a document, a joint strategy—something in that class. 
defaultQ199 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default You mentioned 
defaultearlier 
defaultthat you have done some work on apprenticeships
default and on training. Can I just follow up on that, please? 
defaultA
defaults we have gone around talking to people, we have found it a bit difficult to define precisely what different people in different countries mean by 
defaultapprenticeships
default. That is question one. The other 
defaultquestion 
defaultis on training. Do you think that the quality, content and type of training across 
defaultEurope
default are what is needed? If not, are there things that should be done about that at a European Union level?
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default First
default of all
default, 
defaultit is not only people in general who are finding problems in defining an apprenticeship and an internship but the 
defaultEuropean Commission 
defaultitself, because although it launched the proposal for a quality framework for apprenticeships, in that document, which is currently under discussion, it tackles
default 
defaultwhat it referred to before as 
defaultopen market internships. For many years when 
defaultwe were 
defaultnegotiating with employers 
defaultand talking to the European Commission, 
defaultwe referred to apprenticeships as 
defaulttraining schemes 
defaultwithin 
defaultthe framework of the 
defaulteducation system
default and to internships as any kind of scheme that is after the education system, more or less. Before negotiating the framework for action on youth unemployment, we
default set up a
default joint definition of the different schemes with employers to avoid misunderstandings. 
defaultAt 
defaultthe European level, it is true that there are 
defaultwide differences 
defaulti
defaultn 
defaultthe 
defaultquantity
default and the quality of apprenticeship schemes
default. In 
defaultcountries like 
defaultGermany
default, 
defaultAustria
default and 
defaultDenmark
default, where they have a very 
defaultwell
default 
defaultdeveloped 
defaulttraining system, the quality and quantity of apprenticeships provided, especially within the 
defaultvocational training 
defaultsystem, are pretty well 
defaultrecognised
default by society as a whole. They are quite proud. T
defaultrade unions and employers’ organisations 
defaultare also in many cases members of the bodies identifying the companies where students 
defaultcan 
defaulthave apprenticeships. They also 
defaultassess 
defaultthe 
defaultquality of 
defaultthe 
defaultschemes. It is not only 
defaulta 
defaultqu
defaultestion in many cases of the industrial fabric—what we can find in 
defaultGermany
default is completely different from what we can find
default in
default, for example, 
defaultCyprus
default—but it is also a question of how these bodies are conformed. 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Just to clarify
default, what would the definition of an apprenticeship be now in, let us say, 
defaultSpain
default or 
defaultItaly
default? What would “apprenticeship” mean?
defaultCinzia Sechi:default 
defaultWe at the ETUC 
defaulthave just finished 
defaulta project at the European level. W
defaulte 
defaultlooked at the 
defaultquality framework
default for apprenticeships, and it showed that the definition was a common concern. If you want to find a shared definition at the European level, 
defaultI advise you to look 
defaultat what Cedefop
default 
defaulthas provided as a definition of apprenticeships. 
defaultCedefop
default is a tripartite agency of government, trade unions and employers, and we have 
defaultexpressed our agreement 
defaulton that specific definition. You 
defaultwill find details 
defaultsuch as the fact that 
defaultapprenticeships 
defaultshould be provided at workplace level, that some education should also be given by public institutions
default and 
defaultthat a 
defaultcontract should be att
defaultached to apprenticeship schemes
default. There is also 
defaulta reference to payment, which is not the case for apprenticeship schemes in some member states
default. 
defaultCedefop
default could be a good starting point. However, as Ignacio said, there is 
defaultproliferation 
defaultand 
defaulta lot of political attention
default on apprenticeship schemes at the European level, so in different documents
default 
defaultand publications 
defaultunfortunately the 
defaultdefinition used is 
defaultnot
default 
defaultCedefop
default’s
default.
default 
defaultThere should be a political commitment on the part of member states and social partners to work together towards a shared definition not only at 
defaultCedefop
default level but at a higher level. 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default I am sorry to interrupt, but what was the name?
defaultCinzia Sechi:default defaultCedefop
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThat sounds very useful. 
defaultHow many other 
defaultmember 
defaultstates
default would have that and have bought into that, as they say—they have adopted this?
defaultCinzia Sechi:default 
defaultIt has not been formally adopted, but 
defaultit 
defaultis 
defaultcommon
default ground, and it is 
defaultone of the oldest agencies in 
defaultEurope
default. It is based, unfortunately, 
defaultfar away
default in 
defaultThessaloniki
default in 
defaultGreece
default. 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultAnd “encourages” employment, which they need. 
defaultCinzia Sechi:default Yes, indeed. Apprenticeship schemes vary too much at the European level, so, again, our political demand is that we should find a common meaning.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThis 
defaultis what we 
defaultreally 
defaultbelieve. 
defaultI am just interested to know how wide the acceptance has been of the 28 member states. 
defaultHow ma
defaultny people know of its existence and how many of them have agreed that it is a good thing?
defaultCinzia Sechi:default I will turn your question around. 
defaultFirst of all, the 
defaultdefinition of apprenticeships is not codified in 
defaultall 
defaultmember states.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultYes, we know that.
defaultCinzia Sechi:default 
defaultSometimes it is in law, sometimes it is in regulations or 
defaultcollective agreements.
default It would be interesting to see how many definitions match the 
defaultCedefop
default definition, which matches what they have 
defaultin 
defaultDenmark
default and 
defaultGermany
default but not 
defaultwhat they have in a number of 
defaulteastern European countries
default, for example, where the schemes have not been developed very much. The other main issues with apprenticeship schemes are the
defaultir
default quality and 
defaulttheir 
defaultincreased 
defaultattractiveness
default to young people.
default We hear a lot 
defaultfrom our members that there is a lack of places for apprentices in a number of member states, including member states with a very strong dual system, such as 
defaultGermany
default and 
defaultDenmark
default. That, again, could have an impact on the schemes in the long term but especially in the short term. 
defaultQ200 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default I 
defaultreally 
defaultdo not want to hog the conversation
default, but I am very interested in what you have said
default. 
defaultYou have said that the d
defaultefinition of apprenticeships 
defaultprobably differed 
defaultfrom 
defaultthe 
defaultdefinition 
defaultof apprenticeships 
defaultthat other member states 
defaulthave
default. Is there 
defaultsuch a thing as 
defaulta document that shows 
defaultthe definition of the word “
defaultapprenticeship
default” in each of the 28 member states? We cannot get our heads around that.
defaultCinzia Sechi:default 
defaultCould you 
defaultrepeat the question
default, please?
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultWe would like a definition of an apprenticeship. Is there a definition of what an apprenticeship is in each of the 28 member states?
defaultCinzia Sechi:default We surveyed 10 member states and we 
defaultfound that almost all of them had 
defaulta definition. 
defaultI was not directly involved, but we found a definition in most of them. This definition is made either under the labour code or 
defaultby 
defaultcollective agreements. The nature of the instrument codifying the definition differs from member state to member state.
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default 
defaultWe worked on this in the final conference that we had in November, so we will provide you with the final document, which is quite handy when it comes to apprenticeships.
defaultI 
defaultwould like 
defaultto 
defaultcomplete this 
defaultquestion 
defaulton apprenticeships, because we may have focused too much 
defaulton good practice in 
defaultGermany
default and 
defaultDenmark
default. There are also very good examples in 
defaultItaly
default, for example, where e
defaultmployers 
defaultsigned 
defaultan agreement
default 
defaultwith three trade union confederations, I think three years ago. 
defaultI can 
defaultalso 
defaultprovide 
defaultyou with a brief explanation of this scheme, because it was presented as evidence of good practice for the negotiation on the framework for action 
defaultat the European level. 
defaultThey defined in a very 
defaultclear way three different apprenticeship schemes. 
defaultThe n
defaultational framework 
defaultwas 
defaultcompleted six m
defaultonths ago, with another agreement reached between employers and the 
defaultunions on a basic salary 
defaultof 
default€400 
defaultfor every apprenticeship, which can be improved at regional level. The €400 is the 
defaultminimum floor
default for the company. In some regions, it even reaches €600 or something like that. We w
defaultill provide 
defaultyou with 
defaultmore information
default on that
default. 
defaultIn 
defaultorder to tackle 
defaultthe 
defaultwide variety of 
defaultapprenticeship 
defaultschemes 
defaultand internships all over 
defaultEurope
default, the European Commission 
defaultlaunched 
defaultthe 
defaultquality framework for apprenticeships. 
defaultIt was presented last December, on the 5th I believe. 
defaultWe 
defaultcan also provide you with the statement that we launched the day after. We 
defaultagree with 
defaultthe European Commission’s evaluation 
defaulton 
defaultthe 
defaultquality and quantity of apprenticeships 
defaultall over 
defaultEurope
default, 
defaultbut we were 
defaultreally 
defaultdisappointed
default with the measure that it was recommending, because it is 
defaulta 
defaultrecommendation to the Council. 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default What was their recommendation?
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default 
defaultActually their recommendation is as basic as saying that a
defaultny training 
defaultapprenticeship will do. The 
defaultonly thing 
defaultthey are asking for 
defaultis for e
defaultmployers to provide a contract, so they are definitely not tackling the quality. R
defaultegardless of 
defaultthe 
defaultconditions of 
defaultthe 
defaultapprenticeship
default,
default 
defaultthey should be registered in a written contract where 
defaultall 
defaultthese 
defaultconditions should be kno
defaultwn by trainee
defaults
default before they start the apprenticeship.
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultLord Brooke, did you want to ask question 5?
defaultLord defaultBrooke of Alverthorpe:default I think it has been covered.
defaultQ201 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default You touched on the question of best practice, which has interested us quite a lot. How could, and how should, the Commission publicise best practice? One example that has come to us is the various bids for the employment initiative. We are told that every country, except one, which we happen to represent, has put in their bids, but these are not public documents yet, so the question is: do you think that the Commission could do more to publicise best practice? Would you support that, or is it being done enough already?
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default First
default of all
default, the E
defaulturopean 
defaultT
defaultrade 
defaultU
defaultnion 
defaultC
defaultonfederation
default 
defaultfirmly 
defaultbelieves that 
defaultthe 
defaultEuropean Commission should go 
defaultfar 
defaultbeyond 
defaultexchanging practices in member states when it comes to promoting policies. We firmly believe that a c
defaultommon 
defaultbackground that is obligatory for 
default28 member states is necessary. 
defaultWe are n
defaultot talking about direct implementation. 
defaultThe best way to tailor a European initiative is through s
defaultocial dialogue.
default 
defaultWe have identified 
defaultmany interesting 
defaultinstances of good practice
default, which were used, for example, in the negotiations on the framework for action and in the negotiations with the European Commission on the implementation plans of the 
defaultYouth Guarantee
default. 
defaultMany member states are supposed to have 
defaultalready 
defaultsent
default their implementation plan to the European Commission. All that documentation is private so far. The European Commission is not discussing those plans even with the member states, as far as 
defaultwe 
defaultknow, or with the European social partners. 
defaultWe can provide 
defaultyou with 
defaultsome 
defaultexamples of good practice, which 
defaultwere used 
defaultas common ground 
defaultto negotiate the four 
defaultdifferent 
defaultchapters
default of the framework for action on youth employment
default. 
defaultWe 
defaultcan give 
defaultyou s
defaultome good examples 
defaultof current good practice on the 
defaultYouth Guarantee
default, for example, 
defaultin 
defaultFinland
default and in 
defaultDenmark
default, 
defaultAustria
default and 
defaultSweden
default. 
defaultThat is a great example because it has been t
defaultransposed to other European countries. 
defaultThe same applies to the dual training system, which was i
defaultnitially created in 
defaultAustria
default and in 
defaultGermany
default. We also gave you the example of the 
defaultItalian agreement for apprenticeships. 
defaultWe have an 
defaultannex
defaulte
default 
defaultwith something like 20 good practices listed in it, which were presented in the negotiations on the framework for action. I always say that 
defaultfive 
defaultexamples should be selected for evidence sessions, but if it is possible I can send you the whole document. 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Let me get this right. 
defaultWhen I ask whether the Commission should be doing more, you are doing it. 
defaultWhere are you getting 
defaultall 
defaultthe information
default from
default?
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultAnd 
defaultwho is paying you
default to do it?
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default 
defaultActually we obtain all this information from our affiliates. During the negotiations on the framework for action on youth employment, the 
defaultEuropean Commission 
defaultfunctioned as a vehicle. It was the 
defaultemployers and 
defaultthe 
defaultunions 
defaultthemselves that wanted to 
defaultnegotiate 
defaultthe different courses of action, which are included in the agreement.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Should there be more collection of
default data by member states? Should member states be doing this? Are you really doing this job, and is everyone else aware that you are doing it? Does it get out?
defaultCinzia Sechi:default This is 
defaultvery much 
defaultpart of the European social dialogue. 
defaultIn order to reach that agreement with employers, we first collected evidence that social partners at the national level and at the 
defaultsectoral level
default were active in addressing youth concerns
default. We collected 
defaultthat 
defaultevidence 
defaultfirst, 
defaultand 
defaultthen 
defaultnegotiated 
defaulta framework for action consisting of five priorities which we committed ourselves to looking 
defaultat
default in the next three years and to continuing to monitor
default our members 
defaultand see 
defaultwhat they are doing
default, either together or unilaterally,
default to address youth unemployment. 
defaultSo to answer your question, we will indeed continue to look at good practice, and at
default the end of the process we will make an assessment.
default Hopefully we will also be confronted with a better situation.
defaultThe Commission and the institutions are looking 
defaultat good practice on youth unemployment 
defaultfrom a different angle. 
defaultOf course, they are very much involving Governments, whereas o
defaultur focus is 
defaultmore 
defaulton social partners. Yes, we should continue to look at good practice
default, but we should make sure that this is not only a top-down approach. I agree very much with what you said: member states themselves should start not only putting these good practices into practice but sharing them at the local and the national level. Otherwise this European feeling will be lost. In a top-down approach, the impact of what we were doing would be limited.
defaultQ202 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThat is very interesting. 
defaultWe have asked
default about your view as to how the EU initiatives are being used in different states. How do you see the 
defaultUK
default’s response 
defaultin comparison to others? You talked about the youth employment programme, the 
defaultYouth Guarantee
default and the youth employment initiative.
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default 
defaultT
defaulto answer this question we 
defaultcontacted 
defaultthe TUC
default and asked for ideas
default. The TUC is not happy 
defaultat all 
defaultwith the fact that 
defaultUK
default has decided that 
defaultthe 
defaultYouth Guarantee 
defaultwill not be implemented in the 
defaultU
defaultnited 
defaultK
defaultingdom
default as the 
defaultYouth Contract 
defaultinitiative already covers 
defaultthe same
default objectives
default. The TUC produced a
default very 
defaultinteresting statement on 
defaultits 
defaultposition
default on the 
defaultYouth 
defaultContract
default. During the negotiations on the framework for action
default,
default the 
defaultYouth Contract 
defaultwas presented by 
defaultrepresentatives 
defaultof the 
defaultUK
default employers’ organisations
default as a good practice. The 
defaultTUC had a sound argument against 
defaultthat 
defaultproposal
default, because all the 
defaultdifferent good practices
default included in the framework for action on youth employment at the European level did not 
defaultnecessarily 
defaulthave to be 
defaultagreed
default between the social partners at the national level
default. The TUC disagreed
default with implementing the 
defaultYouth Contract as
default a good example. Correct me if I am wrong but I think the 
defaultYouth Contract
default was launched two years ago, so the TUC has already been able to 
defaultassess
default its 
defaultoutcomes
default. It has not generated youth employment at all. 
defaultThere is n
defaulto way 
defaultof 
defaultassess
defaulting the 
defaultextent 
defaultto which 
defaultcompanies
default are using the 
defaultYouth Contract
default to replace other 
defaultformal jobs
default. Even though it is stated in the political proposal at company level, since it is very difficult to guarantee that formal jobs are not going to be replaced 
defaultby 
defaultthe 
defaultYouth Contract
default, there is n
defaulto statistical evidence 
defaultof how 
defaultnet employment 
defaultis going to be 
defaultcreated solely by investing money in the private sector 
defaultin order to subsidise jobs rather than by investing 
defaultin economic activity itself. 
defaultThe TUC was also quite critical about the fact that the 
defaultYouth Contract
default also makes it possible for companies to 
defaulthave 
defaultyoung people 
defaultin 
defaultunpaid
default positions
default.
default It also related the fact that the 
defaultscheme 
defaultmeant that 
defaultthe Future Job
defaults
default Fund 
defaultwas 
defaultset aside when 
defaultthe Youth Contract
default was 
defaultlaunched by the Government.
defaultQ203 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Freeman:default You have been extremely helpful
default. Over the last two days we
default have heard a great deal 
defaultand had some helpful advice 
defaultabout the supply side coming from the European Commission
default and from companies
default. 
defaultI would like to ask you about t
defaultrying to understand 
defaultbetter 
defaultthe demand side 
defaultfrom 
defaultyoung people. 
defaultIn your judgment, are there a
defaultny initiatives 
defaultthat could be taken by member states to understand attitudes to work and 
defaulthow much knowledge 
defaultthere is 
defaultabout employment opportunities
default or lack of them? Can you think of any initiatives that would help both to educate and to understand the p
defaultre
defaultdicament that many young people find themselves in?
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default We identified 
defaultthe 
defaultgood practice in the 
defaultCzech Republic
default of both employers and trade unions visiting 
defaultschools 
defaultat a very basic level in order to share with the students the different prospects that they might expect in their 
defaultworking lives
default. They tackled the 
defaultdifferent youth opportunities, mainly in sectors 
defaultthat were 
defaultidentified as being 
defaultparticularly un
defaultattractive, such as the energy sector
default in the 
defaultCzech
default 
defaultRepublic
default. At least, that is what they presented in the papers. They also presented the u
defaultnion side
default on completing training schemes for students. The unions talked about the 
defaultspecific condition
defaults
default of those sectors
default, the 
defaultcollective agreements
default covering those sectors
default,
default 
defaulthealth and safety issues
default, the
default work/life balance in general
default, and the sectors that were strong for the students in particular.
default The European social partners agreed on the importance of that
default, even though they do not think it is going to be 
defaulta magic solution for the crisis 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are facing. 
defaultThat is why it was included as a good example in the framework for action.
defaultLord Freeman:default Is that information readily available
default to us?
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default I have it here.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultYou are absolutely brilliant. 
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default I 
defaultforgot to add the annexes, but I will send them to you if it is possible, because you will find all the examples of good practice in them.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultYou are absolutely brilliant. Thank you so much. Lord Brooke, your question is the final one but I want to ask one afterwards.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpedefault:default 
defaultYou can ask yours now, if you want.
defaultQ204 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Right. 
defaultI am going back to the money. 
defaultDo you think that the ESF and the additional youth initiative 
defaultmoney
default 
defaultwill be used in the right way? A lot of money is involved and 
defaultwe do not want to throw money at things and find that that has been such a waste, because 
defaultwe
default will never recover from 
defaultthe
default opportunity that 
defaultwe
default have now. 
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default 
defaultFirst of all, when it comes to the money, you are talking about the 
defaultYouth Guarantee
default scheme, so I will focus on that
default. The 
defaultInternational Labour Organisation carried out deep research 
defaulton the funding 
defaultnecessities at 
defaultthe European level of the effective implementation of 
defaultthe 
defaultYouth Guarantee
default. 
defaultIt f
defaultound that more than 
default€20 billion
default 
defaultw
defaultould be needed. It is important to say that Eurof
defaulto
defaultund states in research, which it launched in 2011 on the NEETs situation, that the cost 
defaultof NEETs at the national 
defaultand European 
defaultlevel 
defaultis actually the cost of not acting. If 
defaultyou have people who 
defaultar
defaulte neither 
defaultworking 
defaultn
defaultor 
defaultattending any kind of 
defaulttraining
default, that is the cost to the 
defaultGovernment and the 
defaultEuropean Commission of not acting
default, which 
defaultamounts to €160 billion a year, but I still think there is room for improvement in investment. The European Commission has allocated €6 billion for the 
defaultyouth employment initiative
default, which is a lot and we firmly consider that that
default money should be 
defaultspent in a very effective way.
default 
defaultFrom what we 
defaulthave heard from Ma
defaultnuel
default Huber
defaultt
default from the European Commission
default, the Commission is going t
defaulto revisit that aspect when it assesses 
defaultall 
defaultthe 
defaultimplementation plans 
defaultand allocates the money to the member states to implement the 
defaultYouth Guarantee
default. But it is a question 
defaultnot only 
defaultof the European Commission
default auditing the money sent to the member states but of the importance of social partners designing, together with the Governments, the different schemes that are implemented at the national level
default.
default That is also going to be a very effective way of ensuring that the money is well spent.
defaultQ205 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default You raised the issue of zero-hours contracts
default earlier in one of your replies
default. 
defaultYou indicated that you were not happy about them. Certainly the t
defaultrade union movement back in the 
defaultUK
default 
defaulthas been un
defaulthappy about them. 
defaultWe have also had evidence from some quarters that
default,
default while people may not be enthusiastic about them, they are sometimes a 
defaultmeans 
defaultwhereby people can find an 
defaultentry into the labour market who would otherwise remain unemployed. 
defaultWe heard this morning from the Commissioner that they wanted a meeting with you to discuss their 
defaultideas 
defaultabout how they might produce a 
defaultframework 
defaultthat 
defaultcould be suggested across 
defaultEurope
default and that should form a basis for embracing zero hours to some degree
default. 
defaultYou 
defaultprefer 
defaultto have 
defaulta wider discussion
default on youth unemployment, rather than focus simply on that topic. Could we come back to it, and could you give us the strongest argument you can that we should in principle be totally opposed to it when some have been advocating them, albeit not with enthusiasm, given the right conditions surrounding 
defaultthem
default, as a means of getting people into employment? I got the impression that you were saying, “No, we just do not want to embrace them”—unless I am being unfair to you.
defaultIgnacio Doreste:default First
default of all
default, a framework agreement was signed 
defaultby the European employers’ organisation and the ETUC, which was later converted into 
defaulta 
defaultD
defaultirective on temporary contracts. In that legal statement, we both agreed that indefinite contracts should be the rule rather than the exception. Both parties 
defaultacknowledged 
defaultthat certain forms of temporary contract could be a stepping stone to
defaultwards
default entering the labour market. That is something on which there is an agreement between 
defaultemployers and
default the ETUC
default. 
defaultHaving said that
default, examples of zero
default-
defaulthour contracts are practices 
defaultthat are not the outcome of 
defaultsocial dialogue
default. It 
defaultis our opinion that w
defaulthenever we investigate whether a practice might be good or bad
default for helping workers to enter the labour market
default, the first thing 
defaultwe should look at is whether that 
defaultpractice 
defaultwas 
defaultthe outcome of social dialogue
default and whether there was an agreement between the social partners at the national or European level. Fundamentally, in the two cases in the 
defaultUK
default that you mentioned, there was no agreement. A t
defaultraineeship or internship
default, which is a scheme for when you leave the education system, is definitely not 
defaultgoing to be the most qualified job experience of a young person’s life
default. The 
defaulttrade unions are supporting 
defaultthe schemes, but in order to e
defaultnsure that they are stepping stones 
defaultand to ensure that 
defaultpeople 
defaultare not stuck 
defaultin a vicious circle
default it is important to define the floor conditions to ensure that it is not going to be possible for 
defaultcompanies to make use of 
defaultth
defaultat kind of 
defaultformula
default, with 
defaultthe same person 
defaultin that position for a long 
defaultperiod. 
defaultIt is a
defaultlso important that 
defaultthese kinds of 
defaultcontracts are covered by the social security syste
defaultm and many other standards.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultLet me 
defaultsay a very big 
defaultthank you 
defaultto both of you 
defaulton behalf of us all. 
defaultI am sure you will all agree that it has been v
defaultery informative
default. It certainly makes me realise that 
defaultwe were absolutely right to come h
defaultere and seek your co-operation, which has been very graciously and generously given. W
defaulte will send you a copy of the report
default once we publish it. You will have the transcript to correct or whatever you want to do. Also, t
defaulthank you in advance for 
defaultyour co-operation in sending us a lot of 
defaultbackground data
default, which 
defaultwill help
default us to give some measure of solidity to parts of the report 
defaultthat 
defaultwe might not have been able to do without them
default.
default Thank you very much.
