"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by TCPA (HOT37)&#xa0;\n1.               About the TCPA               The Town and \nCountry Planning Association (TCPA) is an independent charity working to improve the art and science of town and country planning. The TCPA puts social justice and the environment at the heart of policy debate and inspires government, industry and campaign\ners to take a fresh perspective on major issues, including planning policy, housing, regeneration and climate change. Our objectives are to:\n&#xa0;\n2.               TCPA responseThe TCPA \nhas chosen to respond solely to\n the question \n‘Why is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK?’ \nThrough leading two Intelligent Energy Europe\n (IEE)\n projects \nthe Association has\n become aware of the vast differences between the UK and other European countries in terms of \nthe use of community and district heating as well as CHP. \n&#xa0;\n2.1 The positive role of planning in delivering community heatingPlanning can play a key role in deli\nvering community \nheating\n. Through the work of \nthe \nTCPA and Friends of the Earth led \nPlanning and Climate Change Coalition\n we have explored the ways in which planning policies can support \ncommunity heating and CHP\n. Our \nPlanning for climate change - guidance for local authorities\n \nwhich was published following the National Planning Policy Framework in April 20\n12, sets out\n \nbest practice policies for plan making and development management, as well as highlighting the importance of evidence gathering. \n&#xa0;\n2.2 Lessons from our European projectsThe TCPA \ncurrently \nleads two Intelligent Energy Europe \np\nrojects which bot\nh champion the positive role of planning in the delivery of community \nheating and CHP\n. \nLeadership for Energy Action and Planning\n (LEAP) has been established to facilitate a network of pan-European municipalities to plan and deliver local sustainable energy solutions in line with the Covenant of Mayors. A partnership of ten organisations from seven European Union (EU) countries have\n come together to improve their capacity as key actors in speeding up the local uptake of sustainable energy measures and the move towards a low-carbon local economy. \n&#xa0;\nThe project highlights case studies of how local authorities can work in partnership to\n help community groups deliver community \nheating\n schemes. The project also focusses on the key role of the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) in delivering these objectives.\n&#xa0;\nA recently published \nCase \nStudies Paper\n from the LEAP p\nroject \nsets out four key recommendations to ensuring greater deployment of decentralized energy, including district heating/ CHP, as follows:\n&#xa0;\nThe TCPA’s second Intelligent Energy Europe\n funded\n project is \nSpatial Planning and Energy for Communities In All Landscapes\n (SPECIAL). The three year project started in March 2013 and focus\nes\n on training planners to link spatial planning and energy. Spatial planning and urb\nan planners have a pivotal role in developing energy strategies and action plans, and the SPECIAL project has been set up to help bridge the gap between climate change/energy action planning and spatial and urban planning. The project will address the barr\niers \nto \nhaving a positive and holistic regulatory framework in place, and the importance of creating energy opportunity maps, based on sound evidence bases, which can direct community groups to the most appropriate locations for community \nheating\n projects.\n&#xa0;\nAs part of \nthe TCPA’s\n \ntraining for the SPECIAL project \nthe Association and project partners have \nvisited developments in Sweden where district heating is the most common source of heating for apartments and commercial buildings, whilst it is also used fo\nr detached homes to a lesser extent. During a training week in the UK \nthe project partnership\n \nvisited the CHP scheme in central Milton Keynes operated by Thameswey Central Milton Keynes Ltd\n. This exemplified some of the challenges and opportunities of esta\nblishing a district scale CHP scheme in the UK.\n Set up in 2005, \nthe Milton Keynes scheme \nrequired a partnership with English Partnerships (\nnow the \nHCA) and \nbenefited from the\n agency\n being both the planning authority and landowner\n. It took place \nahead of ma\ninstream planning policy for district heating in Milton Keynes. However, the Council now has a Core Strategy Policy on \n‘\nCommunity Energy Networks and Large Scale Renewable Energy Schemes\n’\n, where it \npromote\ns\n the use of renewable energy schemes \nthat can \ndemonstrate\n that there will not be any negative social, economic, or environmental\n \nresults from the scheme.\n \nThe Council also has the following requirements:\n1. For developments of more than 100 homes, applications should show that the\n \npotential for communi\nty energy networks has been explored\n2. For development of more than 200 homes, applications will require community\n \nenergy networks, unless it can be proven that this is not feasible on technical or\n \neconomic grounds\n3. Regardless of the number of homes in \na proposal, where an existing local energy\n \nnetwork is established, developments will be expected to connect to the\n \nnetwork, if feasible\n&#xa0;\nThe TCPA believe\ns \nspatial planning has a key role to play in identifying suitable locations for the installation of dis\ntrict heating and CHP. Through energy opportunity mapping and heat mapping planners can spatially map demand, capacity and constraints. \nAs the above example illustrates t\nhey can also require new developments to consider installing district heating systems,\n or require them to connect to existing ones.    \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Planning and Climate Change Coalition (April 2012) \nhttp://www.tcpa.org.uk/data/files/PCC_Guide_April_2012.pdf\n \n LEAP project (2013) \nhttp://leap-eu.org/\n \n SPECIAL project (2013) \nhttp://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=1134\n \n"
