[normal]Quality Education For All Falls Short If [bold]Children With Disabilities Are Excluded[bold]Introduction[bold]Africa Network Campaign on Education For All (ANCEFA) is a voluntary, non-partisan and not-for profit network of national civil society organizations in Africa championing the cause for quality education
[normal] for all. The membership currently stand at 35 national education coalitions, each of them constituting diverse membership including NGOs, Teachers Unions, Human Rights, Child Rights and Education Rights Activists, Media Practitioners, Researchers, Academi
[normal]a, Community Based Organizations

[normal]ANCEFA envisions a 
[normal]Literate and Empowered Africa
[normal] where Quality Education For All is a reality enjoyed by all children, youth and adults, without any hindrances whatsoever. In order to realize its
[normal] dream, ANCEFA’s mandate is to enhance capacity of African Civil Society to efficiently and effectively push for universal access to quality education and development through campaign, advocacy, networking, research and resource mobilization.

[normal]Why Inclusion is the way to go [bold]for governments [bold]and donor aid should target this[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]For the period of 2009 – 2012, ANCEFA with the support of Save the Children UK, undertook an action-oriented survey in the ECOWAS region of Africa to underscore the significance of the inclusive Education and how it would accelerate the access to quality E
[normal]ducation by children with disabilities. 
[normal]Many children whom most are psychologically or physically disabled are prevented from going to school simply because no one thought about integrating adapted learning, teaching and construction facilities to accommod
[normal]ate them. 
[normal]Not less that 5% of the total children population in the countries of the region has been projected to have one disability or the other (
[normal]ANCEFA 
[normal]Report ECOWAS, 2013)
[normal]The first shocking revelation is that there is absolutely no reliable data 
[normal]on a d
[normal]isaggregated manner showing
[normal] the statistics of the disabled children, more so on the nature of disability. ANCEFA and partners thus heavily rooted for an inclusive Education process that would ensure that EVERY child is in school
[normal] and LEARNING. Development p
[normal]artners have thus been called upon to support the process with governments being asked to take the lead since delivery of INCLISVE EDUCATION should be the top priority of every government
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Further, disabled children and girls in rural areas do not go to sc
[normal]hool and in urban areas, special schools are insufficient. Consequently, most disabled children are totally excluded from the educational system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Inclusive Education relates to all children accessing and meaningfully participating in quality Education in 
[normal]ways that are responsive to their individual needs. Inclusive education is therefore expected to meet EVERYONE’s rights to Education.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is universally agreed that every child has a fundamental right to 
[normal]Education and that every child CAN Learn. Further 
[normal]every stakeholder and lead agencies including governments and donor aid agencies should acknowledge and respect differences in children. Education structures, systems and methodologies must meet the needs of every children, and where 
[normal]historically disabled 
[normal]children have been discriminated against, schools have to accommodate children with special educational needs and redress the past imbalance
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Increasing awareness and vigilance among communities, enhancing capacity building of MPs and journalists on inclus
[normal]ive education, budget tracking and child rights, advocacy on inclusive education and increased budget allocations, popularization of instruments and texts on children rights, sensitization and lobbying using diverse means should help address the problem
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]National and international partnerships need to be enhanced to tackle the perennial exclusion of the children with disability from Education. A call to all international aid agencies to promote this would be a welcome move
