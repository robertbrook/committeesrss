defaultWhy Inclusion is the way to go defaultfor governments defaultand donor aid should target thisdefault&#xa0;
defaultFor the period of 2009 – 2012, ANCEFA with the support of Save the Children UK, undertook an action-oriented survey in the ECOWAS region of Africa to underscore the significance of the inclusive Education and how it would accelerate the access to quality E
defaultducation by children with disabilities. 
defaultMany children whom most are psychologically or physically disabled are prevented from going to school simply because no one thought about integrating adapted learning, teaching and construction facilities to accommod
defaultate them. 
defaultNot less that 5% of the total children population in the countries of the region has been projected to have one disability or the other (
defaultANCEFA 
defaultReport ECOWAS, 2013)
defaultThe first shocking revelation is that there is absolutely no reliable data 
defaulton a d
defaultisaggregated manner showing
default the statistics of the disabled children, more so on the nature of disability. ANCEFA and partners thus heavily rooted for an inclusive Education process that would ensure that EVERY child is in school
default and LEARNING. Development p
defaultartners have thus been called upon to support the process with governments being asked to take the lead since delivery of INCLISVE EDUCATION should be the top priority of every government
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther, disabled children and girls in rural areas do not go to sc
defaulthool and in urban areas, special schools are insufficient. Consequently, most disabled children are totally excluded from the educational system.
default&#xa0;
defaultInclusive Education relates to all children accessing and meaningfully participating in quality Education in 
defaultways that are responsive to their individual needs. Inclusive education is therefore expected to meet EVERYONE’s rights to Education.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is universally agreed that every child has a fundamental right to 
defaultEducation and that every child CAN Learn. Further 
defaultevery stakeholder and lead agencies including governments and donor aid agencies should acknowledge and respect differences in children. Education structures, systems and methodologies must meet the needs of every children, and where 
defaulthistorically disabled 
defaultchildren have been discriminated against, schools have to accommodate children with special educational needs and redress the past imbalance
default&#xa0;
defaultIncreasing awareness and vigilance among communities, enhancing capacity building of MPs and journalists on inclus
defaultive education, budget tracking and child rights, advocacy on inclusive education and increased budget allocations, popularization of instruments and texts on children rights, sensitization and lobbying using diverse means should help address the problem
default&#xa0;
defaultNational and international partnerships need to be enhanced to tackle the perennial exclusion of the children with disability from Education. A call to all international aid agencies to promote this would be a welcome move
