[normal]Written evidence submitted by[bold] [bold]Professor Clive Walker [CT 05][bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]1
[normal]              
[normal]This paper responds to the call 
[normal]on 23 July 2013 
[normal]for evidence from the 
[normal]Home Affairs
[normal] Committee on 
[normal]aspects of the ‘Pursue’ strand of the CONTEST strategy. This paper addresses just one element: ‘
[normal]Whether the Charities Commission has reduced the ability of terrorists to obtain funding through charitable donations.
[normal]’
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]Discussion in this paper derives from my research over many years into anti-terrorism laws and also, more recently, into 
[normal]regulatory action and litigation involving charities suspected of financing terrorism
[normal]. For fuller details and arguments
[normal],
[normal] see principally:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Background[bold]3
[normal]              
[normal]A
[normal]ttention to the financing of terrorism has intensified 
[normal]since 
[normal]the attacks on September 11, 2001
[normal]. 
[normal]Underlying 
[normal]characteristics
[normal] 
[normal]with
[normal]in charities which give rise to vulnerability include 
[normal]enhanced 
[normal]public trust, diversity of financ
[normal]ial activities
[normal], cash intensiv
[normal]eness,
[normal] 
[normal]complex multiple donor patterns, and the involvement of politically committed individuals.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]Th
[normal]e 
[normal]potential 
[normal]link between charities and terrorism finance
[normal] was signalled 
[normal]internationally 
[normal]by the Financial Action Task Force (‘FATF’)
[normal] in October 2001
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]when it issued
[normal] its Special Recommendation VIII
[normal] on Terrorism Financing
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The FATF identifies three categories of charity abuse
[normal].
[normal] The first concerns
[normal] the use of bogus charities as front
[normal]s
[normal] for terrorists
[normal].
[normal] The second is the 
[normal]fraudulent 
[normal](or at least furtive) 
[normal]diversion of properly raised funds
[normal] 
[normal]which are subverted towards
[normal] terrorist purposes. The third example involves 
[normal]broad
[normal]er
[normal] 
[normal]exploitation
[normal] of a charitable umbrella, such as 
[normal]through the recruitment 
[normal]and payment 
[normal]of 
[normal]extremists
[normal] or for the propagation or glorification of a militant ideology
[normal]. It is difficult to find clear examples 
[normal]in the United Kingdom 
[normal]with
[normal]in the first category. The second 
[normal]category 
[normal]will typically 
[normal]arouse
[normal] suspicions about the humanitarian work abroad of cultural associations based within 
[normal]minority communities
[normal]. 
[normal]The third category also presents 
[normal]some
[normal] risk.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]risk of charitable funding of 
[normal]jihadi
[normal] 
[normal]terrorism is viewed as 
[normal]affected
[normal] by
[normal] two further factors. One 
[normal]is
[normal] the 
[normal]Islamic custom of 
[normal]zakat
[normal] – the duty of 
[normal]donating 
[normal]personal
[normal] wealth 
[normal]for 
[normal]charit
[normal]able purposes
[normal]. 
[normal]The second factor 
[normal]affects
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]hose charities which are active in regions of conflict (such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Palestine, Somalia,
[normal] 
[normal]and, hitherto, Sri Lanka
[normal])
[normal]. They are
[normal] 
[normal]thereby
[normal] especially vulnerable
[normal] to 
[normal]the risks from 
[normal]working alongside protagonists within the conflict
[normal] and by the limits or costs of formal banking systems requiring reliance upon informal remittance systems
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]These 
[normal]depictions
[normal] of
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]political and legal salience
[normal] of 
[normal]contemporary 
[normal]ter
[normal]rorism 
[normal]finance and the centrality of charities in its 
[normal]operation
[normal] 
[normal]underplay the personal 
[normal](non-financial) 
[normal]commitment which drives
[normal] 
[normal]terrorism and 
[normal]the personal integrity of 
[normal]charity
[normal] workers
[normal] who view their independence from terrorism and government as crucial to their work
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] allegations
[normal] 
[normal]of complicity i
[normal]n terrorism 
[normal]also 
[normal]overplay 
[normal]the analogy to 
[normal]criminal racketeering
[normal] or more generally to rational choice theory
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Terrorist operations are often inexpensive
[normal], especially for the late modern (dis)organisation of many 
[normal]jihadi
[normal] groups,
[normal] and do not start with the motive of amassing personal wealth
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]So
[normal] far as the United Kingdom law is concerned, 
[normal]l
[normal]egislation against the funding of terrorism is 
[normal]a core part of 
[normal]‘CONTEST’
[normal] 
[normal]and is e
[normal]xecuted by 
[normal]the Terrorism Act 2000
[normal], P
[normal]art
[normal] III, 
[normal]as 
[normal]supplemented by 
[normal]Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001
[normal], 
[normal]Part I
[normal], the 
[normal]Counter-Terrorism Act 2008
[normal], Part V
[normal], and the 
[normal]Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc. Act 2010
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]h
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]submission
[normal] 
[normal]will first 
[normal]briefly 
[normal]explain the
[normal]se
[normal] policing mechanisms. The findings will lead into analysis of 
[normal]the key questions: ‘do they work’ and, if so, 'who pays the price' of the policing and regulatory burdens?
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]P[bold]olicing and regulatory mechanisms applied to charities[bold]8
[normal]              
[normal]Whether within
[normal] the
[normal] 'policing' or 'regulation'
[normal] of charities
[normal], there are the following essential elements
[normal] of activity
[normal]: the specification of rules or stand
[normal]ards; 
[normal]the monitoring of compliance
[normal];
[normal] and the e
[normal]stablishment of 
[normal]enforcement 
[normal]devices
[normal].
[normal] These elements 
[normal]are
[normal] reflected at two policing levels
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]'
[normal]internal
[normal]'
[normal] and 
[normal]'
[normal]external
[normal]'
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Internal [bold]policing[bold]9
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]nternal 
[normal]policing applied to charities
[normal] demands that 
[normal]they
[normal] 
[normal]should
[normal] 
[normal]monitor
[normal] 
[normal]their
[normal] own business and procedures to ensure that terrorism financing does not take place. 
[normal]A number of specialist measures 
[normal]comprise
[normal] this watchfulness 
[normal]against
[normal] terrorism financing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal]              
[normal]First, 
[normal]trustees of charities
[normal], like everyone else,
[normal] 
[normal]must 
[normal]not to withhold information about terrorism, breach of which is a criminal offence
[normal] (
[normal]section 
[normal]38B(2) of the 
[normal]Terrorism 
[normal]Act 
[normal]2000
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]A more onerous duty along the same lines is imposed by
[normal] section 
[normal]19(1) of
[normal] the
[normal] T
[normal]errorism 
[normal]A
[normal]ct 
[normal]2000
[normal]. W
[normal]he
[normal]n
[normal] a person believes or suspects that another person has committed an offence under 
[normal]either
[normal] of
[normal] sections 
[normal]15 to 18 on the basis of information accruing in the course of a trade, profession, business, or employment, an offence is committed if the information is not disclosed to a police officer or member of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (
[normal]'
[normal]SOCA
[normal]'
[normal]) 
[normal]or even the Charity Commission 
[normal]as soon as reasonably practicable. 
[normal]In the drafting of 
[normal]section 19
[normal], t
[normal]he government emphasi
[normal]s
[normal]ed the confinement of
[normal] 
[normal]the onerous duty
[normal] to professionals.
[normal] However, t
[normal]he reach of
[normal] section 
[normal]19 has been 
[normal]significantly 
[normal]supplemented by 
[normal]the 
[normal]Counter-Terrorism Act 2008
[normal],
[normal] section 
[normal]77
[normal], arising 
[normal]from allegations that charities 
[normal]were
[normal] being misused 
[normal]for terrorism financing
[normal] 
[normal]and that trustees d
[normal]id
[normal] not pay sufficient attention – thus, in 2006, just 48 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) were issued from the charitable sector, a dearth of suspicion which officialdom f
[normal]ound
[normal] 'hard to explain'
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Section 77 inserts
[normal],
[normal] as
[normal] section 
[normal]22A of the 
[normal]Terrorism Act 2000
[normal],
[normal] a new definition of ‘employment’ which encompasses both paid and unpaid 
[normal]employment and can even include voluntary work. In this way, unpaid volunteers who are the trustees of a charity must act with the same insight as professional forensic accountants.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11
[normal]              
[normal]An even stricter duty to disclose is imposed on the ‘regulated sector’
[normal] by Sch
[normal]edule
[normal] 2, P
[normal]ar
[normal]t III
[normal],
[normal] of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001
[normal]. Under
[normal] section 
[normal]21A (inserted into 
[normal]the 
[normal]Terrorism Act 2000
[normal]), a person in that sector commits an offence by knowing or suspecting or having reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting, that another person has attempted or committed an offence under 
[normal]either
[normal] of
[normal] sections 
[normal]15 to 18 (including with extra-territorial effect), unless that information is disclosed to a constable, officer of SOCA, or the employer’s nominated officer as soon as practicable. The duty is subject to a reasonable excuse not to disclose. The objective standard of liability, which can arise without subjective awareness of any suspicion, is justified by the ‘[g]reater awareness and higher standards of reporting in the financial sector’.
[normal] 
[normal]Charities do not generally fall within th
[normal]e
[normal] 'regulated sector', but the financial institutions which handle their transactions certainly do so. 
[normal]For instance, the
[normal] Royal Bank of Scotland was fined £5.6m 
[normal](including a 30% discount for 
[normal]early
[normal] settlement) 
[normal]by the Financial Services Authority in 2010 for 
[normal]failing to ensure funds were not transferred to people or organisations on sanctions lists, leading to an 
[normal]'
[normal]unacceptable risk
[normal]'
[normal] of facilitating terrorist financing.
[normal] 
[normal]More serious criticisms and r
[normal]egulatory penalties
[normal] and 
[normal]civil
[normal] litigation ha
[normal]ve 
[normal]also been encountered by 
[normal]UK 
[normal]financial institutions 
[normal]in the United States
[normal], arising from the alleged defaults of United Kingdom banks
[normal] in respect of accounts held by charities
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]External [bold]policing[bold]12
[normal]              
[normal]External 
[normal]policing
[normal] is principally 
[normal]exerted
[normal] by the Charit
[normal]y
[normal] Commission
[normal], 
[normal]under 
[normal]Part II of the Charities Act 2011
[normal]. 
[normal]In the context of alleged links to terrorism, there may be two triggers for 
[normal]investigation
[normal]. One is that the charity 
[normal]is
[normal] overstepping the boundaries of its charitable status 
[normal]by supporting political purposes 
[normal]which are 
[normal]espoused by
[normal] terrorist groups.
[normal] This first potential problem has not been the prime 
[normal]issue
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Instead, the allegation is 
[normal]commonly 
[normal]that money is being used to fund 
[normal]activities
[normal] which are in part political 
[normal]or
[normal] social but also in part 
[normal]violent
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal]              
[normal]The e
[normal]nforcement powers 
[normal]of the Charity Commission
[normal], 
[normal]in
[normal] section
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]76
[normal] 
[normal]to 87 
[normal]of the Charities Act 
[normal]2011
[normal], 
[normal]are
[normal] sweeping
[normal] 
[normal]b
[normal]ut 
[normal]rarely
[normal] used
[normal] and are
[normal] in practice 
[normal]circumscribed 
[normal]by two limitations. 
[normal]The first is that 
[normal]while charities with a turnover above a specified amount (of £5,000) must register under 
[normal]section 30 of the 
[normal]Charities Act 
[normal]2011
[normal], 
[normal]there is no obligation to 
[normal]adopt the form of a charity
[normal] by not-for-profit bodies
[normal].
[normal] Some 
[normal]groups
[normal] are suspicious of 
[normal]potential
[normal] 
[normal]meddling
[normal] or do not recognise any benefit in registration
[normal]. 
[normal]For example, despite the efforts of the Faith and Social Cohesion Unit set up in 2007, a minority of the estimated 
[normal]1
[normal],
[normal]6
[normal]72
[normal] 
[normal]m
[normal]osques
[normal] in the United Kingdom
[normal] are registered
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14
[normal]              
[normal]The second limitation is that policing and enforcement are 
[normal]secondary
[normal] in the 
[normal]constitution
[normal] 
[normal]and culture 
[normal]of the Charity Commission. 
[normal]T
[normal]he Mission of the Charity Commission i
[normal]nvolve
[normal]s
[normal] ‘enabling’, ‘encouraging’, and ‘promoting’,
[normal] while 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]statutory objectives in section
[normal] 
[normal]1
[normal]4 of 
[normal]the Charities Act 
[normal]2011
[normal] comprise legal compliance 
[normal]by charity trustees with their legal obligations 
[normal]as 
[normal]just 
[normal]one objective amongst several
[normal]. Likewise, the 'general functions' of the Commission in section 15(1)(3), without mention of any punitive or prohibitory sanction, refer to '
[normal]Identifying and investigating apparent misconduct or mismanagement in the administration of charities and taking remedial or protective action in connection with misconduct or mismanagement in the administration of charities.
[normal]'
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]'
[normal]green
[normal]-
[normal]light
[normal]'
[normal] approach of the Charity Commission can be 
[normal]further 
[normal]evidenced by its six general duties in 
[normal]section 16 of the Charities
[normal] Act
[normal] 2011
[normal]. 
[normal]General Duty 2
[normal] states that 
[normal]'
[normal]So far as is reasonably practicable, the 
[normal]Charity Commission must act in a way which is compatible with the encouragement of (a) all forms of charitable giving, and (b) voluntary participation in charity work.
[normal]'
[normal] Furthermore, in performing all its functions, the Commission is required by General Duty 4 to 
[normal]'
[normal]have regard to the principles of best regulatory practice (including the principles under which regulatory activities should be proportionate, accountable, consistent, transparent and targeted only at cases in which action is needed).
[normal]'
[normal] 
[normal]In this way, the Commission constitutes a 'green-light' regulator rather than a 'red-light' regulator.
[normal] Because of this approach, more formal policing agencies find it hard to take over investigations started by the Charity Commission.
[normal] 
[normal]The claim that the Charity Commission is hobbled, in part 
[normal]by the
[normal] framing 
[normal]of
[normal] law and in part 
[normal]as 
[normal]a self-induced restrain
[normal]ing organisational culture
[normal], may be next tested by 
[normal]some case studies
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T[bold]he application of external policing[bold]Regulatory responses[bold]15
[normal]              
[normal]If a charity becomes 
[normal]designated under 
[normal]the 
[normal]international sanctions 
[normal]regime
[normal]s, the need for regulatory action
[normal] is palpable
[normal]. But designation has only affected two charities operating in the 
[normal]U
[normal]nited Kingdom
[normal] jurisdiction. 
[normal]Assuming a charity 
[normal]is 
[normal]not internationally designated, then regulatory action is much less straightforward. 
[normal]The 
[normal]version
[normal] of 'green-light' regulation 
[normal]thesis 
[normal]adopted here is not that the Charity Commission 
[normal]wholly 
[normal]ignores allegations of terrorism. 
[normal]I
[normal]ts
[normal] caseload of 180 investigations in 2009-10
[normal] included 11 which related to 
[normal]allegations or suspicions of terrorist-related activities.
[normal] Rather, the 
[normal]issue is whether its resolve to deal with the allegations is sufficiently firm.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hree 
[normal]cases 
[normal]might
[normal] be highlighted
[normal]. These are selected as 
[normal]more recent than the notorious case of 
[normal]Abu Hamza
[normal]’s involvement in 
[normal]the North London Central Mosque 
[normal](Finsbury Park)
[normal],
[normal] more straightforward than the various inquiries into Interpal, the facts about which are disputed
[normal], and less affected by media pressures (as 
[normal]applied to the handling of 
[normal]Viva Palestina)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16
[normal]              
[normal]One 
[normal]case 
[normal]concerned the 
[normal]Ikhlas Foundation, 
[normal]which was registered in 1997 and whose main work 
[normal]involved
[normal] the 
[normal]'
[normal]Muslim Prisoner Support Group
[normal]'
[normal] and especially related to 
[normal]prisoners 
[normal]impugned for involvement in terrorism. 
[normal]The group
[normal] h
[normal]ad
[normal] been of serial concern to the Charity Commission
[normal] because of the activities of various trustees
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In 200
[normal]7
[normal], Mohammed al-Ghabra
[normal], a trustee,
[normal] w
[normal]as removed after he was 
[normal]designated by the UN and 
[normal]by the HM
[normal] Treasury in 
[normal]December 
[normal]2006
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The Charity Commission was apparently unaware of this designation until informed in July 2007
[normal]; 
[normal]he was 
[normal]removed as a trustee in October 2007
[normal]. However, 
[normal]no sanction 
[normal]was imposed 
[normal]on the remaining trustees even though 
[normal]the Commission 
[normal]viewed them as inadequately recognising or managing the risks. 
[normal]Instead, the inquiry was closed on the commitment by remaining trustees to strengthen 
[normal]their 
[normal]governance within three months.
[normal] 
[normal]That 
[normal]undertaking by the 
[normal]trustees
[normal] did not 
[normal]bear
[normal] 
[normal]fruit
[normal]. 
[normal]A
[normal] second
[normal] 
[normal]inquiry began in 2008, when another 
[normal]trustee, Abbas Taj, was 
[normal]suspended 
[normal]by the Commission 
[normal](and later resigned) 
[normal]following his 
[normal]arrest in 2008 and 
[normal]conviction in 2009 for conspiring in
[normal] a
[normal]n arson
[normal] attack
[normal] on a publisher
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he Commission recorded that the trustee
[normal]s
[normal] had 
[normal]failed to 
[normal]deliver
[normal] 
[normal]on their 
[normal]previous 
[normal]commitment
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal] Despite this recurrently woeful record, the Commission concluded its second inquiry by issuing a direction under section 19A by which the trustees were 
[normal]set a further few months
[normal] to regularise their meetings and membership
[normal],
[normal] to conduct a risk assessment
[normal],
[normal] and to mitigate risks. Given that the charity had a very modest income of around £5,000 per annum, the risk of terrorism financing should not be exaggerated. Nevertheless, 
[normal]the patience of the Charity Commission 
[normal]accorded
[normal] to
[normal] this serially delinquent charity 
[normal]was
[normal] 
[normal]astonishing
[normal], though the Ikhlas Foundation has 
[normal]since
[normal] been removed from the Register of Charities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]second
[normal] case, Iqra, a bookshop and learning centre in Beeston
[normal],
[normal] Leeds, registered as a charity in 2003. It
[normal]s
[normal] activities came to a
[normal]n abrupt
[normal] 
[normal]h
[normal]alt in 2005,
[normal] 
[normal]when it was confirmed that two of the July 7 bombers, Mohammed Siddique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer, had 
[normal]acted as
[normal] trustees. The police raid
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]its
[normal] premises, as a result of which the remaining trustees claimed that the charity had become inoperative. 
[normal]An
[normal]other trustee, Khalid Kaliq was subsequently convicted of terrorist
[normal]-
[normal]related offences
[normal] not directly related to Iqra
[normal].
[normal] Yet, not until 2009 
[normal]did
[normal] the Charity Commission decide to launch a formal inquiry, and even that step seems to have been prompted by media 
[normal]reports
[normal]. In the event, the Commission found no evidence that Iqra's finances or premises had been used for the preparation of the July 7 attacks, and it can hardly be blamed for not detecting 
[normal]terrorist connections 
[normal]more 
[normal]astutely
[normal] than the police or security 
[normal]agencies. However, the Commission 
[normal]found
[normal] that extremist materials had been 
[normal]possessed
[normal] and 
[normal]also 
[normal]admitted that 
[normal]no 
[normal]action had been taken over the fact that 
[normal]no reports or 
[normal]accounts had ever been filed
[normal] by the trustees
[normal]. Awakening from 
[normal]this
[normal] 
[normal]stupor
[normal] after 
[normal]further 
[normal]prodding by the media
[normal], the Commission took steps to seize the remaining 
[normal]trust 
[normal]money (£12,500).
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]third example concerns the 
[normal]c
[normal]harity, Sivayogam,
[normal] an organisation which worked with Tamils both in London and in northern Sri Lanka. Concerns surfaced in 2005 when it became 
[normal]public
[normal] that the leading trustee, 
[normal]Nagendram Seevaratnam
[normal], had professed 
[normal]LTTE 
[normal]sympathies. The Inquiry 
[normal]instigated by the Charity Commission 
[normal]found problems with the selection and monitoring of local partners in Sri Lanka, 
[normal]with
[normal] financial accounting, and 
[normal]with the involvement of a trustee who remained openly supportive of the 
[normal]LTTE. In 
[normal]another
[normal] example of its 
[normal]'green-light'
[normal] style, the Charity Commission imposed the sanction of removal 
[normal]of one
[normal] trustee but otherwise sought to work with the impugned charity to improve its standards. Even the attempted removal was reversed by the 
[normal]First-Tier Tribunal (Charity)
[normal], which viewed the trustee's statements as merely 
[normal]'
[normal]unwise and unguarded
[normal]'
[normal] 
[normal]and that 
[normal]contact with the LTTE did not make it necessary or desirable to remove him
[normal].
[normal] Furthermore, the Tribunal endorsed a 
[normal]'
[normal]green
[normal]-
[normal]light
[normal]'
[normal] regulatory approach:
[normal] 
[normal]'
[normal]If there had remained any legitimate regulatory concerns following a proper examination of the evidence originally provided to it, the Tribunal concludes that it would have been appropriate for the Respondent to work with the charity to improve its processes before considering exercising its regulatory powers.
[normal]'
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A[bold]ssessment of responses[bold]19
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]his 
[normal]track 
[normal]record 
[normal]of the 
[normal]Charity 
[normal]Commission
[normal] does not match the seriousness with which the threat of terrorism is 
[normal]depicted
[normal] in CONTEST. 
[normal]That verdict is subject to two p
[normal]rovisos
[normal]. One is that 
[normal]further 
[normal]efforts have been 
[normal]instituted
[normal] since 2006 to 
[normal]improve the relevant guidance
[normal].
[normal] The second point is that there are competing public interests which may legitimately affect the degree and manner of intervention by regulators.
[normal] These

[normal]              
[normal]In response to the 
[normal]evident 
[normal]perils of terrorist abuse and infiltration of charities, 
[normal]the Home Office and HM Treasury 
[normal]reviewed the 
[normal]policing
[normal] regime
[normal] i
[normal]n their 
[normal]2007 
[normal]report, 
[normal]Review of Safeguards to Protect the Charitable Sector (England and Wales) from Terrorist Abuse
[normal]’.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal] government departments
[normal] urge
[normal]d
[normal] the Charity Commission to reinforce 
[normal]its guidance
[normal], and it 
[normal]responded 
[normal]in 2008 
[normal]by 
[normal]publish
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]Counter-Terrorism Strategy
[normal] wherein it promised
[normal] 'zero tolerance'.
[normal] In pursuance of 
[normal]its
[normal] strategy, various actions have been undertaken to improve trustee awareness, 
[normal]including 
[normal]oversight through a Proactive Monitoring Unit, cooperation between enforcement agencies, and 
[normal]greater 
[normal]intervention. 
[normal]Published advice has been 
[normal]further 
[normal]elaborated through the issuance of an 
[normal]Operational Guidance
[normal] 
[normal]and a 
[normal]Compliance Toolkit
[normal], setting out the Commission’s approach, and underlining the duties of vigilance and disclosure of trustees, illustrating the possible threats, 
[normal]and giving advice about the work of the Counter Terrorism Team which forms part of the Intensive Casework Unit in Compliance and Support.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]Compliance Toolkits
[normal] w
[normal]ere
[normal] 
[normal]impressively
[normal] expanded in 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21
[normal]              
[normal]Despite these 
[normal]documentary
[normal] 
[normal]elaborations
[normal], 
[normal]there has been no discernible change in the 
[normal]'
[normal]green
[normal]-
[normal]light
[normal]'
[normal] approach.
[normal] The Home Office commented in its 2011 paper on 
[normal]Prevent Strategy
[normal] 
[normal]as part of the 'Next Steps' agenda
[normal] that '
[normal]The Charity Commission must be seen to be capable of taking robust and vigorous action against charities that are involved in terrorist activity or have links to terrorist organisations.
[normal]' The accompanying independent survey by Lord Carlile is more candidly critical of the Commission.
[normal] 
[normal]This analysis of the 
[normal]continuing 
[normal]attitude and approach of the Charity Commission tallies with some recommendations 
[normal]in
[normal] the report by Lo
[normal]r
[normal]d Hodgson in 2012, 
[normal]Trusted and independent: giving charity back to charities - review of the Charities Act 2006
[normal].
[normal] Lord Hodgson not only calls for automatic trustee disqualification 
[normal]following any conviction of a terrorism offence
[normal] (which would not make much difference) but also that the Charity Commission should take ‘
[normal]a more robust approach to potentially failing organisations
[normal]’ and ‘
[normal]proactive as well as reactive steps
[normal]’ in cases of abuse.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22
[normal]              
[normal]Moving next to the 
[normal]competing public 
[normal]g
[normal]oods
[normal], 
[normal]these 
[normal]countervailing considerations are that 
[normal]British 
[normal]society 
[normal]should not
[normal] appear 
[normal]to be 
[normal]stone-hearted
[normal] 
[normal]in the face of 
[normal]humanitarian 
[normal]crises
[normal] in 
[normal]conflict zones
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]such as 
[normal]in 
[normal]Palestine, Somalia, and Sri Lanka
[normal]. Such
[normal] a stance 
[normal]might even aggravate the situation by 
[normal]encourag
[normal]ing
[normal] less regulated and 
[normal]less cooperative
[normal] 
[normal]activities
[normal], even resulting in 
[normal]a strategic defeat
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]An illustration of s
[normal]uch upheaval 
[normal]arises from 
[normal]the United Nations listing of the Al Barakaat group in Somalia from 2001 to 2009
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]However, a
[normal]nother public good is the punishment of wrongdoing
[normal] which, in this case, may curtail the financing of terrorism and uphold the integrity of the charitable sector
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]F[bold]uture [bold]regulation[bold]2

[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he United Kingdom approach to charities assailed by the taint of terrorism funding has been one of considerate understanding if not
[normal],
[normal] at times
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]excessive
[normal] 
[normal]'green-light' 
[normal]lenienc
[normal]y
[normal]. 
[normal]Equally
[normal], their
[normal] bankers are
[normal] 
[normal]rarely
[normal] at risk 
[normal]except in 
[normal]US civil courts. 
[normal]Thus,
[normal] worthy 
[normal]individuals pay the 
[normal]highest 
[normal]price
[normal] for 
[normal]relief work at the margins of legality
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he Charity Commission is wholly correct to be highly suspicious of self-serving allegations from the opponents of Palestinians, Tamils, and other oppressed peoples and to adopt a stance which is primarily encouraging of compliance with high standards of governance rather than a condemnatory approach.
[normal] 
[normal]But 
[normal]its 
[normal]serial indulgence of 
[normal]patent 
[normal]abuses does no
[normal]t 
[normal]aid
[normal] the charitable sector
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]wo 
[normal]facile
[normal] reactions should be avoided. One 
[normal]would be
[normal] to swing entirely towards criminal prosecution and asset forfeiture, a stance which
[normal] would unduly ignore competing public goods
[normal].
[normal] The second 
[normal]mistake 
[normal]would be to 
[normal]seek to 
[normal]reinforce the 
[normal]punitive 
[normal]resolve of the Charity Commission. 
[normal]The data from this 
[normal]chapter 
[normal]suggests that 
[normal]the Commission's
[normal] 
[normal]weak 
[normal]statutory remit and 
[normal]entrenched 
[normal]‘
[normal]enabling
[normal]’ 
[normal]culture
[normal] cannot easily be nudged
[normal]. 
[normal]A
[normal] 
[normal]more 
[normal]promising
[normal] 
[normal]third way is to 
[normal]emphasise
[normal] the value of financial investigation 
[normal]to facilitate
[normal] intelligence-gathering
[normal]. P
[normal]rosecution 
[normal]and confiscation
[normal] 
[normal]remain
[normal] possible outcomes
[normal] but should be less pressing than disruption and the gathering 
[normal]and transmission 
[normal]of 
[normal]data
[normal] about terrorism activities 
[normal]other
[normal] than just financing
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]A
[normal] financial investiga
[normal]tion approach c
[normal]ould have produced 
[normal]outcome
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]of greater 
[normal]utility
[normal] to counter-terrorism 
[normal]in 
[normal]several
[normal] of the inquiries described in this paper. 
[normal]I
[normal]t would have been more likely to have delivered
[normal] information 
[normal]about terrorism networks 
[normal]and 
[normal]to 
[normal]close off the facilitation of militancy, but 
[normal]without 
[normal]hurting
[normal] worthy causes.
[normal] Th
[normal]is
[normal] financial investigation approach is not best placed in the hands of the Charity Commission
[normal] but should primarily be conducted by a 
[normal]formal 
[normal]polic
[normal]e
[normal] body
[normal]. 
[normal]The roles left for the Charity Commission would be as standard-setter, 
[normal]as 
[normal]standard-monitor (with 
[normal]early 
[normal]alerts back to the police financial investigators), and 
[normal]as 
[normal]standard-applier
[normal] (with police advice)
[normal].
[normal] In this way, the heaviest price for terrorism financing 
[normal]should
[normal] be paid by 
[normal]professional profit-takers and 
[normal]recipient
[normal] perpetrators
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] terrorism.
