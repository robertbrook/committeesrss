[normal]Written[bold] E[bold]vidence [bold]S[bold]ubmitted by the Joint Industry Board for the Electrical Contracting [bold]Summary[bold]The Joint Industry Board for the Electrical Contracting Industry[bold]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Joint Industry Board for the Electrical Contracting Industry (JIB) 
[normal]is a not for profit organisation. It 
[normal]was established in 1968 by The Electrical Contractors’ Association and 
[normal]the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunication and Plumbing Union (now part of Unite the Union).
[normal] Further information on the JIB is available on its website at 
[normal]www.jib.org.uk
[normal]The Electrotechnical Certification Scheme[bold]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Electrotechnical Certification Scheme (ECS) is jointly owned by the Joint Industry Board (JIB) and its sister organisation, the Scottish Joint Industry Board (SJIB).
[normal] The primary aims
[normal] of the Scheme 
[normal]are
[normal] to set standards for individual competence
[normal], to ass
[normal]ess competence against the standards within the Scheme and to accredit competence through the issue of ECS cards to individuals.
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Scheme developed from the JIB and SJIB Grading Systems, which were introduced in 1968 by the JIB and in 1969 by the SJIB.
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he UK Register of Electricians was established in 1993 to accredit electricians who could demonstrate competence equivalent to the standards of the National Vocational Qualification (N/SVQ) at Level 3.
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 1999 the JIB Grading System was merged with the UK 
[normal]Register of Electricians to form 
[normal]one industry recognised scheme under 
[normal]the 
[normal]Electrotechnical Certification Scheme (
[normal]ECS
[normal]). Th
[normal]e
[normal] scheme became available to all individuals who could demonstrate that they met the 
[normal]required 
[normal]standard
[normal]s.
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The ECS was affiliated to the Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) in 2002 
[normal]following the introduction of 
[normal]Health and Safety Assessments
[normal]. These were implemented following a call in February 2001 by the Deputy Prime Minister for the construction in
[normal]dustry to improve its safety record.
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A total of over 111,000 cards are held across the UK, with
[normal] 98,000
[normal] 
[normal]cards currently held by individuals based in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, of which over 48,000 are Installation Electrician
[normal]s. 
[normal]A further 13,000 
[normal]cards are held by individuals based in Scotland.
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Further information on the ECS is available on its website at 
[normal]www.ecscard.org.uk
[normal]Part ‘P’ of the Building Regulations[bold]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The introduction of Part ‘P’
[normal] of the Building Reg
[normal]ulations
[normal] 
[normal]in 2005 set minimum standards for the first time for electrical installation work in dwellings.
[normal]10.
[normal] 
[normal]Competent Person Schemes 
[normal]took the domestic sector forward
[normal] by
[normal] introduc
[normal]ing the registration of Qualified Supervisors by
[normal] 
[normal]e
[normal]lectrical companies
[normal]. The
[normal] 
[normal]Qualified Supervisor
[normal] is
[normal] responsible for signing off work and in doing so warranting that the work has been undertaken in accordance with 
[normal]all parts 
[normal]of the Building Regulations and that the electrical installation has been executed in accordance with 
[normal]the UK 
[normal]wiring regulations (
[normal]BS 7671
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]11.
[normal] 
[normal]The use of initial and subsequent annual assessments 
[normal]of the electrical business 
[normal]by 
[normal]a
[normal] Competent Person Scheme helps to set and maintain standards.
[normal]12.
[normal] 
[normal]The concept of Competent Person Schemes
[normal],
[normal] which ensure that companies comply wit
[normal]h Building Standards
[normal],
[normal] is however incomplete without the accreditation of the competence of the individuals who actually undertake the work.
[normal]13.
[normal] 
[normal]It should be noted that whilst the Qualified Supervisor is responsible for 
[normal]signing off work under Part ‘P’, 
[normal]they
[normal] may
[normal] not have personally undertaken the work. This point is particularly important in the case of electrical installations and repairs because much of the work is hidden
[normal]. 
[normal]14.
[normal] 
[normal]The JIB offer
[normal]s
[normal] to work with the Competent Person Schemes to accredit the competence of e
[normal]ach individual who undertakes electrical installation work in the domestic sector in England and Wales within the scope of Part ‘P’ of the Building Regulations.
[normal]15.
[normal] 
[normal]In each case the individual’s qualifications and experience will be considered in accordance wi
[normal]th the rules of the ECS and an 
[normal]appropriate 
[normal]ECS card will be issued to that individual.
[normal]16.
[normal] 
[normal]The ECS will then become the UK wide scheme for the accreditation of the competence of electricians
[normal]. This will provide c
[normal]onfidence
[normal] for
[normal] consumers and 
[normal]clarity for 
[normal]the industry.
