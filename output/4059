defaultThe Electrotechnical Certification Schemedefault2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Electrotechnical Certification Scheme (ECS) is jointly owned by the Joint Industry Board (JIB) and its sister organisation, the Scottish Joint Industry Board (SJIB).
default The primary aims
default of the Scheme 
defaultare
default to set standards for individual competence
default, to ass
defaultess competence against the standards within the Scheme and to accredit competence through the issue of ECS cards to individuals.
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Scheme developed from the JIB and SJIB Grading Systems, which were introduced in 1968 by the JIB and in 1969 by the SJIB.

defaultT
defaulthe UK Register of Electricians was established in 1993 to accredit electricians who could demonstrate competence equivalent to the standards of the National Vocational Qualification (N/SVQ) at Level 3.
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 1999 the JIB Grading System was merged with the UK 
defaultRegister of Electricians to form 
defaultone industry recognised scheme under 
defaultthe 
defaultElectrotechnical Certification Scheme (
defaultECS
default). Th
defaulte
default scheme became available to all individuals who could demonstrate that they met the 
defaultrequired 
defaultstandard
defaults.

defaultThe ECS was affiliated to the Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) in 2002 
defaultfollowing the introduction of 
defaultHealth and Safety Assessments
default. These were implemented following a call in February 2001 by the Deputy Prime Minister for the construction in
defaultdustry to improve its safety record.

defaultA total of over 111,000 cards are held across the UK, with
default 98,000
default 
defaultcards currently held by individuals based in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, of which over 48,000 are Installation Electrician
defaults. 
defaultA further 13,000 
defaultcards are held by individuals based in Scotland.

defaultPart ‘P’ of the Building Regulationsdefault9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe introduction of Part ‘P’
default of the Building Reg
defaultulations
default 
defaultin 2005 set minimum standards for the first time for electrical installation work in dwellings.

default 
defaultCompetent Person Schemes 
defaulttook the domestic sector forward
default by
default introduc
defaulting the registration of Qualified Supervisors by
default 
defaulte
defaultlectrical companies
default. The
default 
defaultQualified Supervisor
default is
default responsible for signing off work and in doing so warranting that the work has been undertaken in accordance with 
defaultall parts 
defaultof the Building Regulations and that the electrical installation has been executed in accordance with 
defaultthe UK 
defaultwiring regulations (
defaultBS 7671
default)
default. 
default11.
default 
defaultThe use of initial and subsequent annual assessments 
defaultof the electrical business 
defaultby 
defaulta
default Competent Person Scheme helps to set and maintain standards.
default12.
default 
defaultThe concept of Competent Person Schemes
default,
default which ensure that companies comply wit
defaulth Building Standards
default,
default is however incomplete without the accreditation of the competence of the individuals who actually undertake the work.
default13.
default 
defaultIt should be noted that whilst the Qualified Supervisor is responsible for 
defaultsigning off work under Part ‘P’, 
defaultthey
default may
default not have personally undertaken the work. This point is particularly important in the case of electrical installations and repairs because much of the work is hidden
default. 
default14.
default 
defaultThe JIB offer
defaults
default to work with the Competent Person Schemes to accredit the competence of e
defaultach individual who undertakes electrical installation work in the domestic sector in England and Wales within the scope of Part ‘P’ of the Building Regulations.
default15.
default 
defaultIn each case the individual’s qualifications and experience will be considered in accordance wi
defaultth the rules of the ECS and an 
defaultappropriate 
defaultECS card will be issued to that individual.
default16.
default 
defaultThe ECS will then become the UK wide scheme for the accreditation of the competence of electricians
default. This will provide c
defaultonfidence
default for
default consumers and 
defaultclarity for 
defaultthe industry.
