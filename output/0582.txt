[[[Executive Summary]]]&#xa0;This memorandum contains written evidence submitted by PHS Space Ltd to the Science and Technology Committee inquiry into the European and UK Space Agencies. Responses are provided to five of the six categories of information requested by the committee. However, the focus of the evidence relates to the space debris problem. Some concerns about the level of funding available in the UK are identified, particularly with regard to the development of innovative debris mitigation / remediation technologies. Budgetary pressures are also observed to be jeopardizing the UK’s long-standing participation at important international debris mitigation committees. It is noted that the UK cannot afford to ignore the debris problem if it is serious about growing the space sector to achieve a £40 billion turnover by 2030. Indeed, part of this turnover could come from the development and use of technologies that address the debris problem.&#xa0;

[[[What are the strengths and weaknesses of the funding, organisation, and work of the European Space Agency?]]]&#xa0;1.1/              The greatest strength of ESA is its technical staff, whose breadth and depth of knowledge across the organisation is significant. This expertise, which has brought about many successful space missions, should be developed as much as possible. For example, more opportunities could be provided for the secondment of ESA staff to industry, national space agencies or the EU. &#xa0;1.2/              In terms of organisation, ESA has a rigid hierarchical structure which is similar in many respects to a large civil service department. A flatter organisation with a matrix management system, if implemented correctly, would allow greater flexibility in moving staff both within and outside the organisation. It would also provide a closer relationship between senior management and the technical staff. This should improve upward communication flow of important advice from technical staff.&#xa0;1.3/              One area requiring attention in ESA is the process that industry has to follow when bidding for relatively low-value competitive tenders, i.e. those less than 500k euros. At present the process is too costly, time-consuming and complicated. This can act as a barrier to SMEs bidding, since the size of the investment that must be made, and risk taken, may be a substantial proportion of the SME’s overall business. Therefore, SMEs are forced to consider bidding only for those ESA contracts that they have a significant chance of winning. By contrast, large organisations can absorb the high bidding costs much more readily, and therefore they can afford to be more speculative when bidding for work. Thus the complexity and cost of the ESA bidding process has an inherent bias in favour of large organisations.  This clearly has a couple of (perhaps unintended) consequences. First, the organisation that wins a contract may not necessarily be the best one to undertake the work. Second, the potential for SMEs to grow could be hindered.&#xa0;1.4/              An aspect of the ESA bidding process that remains a cause for concern is “juste retour”. The existence of a geographical return requirement can force a bid consortium to include some weaker partners in order to spread the geographical loading. Therefore, it seems inevitable that bid consortia will be sub-optimal in their make-up. As a consequence, one must also presume that some of the resulting contract deliverables from a winning consortium will not be of the highest standard achievable.&#xa0;

[[[In light of the European Commission’s recent Communication on relations between ESA and the EU (COM 2012 671), what relationship between ESA, the EU and the UK would provide the most effective governance regime? Why?]]]&#xa0;2.1/              ESA has accomplished much since its inception. There have been notable achievements across all of the space activity domains. However, given its budgetary constraints, and the emergence of EU funding of space-related activities, perhaps now is the time for ESA to focus on certain key areas. There should be a clear demarcation between ESA’s activities and those of the EU. The greatest technological risk and challenge comes from science missions, interplanetary missions and human spaceflight. It could be argued that ESA’s undoubted technical expertise would be put to best use by concentrating on these particular areas. Where synergies and economies of scale exist, ESA projects should be pursued in collaboration with national space agencies within Europe, such as the UK Space Agency, or agencies outside of Europe.&#xa0;2.2/              To complement this approach, the EU could assume responsibility for unmanned, Earth orbital missions since these provide the most immediate and obvious societal benefits to European citizens. In recent years the EU has demonstrated its commitment to Earth orbital space, both in terms of use (e.g. GMES) and in terms of preservation of the environment for future generations (e.g. addressing the space debris problem).&#xa0;

[[[How effective is the EU’s support for research and innovation in the space sector? What effect have changes to the Multi-Annual Financial Framework had on ESA and support for the space sector from the Horizon 2020 programme?]]]&#xa0;3.1/              EU support for research and innovation has provided a significant boost to the European space sector, and has filled in some sizeable funding gaps. This is particularly evident in an area such as space debris research. Over the past three years several large debris projects have been funded within FP7 to address a variety of important needs. These include the development of methods to mitigate the growth in orbital debris and technologies for actively removing debris from the environment. In the light of concerns about the Kessler syndrome taking hold, i.e. the onset of an irreversible collision cascade in low Earth orbit (LEO), the EU has approached the debris problem with a sense of urgency. This is laudable. EU funding has helped many European companies, especially SMEs, to develop promising ideas and technologies. In so doing, the competitiveness of European industry has also been improved. The upcoming Horizon 2020 programme looks set to continue that trend.&#xa0;3.2/              One problem that the EU currently appears to suffer from is a lack of staff to oversee the space-related research being undertaken. At present the EU has limited in-house technical expertise, and therefore it has to invite outside experts to act as project reviewers. This can work quite well if there is a good match between the aims of a project and the knowledge of the expert. However, experience shows that this is not always the case. Some projects have been reviewed by experts who are not sufficiently qualified to provide meaningful inputs. If the EU is to provide effective oversight of research within Horizon 2020, then it needs to address this problem. One possible solution would be for ESA to provide a number of technical staff to the EU. This could be on a secondment basis or as a permanent transfer.&#xa0;

[[[How effective has the UK Space Agency been and what improvements could be made? Is the UK effectively exploiting opportunities for growth in the space sector or could more be done?]]]&#xa0;4.1/              The UK Space Agency’s National Space Technology Programme (NTSP) has given much-needed assistance to the development of innovative technologies within the UK space sector. However, the level of investment would seem to fall short of that necessary to satisfy the aspiration of creating a £40 billion-turnover space industry within the UK by 2030. In addition, calls for proposals need to be more frequent and regular to ensure that promising new ideas can be developed quickly and retained by the UK.&#xa0;4.2/              The relationship between funding offered by the NTSP and that offered by the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) is unclear. It is presumed that there is coordination between these funding programmes regarding the technical requirements in calls for proposals. However, an outsider to the process can have poor visibility and understanding of this. For example, it is not clear under what circumstances a proposal should be submitted to the NTSP rather than the TSB.&#xa0;

[[[How resilient is the UK’s space-based infrastructure? Are threats from space debris or solar activity being appropriately mitigated? What role do, or should, ESA and the UK Space Agency play in addressing these issues?]]]&#xa0;5.1/              One of the leading international organisations for addressing the space debris problem is the Inter Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC). This is an international governmental forum for the worldwide coordination of activities related to the issues of man-made and natural debris in space. Recently IADC has studied the stability of the debris population in low Earth Orbit and found that the population is likely to increase by approximately 30% in the next 200 years. This projection assumes 90% implementation of mitigation measures in the design and operation of spacecraft (which is not currently achieved). In view of this result, the IADC observes that two key elements are required for the long-term sustainability of the future LEO environment. The first defence is to encourage greater compliance with mitigation measures (such as those contained in the IADC’s space debris mitigation guidelines or the ISO 24113 standard). Secondly, active debris removal (ADR) should be considered. The IADC study concludes that “the international community should initiate an effort to investigate the benefits of environment remediation, explore various options, and support the development of the most cost-effective technologies in preparation for actions to better preserve the near-Earth environment for future generations”.&#xa0;5.2/              Active debris removal brings with it many challenges. Aside from the technical difficulties in safely removing debris, there are also political, legal and financial hurdles to be overcome. The UKSA should make a meaningful contribution towards finding solutions to all of these problems. For example, on the technical side, the UK has significant expertise in a number of areas, including:&#xa0;&#xa0;5.3/              The UKSA should encourage and support the development of promising new debris mitigation / remediation ideas, particularly those emerging from SMEs. Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will benefit from the UK’s innovations. At least one such idea is on the verge of being lost from the UK because of a lack of funding opportunities.&#xa0;5.4/              The UK Space Agency also has a long-standing obligation to participate in international forums addressing the space debris problem. It has satisfied this obligation with the help of a small number of experts who have provided the UKSA with technical support and advice on space debris matters for a number of years. As a result the UKSA has been able to take a leading role in the development of international debris mitigation guidelines and standards, such as those published by the IADC, UN and ISO. This work is on-going, and has now been expanded to include recommendations relating to active debris removal (ADR). To ensure the UK can continue to have a positive influence on these activities, and therefore protect the commercial interests of the UK space industry, it is very important that such representation is maintained. However, budgetary pressures within the UKSA in recent years have reduced funding for the expert support to a point where meaningful participation has been jeopardized.&#xa0;5.5/              The UK cannot afford to walk away from its obligations in these international debris mitigation forums if it is serious about growing the space sector to achieve a £40 billion turnover by 2030. Activities such as monitoring and modelling the debris environment, and standardizing spacecraft design and operations to mitigate debris are inseparably bound with this economic aspiration. The UKSA should therefore reaffirm its commitment to international space debris mitigation efforts via the IADC, UN and ISO, and take immediate measures to reverse the decline in funding support for expert participation in these forums.&#xa0;5.6/              ESA’s funding of the space debris problem has been variable during the past decade. Approximately 10 years ago, a management decision was made to curtail funding of space debris research. The rationale for the decision is unclear. Since no serious collisions had happened up to that point, perhaps there was a perception that debris was not a significant problem that deserved funding. In contrast, ESA debris experts at that time were predicting that collisions would be likely to start within a few years (based on simulations from long-term debris environment evolution models). As it happened, the first major accidental collision took place in February 2009 and the environment has deteriorated substantially since then. It is worth noting that ESA funding of space debris research has increased noticeably in the past couple of years. This is a welcome development. However, given the level of concern about the debris problem now, perhaps there is scope for further improvement.&#xa0;5.7/              Finally, within ESA, technical experts are currently studying options for actively removing the Envisat satellite from orbit. Envisat, one of the largest spacecraft to be launched, orbits in a very popular and populous region of low Earth orbit. After 10 years of operation it suffered a sudden and irrecoverable failure last year and, as a result, became one of the most hazardous debris objects in LEO. Unfortunately, Envisat will now remain in orbit for well over a century unless ESA can find some method to remove it safely. Space debris experts in the UK are also considering possible solutions to this problem.&#xa0;April 2013&#xa0;
