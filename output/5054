[normal] [PCC Progress 43]
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]About CfPS[bold]1.
[normal]              
[normal]The Centre for Public Scrutiny is a charity whose principal focus is on scrutiny, accountability and good governance, both in the public sector and amongst those people and organisations who deliver publicly-funded services.
[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]We believe that accountability, transparency and involvement should be the foundations of planning and delivering public services.
[normal]3.
[normal]              
[normal]Effective scrutiny and accountability can hold services to account and create opportunities for communities and decision-makers to improve the quality of services by producing solutions to problems together.
[normal]4.
[normal]              
[normal]The Centre supports individuals, organisations and communities by sharing research and analysis of current and developing best practice through publications, consultancy and events. We also create and support networks and on-line forums. The bulk of our work focuses on local government and the wider localism agenda, but we also work extensively with and for health and social care bodies, and others such as police, park and fire authorities, housing associations and other housing management organisations, universities, regulators, Parliament and select committees and government departments.
[normal]5.
[normal]              
[normal]The Centre for Public Scrutiny is an independent charity (charity number 1136243) and company limited by guarantee (company number 5133443), governed by a 
[normal]Board of Trustees 
[normal]and supported by an 
[normal]Advisory Board
[normal]. There are three Trustees from our founder members (LGA, CIPFA and LGiU) and six independent Trustees, including the Chair, the Rt Hon Nick Raynsford MP.
[normal]Declaration of interests[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.
[normal]              
[normal]In 2009 we co-produced statutory guidance, with the Local Government Information Unit, covering sections 19 to 21 of the Police and Justice Act 2009. We received Home Office funding for this work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]              
[normal]In September 2010, we made a submission to the Home Office’s consultation on proposals which subsequently formed part of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011. 
[normal]In this submission we recommended that the Government not introduce Police and Crime Commissioners. The response can be found here:

[normal]8.
[normal]              
[normal]From 2011 to 2012 a CfPS staff member sat on a Home Office project board providing advice to civil servants and Ministers on the checks and balances elements of the new policing arrangements (specifically, Police and Crime Panels). 
[normal]CfPS received no remuneration for this work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal]              
[normal]In 2011 and 2012, we produced 
[normal]three sets of unofficial guidance for Police and Crime Panels. This work was paid for and published by the Local Government Association. In 2013, we have carried out detailed research for the Local Government Association on the first year of Police and Crime Panels. This was paid for by the Local Government Association. This research has not yet been published. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Submission[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]10.
[normal]              
[normal]This submission focuses on t
[normal]he role of police and crime panels in holding their commissioners to account
[normal]. It is based on as-yet-unpublished research carried out by the Centre for Public Scrutiny over the course of autumn 2013. This involved structured telephone interviews with the support officers for 38 of the 41 Panels outside London, similar interviews with a number of Panel chairs and independent members, and informal discussions with a wider group of Panel members at a series of events held by the Local Government Association in March, July and November 2013. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction: the role of the Police 
[normal]and Crime Panel
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal]              
[normal]The Act states that
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“The functions of the police and crime panel for a police area must be exercised with a view to supporting the effective exercise of the functions of the police and crime commissioner for that police area” (s28)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.
[normal]              
[normal]The Panel has specific statutory duties which empower it to review and scrutinise:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.
[normal]              
[normal]There is also a general statutory power to review and scrutinise the PCC’s decisions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal]              
[normal]Staff supporting Panels, and some Panel members, feel that Panels’ first year can be divided into two phases – a 
[normal]first phase, typified by a focus on statutory duties, and a second phase, which has seen more proactive work beg
[normal]i
[normal]n. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Making a difference on the ground
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15
[normal]              
[normal]It is too early to make conclusive judgments about the effectiveness of Police and Crime Panels[bold]. Panels have been operational for one year, but their first few months – typified by a fast pace of work, during a period in which PCCs were also finding their feet – is likely to be atypical of their future activity. The large volume of confirmation hearings in particular is unlikely to be repeated in future. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.
[normal]              
[normal]Overall, indications for the future are positive. 
[normal]Some Panels’ work this year has served, for example, to make substantial improvements to draft Police and Crime Plans. But it is difficult at this stage to point to tangible impacts on the ground, and to assert that specific things would not have happened but 
[normal]for 
[normal]Panels’ existence and involvement. The length of the decision and policy-making cycles within which PCCs operate suggest to us that it will be 2015 by the time we are able to reach conclusive judgments on 
[normal]panels’ 
[normal]impact and effectiveness. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Holding to account: statutory duties
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.
[normal]              
[normal]From November 2012 to April 2013, most Panels’ work focused on 
[normal]their 
[normal]principal statutory duties. This was work for which Panels had little time to prepare. PCCs, too, had only a few weeks to develop their Police and Crime Plans and their 2013/14 budgets. 
[normal]As a result, most PCCs’ priorities and budgets closely reflect former police authorities’ plans. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18.
[normal]              
[normal]The tight timescale for the formal tabling of this information led to the experience of scrutiny of budgets, precepts and plans in early 2013 being rushed and unsatisfactory in many areas. Panels had difficulty getting hold of information in a timely manner, meaning that formal, public scrutiny sessions were not as effective as they might have been. 
[normal]For example, discussions about Police and Crime Plans were extremely general, and budget discussions were in some instances based on little more information than the base figure of the precept itself. Additionally, in a couple of instances, Plans and budgets were not presented together, making it difficult for links to be drawn between these key strategic documents. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19.
[normal]              
[normal]A large number of confirmation hearings added to the pressure of work at this time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Holding to account: proactive work
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20.
[normal]              
[normal]Since April 2013, more Panels have been turning their mind to proactive work. 
[normal]This work takes the form of:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21.
[normal]              
[normal]This proactive work is not provided for in legislation. 
[normal]We believe, however, that it will prove necessary for Panels to undertake this work in the future. This is because it will be required to help Panels to understand fully the PCC’s priorities, and without this background information – which can only be gathered by carrying out this kind of proactive work 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]it will be difficult for them to carry out their core, statutory duties. 
[normal]Where carried out, 
[normal]activity of this nature 
[normal]will need to be delivered further to a
[normal] work
[normal] programme that 
[normal]is carefully prioritised,
[normal] defined by the prioritie
[normal]s in the Police and Crime Plan. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Holding to account: relationships
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22.
[normal]              
[normal]Relationships between Panels and PCCs are for the most part constructive, although there have been difficulties in a minority of instances. 
[normal]There have been particular difficulties for a number of Panels in getting hold of information from PCCs – both information about decision-making, and information about operational performance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.
[normal]              
[normal]The review and scrutiny of PCC decisions is one of the Panel’s statutory duties but a number of Panels have found it difficult. This has two principal causes – one sitting with Panels themselves, and the other with PCCs:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.
[normal]              
[normal]Relationships have proved fractious in areas where disagreements have arisen over the 
[normal]scope and nature of Panels’ work. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25.
[normal]              
[normal]Disagreements about the meaning of words in the Act – which coalesce around the two points above – serve to 
[normal]perpetuate tortuous, circular and legalistic arguments and what information the PCP is “entitled” to see, and actions it is “entitled” to carry out. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26.
[normal]              
[normal]These disagreements highlight a more fundamental issue – a lack of understanding 
[normal]about the role and remit of the Panel
[normal] by PCCs, their offices and, in some instances, Panels themselves
[normal]. 
[normal]A large number of Panel members are former police authority members, and some of them do not appreciate how their role has changed since November 2012, and that the Panel is not the police authority’s “replacement”. Equally, some PCCs, and their offices, are resistant to the idea of scrutiny by an external body,
[normal] 
[normal]resulting in an approach that has seen little information being shared and little willingness to engage to explore how the relationship might work better in the future. 
[normal]Where little information is shared between the PCC and the Panel, it makes the work of the Panel more difficult to carry out, which raises questions locally about the Panel’s effectiveness. This is a vicious cycle that need to be broken to make the arrangements work, but is not by any means a systemic problem affecting all Panels. Indeed, in many areas these problems have either been overcome, or never occurred in the first place. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Holding to account: resourcing
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27.
[normal]              
[normal]Each Panel has £53,000 of funding from the Home Office to support its Police and Crime Panel. We understand that this was calculated to reflect the average funding required, with on-costs, to appoint a scrutiny officer (a post roughly equivalent to that of a committee specialist on a Commons select committee). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28.
[normal]              
[normal]Notwithstanding this funding, resourcing has proven to be a challenge for many (but not all) Panels. The Home Office assumed that Panels would need to meet only four times a year; over the course of 2012 and 2013, most have met at least seven times and a few as many 
[normal]as 
[normal]twelve. This has in part been due to 
[normal]a disproportionate number of confirmation hearings in year 1, but also reflects the need for Panels to cover a wide range of issues, and to undertake a workload that allows them to fully engage with PCCs’ work. The consensus amongst Panels is that four meetings per year would not allow them to do this. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29.
[normal]              
[normal]Where they exist, resource challenges are exacerbated by the fact that the range of skills required to support Panels are wide-ranging, and unlikely to be possessed by a single person. They include legal, finance, HR, policy and research, administrative support and specialist knowledge of community safety issues. 
[normal]This has resulted in expertise being brought in by lead authorities in an ad hoc manner, which has resulted in a number of lead authorities informally expending more than the £53,000 allocated by the Home Office, to ensure that Panels run effectively. We consider that this has placed those authorities at an unreasonabl
[normal]e
[normal] disadvantage. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30.
[normal]              
[normal]Some areas have not put in place long-term arrangements for Panel support because of a fear that the Home Office funding will be withdrawn, and that they will be unable to support an additional officer post without those funds. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Proposals and suggestions for change
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31.
[normal]              
[normal]Over the course of our research, and since it has been completed, a number of different proposals have been put to us as to how Panels’ remit and role could be changed, and/or how a new system for policing accountability could be introduced, should a future Government decide to abolish PCCs and Panels altogether. 
[normal]We have also developed some ideas about ways in which improvements could be made within the existing statutory framework. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]32.
[normal]              
[normal]Some possibilities 
[normal]which would require changes in the law 
[normal]include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]33.
[normal]              
[normal]Possibilities which would not include legal changes might include:
