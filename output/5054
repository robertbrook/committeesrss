default&#xa0;defaultAbout CfPSdefault1.
default              
defaultThe Centre for Public Scrutiny is a charity whose principal focus is on scrutiny, accountability and good governance, both in the public sector and amongst those people and organisations who deliver publicly-funded services.
default2.
default              
defaultWe believe that accountability, transparency and involvement should be the foundations of planning and delivering public services.
default3.
default              
defaultEffective scrutiny and accountability can hold services to account and create opportunities for communities and decision-makers to improve the quality of services by producing solutions to problems together.
default4.
default              
defaultThe Centre supports individuals, organisations and communities by sharing research and analysis of current and developing best practice through publications, consultancy and events. We also create and support networks and on-line forums. The bulk of our work focuses on local government and the wider localism agenda, but we also work extensively with and for health and social care bodies, and others such as police, park and fire authorities, housing associations and other housing management organisations, universities, regulators, Parliament and select committees and government departments.

default              
defaultThe Centre for Public Scrutiny is an independent charity (charity number 1136243) and company limited by guarantee (company number 5133443), governed by a 
defaultBoard of Trustees 
defaultand supported by an 
defaultAdvisory Board
default. There are three Trustees from our founder members (LGA, CIPFA and LGiU) and six independent Trustees, including the Chair, the Rt Hon Nick Raynsford MP.

defaultIn 2009 we co-produced statutory guidance, with the Local Government Information Unit, covering sections 19 to 21 of the Police and Justice Act 2009. We received Home Office funding for this work. 
default&#xa0;
default7.
default              
defaultIn September 2010, we made a submission to the Home Office’s consultation on proposals which subsequently formed part of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011. 
defaultIn this submission we recommended that the Government not introduce Police and Crime Commissioners. The response can be found here:

defaultFrom 2011 to 2012 a CfPS staff member sat on a Home Office project board providing advice to civil servants and Ministers on the checks and balances elements of the new policing arrangements (specifically, Police and Crime Panels). 
defaultCfPS received no remuneration for this work. 
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultIn 2011 and 2012, we produced 
defaultthree sets of unofficial guidance for Police and Crime Panels. This work was paid for and published by the Local Government Association. In 2013, we have carried out detailed research for the Local Government Association on the first year of Police and Crime Panels. This was paid for by the Local Government Association. This research has not yet been published. 
default&#xa0;defaultSubmissiondefault&#xa0;
default10.
default              
defaultThis submission focuses on t
defaulthe role of police and crime panels in holding their commissioners to account
default. It is based on as-yet-unpublished research carried out by the Centre for Public Scrutiny over the course of autumn 2013. This involved structured telephone interviews with the support officers for 38 of the 41 Panels outside London, similar interviews with a number of Panel chairs and independent members, and informal discussions with a wider group of Panel members at a series of events held by the Local Government Association in March, July and November 2013. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIntroduction: the role of the Police 
defaultand Crime Panel
default&#xa0;
default11.
default              
defaultThe Act states that
default&#xa0;
default“The functions of the police and crime panel for a police area must be exercised with a view to supporting the effective exercise of the functions of the police and crime commissioner for that police area” (s28)
default&#xa0;
default12.
default              
defaultThe Panel has specific statutory duties which empower it to review and scrutinise:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default13.
default              
defaultThere is also a general statutory power to review and scrutinise the PCC’s decisions. 
default&#xa0;
default14.
default              
defaultStaff supporting Panels, and some Panel members, feel that Panels’ first year can be divided into two phases – a 
defaultfirst phase, typified by a focus on statutory duties, and a second phase, which has seen more proactive work beg
defaulti
defaultn. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMaking a difference on the ground
default&#xa0;
default15
default              
defaultIt is too early to make conclusive judgments about the effectiveness of Police and Crime Panelsdefault. Panels have been operational for one year, but their first few months – typified by a fast pace of work, during a period in which PCCs were also finding their feet – is likely to be atypical of their future activity. The large volume of confirmation hearings in particular is unlikely to be repeated in future. 
default&#xa0;
default16.
default              
defaultOverall, indications for the future are positive. 
defaultSome Panels’ work this year has served, for example, to make substantial improvements to draft Police and Crime Plans. But it is difficult at this stage to point to tangible impacts on the ground, and to assert that specific things would not have happened but 
defaultfor 
defaultPanels’ existence and involvement. The length of the decision and policy-making cycles within which PCCs operate suggest to us that it will be 2015 by the time we are able to reach conclusive judgments on 
defaultpanels’ 
defaultimpact and effectiveness. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHolding to account: statutory duties
default&#xa0;
default17.
default              
defaultFrom November 2012 to April 2013, most Panels’ work focused on 
defaulttheir 
defaultprincipal statutory duties. This was work for which Panels had little time to prepare. PCCs, too, had only a few weeks to develop their Police and Crime Plans and their 2013/14 budgets. 
defaultAs a result, most PCCs’ priorities and budgets closely reflect former police authorities’ plans. 
default&#xa0;
default18.
default              
defaultThe tight timescale for the formal tabling of this information led to the experience of scrutiny of budgets, precepts and plans in early 2013 being rushed and unsatisfactory in many areas. Panels had difficulty getting hold of information in a timely manner, meaning that formal, public scrutiny sessions were not as effective as they might have been. 
defaultFor example, discussions about Police and Crime Plans were extremely general, and budget discussions were in some instances based on little more information than the base figure of the precept itself. Additionally, in a couple of instances, Plans and budgets were not presented together, making it difficult for links to be drawn between these key strategic documents. 
default&#xa0;
default19.
default              
defaultA large number of confirmation hearings added to the pressure of work at this time.
default&#xa0;
defaultHolding to account: proactive work
default&#xa0;
default20.
default              
defaultSince April 2013, more Panels have been turning their mind to proactive work. 
defaultThis work takes the form of:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default21.
default              
defaultThis proactive work is not provided for in legislation. 
defaultWe believe, however, that it will prove necessary for Panels to undertake this work in the future. This is because it will be required to help Panels to understand fully the PCC’s priorities, and without this background information – which can only be gathered by carrying out this kind of proactive work 
default–
default 
defaultit will be difficult for them to carry out their core, statutory duties. 
defaultWhere carried out, 
defaultactivity of this nature 
defaultwill need to be delivered further to a
default work
default programme that 
defaultis carefully prioritised,
default defined by the prioritie
defaults in the Police and Crime Plan. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHolding to account: relationships
default&#xa0;
default22.
default              
defaultRelationships between Panels and PCCs are for the most part constructive, although there have been difficulties in a minority of instances. 
defaultThere have been particular difficulties for a number of Panels in getting hold of information from PCCs – both information about decision-making, and information about operational performance. 
default&#xa0;
default23.
default              
defaultThe review and scrutiny of PCC decisions is one of the Panel’s statutory duties but a number of Panels have found it difficult. This has two principal causes – one sitting with Panels themselves, and the other with PCCs:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default24.
default              
defaultRelationships have proved fractious in areas where disagreements have arisen over the 
defaultscope and nature of Panels’ work. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default25.
default              
defaultDisagreements about the meaning of words in the Act – which coalesce around the two points above – serve to 
defaultperpetuate tortuous, circular and legalistic arguments and what information the PCP is “entitled” to see, and actions it is “entitled” to carry out. 
default&#xa0;
default26.
default              
defaultThese disagreements highlight a more fundamental issue – a lack of understanding 
defaultabout the role and remit of the Panel
default by PCCs, their offices and, in some instances, Panels themselves
default. 
defaultA large number of Panel members are former police authority members, and some of them do not appreciate how their role has changed since November 2012, and that the Panel is not the police authority’s “replacement”. Equally, some PCCs, and their offices, are resistant to the idea of scrutiny by an external body,
default 
defaultresulting in an approach that has seen little information being shared and little willingness to engage to explore how the relationship might work better in the future. 
defaultWhere little information is shared between the PCC and the Panel, it makes the work of the Panel more difficult to carry out, which raises questions locally about the Panel’s effectiveness. This is a vicious cycle that need to be broken to make the arrangements work, but is not by any means a systemic problem affecting all Panels. Indeed, in many areas these problems have either been overcome, or never occurred in the first place. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHolding to account: resourcing
default&#xa0;
default27.
default              
defaultEach Panel has £53,000 of funding from the Home Office to support its Police and Crime Panel. We understand that this was calculated to reflect the average funding required, with on-costs, to appoint a scrutiny officer (a post roughly equivalent to that of a committee specialist on a Commons select committee). 
default&#xa0;
default28.
default              
defaultNotwithstanding this funding, resourcing has proven to be a challenge for many (but not all) Panels. The Home Office assumed that Panels would need to meet only four times a year; over the course of 2012 and 2013, most have met at least seven times and a few as many 
defaultas 
defaulttwelve. This has in part been due to 
defaulta disproportionate number of confirmation hearings in year 1, but also reflects the need for Panels to cover a wide range of issues, and to undertake a workload that allows them to fully engage with PCCs’ work. The consensus amongst Panels is that four meetings per year would not allow them to do this. 
default&#xa0;
default29.
default              
defaultWhere they exist, resource challenges are exacerbated by the fact that the range of skills required to support Panels are wide-ranging, and unlikely to be possessed by a single person. They include legal, finance, HR, policy and research, administrative support and specialist knowledge of community safety issues. 
defaultThis has resulted in expertise being brought in by lead authorities in an ad hoc manner, which has resulted in a number of lead authorities informally expending more than the £53,000 allocated by the Home Office, to ensure that Panels run effectively. We consider that this has placed those authorities at an unreasonabl
defaulte
default disadvantage. 
default&#xa0;
default30.
default              
defaultSome areas have not put in place long-term arrangements for Panel support because of a fear that the Home Office funding will be withdrawn, and that they will be unable to support an additional officer post without those funds. 
default&#xa0;
defaultProposals and suggestions for change
default&#xa0;
default31.
default              
defaultOver the course of our research, and since it has been completed, a number of different proposals have been put to us as to how Panels’ remit and role could be changed, and/or how a new system for policing accountability could be introduced, should a future Government decide to abolish PCCs and Panels altogether. 
defaultWe have also developed some ideas about ways in which improvements could be made within the existing statutory framework.
