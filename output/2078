defaultAppendix 1:  Specific comments on draft Deregulation Bill in order to promote rail devolution to the North of England.defaultThe provisions in the Deregulation Bill that relate to rail devolution are contained within section 
default22 and Schedule 7.  In order to deliver the rail devolution agenda for the North, Local Transport Authorities would need to have the following powers:
default&#xa0;
default1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultto form an accountable corporate body capable of contracting with other authorities, Government and Rail Operators;
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultto provide or procure rail passenger services under the Transport Acts across the geography of the area; and,
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultto
default have the benefit of an exemption order from the Railways Act 1993 franchising provisions whilst retaining various powers and protections enjoyed by the Secretary of State under those provisions.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll authorities currently have the first power.  However, in the metropolitan areas of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear and West Yorkshire, the second power is potentially restricted by the 25 mile limit on the exercise of their PTE’s 
defaultpower to carry or procure the carriage of passengers by rail.  This restriction is anomalous, since LTAs outside metropolitan areas which have no PTE do not have this restriction and can use their general power of competence.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs regards the third power for rail devolution to work practically, it is important that LTAs and PTEs which manage services exempted from the national franchising regime should enjoy the benefits of some of the powers and protections in relation to any operating agreement enjoyed by the Secretary of State in relation to franchised services.  The existing legislation does not allow this.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe provisions of the Deregulation Bill will address these legislative obstacles by giving authorities most of the requisite remaining powers, and is therefore welcomed.  There are some observations to be made however:
default&#xa0;defaultAppendix 2:  Comments of suggested questions default&#xa0;
defaultGeneral default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is our opinion that the changes in powers that we seek cannot be achieved through secondary legislation.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe changes in powers that we seek will provide the most robust underpinning for the operation of the proposed devolved decision-making structures.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultN/a
default.  
default&#xa0;
default4. Does the draft Bill achieve its purpose of reducing the regulatory burden on business, organisations and individuals effectively and fairly? 
default&#xa0;
defaultYes.  Our proposals will lead to better prioritisation of national and local resources into rail service provision.  The legislation removes unnecessary restrictions in the Transport Act 1968 and 
defaultthe  Railways
default Act 1993.  
default&#xa0;
default5. Will the draft Bill generally benefit businesses by offsetting other regulatory burdens?  Are there indirect impacts on other businesses from reducing regulation in specific sectors? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNo significant issues arising.  
default&#xa0;default6. To what extent does the draft Bill benefit consumers as well as businesses? 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe use of the powers the bill contains will enable rail services to be managed closer to the beneficiary, whether that 
defaultbe
default local businesses or rail passengers.  We fully expect this will lead to better services that more closely match their needs.  
default&#xa0;
default7. How does the provision in the draft Bill affect: 
defaulti
default. protections afforded to individuals under human rights and equalities legislation? 
defaultii. 
defaultemployment
default law, skills and the labour market? 
defaultiii. 
defaultthe
default environment, particularly in the management of waste? 
defaultiv. 
defaultthe
default provision of education? 
defaultv
default. the effective administration of justice? 
defaultvi. 
defaultsocial
default, wellbeing or health inequalities? 
default&#xa0;
defaultNo significant impacts. 
default&#xa0;
default8.
default              
defaultHave the measures set out in the draft Bill been subject to adequate cost-benefit analysis on the basis of consultation with those affected? 
default&#xa0;
defaultA proposition and business case for the rail devolution proposals was submitted to the Department of Transport in August 2013.  It is currently under consideration.  It sets out the business case for the proposed changes according to Treasury guidelines on business cases.  
default&#xa0;
default9. 
default              
defaultWill any or all of the proposals have any significant economic or financial impact? Do you have any evidence of the impact that will aid the Committee in their scrutiny? 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe primary aim of our proposals is to achieve better economic outcomes from rail service provision by managing that provision more locally.

default10. 
default              
defaultIs a new “power to 
defaultdisapply
default legislation no longer of practical use” necessary or are there existing procedures which could be used to achieve the same effect?” 
default(Clause 51)?
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have no opinion on this issue. 
default&#xa0;
default11. Is the 
defaultmeaning of the phrase “no longer of practical use” clear
default? In this context, what is meant by “practical”? 
defaultShould it be defined and, if so, how?
default Will removing any of the provision proposed in Schedule 16 of the draft Bill have implications for any other areas of regulation? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have no opinion on this issue.
