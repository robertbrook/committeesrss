[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Plantlife is the organisation that is speaking up for our wild flowers, plants and fungi. From the open spaces of our nature reserves to the corridors of government, we’re here to raise their profile, to celebrate their beauty, and to protect their future. Wild flowers and plants play a fundamental role for wildlife, and their colour and character light up our landscapes. But without our help, this priceless natural heritage is in danger of being lost, with non-native invasive species posing a major threat.  &#xa0;Plantlife welcomes the opportunity to send a written response to the Environmental Audit Committee's inquiry on Invasive Species.&#xa0;Plantlife has produced a publication of 'non-native invasive species to avoid' which includes species not currently on Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act that we believe should be. This was based on the Horizon-scanning for invasive non-native plants in Great Britain report, whether species are currently available on the market, and the nature of how a species spreads in the wild. This publication gives an indication of the plant species Plantlife believes are of most concern and where listing on Schedule 9, or another mechanism, is an appropriate action to take.&#xa0;Plantlife support the UK’s position on removing the cap on the number of species to be included on the EU list, as Plantlife strongly believes the list should represent and address the scale of the environmental issue. Capping the list of IAS at 50 when there are at least 1200 across Europe will not make a strong enough impact on this growing problem and one that is causing significant harm to biodiversity. Plantlife support the Wildlife and Countryside Link position of producing one regularly reviewed species list, composed of two components, which is directly incorporated within the Regulation, albeit ‘empty’ in the first instance. Part One should be composed of species which are alien to the EU as a whole, and for which measures apply to all Member States with no opt out on basic legislative measures (e.g. bans). Part Two should be populated by species which are native within parts of the EU but invasive in other parts. For these latter species, the list should contain an indication of the Member States/regions where the species is non-native, and the Regulation should apply in those areas only. Member States where the species is native can legitimately decide to trade or otherwise use the species, but may need to adopt measures to prevent the species from being transported by human agency elsewhere. &#xa0;Plantlife also support the Wildlife and Countryside Link position that a regional approach would be better achieved through enhanced cooperation between affected Member States through Risk Assessments and a spatially literate action plan.&#xa0;Plantlife's primary concern is to prioritise action on those non-native invasive species having a detrimental impacts on wild plants in Important Plant Areas and so our criteria of highest weighting is biodiversity. Tables 1 and 2 in the Horizon-scanning for invasive non-native plants in Great Britain report include the criteria and weighting used in the risk assessment process. A summary version, Here today, here tomorrow?, can be found on the Plantlife website. Biodiversity, human health and economic considerations are all important criteria however, the weighting of their importance will mainly depend on the nature of a species and the nature of its impacts.&#xa0;Plantlife fully support the precautionary principle approach and submit that it must be enshrined within both national and international legislation. Those who intentionally or recklessly allow known non-native invasive species of concern to become established or invade should contribute to the action necessary to remedy the problem. &#xa0;The balance between the different strands (detection, prevention, containment/adaptation or eradication

[[[)]]] will need a case by case response and will need to be proportionate to the problem. Different species with different traits need different approaches. In addition, whether a species is already present in the country, if it is widespread or in a few locations, or whether it has the potential to arrive will determine which of these strands is the priority for that species. For example, it may be that total eradication should be prioritised for sites of particular conservation / wildlife value such as Important Plant Areas, SSSIs, SAC, SPA, National Parks etc. However, eradication on the national or even regional scale may not be an option. While early detection and prevention into the country is the ideal, both from an environmental and economic perspective, and should be the priority for potentially invasive non native species; it may also be necessary to prioritise the prevention and spread of some species that are already present within the country from getting into another catchment, or into sites of conservation importance. Similarly, some species may only be in a few locations so a national eradication plan can be the priority.&#xa0;Plantlife support the approach of listing the harmful species to tackle as on an EU scale listing safe species would be too complicated when there are many different biogeography regions to consider.&#xa0;In place of trying to identify areas of conflict Plantlife suggest identifying the environmental obligations that would be complimented and achieved through tackling invasive non native species such as the Water Framework Directive, Target 9 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Target 10 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, and  biodiversity duty under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act and the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004.Plantlife fully supports Member States being able to adopt more stringent measures as and when they see fit, and thus support the UK position on that. The EU IAS Regulation should not (and seemingly does not) prohibit Member States from taking further action. Within the UK, the devolved administrations have different legislative approaches to non native invasive species and the GB Invasive Strategy and EU IAS Regulation must continue to allow for flexibility in approach.&#xa0;The introduction and spread of non-native invasive species is directly comparable to that of some plant disease pathways, and those associated with trade are agreed to be best tackled through legislation and regulation.  Trade partners often express the need for a statutory framework against which they can make clear business decisions and which can drive forward the development of new markets.&#xa0;Plantlife believe &#xa0;&#xa0;England and Wales could learn from the Scottish experience with respect to: 8.1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Issuing an order to require specified individuals (whether by type of person or individual identity) to notify the competent authority of the presence of specified invasive non-native species. &#xa0;8.1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Issuing species control orders on the same model as under the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011 should be adopted by a new legal regime. The introduction of statutory backing, such as Species Control Orders, for specific bodies should enable them to take reasonable action to control, contain or eradicate invasive species outside of their native range, including on privately owned land where landowners are not taking adequate action to prevent their spread.8.1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ensuring the precautionary approach to the release of non-native species is adhered to: it is currently illegal only to plant/cause to grow in the wild those invasive non-native plants which are listed on Schedule 9 Part II.&#xa0;13 January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0; http://www.plantlife.org.uk/uploads/documents/PL_Invasive_recommendations_%282%29.pdf http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/40015?category=47020 http://www.plantlife.org.uk/wild_plants/important_plant_areas/ http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/40015?category=47020 http://www.plantlife.org.uk/publications/here_today_here_tomorrow http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/40015?category=47020
