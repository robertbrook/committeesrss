[normal]About ADS[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]ADS is the trade organisation advancing the UK Aerospace, Defence, and Security industries with Farnborough International Limited
[normal] that runs the Farnborough International Airshow,
[normal] a wholly-owned subsidiary. ADS encompasses the British Aviation Group (BAG) and jointly sponsors, with Intellect, UK
[normal] 
[normal]space. ADS is also a member of the Sustainable Aviation coalition of airports, 
[normal]airlines, aerospace
[normal] manufacturers
[normal] and NATS
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ADS
[normal] 
[normal]was formed on 1 October 2009 from the merger of the Society of British Aerospace Companies (SBAC), the Defence Manufacturers Association (DMA) and the Association of Police and Public Security Suppliers (APPSS). ADS comprises around 900 member companies within the industries it represents. Together with its regional partners, ADS represents over 2,600 companies across the UK supply chain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Aviation sector is vital to the UK economy bringing financial benefits to the UK and providing high skilled employment and connections to growing markets. The UK aerospace industry is one of the UK’s few world class manufacturing industries worth over £24bn to the UK of which 75% is exported world-wide. The sector is high value and highly skilled, employing directly and supporting a workforce of around 360,000 plus another 46,000 overseas. As the Prime Minister noted UK aerospace is “
[normal]a powerhouse in the UK economy”. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ADS welcomes the opportunity 
[normal]to respond to the consultation from
[normal] the House of Commons
[normal] Science and Technology Select Committee
[normal].  Representing the aerospace supply chain, the ADS submission focuses 
[normal]on how aerospace manufacturers can contribute to the public’s understanding of climate change.

[normal]It is important that Government Departments utili
[normal]s
[normal]e the knowledge and expertise of 
[normal]scientific
[normal] advisors. 
[normal]Impartial a
[normal]dvisors 
[normal]can better help inform the public discourse on climate change.
[normal] ADS 
[normal]welcomed

[normal]cientific 
[normal]A
[normal]dviser HM
[normal] Treasury
[normal] in June 2011
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] the
[normal] i
[normal]ncreasing community of scientific advisers
[normal] in Whitehall departments
[normal] has been well received by industry. 
[normal]These appointments allow
[normal] 
[normal]longer-term strategic thinki
[normal]ng with regard to science
[normal] and engineering investment and
[normal] 
[normal]ensure
[normal] that 
[normal]expert scientific advice is available 
[normal]within departments and across government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]ndustry 
[normal]takes its environmental responsibilities seriously
[normal] and
[normal] over recent 
[normal]years,
[normal] huge technological
[normal] strides
[normal] have been
[normal] made 
[normal]to reduce emissions. 
[normal]As a result
[normal] of continuous technological advancement
[normal], a
[normal]n aircraft today produces 70% less carbon dioxide compared to its equivalent from 50 years ago and 75% less noise tha
[normal]n
[normal] its equivalent from 30 years ago. The new Airbus A380 burns 17% less fuel per seat and produces around 10% less NOx than the previous largest aircraft model, whilst creating only about a quarter of the noise on arrival. Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner is 20% more fuel efficient than other 
[normal]aero
[normal]planes of similar size 
[normal]partly as a result of
[normal] being made from light carbon composite materials and having world-class Rolls-Royce engines.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With technological innovation playing such a crucial role in enhancing environmental efficiency,
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]t is important industry has a voice within
[normal] public discourse on climate change
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Many companies in the aerospace industry facilitate or are involved in 
[normal]events and initiatives 
[normal]that inform the
[normal] public 
[normal]of 
[normal]the new technologies and efficiencies that are reducing the environmental impact of flying.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is still more that the aerospace industry (in cooperation with Government) 
[normal]can do to 
[normal]communicate with the public
[normal] 
[normal]so the discourse surrounding climate change is well informed
[normal].
[normal] The industry is not complacent and always looks at ways to 
[normal]inform
[normal] the public 
[normal]of
[normal] its
[normal] efforts to reduce the environmental impact of its activity and the many scientific advancements within aviation.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]How could public understanding of what is meant by climate change be improved? What are the main barriers to this? Does the media have a positive role to play?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is important that the public understanding of the factors affecting
[normal] climate change 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]informed by scient
[normal]ific evidence
[normal];
[normal] and 
[normal]that Government 
[normal]policy
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] targeted
[normal] to 
[normal]ensure 
[normal]maximum
[normal] environmental
[normal] 
[normal]benefits 
[normal]with 
[normal]the 
[normal]minimum
[normal] impact 
[normal]on 
[normal]business
[normal] competitiveness
[normal]. S
[normal]tudies have demonstrated that the public understanding of the 
[normal]environmental impact 
[normal]of 
[normal]aerospace
[normal] 
[normal]does
[normal] not reflect reality
[normal]. The graph below 
[normal]using information 
[normal]from the 
[normal]DfT’s report on “Public attitudes to climate change and the impact of transport” and the 
[normal]National Air Emissions Inventory, give
[normal]s evidence of this point, through
[normal] a comparison between the real share of transport emissions and the perceived share.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]NB total transport emissions (100% in the chart below) represent only 27% of the UK total in 2007.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 2007 comparison, taken even before the introduction of fuel efficient Long Range Aircraft such as the A380 that are dram
[normal]a
[normal]tically reducing fuel consumption per passenger mile
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]highlights each mode of transport’s share of emissions in reality and what the public perceive them to be. The largest divergence is in relation to air travel where the public perceive emissions to be higher than evidence would suggest. 
[normal]The graph notes that 
[normal]the public perceived that flights accounted for 40% of total transport 
[normal]emissions
[normal] 
[normal]whereas
[normal] in r
[normal]eality it was almost half this amount.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is clear from 
[normal]the above 
[normal]graph that more can be done to inform the public understanding of 
[normal]the 
[normal]factors affecting climate change.
[normal] The government, industry and media 
[normal]all have a role in 
[normal]influenc
[normal]ing
[normal] this understanding. Industry is working to improve public knowledge of climate change issues
[normal] with events such as Future Days at Farnborough Airshow
[normal],
[normal] but also with joint industry initiatives
[normal]. Sustainable Aviation
[normal] (SA)
[normal], for example is a proactive group of 
[normal]UK 
[normal]airlines, airports, engine and airframe manufacturers and 
[normal]NATS,
[normal] established specifically to address sustainability issues. Through studies such as the CO
[normal]2
[normal] Road-Map, 
[normal]SA
[normal] outlines an expert
[normal] industry and scientific
[normal] insight on how UK aviation can 
[normal]promote cleaner, 
[normal]quieter
[normal], smarter flying
[normal]. The group not only addresses carbon emissions but other areas of importance to the public such as noise
[normal], sustainable fuels
[normal] and waste
[normal] reduction
[normal], etc
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The media has the potential to play a positive role
[normal] providing access to i
[normal]nformed data and information
[normal], 
[normal]as well as 
[normal]highlighting and raising
[normal] climate change
[normal] concerns in the public consciences
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It can also help
[normal] inform the public of 
[normal]technological and operational improvements within industry that are reducing 
[normal]the
[normal] environmental footprint
[normal] of aviation
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How important is public understanding in developing effective climate change[bold] policy[bold]?[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A recent report by Frontier Economics prepared for Heathrow
[normal] noted that companies do 20 times the amount of business with countries connected by air, than those who are not. Supporting aviation will benefit the wider economy.  Ineffective climate change policy can result in hindering the aviation industry, general business
[normal] and 
[normal]international competitive
[normal]ness
[normal]. Taxation such as the Air Passenger Duty has resulted in the UK ranking 134th out of 138 countries
[normal] 
[normal]in terms of competitive aviation
[normal] by the World Economic Forum. This
[normal] damages the industry and the UK as a place to do business.
[normal] In a report published by PWC in February 2013 abolishing APD would boost UK GDP, create jobs, benefit consumers, tourists and business, and potentially pay for itself
[normal].  For these reasons it is crucial that climate change policy is effective and does not hinder the UK economy. 
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The public’s understanding of climate change, particularly 
[normal]channelled
[normal] through environmental pressure groups undoubtedly has an effect 
[normal]on
[normal] the formulation of climate change policies. Good public understanding of the aerospace industry and how key technologies are reducing environmental impact of flying are important to influence views on the necessary climate change policies.
[normal] As highlighted above,
[normal] 
[normal]p
[normal]oorly targeted environmental policy risk
[normal]s
[normal] the UK’s global competitiveness in the aerospace industry and the economy more widely.
[normal] They also have the potential to divert funds away from industry hindering the ability to invest in innovative new technologies.
[normal] It is therefore important that public knowledge of the factors affecting climate change is well informed. 
[normal]4[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Does the Government have sufficient expertise in social and behavioural [bold]sciences[bold] to understand the relationship between public understanding of climate science and the feasibility of relevant public policy policies?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The public’s perception of environmental changes is complex and as a result 
[normal]can
[normal]not always translate into clear and feasible public policies. Although concerning noise, rather than climate change issues, the 
[normal]imminent
[normal] Noise Road Map 
[normal]commissioned by Sustainable Aviation, gives evidence to this point
[normal].
[normal] It states that
[normal] 
[normal]d
[normal]espite the reduction in aircraft noise achieved by the industry over the last half century, 
[normal]‘
[normal]perceptions of noise by local communities have not always improved in line with these improvements’. There are a number of variables to be considered and behaviour is not easily predicted
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The difficulty in 
[normal]interpreting
[normal] the 
[normal]public understanding
[normal] of aviation and climate change is equally as difficult. As outlined earlier, perception does not match reality and opinions and actions a
[normal]re
[normal] often
[normal] complex and unexpected.
[normal] 
[normal]Evidence of this
[normal] point
[normal] can be seen in 
[normal]the 2011 Office
[normal] of National Statistics Opi
[normal]nion Survey.
[normal] 
[normal]Respondents
[normal] were asked whether they supported increased taxes/other charges to encourage reduction in air travel. Over half (54%) did not support this notion with only 19% supporting that premise. Even among those who classed themselves as very concerned about climate change there was net opposition to this measure
[normal]. 
[normal]The public, wh
[normal]o are often worried 
[normal]about 
[normal]the impact of climate change
[normal], are 
[normal]frequently
[normal] not supporting of 
[normal]certain environmental 
[normal]policies
[normal]. It is a complex arrange
[normal]ment, Government must be aware
[normal] of this when developing relevant public policy policies
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To aid public understanding on climate change, government messages should be consistent
[normal]. Mixed messages enhance the complexity of the public perception of environmental issues. These mixed messages appear when industry is supported, while at the same time penalised. 
[normal]The Air Passenger Duty is a clear example of this. 
[normal]While the government outwardly supports the 
[normal]aviation
[normal] industry and encourages innovation, they continue to increase the Air Passenger Tax
[normal] 
[normal]beyond
[normal] any rising environmental impact of flying. This exacerbates negative perception towards the industry and
[normal] reduces the 
[normal]amount of money
[normal] available to reinvest in 
[normal]the new, more fuel efficient, types being developed through fleet replacement
[normal].
[normal] It is crucial Government has a clear position 
[normal]in order not to create confusion amongst the public
[normal] and wrongly influence opinions and behaviour
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Can lessons about public engagement with climate change policy be learned from other countries?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]cting internationally and learning from successful and unsuccessful policy from other countries is crucial when addressing issues domestically. “Going it alone” risks international competitiveness and 
[normal]will put
[normal] the UK at an economic disadvantage. 
[normal]In addition
[normal], effective climate change policy is enhanced greatly from the involvement of international partners. Aviation operates in a global market and as such, needs global solutions to avoid market distortions that would prejudice UK industry. 
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Acting internationally enhances en
[normal]vironmental performance, and has
[normal] a much greater impact 
[normal]than domestic
[normal] 
[normal]initiative
[normal].
[normal] For example,
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]n the case of aircraft and aero-engine design, standards set at the international level have significantly enhanced environmental performance. The UK Government’s role in the negotiation and development of these at the International Civi
[normal]l Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has been
[normal] fundamental in ensuring that UK industry is not disadvantaged by other nation’
[normal]s interests. T
[normal]he aircraft CO2 certification scheme under development at ICAO and supported by industry gives a key indication of the importance of environmental action on an international level.
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Learning from the lead taken by other countries is important when formulating effective environmental policy
[normal].
[normal] In the case of Air Passenger Duty, 
[normal]other European countries, acted
[normal] quickly when it was realised the tax was having a negative impact on the
[normal]ir respective economies
[normal]. 
[normal]The Netherlands
[normal],
[normal] Denmark and 
[normal]Eire 
[normal]have all reversed equivalent taxes in recent years, while the Irish government has reduced it significantly. The UK government
[normal] has already
[normal] recognised the negative impact A
[normal]ir 
[normal]P
[normal]assenger 
[normal]D
[normal]uty had
[normal] in Northern Ireland and 
[normal]has 
[normal]reduced it 
[normal]there 
[normal]in order to compete
[normal] with flights from the Irish 
[normal]R
[normal]epublic
[normal]. Climate Change policies must support environmental goals 
[normal]effectively
[normal], not hinder the economy
[normal] or industry.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Conclusion[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The UK Aerospace industry sector is a successful, high value, high technology engineering, manufacturing and service industry that 
[normal]generate
[normal] significant returns to all its stakeholders. UK Aerospace is investing in new technologies to reduce its environmental impact whilst working with Government to secure the future of the industry. The industry does work to communicate its activities in reducing its environmental impact, but is not complacent and 
[normal]is ready to 
[normal]do more. 
[normal] 
[normal]ADS
[normal], and its members,
[normal] 
[normal]would be pleased 
[normal]to work with Government to enhance public knowledge of climate change
[normal].
