"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from BALPA (SRN 034)&#xa0;About BALPA&#xa0;\n1. Over 80% of the UK’s commercial pilots are members of BALPA and we are\n \nrecognised as the main partner in 26 airlines covering all major UK operations. In\n \naddition over 1,000 commercial pilots have joined us even though their airline has\n \nno partnership agreement with BALPA and this includes a swath of Ryanair pilots.\n&#xa0;\n2. BALPA was formed in 1937 following the antics of the CEO of Imperial Airways who\n \nwas for\ncing professional pilots to operate when it was not, in the professional\n \njudgment of those pilots, safe to do so. This led to the Cadman report. Those origins\n \nremain a key feature of our DNA today and which is why our vision as an association\n \nis still “to \nmake every flight a safe \nflight”\n. It is also perhaps why a recent public poll\n \nby YouGov found that airline pilots belonged to one of the most trusted professions.\nIt is a responsibility we take seriously.\nBALPA’s position&#xa0;\n3. Although the Committee’s frame\n of reference is the impact of the adverse weather\n \non all transport sectors BALPA’\ns\n response will be with regard to air travel.\n&#xa0;\n4. Any discussion around adverse weather operations needs to start from the stand\n \npoint of making sure that any operation is sa\nfe. However, we believe it is possible to\n \nrun a safe, economically-viable winter operation out of UK airports, as it is\n \nelsewhere in Europe and around the world. Pilots’ experiences and advice should\n \nform part of the discussion about how to make sure\n recen\nt, poor experiences do\n not\n \nhappen again and how to ensure that winter operations are safe.\n&#xa0;\n5. Pilots are a valuable resource for regulators, the industry and government \n–\n a\n \nresource we believe is not sufficiently well used.\n&#xa0;\nRemote vs on-stand de-icing&#xa0;\n6\n. During cold weather and at times of snow, aircraft must be de-iced to ensure wings\n \nare not contaminated with ice and snow. They then need to have an anti-icing layer applied to ensure no\n \nprecipitation sticks to the now ice free surfaces.\n \nContamination of\n aircraft wings and other\n \nsurfaces degrades lift and has in the past been the cause of serious\n, including\n fatal\n,\n accidents.\n \nDe-\nicing and anti-icing of aircraft is carried out by spraying a\n glycol solution \nacross\n \nthe wings, tail and fin of the aircraft, and\n the fuselage too if snow has accumulated\n \nthere.\n27. The severity of the weather and volume of precipitation (rain, snow, freezing fog,\n \netc.) affects the ‘holdover’ time. Holdover time is the maximum time between\n \nthe start of the anti-icing process and th\ne start of the take-off roll. In\n \nweather suc\nh as that experienced during recent\n winte\nrs\n holdover time can be less than\n \n20 minutes in some circumstances. Note that holdover time begins when the glycol\n \napplication starts, not when it ends.\n This is why it is \nimportant to perform the de/anti icing operation as close to the take-off runway as possible.\n&#xa0;\n8. De-icing can take place either on-stand or (as is the case in many overseas airports)\n \nremotely at special de-icing areas, usually close to the end of the \nrunway. UK\n \nairports \nprimarily \nemploy on-stand de-icing and do not have the facilit\ny for\n de-icing\n close to the take-off point\n.\n \nBALPA believes that on-stand de-icing procedures \nhave \ncontributed significantly to the\n problems experienced in previous winters\n.\n&#xa0;\n9. On-stand de-icing, which may take 30 minutes or more, blocks up parking stands, so arriving aircraft cannot off-load their pa\nssengers. At Heathrow during recent winters\n, aircraft were landing and then waiting on the taxiways, with passengers and cargo s\ntill on board, for periods of four hours or more. This is not acceptable.\n&#xa0;\n10. Many more de-icing rigs are required to run an on-stand de-icing operation, because the de-icing rigs have to drive around the airport. Compare this to a remote de-icing facilit\ny where the entire de-icing operation can be carried out by a small number of static de-icing vehicles.\n&#xa0;\n11. With on-stand de-icing, the mobile de-icing rig operation has to be rigidly controlled. Rather than remaining static and waiting for aircraft to co\nme to them for de-icing, the rigs have to be directed by radio to drive around the airport, from stand to stand, to get to the next aircraft to de-ice which can result in long waits.\n&#xa0;\n1\n2\n. De-icing rigs have to keep returning to their base to fill up with f\nluid. Time spent\n \ndriving back and forth is time spent not de-icing aircraft.\n&#xa0;\n1\n3\n. Correct timing of on-stand de-icing is difficult. Ideally the de-icer should be ready\n \nto start the procedure exactly 20 minutes before the flight’s Air Traffic Control slot\n \nt\no maximise holdover time. If this calculation is wrong there is a possibility of\n \nmissing the slot and of holdover time expiry.\n&#xa0;\n14. On-stand de-icing causes the apron (parking stand) to be awash with fluid\n \noverspray. We are extremely concerned about the he\nalth and safety implications of\n \ncreating hazardous conditions \nfor ramp staff and pilots. Aprons should be cleared\n \nand gritted, not swimming in d\ne-icing fluid. (See paragraph 18\n below.)\n&#xa0;\n1\n5\n. After de-icing, aircraft have to push back, start engines, and tax\ni out to the runway.\n \nIf holdover time expires, and snow is accumulating on the aircraft, it must be \nde-iced\n \nall over again. On-stand de-icing significantly increases the likelihood of\n \naircraft having to return to stand for repeat de-icing because of holdov\ner time\n \nexpiry, compared to a remote de-icing operation which takes place close to the\n \nrunway.\n&#xa0;\n1\n6\n. On-stand de-icing wastes de-icing fluid as the rigs have to spray excess quantities of\n \nfluid, and with a far more concentrated mix, in order to maximise hol\nd-over time.\n \nExcess fluid cannot easily be captured and recycled with on-stand de-icing. Remote\n \nde-icing facilities can have in-built sumps for capturing, filtering and reclaiming\n \nover-sprayed fluid. On-stand de-icing, therefore, in comparison to remote \nfacilities,\n \ndamages the environment and wastes resources.\n&#xa0;\n1\n7\n. Most airports with colder climates, such as those in Scandinavia, have remote \nde-icing\n \nfacilities, where winter operations are usually harsher for longer than in the\n \nUK. However, even Madrid-Ba\nrajas Airport in Spain, which has higher average\n \ntemperatures than London, maintains remote de-icing facilities. It is fair to say that\n \nremote de-icing facilities are the norm at busy overseas airports, including those\n \nwith significantly warmer winter weat\nher than the UK.\n&#xa0;\n18. We are also concerned about personal safety on the ramp. Our interest has been\n \nespecially driven by two very serious injuries which occurred to pilots whilst\n \ncarrying out pre-flight departure walk-rounds (aircraft external inspections\n). Both\n \noccurred during winter operations, after de-icing procedures on stand had been\n \nunder way for a few days. Both incidents led to broken bones, hospitalisation and\n \nlong recuperation periods after surgery, following slips on surfaces\n.\n&#xa0;\nWider infrastructure problems&#xa0;\n19. The Committee will be looking at the impact of adverse weather across all\n \ntransport sectors. This is vital because the ability of a UK airport to operate during\n \nadverse weather is impacted upon by the ability of staff to get to the \nairport.\n&#xa0;\n20. More attention must be paid to staff access to and around the airport as well as on\n \nthe runways and taxiways. This includes making sure landside and airside roads\n \nand staff car parks are kept clear so that staff and operational equipment can \nmove\n \naround the airport with reasonable safety.\n&#xa0;\nComparisons with other countries’ airport operations&#xa0;\n21. Chicago’s O'Hare Airport has 440 staff, 400,000 gallons of de-icer, 21,000 tons of\n \nsalt and nearly 200 pieces of snow removal equipment for car parks\n and public\n \nroadways. In a crisis they can call on up to 600 drivers and almost 163 pieces of\n \nsnow equipment to clear the gate, ramp and cargo areas.\n&#xa0;\n22. Charles de Gaulle, France’s biggest airport, spent £24 million on their snowclearing\n \nequipment. 74 ma\nchines, including snowploughs, snow-blowers and de-icers,\n \nand plans to further increase their budget. Paris’ climate is comparable to\n \nLondon’s.\n&#xa0;\n2\n3\n. Stockholm’s Arlanda airport has never closed and boasts the world’s fastest\n \nsnow-clearing team and a fleet \nof 17 Plough, Sweep and Blow (PSB) machines\n \ndesigned by Volvo. Nine machines are driven alongside each other, clearing the\n \nrunways in less than ten minutes.\n&#xa0;\n2\n4\n. UK airports need to effectively compete especially against European hubs for\n \ntraffic. This is \nnot just about making travelling easier for the British public, as\n \nimportant as that is, it is also about ensuring that passengers do not make a conscious effort to avoid UK airports in favour of those in the rest of Europe to make\n \nconnections.\n&#xa0;\nConclusions&#xa0;\n2\n5\n. Pilots want to be able to operate during adverse weather conditions, but must do so\n \nsafely. We believe this must be just as possible in the UK as it is at overseas airports.\n \n&#xa0;\n2\n6\n. De-icing procedures are just one of the many areas that must be cover\ned in a\n \npilot’s preparations for take-off. The additional pressure of arranging for the\n \ncorrect level of de-icing at the correct time, being conscious of holdover times and\n \nthe commercial pressure to make the flight’s ATC slot, all add to a pilot’s workloa\nd\n \nand stress levels. Added to this we have the additional effects of pilot fatigue,\n \nwhich will be made much worse under the recently accepted proposals from EASA.\n \nWe believe remote de-icing facilities provide for a much less stressful operation for\n \npilots \nwhich in turn contributes to the safe operation of an aircraft.\n&#xa0;\n27. Remote de-icing areas should be constructed at all busy UK airports. Heathrow and\n \nGatwick in particular must be provided with such facilities if \nwe are not to see a repeat of previous dis\nastrous experiences.\n&#xa0;\n28. The infrastructure has to be put into place to ensure all staff have access to and\n \naround the airport in order to ensure a winter operation can be successfully\n \nmounted.\n&#xa0;\n29. Pilots have been pointing out the deficiencies in UK air\nport infrastructure for many\n \nyears. We are only too aware of the gaps in the UK operation, because we fly all\n \nover the world, and see at first-hand how things are achieved elsewhere\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n30. Now is the time to act. BALPA offers its overwhelming support to \nensuring a safer\n \nand a more efficient UK Commercial Aviation winter operation and would gladly\n \nmake our Flight Safety experts available if further information or support is needed\n \nto achieve this.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n4\n&#xa0;\n"
