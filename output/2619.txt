Subsequently (extracted below) it is explained that Muslims should kill an apostate. It is further explained in the last screen shot that Ahmadi Muslims referred to as Qadianis are the third type of disbelievers and they should also be killed. &#xa0;b.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; http://www.paklinks.com/gs/all-views/405097-qadiani-ahmadi-population-in-pakistan-globally.htmlThis is an example of a blogging site where it shows that it is now widely known among online users that Ahmadi Muslims should be killed.&#xa0;c.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; http://irshad.org/exposed/fatwas/edesai.php and http://irshad.org/brochures/message.phpInciting hatred and calling for a social boycott of Ahmadi Muslims&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;a.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; http://www.channel4.com/news/hate-crime-investigation-into-threats-against-ahmadi-muslims&#xa0;This news report by Channel 4 illustrates the use of posters explaining how the businesses of Ahmadi Muslims should be boycotted and one example of a member of the Community being dismissed from employment due to his religion. There is also mention of online videos on YouTube which also call for Ahmadi Muslims to be boycotted. Leaflets which are readily available online are also shown posted on shop windows.&#xa0;b.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; http://www.khatmenubuwwat.org/media/File/leaflets/mta_tv_eng.pdfThis link shows posters in shop windows calling for Muslims to be aware of Qadianis (Ahmadi Muslims). The poster displayed on that shop is readily available on the internet. The poster states: “This notice is to serve warning that we should all be aware of the transgression by the Qadiyanis and not fall into their trap”. It further calls on readers to make more copies of this poster and distribute it. The hate campaign leaflet was also reported in local news:&#xa0;c.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/8451668.Relgious_hate_leaflets_found_in_Tooting__Streatham_and_Kingston/?ref=arhttp://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/wimbledonnews/8451429.Hate_campaign_discovered_against_Islamic_minority/  The above news report shows how leaflets have been posted in shops calling for the boycott of Ahmadi Muslim businesses. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;a.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb167/&#xa0;b.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb222/obb222.pdf&#xa0;
