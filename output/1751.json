"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Kirkby \nThore\n Parish Council (TIC 080)\n&#xa0;\nKirkby \nThore\n is a small rural community situated in Eden valley in the east of Cumbria.\n&#xa0;\n The village is situated just off the main A66 trunk road approx 10 miles from Penrith\n and 5 miles from Appleby in Westmorland.\n&#xa0;\n The community is made up of approximately 350 dwellings, 60 of which are designated as social housing.\n&#xa0;\n The village has a small shop and post office.\n&#xa0;\n There is little local employment to which people would not hav\ne to use some form of transport.\n&#xa0;\nThe village is served by the 563 bus service which operates between Kirkby Stephen and Penrith.\n&#xa0;\n The route has 10 services in each direction during the week.\n&#xa0;\n The service generally stops at the bus stop situated on the A6\n6 which is at least 1 mile from the vast majority of properties.\n&#xa0;\n There are 4 services (2 in each direction) that call in to the village itself.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nKirkby Thore Parish Council successful campaigned to increase the number of services calling into the villa\nge from 2 to 4 in 2012.\n&#xa0;\n Although the Parish Council initially underwrote the cost of these extra services their popularity has deemed them to be self financing.\n&#xa0;\nThe Parish Council believes that the key to rural transport is the improvement of bus servic\nes and that to deliver transport\n&#xa0;\nimprovements a number of issues and authorities will need to work together.\n&#xa0;\n This is something that the Parish Council is actively trying to achieve. \n&#xa0;\nThe Parish Council is still campaigning for more bus services to call \nin to the village and believes if a number of agencies worked together it would benefit the community as a whole.\n&#xa0;\n If more buses (Cumbria County Council) called into the village less people would need to cross the busy A66, near to a difficult junction wit\nh poor visibility, to get to the bus shelter (Highways Agency).\n&#xa0;\n If the all the bus services called in to the village and none stopped on the A66 the bus shelter and layby could be used as part of a junction improvement (Highways Agency).\n&#xa0;\n If more bus serv\nices called into the village more people would be able to access employment (Reduction in Benefits).\n&#xa0;\n If more bus services called in to the village the housing association would find it easier to fill properties being vacated as a result of the bedroom tax\n. (Eden Housing Association).\n&#xa0;\nIn addition the Eden Local Development Plan has identified sites within the Parish where a potential 152 additional properties could be built - a 43% increase in the size of the village.\n&#xa0;\n This Plan however does not detail an\ny additional services or improvements that the community could expect if such an increase should occur.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Parish Council hopes that the example and issues described above relating to Kirkby Thore will help demonstrate that the issues rural communitie\ns face are complex and many; with transport being at the centre of achieving many other benefits, however,\n&#xa0;\naddressing issues in isolation will not deliver the results rural communities need to survive.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
