[normal] Consultation response, Annex F, paragraph 4.8.
[normal] See paragraph 214 of the consultation response.
[normal] Judicial review will remain possible, in prisoner cases, although there are serious doubts around how those will arise if solicitors are not able to act at the earlier stages, or are no longer doing prison work as a result of the 17.5.% rate cut.
[normal] Parole
[normal] Board 
[normal]Annual Report and Accounts 
[normal]2011/12.
[normal] Based on the assumption that all lifers would be in the cheapest accommodation (open conditions), which costs £25,106 a year (see 
[normal]Costs per place and costs per prisoner 
[normal](MOJ Oct 2012)), and IPPs would be either 
[normal]in open or in Cat C. It may be said that a three month delay overstates it. The present author’s experience is that it is conservative, but more importantly, this figure has been seen and agreed by the Parole Board. At the same time, this figure gives no a
[normal]ccount of young and elderly prisoners, who may be delayed longer, and whose incarceration is much more expensive (a place for a child in a secure training establishment, for example, costs up to £215,000 a year. A Young Offender Institution place is £60,00
[normal]0 a year. There are at least 1,000 children in prison at any one time). Nor does the figure take account a further Parole Board concern, which is that it needs specialist solicitors to persuade prisoners not to make applications for parole when such applic
[normal]ations are bound to fail. Factoring in these figures would drive the £3.45m figure up, perhaps significantly. 
[normal] MOJ figures, ibid. 
[normal] Annex B to the consultation response, paragraph 10. 
[normal] Which also undermines years of progress on promoting alternatives 
[normal]to litigation.

[normal]Judicial Review – proposals for further reform, 
[normal]paragraph 119.
[normal] See the impact assessment accompanying the 
[normal]Transforming Legal Aid 
[normal]paper. 
[normal] Ibid, §31. 
[normal] Which means there is a success rate, on issued cases, of over 50%. 
[normal] Again, it is l
[normal]ikely that these are particularly susceptible to a change in incentives. Social welfare and education cases tend to settle early because they concern failures to assess and provide services and compromise can usually be found. At the moment, therefore, ver
[normal]y few of these cases fight.  
[normal] As the consultation paper accepts: §3.76.
