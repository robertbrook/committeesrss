defaultExecutive Summarydefault&#xa0;
default1. 
default              
defaultNational Parks England (NPE) brings together the ten National Park Authorities across the country that work with farmers to ensure a high quality environment and produce.  We welcome the Efra Select Committee inquiry and have been active participants in workshops and groups that Defra have convened on CAP reform.  Our evidence is based on 
defaultour understanding of the proposals at the current time.
default  We expect a consultation from Government soon.
default&#xa0;
default2. 
default              
defaultTraditional farming systems have created the National Park landscapes that millions cherish and enjoy; it is essential that the next Rural Development Programme provides practical support to sustain those farming systems and the public benefits they generate.
default&#xa0;
default3. 
default              
defaultWe support maximum voluntary modulation from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 with the specific aim of ensuring maximum funding to support delivery of public benefits in our most important landscapes.
default&#xa0;
default4. 
default              
defaultAccepting that there will be less money in the next Rural Development Programme 
defaultNPE is
default concerned to ensure that the key role of protected landscapes is recognised in the targeting of the new environmental land management schemes and funding for competitiveness and wider rural development. Targeting should be on the basis of maximising delivery of environmental outcomes.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultWe would like to see more detail on how the Government proposes to honour the commitment in 
defaultthe
default coalition agreement 
default(and referred again by the Secretary of State in a recent conference) 
defaultto introduce a system of extra support for hill farmers.  The proposal to ‘move money up the hill’ is to be welcomed if there is no net reduction in the farm business income for hill farmers. 
default&#xa0;
default6.  
default              
defaultIt is important 
defaultthat 
defaultthe next set of agri-environment schemes are focused on delivering multiple environmental benefits
default;
default with options that allow for delivery of landscape, biodiversity, carbon and water management, 
defaultpeatland restoration, 
defaulthistoric environment, access and education objectives
default;
default whilst also facilitating the production of high quality food through sustainable farming systems. 
default 
defaultWe would also like to see a move towards outcome based agreements with less focus on what some have described as ‘management by prescription’.
default&#xa0;
default7.
default              
defaultWhilst 
defaultNPE 
defaultsupport
defaults
default the aim of digital delivery or ‘digital by default’ it is important that there are other options 
defaultavailable 
defaultas broadband connection speeds vary across rural areas and there is a risk that this aim could increase costs for farm businesses by forcing them to use agents.
default&#xa0;
default8. 
default              
defaultWe would like to see greater integration across the six priorities of the Rural Development regulation and believe that National Park Authorities are well placed to work with local partners as delivery agents for such an approach – perhaps by delivering a single pot approach to rural development.
default&#xa0;
default9. 
default              
defaultIt is important that conservation bodies /organisations/land owners
default who are actively managing land for conservation benefit 
defaultare recognised as active farmers
default.
default&#xa0;
default10. 
default              
defaultWe have potential concerns about the implications of increasing the minimum holding size for direct payments as this could have a particular impact in National Parks where there are a lot of smaller holdings
default.
default&#xa0;
default11. 
default              
defaultWe support the basic greening measures with a certification scheme 
defaultin order that 
defaultkey additional options can be included.

default&#xa0;
default12. 
default              
defaultNPE 
defaultwould like to see as level playing field as possible across Europe with minimum changes so that the farming industry finds the transition as straight forward as possible
default.  Generally we would support an 
defaultapproach to implementation
default that 
defaultwork

defaultwith the industry
default, that 
defaultensur
defaultes
default there are no surprises
default,
default and that the new schemes are interrelated 
defaultand 
defaultjoined up.
default  In order to achieve a wider range of public benefits without distorting the market, we believe it is also important to avoid coupled payments being introduced across Member States.  Were this to happen it would represent a significant change away from the direction of travel over the last seven years within the UK.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default              
defaultIn terms of 
defaultCAP delivery arrangements
default default– improved connectivity in protected landscapes will be vital if a single on
default-
defaultline process is to work from 2015.  Provision for agents and some form of support if farmers and land managers cannot use 
defaultan 
defaultonline interface 
default(because of poor broadband provision) 
defaultwill be essential.  
defaultNPE would welcome greater clarity from Government on 
defaultwhat the proposed assisted digital service will involve
default.  Will this, for example, 
defaultjust 
defaultbe 
defaulta helpline or
default include
default one to one support?
default&#xa0;
default14. 
default              
defaultThe Defra (Aug 2013): 
defaultCAP Reform in England Status report on Direct Payments
default 
defaultsets out the Government’s current view on Severely Disadvantaged Areas.  This states, 
default‘Ministers’ initial view is that hill farming plays a crucial role in maintaining the social, environmental and economic fabric of
default the 
defaultuplands. It also has the potential to deliver ecosystems services. For these reasons, hill farming should be compensated by some movement of basic payments ‘uphill’ from the lowland region to the SDA and moorland regions’
default (para 6.2-6.3)
default.
default  National Parks England strongly agrees t
defaulthat the 
default3 current English regions (non S
defaultDA, SDA
default non moorland
default &amp; SDA 
defaultm
defaultoorland) should be kept and that the payments for SDA 
defaultnon
default moorland should be increased in order to recognise these areas of natural constraint and the social and public goods which these areas deliver
default.  This is also necessary to
default ensure that the loss of UELS is not detrimental to the sustainability of upland farms.
default&#xa0;
defaultDirect Payments System
default&#xa0;
default15. 
default              
defaultOverall, we welcome the fact that 
defaultcross compliance applies to all land whether payments are claimed or not.
default  NPE is concerned to ensure that further thought is given to the potentially detrimental impact on National Park landscapes from the proposal to exclude holdings of less than 5ha from direct payments.  Annex I to our evidence provides 
defaultinformation on the size of land holdings within National Parks.  This illustrates that 
default40% of 
defaultholdings within National Parks are less than 
default5 ha.  Defra’s assessment of the area of land 
defaultthat
default would be removed from cross compliance in England is 1%
default.  I
defaultt would be helpful if Defra could assess the 
defaultpercentage
default for the English N
defaultational Parks 
defaultby comparison.
default  One example of potential 
defaultdetrimental impact is the P
defaulteak District National Park’s 
defaultSouth West Peak.  This area consists of numerous small part time holdings which in themselves may not be significant but collectively give the area its character and provide opportunities to engage farmers and land managers to address the decline in wader populations at a landscape scale.
default 
default We recognise that Defra is looking at this issue and look forward to further information becoming available on the potential impact
default&#xa0;
default16. 
default              
defaultThere are a variety of ways in which this potential problem could be addressed.  For example, the minimum area could be kept 
default1 ha 
defaultwith 
defaultadditional payments for the 1
defaultst
default x ha of land claimed on.
default  This would seem preferable and a less 
defaultbureaucratic way of supporting small farmers
default, 
defaultwho are not able to gain the benefits of economies of scale
default 
defaultparticularly in the uplands
default.  An alternative would be to consider a small farmer scheme.  We understand Ministers are not minded to adopt such a scheme, and whilst we recognise that many feel this to be a complex mechanism for supporting farmers on smaller holdings, we would not wish to see this removed as an option until the full impact of any changes on the minimum claim area and associated cross compliance can be fully assessed.  A third 
defaultalternative would be to rely on voluntary measures which would require more facilitation.
default  Whichever option is chosen, the intent should be to develop a 
defaultcomprehensive approach 
defaultthat 
defaultdeliver
defaults
default a consistent interconnected and interrelated landscape scale approach.
default&#xa0;
default17. 
default              
defaultNPE supports in principle the proposal 
defaultto reduce the number of 
defaultcross
default compliance requirements
default.  For the Statutory M
defaultanagement Requirements (SMRs)
default this is from 
default16 down to 13
default.  For the 
defaultGood Agricultural &amp; Environmental Conditions (GAEC) 
defaultthe reduction is from 
default16 down to 7.
default  We support such a reduction where the requirements are already set out in legislation elsewhere as these do not represent a good use of public money.  However, it is important that the existing legislation works and is being properly applied before cross compliance requirements are removed.  We would hope that NPE and other organisations with an interest in conservation and land management be consulted prior to changes in the requirements to properly test this and ensure no loss in environmental protection and public access.  Examples where such specialist knowledge is important are the need to consult NPAs over the historic importance of dry stone walls before removal; and to retain access to CROW land in the revised guidance.

defaultN
defaultew Environmental Land Management Service (NELMS)
default&#xa0;default18. 
default              
defaultNPE believes that f
defaultuture targeting of the new scheme will need to reflect the importance of protected landscapes
default.  These are recognised as areas of high environmental importance and 
defaultdeliver public goods and 
defaulthave been able to 
defaultdemonstrate value for money.
default&#xa0;defaultWdefaulthat steps Government might take in implementing CAP to help tenant farmers, farmers in upland areas, and to take account of issues pertaining to common land default&#xa0;default19.
default              
defaultNPE recognises that there is likely to be limited funding, and yet our expectations as a society of what agri environment schemes should deliver are increasing.  This means ever greater targeting will be essential.  This should be on the basis of value of money in providing public benefits.  We note and welcome the comments of the Secretary of State when addressing the Association of National Park Authorities Conference in September 2013. 
default&#xa0;
default“We recognise that the uplands face particular challenges and that there is a specific role for taxpayers’ money in compensating farmers for the work they do in enhancing the environment and providing public goods for which there is no market mechanism.  I have asked my officials to look at how we might ensure that hill farmers are able to be more economically secure, continue to contribute to food production and remain custodians of our valuable uplands.”

default Association of National Park Authorities Conference, 25 September 2013
default&#xa0;
default20.
default              
defaultWe look below at the direct payments system, the new environmental land management service, and the specific issues for those with large areas of common land.    
default&#xa0;
defaultDirect Payments System
default&#xa0;
default21.
default              
defaultNPE supports 
defaultkeeping the 
defaultthree
default current regions (non SDA, SDA
default non moorland &amp;
default SDA moorland) and ensuring that more funds go to the uplands to help support the social, environmental &amp; economic fabric of the uplands so that they can continue to deliver ecosystem services.  
default&#xa0;
default22.
default              
defaultWe are aware that with the Upland Entry Level Scheme (UELS) ceasing, and the NELMS under huge pressure, there is a danger that upland farming incomes could be reduced.  Farmers can receive £62/ha under UELS, but in future 
defaultmight 
defaultreceive 
defaultonly an additional 
default£40/ha for SDA non moorland, which would result in a net decrease in payments of £22/ha.  Smaller farms operating in marginal agricultural areas are more reliant on the support provided by such schemes.  The National Parks want to see sustainable upland farming that delivers a range of public benefits.  Yet, we are concerned that current changes could lead to a reduction in incomes for upland farmers.  As there is an underlying assumption that reductions in SPS and UELS cannot be offset by increased agricultural production, the detrimental impact on the sustainability of upland farms could be significant.  We would ask the Committee to consider this point and invite Defra to carry out further modelling of the likely impacts of the proposed changes. 
default&#xa0;

default.
default              
defaultWe believe that the
default 
defaultMinimum claim size 
defaultrules could impact on farming in many of our National Parks.  W
defaulthilst increasing from 1 ha to 5 ha looks attractive there is a growing issue with the number of holdings of less than 5 ha
default,
default particularly when holdings are lotted up and sold on the open market
default.  A
defaultbout 8% of each NP is made up of holdings in this category
default (see Annex I).
default  So this proposal could have unexpected negative consequences in N
defaultational Parks and we have asked 
defaultDefra for a further breakdown of statistics so that any potential risk for N
defaultational Parks 
defaultcan be better assessed.
default&#xa0;

defaultNPE s

default making extra payments for the 1
defaultst
default x ha of claim which will support those small farmers in the uplands.  In principle
default, we also 
defaultsupport the progressive reductions on claims over a threshold of 150,000 euros. However it would be helpful if Defra could carry out further modelling of the potential impact o
defaultf this on National Parks.
default&#xa0;

default5
default.
default              
defaultThe implementation of Areas of Natural Constraint will be delayed until 2018.  We recognise that the need for mapping comes at a time of particular pressure for agencies in bringing forward the reforms for a new CAP and so understand the need for a delay.  However, it will be important to reserve consideration for additional top-up 
defaultpayments for ANCs if other reforms do not go far enough in terms of supporting the uplands

default7
default.
default              
defaultThere are a number of detailed issues or changes in NELMs that have the potential to have a significant impact on upland farming within National Parks.  These are set out below.
default&#xa0;
default28. 
default              
defaultObjectives – 
defaultThere is concern that the current NELMs is likely to be too restricted in its focus towards 
defaultbiodiversity and WFD (Water Framework Directive) 
defaultobjectives.  National Parks see NELMs as a key delivery vehicle for biodiversity and water policy objectives.  However, we believe n
defaultew scheme(s) should take a whole ecosystem services approach (as advocated in 
defaultthe Government’s Natural Environment White Paper
default) and then set priorities around value for money (i.e. 
defaultat its simplest, the 
defaultmore pub
defaultlic goods the greater the value
default).
default  NELMs o
defaultptions 
defaultneed to
default allow for delivery of landscape, biodiversity, carbon and water management, 
defaultpeatland restoration, 
defaulthistoric environment, access and education objectives. 
default 
defaultWe would also like to see a move towards outcome based agreements with less focus on what some have described as ‘management by prescription’.
default&#xa0;
default29. 
default              
defaultTargeting – limited money means 
defaulteffective targeting is essential.  This exercise should be undertaken on the basis of 
defaultvalue for money in providing public benefits. 
default 
defaultN
defaultational Park Management Plans (and their equivalents in AONBs) 
defaultoffer an existing locally agreed prioritisation at a 
defaultl
defaultandscape scale.
default&#xa0;
default30. 
default              
defaultFacilitation – an important ingredient to maximize 
defaultvalue for money and help with joined up delivery is facilitation.  Facilitation means the debate is not 
defaultjust about agri-environment but also farm competitiveness
default,
default and from there to 
defaultm
defaultake link
defaults
default to wider rural 
defaultdevelo
defaultpment.
default&#xa0;
default31. 
default              
defaultLength of agreement – Entry level agreements currently last for five years, and higher level stewardship agreements for ten years with the option of a five year break clause.  We understand the proposal is to move towards a five year set of agreements.  The fact that an agreement was for ten years was a significant positive selling point for farmers.  It gave them security to plan (and ride out short term market variations); to diversify, and has been essential for changes in management (eg. from commercial to traditional breeds, to restore salt marshes and blanket bog) which are major business decisions and take longer to achieve.  NPE believes agreements of longer than five years are important for the top and middle tier payments and should continue to be supported, albeit with the option of a five year break clause.  
default&#xa0;
default3
default2
default. 
default              
defaultEngagement with farmers – it is important to engage farmers 
defaultat the outset to get full buy in to 
defaultagreed priority objectives.  This needs to be behind the ethos of the scheme and its delivery.
default&#xa0;
default33.
default              
defaultUELS has supported farmers in upland areas and has demonstrated the value of effectively ring fencing funds for the uplands.  If there is no separate uplands scheme 
defaultin future 
defaultthere is concern about the real impact 
defaultthis will have 
defaulton upland farm net incomes 
default(see paragraph 22)
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultCommon Land
default&#xa0;
default34. 
default              
defaultFor some National Parks, ensuring the system works effectively for commons is critical.  The New Forest National Park, for example, now has a commons scheme which 
defaultworks and is understood by both claimants and the RPA.  
defaultWe believe 
defaultthe existing basis of allocation of entitlements for commons should be retained and carried forward into the direct payment scheme (DPS).  To facilitate this, we believe it will be important to update the commons registers, or implement the Commons Act 2006 to ensure accurate distribution of payments. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBureaucracydefault&#xa0;defaultWhat steps does the Government need to take to ensure the reformed CAP is less bureaucratic?default default&#xa0;default35. 
default              
defaultWe believe that there would be considerable benefits from having one IT platform.  Furthermore, thought needs to be given to how to avoid 
defaultoverlap between agencies and organisations operating across measures in the RDP.
default  
defaultLinked to this, business process, IT systems and information sharing needs to be common across all delivery organisations and agencies.
default 
default&#xa0;
default36. 
default              
defaultWe
default welcome and 
defaultsupport the Government
default’
defaults approach to 
defaultCAP reform that has involved 
defaultconsultation at an early stage
default.  This helps establish 
defaultcommon ground, 
defaultenables a 
defaultno surprises 
defaultapproach to be adopted 
defaultand 
defaultincreases the opportunities for 
defaultshared solutions
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow might minimum activity best be defined – for qualification of an active farmerdefault?default&#xa0;default37. 
default              
defaultOverall, NPE 
defaultsupport
defaults
default keeping th
defaulte qualifying criteria 
defaultas minimal and simple as possible.
default  We support the Government’s current approach to the definition of the active farmer test – as set out in Defra (August 2013): 
defaultCAP Reform in England: Status report on Direct Payments
default (paragraphs 7.21-7.23).
default&#xa0;
default38. 
default              
defaultWe would, however, draw the Committee’s attention to the need to ensure 
defaultthat land managing conservation 
defaulto
defaultrganisations/
default bodies and 
defaultland owners who actively manage land for conservation benefit 
defaultare included within the active farmer definition.  Such bodies would include National Park Authorities, the National Trust, Wildlife Trusts, 
defaultWater Companies, RSPB, Local Authorities &amp; some large 
defaultPrivate 
defaultEstates
default.  
defaultConservation organisations now own a substantial proportion of National Parks
default,
default for example 31% in the Peak District National Park.  Whilst some of this land is tenanted
default,
default significant areas are managed in hand and deliver significant environmental benefits.
default&#xa0;
default39.
default              
defaultThe Government has the opportunity to define “the minimum level of activity” so that it does not exclude 
defaultconservation 
defaulto
defaultrganisations/
default bodies and 
defaultland owners who actively manage land for conservation benefi
defaultt.  For example management of moorland to achieve favourable condition for a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) may involve a period of no cattle or sheep 
defaultgrazing,
default drain blocking and minimal management of birch or scrub.  The land may still be grazed by a population of wild deer.  Conventional agricultural livestock could be reintroduced at a later stage once favourable condition has been achieved.
default&#xa0;
default40.
default              
defaultDefra already seems minded to keep the negative list to a minimum and NPE would support this approach.  There are concerns about the possible definition of “Waterworks” and “Real Estate Services” so that traditional landowners who may be providing private water supplies or renting out property are not included in the negative list.
default&#xa0;
defaultGreeningdefault&#xa0;defaultHow should the Government ensure CAP delivers the best environmental benefits while supporting food productiondefault?default&#xa0;default41. 
default              
defaultThe
default CAP is an essential mechanism for delivering a range of public policy objectives, not least 
defaultBiodiversity 2020
default; the 
defaultVision for National Parks
default; and our response to climate change.  There are a number of ways in which Government could ensure maximum environmental benefit is achieved.  These include:

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultLessons learntdefault&#xa0;defaultWhat lessons are there from previous implementation of CAPdefault?default&#xa0;default42. 
default              
defaultThe National Parks across the UK have had considerable experience in working with farmers, through established relationships, on the provision of public benefits from public funds.  Indeed, the Environmentally Sensitive Area scheme was born in the Norfolk Broads, whilst
default National Park Authorities have been behind many innovative projects (available on request) to further economic, social and environmental outcomes.  The first purpose of National Parks expressly relates to conservation; whilst the duty on NPAs and their culture means they fully recognise the need to work alongside the farming community to deliver long term benefits.  From this experience, we believe a number of lessons can usefully be learnt.  These include:
