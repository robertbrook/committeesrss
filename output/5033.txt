&#xa0;Written evidence from the Hampshire Police and Crime Panel [PCC Progress 24]&#xa0;

[[[Evidence on ‘Police and Crime Commissioners’ to the Home Affairs Select Committee]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1              The Hampshire Police and Crime Panel (hereafter referred to as ‘the Panel’) have agreed to base scrutiny activities on the Police and Crime Commissioner for Hampshire’s (hereafter referred to as ‘the Commissioner) Police and Crime Plan and its priorities.&#xa0;1.2              The Panel have set up a ‘Police and Crime Plan’ working group to monitor the priorities and actions required to implement the Plan. Although the working group is aware of activity ongoing within the Commissioner’s priorities, it has not to this date received information that has enabled it to review progress made or the effectiveness of the Commissioner’s priorities.&#xa0;1.3              Therefore it is too early for the Panel to measure the success of the Commissioner’s priorities in reducing crime or delivering an effective police force, and therefore have no further comment to make on this section of the Home Affairs Select Committee’s inquiry.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1              The Panel is aware through a paper tabled at a formal meeting that the Commissioner has multiple methods of holding the Chief Constable to account, including quarterly scrutiny sessions, workshops with Force staff and performance meetings.&#xa0;2.2              The most publically-visible method of holding the Chief Constable to account is through the Commissioner’s ‘COMpass’ sessions, which are bi-monthly meetings held in public between the Commissioner and the Chief Constable. Each meeting is focused on a particular theme, and the public are able to submit questions.&#xa0;2.3              The Panel are assured to this date that the Commissioner is able to perform his function in holding the Chief Constable to account, and therefore have no further comment to make on this section of the Home Affairs Select Committee’s inquiry.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1               The Panel had a good working relationship and engages constructively with the Police and Crime Commissioner for Hampshire (and the Isle of Wight), Mr. Simon Hayes. &#xa0;3.2               The Panel has, since its inception, effectively carried out its relevant statutory functions in conjunction with the Commissioner. This has included holding two Confirmation Hearings, reviewing the precept, setting up and using a non-serious complaint process, reviewing the Police and Crime Plan, scrutinising the Annual Plan and generally scrutinising and supporting the Commissioner in areas relating to his functions. &#xa0;3.3              Similar to Section 1 above, it is too early to estimate how effective the Panel has been after one year.  However, the relationship between the Panel and the Commissioner would be further strengthened by the production of timely detailed information, when requested. The Panel has been cognisant of the Commissioner’s new role and the need to build an Office which supports the delivery of his priorities and Plan. However, a year into the role, the Panel has publically stated that the Commissioner should be able to provide information requested by Members in a timely fashion. &#xa0;3.5              The Panel’s Complaints Sub-Committee has used considerable resource in the past year in order to review non-criminal complaints made against the Commissioner. The Panel’s powers in relation to any non-serious complaint are minimal in comparison to the time taken to review and conclude complaints. This power could be reconsidered in light of either increasing or reducing this function, to either enable Panels to investigate and apply appropriate actions to a complaint, or for another organisation of body to take on responsibility to considering such complaints. &#xa0;3.6              Following the first year of the Commissioner being in post, the Panel is now looking to move to proactive model of scrutiny where evidence is requested from key stakeholders on the effectiveness of actions under the priorities listed in the Police and Crime Plan. We think it is important to triangulate the information received from the Commissioner with other organisations, stakeholders and the public, so that the Panel can build a picture of how successful work strands relating to the Commissioner’s priorities have been. &#xa0;3.7              The Panel is also looking to strengthen its visibility to the public, and inclusion of the public’s views. Currently the Panel encourages individuals and community groups to engage with the Panel through an easy-to-access website, rotational meeting venues across the Hampshire and Isle of Wight area, and provision for public questions and deputations to the Panel. The Panel hopes to improve on this model by encouraging participation in its proactive scrutiny proposals.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1              That Panel has no comment to make on this section of the Home Affairs Select Committee’s inquiry.

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1              The Panel have an important role to play in the budget and precept setting process, given their ability to review and, if felt appropriate, veto the Commissioner’s precept. Members of the Panel are aware that they do not have a function to perform in publically scrutinising the budget, but believe that without timely access to financial information underpinning the Commissioner’s precept proposals, the Panel cannot perform its function in relation to the precept.&#xa0;5.2              In order to ensure that the Panel is able to review any precept proposed by the Commissioner with a full understanding of the related budget implications, a ‘Finance’ working group has been established to request and review information provided by the Commissioner to this end. The ‘Finance’ working group has, to this date, found it challenging to receive timely information requested, and has therefore struggled to make a tangible early contribution to the precept and budget process. &#xa0;5.3              It would be helpful for Commissioners to be guided on the information that should be made available to Panels on the precept and supporting budgetary information, to ensure more consistency and that the Panel can add value to the process. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1              That Panel has no comment to make on this section of the Home Affairs Select Committee’s inquiry.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]8.1              The Panel understands that the Commissioner publishes decisions that he has taken on his website, in line with the expectation that Commissioners publish any decision that they believe to be of ‘significant public interest’. These decisions are not published with background information, and the Commissioner does not have a method for alerting the Panel that decisions have been taken. 8.2              The Panel is not informed of the decisions that the Commissioner is planning to take, and a forward plan, to the best of the Panel’s knowledge, is not published by his Office.8.3              The majority of the Panel is made up of local authority Councillors, all of whom are familiar with Council processes for taking decisions. The Panel have publically noted that it would be helpful for the public if the Commissioner took a similar approach to taking decisions, namely:&#xa0;8.4              The Panel have no further comment to make on this section of the Home Affairs Select Committee’s inquiry.&#xa0;Owing to the timings of this call out for evidence, the full Panel has not been able to review and approve this submission. Please therefore note that this evidence has been submitted by the Chair on behalf of the Hampshire Police and Crime Panel.&#xa0;Hampshire Police and Crime PanelDecember 2013&#xa0;
