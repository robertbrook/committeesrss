[[[submitted by Cancer Research UK (RAD001)]]]Recent Government Spending Reviews&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[RECOMMENDATION 1: Committee inquiry on science spending]]]Government should produce a plan outlining how it will support science in the long-term. This should incorporate spending decisions on all elements of publicly funded research including infrastructure. This will help provide certainty for future funding decisions by both commercial and non-commercial funders. Medical research in particular is a long-term endeavour that requires sustained and stable funding in order for basic research to be translated into technologies that benefit patients. It can take decades for medical research to develop into treatments, much longer than the 4-5 year spending review periods that Government currently adopts. The Committee should investigate the merits of such a plan and advise on possible content and a suitable length.&#xa0;

[[[RECOMMENDATION 2: Committee ]]]

[[[inquiry into the distribution of the current science budget]]]The academic and charitable sector welcomed the Government’s announcements of a flat cash settlement in the 2013 spending review. How money is allocated within the science ring fence will be of particular interest to the sector, including how the outcome of the research councils’ triennial review affects the settlement.  Investigating how to effectively allocate the science budget could be a potentially useful inquiry for the science and technology committee.

[[[&#xa0;]]]Comments on the NAO reportThe following section contrasts the findings of the NAO report with Cancer Research UK’s experience of funding UK research.

[[[&#xa0;]]]Diversity of funding“Wholly independent and self-sufficient medical research initiatives are rare. Arguably all research activity depends, to a greater or lesser extent, on other parts of the total medical research “ecology” in the UK, and in many cases, internationally. For example, universities conducting charity-funded projects also receive infrastructure support from the public sector through QR and the CRSF.”&#xa0;

[[[RECOMMENDATION 3]]]

[[[ Committee inquiry on diversity of funding]]]The NAO report highlights the importance of the Not-for-Profit sector in the UK research environment. We know that the diversity of funding is a unique element to the UK and brings about significant advantages. The Committee may wish to consider an inquiry into the relationship between Government, industry and Not-for-Profits for the R&amp;D in the UK and whether there are any additional measures that Government could be taking to ensure that collaboration takes place and that Not–for-Profits can invest their money most effectively.  &#xa0;

[[[RECOMMENDATION 4: Committee inquiry on higher education R&amp;D spending]]]The NAO report outlines the real terms decrease in public sector spending in research in Higher Education Institutes. The committee could consider reviewing the impact of Government investment in higher education R&amp;D and look at the possible outcomes for increasing or decreasing investment in these areas, especially the knock on effects for investment by commercial and non-commercial entities.&#xa0;Regional SpendingEuropean Framework Funding&#xa0;&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0; Department of Business, Innovation and Skills,  Leverage from public funding of science and research, March 2013 p.5 Cancer Research UK, Working together: the impact of medical research investment on the health and wealth of the nation http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/prod_consump/groups/cr_common/@nre/@pol/documents/generalcontent/cr_109616.pdf  National Audit Office, Research and Development funding for science and technology,p.21 Office for Health Economics, Exploring the Interdependency between Public and Charitable Medical Research, http://www.ohe.org/publications/article/exploring-the-interdependency-between-public-and-charitable-medical-research-6.cfm  Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, Leverage from public funding of science and research, March 2013 p.5 Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, , Leverage from public funding of science and research, March 2013 National Audit Office, Research and Development funding for science and technology, p.21
