[[[&#xa0;]]]1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Executive Summary&#xa0;1.1              The CIEH welcomes the Select Committee’s Inquiry into the Government’s review of housing standards and its proposals on the Code for Sustainable Homes.  The principal role for Environmental Health Practitioners is in the maintenance of housing standards and conditions in the private rented sector, but there is strong interest in the standards et for new build housing, not least as these are of course the private rented dwellings of the future. The consultation also raises important issues about accessibility and space standards, which are of particular interest.&#xa0;1.2              The key points of our submission are:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Overall approach ]]]&#xa0;2.1              The consultation is concerned with the standards that are applied to new housing construction and seeks to both to simplify standards and remove unnecessary ones, concentrating on those that should be mandatory, while other issues are left to be the subject of voluntary codes adopted by the industry. &#xa0;CIEH position&#xa0;2.2              The distinction between mandatory and voluntary is sensible, but the balance between the two has to be set carefully. The housing market currently favours the “seller” and voluntary codes cannot be relied on alone to achieve the housing stock required in the longer term.  Furthermore, government policies, especially its carbon-reduction targets, depend heavily on the performance of the current and future housing stock. The government should also be planning to ensure that the housing stock is better suited to the demographic shifts that are taking place.

[[[Implementation ]]]&#xa0;3.1              The consultation paper considers different methods for implementing the standards, e.g. embodying them in the Building Regulations. &#xa0;CIEH Position&#xa0;3.2              The CIEH has some concerns about placing sole reliance on the Building Regulations, firstly in terms of the consistency when applied on energy issues and secondly, while they are a well-established and relatively stable mechanism, they have proven less successful in driving up standards. &#xa0;3.3              It is not only in energy efficiency that Building Regulations are inconsistently applied; they are also not noted for bringing about step changes in standards, while there is resistance by house builders to improvements.  But we do not view the solution as being in voluntary codes.&#xa0;

[[[Keeping the standards under review ]]]&#xa0;CIEH Position &#xa0;4.1              Whilst this is not an issue of great significance for the CIEH, we support the establishment of a review group, which should have a broad base to reflect consumer and wider interests (e.g. on environmental and accessibility issues) and should not be solely an industry forum.  It is not clear to us how this is different from the current Building Regulations Advisory Committee which the CIEH has had occasional input into.

[[[Standards for affordable housing ]]]&#xa0;5.1              The Government proposes to remove separate standards for affordable housing but that its higher needs are ‘taken into account’ in implementation. &#xa0;CIEH Position &#xa0;5.2              We agree with the Chartered Institute of Housing that separate standards for social housing have served the sector well. Of course, if the private sector was willing/able to operate to the same standards then differences may no longer be justified, but recent experience suggests that it is not.

[[[Accessibility ]]]&#xa0;6.1              Current standards on accessibility are in part M of the Building Regulations but there are also discretionary standards about wheelchair access and (particularly) the Lifetime Homes (LTH) standard, while various other standards are set by local authorities. The government proposes both a minimum, compulsory standard set in Building Regulations and two further optional levels – intermediate (similar to LTH) and high (fully wheelchair accessible) which could be applied to a proportion of units in a development. &#xa0;CIEH Position &#xa0;6.2              For too long there has been ambiguity, not only in the standards to follow when designing accessible property but to the interpretation of the guidance given. The result of interpretation of the guidance alongside the often conflicting policies (also determining the building design) have sometimes led to “hybrid” properties that are not always fit for purpose or which may have been over manufactured for ‘disability’, rather than being accessible.&#xa0;6.3              Often when considering adaptations to a property the person requiring them has quite differing and individual needs. Council Disabled Facilities Grant and adaptation services need to consider the individual anthropometrics; one size of adaptation does not always fit all.&#xa0;6.4              By making the policy clear and functional, it is hoped that ‘accessible and adaptable’ homes will be provided allowing for the easy tailoring to a person’s needs.&#xa0;6.5              It is very important to make the standards the same for private and affordable housing, which would hopefully open up the housing options for people perhaps affected by the welfare reform changes, or that are inadvertently discriminated against through lack of accessible stock across tenure. Encouraging private landlords to consider accessible stock might impact on the pressures on the council housing stock.&#xa0;6.6              ‘The wheelchair standard’ should be researched and be more of a culmination of other recognised guidance. Wheelchair users should be consulted in this research, which should cover not only the internals of the building, but the approach, access and the provision of parking. &#xa0;6.7              Some local authorities have seen increased demand for one bed wheelchair accessible stock, following the introduction of the welfare reform changes, however, location of this also needs to be near community facilities or is not easily rented. There is some evidence also of a rise in families requiring accessible, level access property, so that they are able to easily and independently tend to their children and stay together as a family in their chosen community. These are mostly 3-4 bed needs. Developers have reported that costs of building such stock are high due to the land required and there is no incentive to build this type of stock, resulting in costly extensions to&#xa0;existing properties, if the building structure lends itself to this in the first place.&#xa0;6.8              The part M requirements essentially make a home ‘visitable’ rather than fully useable overall by a disabled person.&#xa0; The debate is therefore essentially about whether LTH (or similar) should be required nationally across sectors.&#xa0; It already applies in London and several LAs outside London and the previous government planned to extend it to the private sector. The obvious arguments in favour are the ageing population and the much lower cost of incorporating higher standards from the outset. &#xa0;6.9              Part M was a significant advance nevertheless it is somewhat tokenistic and can be applied that way. By contrast, LTHs are not only about the immobility of age and, for example, ought to facilitate caring for chronically sick people in the community.

[[[Space ]]]&#xa0;7.1              National space standards apply only in affordable housing through the HCA and GLA, although they may be enforced by LAs through planning policies. Given the variety of approaches there is obviously a case for harmonisation. &#xa0;7.2              The government has backed away from directly tackling poor space standards and prefers a voluntary approach based on labelling.&#xa0; However, if the aim is to avoid conflicting approaches, the Government would probably need to rescind current planning guidance that encourages local standards, or else encourage a consistent voluntary standard which LAs would have to adopt if they wanted to exceed the minimum. &#xa0;CIEH Position &#xa0;7.3              The largely voluntary approach of the past clearly has not delivered.&#xa0; Setting (adequate) mandatory standards would not only have significant practical benefits but be of symbolic importance in the government/construction industry relationship too.&#xa0;7.4              Britain currently has the lowest floor space in new build in Europe and is the only country without minimum standards.&#xa0; The CIEH favours a minimum standard that applies to all housing, not just affordable housing, that could then be consistently applied across England.  We do not consider that an official labelling system is required above that.&#xa0;

[[[Water efficiency ]]]&#xa0;8.1              Basic water efficiency is currently covered by the Building Regulations and local authorities are able to put forward local standards, which are normally part of sustainability requirements linked to the Code. &#xa0;The government favours continued standards and proposes a dual approach – one based on the whole house and the other on efficiency of individual fittings.&#xa0; The standards would be aimed at a similar level as currently. &#xa0;CIEH Position 

[[[&#xa0;]]]8.2              The CIEH is sceptical of 'whole house' standards since these seem harder to enforce, lead to less market transformation and in some cases have encouraged the installation of inappropriate fittings (to 'balance' other inappropriate fittings) which are then replaced. &#xa0;We are also not convinced on the case for more stringent local standards; it is plain that household consumption cannot be squeezed inexorably to accommodate more and more incomers and where there is no further scope for resource development or leakage reduction, the planning system has to say 'no'.

[[[Energy ]]]&#xa0;9.1              There are two main issues of concern to the Chartered Institute: the proposed winding up of the Code for Sustainable Homes and the scrapping of the provisions in the Planning and Energy Act 2008 which permit local standards for energy efficiency to be set. The importance of the domestic sector in energy use and the double advantage of tackling energy-inefficiency in homes (i.e. both reducing energy use and cutting consumers’ costs) means it is vital that standards are as ambitious as possible if the government’s 2020 and 2050 carbon reduction targets are to be met.

[[[Code for Sustainable Homes]]]&#xa0;CIEH Position&#xa0;10.1              We are concerned at the loss of the Code for several reasons: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[11]]]

[[[              ]]]

[[[Local standards ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]11.1              Local planning authority standards have required developers to work to local sustainability goals, for example generating a proportion of energy on-site, from renewable sources.&#xa0; &#xa0;CIEH Position&#xa0;11.2              Initiatives like the "Merton Rule" have worked well and should be encouraged.&#xa0;An important consideration is that planners and planning authorities have often been in the driving seat for local sustainability ideas which have then been taken up more widely. &#xa0;As a
