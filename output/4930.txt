[[[ from Action with Communities in Rural England (ACRE) (FDC21)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[1. Introduction]]]&#xa0;

[[[1.1]]] Action with Communities in Rural England (ACRE) is the national umbrella for 38 rural community-led regeneration organisations known as Rural Community Councils. ACRE itself was formed in 1987, but its members were created between 1920 and 2011, and so it possesses vast experience across the entirety of rural England with regard to devolved decision-making processes.&#xa0;

[[[1.2]]] ACRE is a charity and, together with the 38 Rural Community Councils, forms the ACRE Network.&#xa0;

[[[1.3]]] ACRE is co-financed by Defra to provide information on the impact of government policies in rural areas.  The possibility of fiscal devolution to cities and city regions has potential impact on rural areas; we have noted disparities in how rural communities are served through existing devolved structures (e.g. Local Government, Local Enterprise Partnerships etc.) and wish to see all areas treated with equity. &#xa0;

[[[1.4]]] Examples of the work of the ACRE Network can be found in Making a Difference in rural communities throughout England - published jointly by ACRE and Defra in the autumn of 2013.&#xa0;

[[[Summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[2.1]]] Our response is brief, but we would be happy to share further information so as to support the work of the select committee.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The concept of fiscal devolution to cities and city regions]]]&#xa0;

[[[3.1]]] The ACRE Network is governed by, and serves, public, private and civil society organisations across rural England. The Network’s activity – primarily an enabling one (providing information, training, consultancy, guidance and networking opportunities) – has a strong focus on participatory democracy, bringing public, private and civil society bodies together at a very local level (e.g. in a single village) to plan for the socio-economic and environmental wellbeing of a particular geography. This is a form of government ‘by the people and for the people’ that should augment representative democratic structures such as Parish, District / Borough, Unitary and County Councils. Our work in this field has included supporting:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The creation of over 4,000 community-led plans (setting economic, social and environmental priorities at local level, and enabling the attraction and delivery of external funding to provide new services and facilities); usually with participation rates between 60 and 90% of the population-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Management of over 11,000 community-owned facilities (largely village halls, but also community-owned shops, pubs, transport operations etc.) These facilities support over 70,000 jobs in rural England.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the first six months of the 2013/14 financial year alone the work of the ACRE Network underpinned the opening of more than £40 million of affordable housing, helped create 118 new businesses (and assisted a further 287, including village shops, to maintain their viability and / or improve performance) and provided over 9,000 people living in rural areas with access to health and social care services (keeping this number of people out of residential care saves around £180 million a year). In addition, 2,886 village halls used the services of ACRE Network members: these venues represent an asset value of around £2.1billion and are a space in which more than 20,000 jobs deliver goods and services.&#xa0;

[[[3.2]]] We see, on a daily basis, the benefits of cross-sector working in tightly defined geographical areas. This means inclusive decision-making processes, drawing on a wide skills’ base, locally-tailored solutions to specific problems and even the ability to attract and generate further investment. The scaling-up of such an approach, to deliver on specific agendas, is something we welcome.&#xa0;

[[[4. ]]]

[[[Rural impact]]]&#xa0;

[[[4.1]]] We are particularly pleased to see that the Chair of the Communities and Local Government Committee, Clive Betts MP, has recognised a need to identify how rural areas might be impacted by proposals for fiscal devolution to cities and city regions.&#xa0;

[[[4.2]]] We are co-financed by Defra to provide information on the impact of Government policies in rural areas. In the instance of a proposal such as the one considered here, impact can only be surmised, as there are many variables to be taken into account.&#xa0;

[[[4.3]]] We know from our own membership (i.e. 38 Rural Community Councils) that the importance of policy initiatives on rural areas varies greatly – as, indeed, is local investment targeted at community-led regeneration generally. Our figures suggested that, on a per head of population basis, local public sector investment in our network can vary hugely – in 2012 we found an example variation of £0.19 per head in one area (e.g. Kent), but £3.80 in another (e.g. Central Bedfordshire.) We know also by early work with Local Enterprise Partnerships containing significant urban populations, that some (e.g. Coast to Capital) are very cognizant of rural economic growth – and how this contributes to a wide geography – and so are already investing in agendas such as affordable housing and community-owned workspace.&#xa0;

[[[4.4]]] Where an area (that might contain a city) has a major rural hinterland, that perhaps is recognised as a key contributor to the economy (or has its own economic challenges and a substantial rural population) then there are positive signs that devolved decision-making can be beneficial for rural areas. We could cite the work of the New Anglia LEP as an example, or indeed various economic development initiatives (e.g. use of the LEADER mechanisms to support innovation in local business and community enterprise, broadband roll-out, multi-village neighbourhood planning) seen in Cumbria over the past decade.&#xa0;

[[[4.5]]] Impact on rural areas might also be affected by the representational composition of structures created to oversee investment. Our network is involved in a number of structures designed to grow the economy, but doing this by setting and delivering on local priorities. However, there is an inconsistent picture across the country, and in some places our members have not become part of structures – and this tends to reflect on the ‘political position’ of either rural areas, community-led regeneration or civil society in relation to economic growth in those places. Examples of our Network’s involvement in such structures (as at December 2013) is:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 4 on LEP Boards (representing 10% coverage)-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 24 on LEP Thematic Working Groups or Sub-Committees (61% coverage)-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 7 involved with Rural Growth Networks (100% coverage)&#xa0;

[[[Rural areas are integral, and not peripheral, to city regions]]]&#xa0;

[[[5.1]]] Much of England’s rural land is devoted to production of energy (e.g. food), and this benefits the whole country. By necessity this energy production requires large amounts of land, and so settlements within it tend to be small – often meaning that it is more expensive to deliver specific services or run major businesses in rural areas. Much of our Network’s activity is targeted at alleviating the impacts of this: nobody should be disadvantaged because they live or work in a rural area.&#xa0;

[[[5.2]]] However, rural areas often do miss out on major investment – or adequate means to address market failure. Our network’s role is to provide the tools and expertise that allow rural communities to identify, articulate and address their needs. These needs do not exist in isolation but often struggle to be met because necessary investment is targeted at urban areas where greater concentration of need exists (even if total figures for specific problems are less than in surrounding, but spread out, rural areas!) To this end we have worked with the Oxford Consultants for Social Inclusion (OCSI) to produce data sets covering the rural share of deprivation, economy and other subjects across the entirety of England. We can generate reports at LEP, County Council, Clinical Commissioning, District Council, Parish and even individual place level. The aim is to demonstrate that any policy or investment decision will impact a specific cohort of the population living and / or working in a rural area.&#xa0;

[[[5.3]]] Rural areas are integral to city regions because the energy (e.g. food) produced is also consumed in urban areas. People working in cities may live in rural locations and there is much access to the countryside for leisure and recreational purposes. While spatial disadvantage arises in rural areas from the need to use land for agriculture, horticulture, forestry etc. – i.e. the land needed means small populations and less strong economies of scale for delivering services or operating certain types of business – the function of rural areas is to support the whole population. We see, therefore, that there is interdependency between rural and urban areas and thus the former is an integral part of any geography that is not purely urban in its confines.&#xa0;

[[[Recommendation]]]&#xa0;

[[[6.1]]] At this stage we have one recommendation to make: devolved fiscal responsibilities should be subject to rural-proofing. &#xa0;

[[[6.2]]] We wish to see fair allocations of resource to rural areas, as opposed to an ability for devolved structures simply to invest in those places with the single greatest return on investment (thus compounding disadvantage elsewhere.) Where spend of public money is to come under greater control, then a means of attributing this to take into account rural population, land area and deprivation levels should be considered. Our experience is that great inconsistencies exist across the country in how rural areas are served through existing devolved power, and that a strong national framework needs to be in place as a ‘check and balance’ against further disadvantaging some rural areas.&#xa0;

[[[6.3]]] Defra has produced various rural-proofing toolkits which might be used as a starting point for this process. We would be happy to help shape a sensible rural-proofing guide fit for the purposes of a fiscal devolution to cities and city regions agenda.&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0; Based on English Rural Housing Association estimates of £150,000 build cost for each local needs house completed.
