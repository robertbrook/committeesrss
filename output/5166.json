"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by The Daily Mail (CLC071)&#xa0;\n1. How should climate scientists communicate their findings?\n&#xa0;\nThe Daily Mail's science and environment correspondents read the major academic journals every\n \nday and report on papers which we believe are important and will interest our readers,\n \nCorrespondents usually interview the author of the scientific paper, and other experts in that field,\n \non the phone to ask them questions about their rese\narch and its wider significance.\n They also make\n \nuse of the independent Science Media Centre which organises panels of scientists a once or twice a\n \nweek to give their opinions on a topic or report and take questions from journalists, and provides\n \nreaction from scientists to articl\nes authored by their colleagues.\n Climate change is no exception to\n \nthis and our reporters regularly interview climate scientists and other researchers whose work has\n \nan impact on the cl\nimate, and report on their work.\n Like most scientists, climate scientists generally\n \nsend out press releases about their published research in advance, and offer to speak to journalists\n \nabout it, which is always \nappreciated.\n There are very few scientists in this field who publicly\n \nchallenge the\n consensus about climate change.\n One example is Professor Judith Curry from the\n \nDepartment of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology who speaks to the\n \nmedia about her concerns that 1998 was the hottest year on record and there has been little\n \nwarmi\nng since so she is often quoted.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe Science Media Centre gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry and I am aware that they highly\n \nvalue the Daily Mail as a supporter.\n&#xa0;\n2. Scientists usually come top of professions that are most trusted by the general public in surveys.\n \nWhy is that different in the climate debate?\n&#xa0;\nReporters covering all science issues including climate change should give an impression of how\n \nmuch agreement there is and how important a piece of research is in the wider context of that field.\n \nIn climate science there is almost universal agreement that the climate is changing, and humans are\n \nhaving some impact on it, but not on its pace and scale and possible future effects. Just because the\n \npublic trust scientists does not mean every piece of research by every scientist should be reported as\n \nfact - science is all about probabilities and it is our job to explain the debate and how it is changing.\n \nFor example the scientist James Lovelock whose influential books suggested that there would be\n \nimminent disaster from global warning in the coming years has since moderated his stance as\n \nreported here- \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2134092/Gaia-scientist-James-Lovelock-I-alarmist-climate-change.html\n. \nMost science published in newspapers is based on material published\n \nin a peer-reviewed journal, further explained in an interview or conference presentation.\n&#xa0;\n3. What is your opinion of mass media coverage of climate?\n&#xa0;\nClimate science has changed dramatically in recent years - there are now departments at\n \nuniversities around the world devoted to what was previously a niche issue. The UN's\n \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has around 800 scientists. But it is also a political issue.\n \nIt is linked to rising energy bills for homes and businesses, to aid to the developing world, and feeds\n \nin to the debate about renewable energy (for example whether in cutting carbon emissions it\n \ndamages the environment in other ways). For example in 2009 the 'Climategate' controversy\n \nscientists at the University of East Anglia were exonerated of wrongdoing by a number of inquiries,\n \nbut it is clear from their emails to \nand from government departments and the Met Office that they\n \nwere discussing how their scientific findings fitted alongside political developments and\n \ninternational negotiations. It is important to explain uncertainties and changes to the science and\n \nexpose where there may be a political agenda.\n&#xa0;\nOn sceptical voices, there are very few serious scientists who deny the climate is changing. But what\n \nis causing it, how fast is happening and what we do about it is controversial. When quoting those\n \nwith well-known sceptical views such as Lord Lawson, we usually refer to him a climate change\n \nsceptic.\n&#xa0;\nWe note that according to last month's Spectator he complained that a meeting of scientists at the\n \nLords was held without reporters being present to record the differing views of scientists.\n&#xa0;\n4. James Painters res\nearch has found that press cove\nrage in the UK has become increasingly\n \npolarised - why is this?\n&#xa0;\nClimate science is used by government and others to justify higher energy bills; construction of wind\n \nfarms, green taxes on businesses which can affect jobs; and closures of coal-fired power stations.\n \nWhen a subject becomes more prominent in public debate, and has considerable political and\n \neconomic implications, then controversies will come to the fore. As far as the Painter report is\n \nconcerned we would take issue with information provided in 2009 in regard to this paper and the\n \nreporting of Copenhagen.\n&#xa0;\nTo my knowledge the only Daily Mail editorial on the subject is the one attached to this email. It says\n \n'this paper keeps an open mind on climate change'. Some columnists have doubted it in opinion\n \npieces under their own name such as this article by Christopher Booker\n \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2335982/CHRISTOPHER-BOOKER-A-dangerously-deluded-energy-policy-greens-want-hide-truth-soaring-bills.html\n.\n \nOthers say it is real and serious\n \nand talk about how Britain should combat it - such as this by the New Scientist's Fred Pearce about\n \nnuclear power \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2066726/Nuclear-power-Yes--A-opponent-calls-Chris-Huhne-embrace-energy-source-thats-cheap-AND-good-environment.html\n. \nThe public can\n \nread the news report and the comment and make up their own mind. Readers of the Daily Mail will\n \nbe very familiar with distinct ways in which the paper reports news and comment. I am not aware of\n \nany climate science stories that have had an effect on newspaper sales.\n&#xa0;\n5\n. What is your publications working definition of climate change?\n&#xa0;\nIt would be impossible to define every term used in the Daily Mail; we generally follow current\n \nwidely accepted usage. Scientists now refer to 'climate change' rather than global warming, as they\n \nno longer believe the effects of greenhouse gas emissions are simply warmer weather, but as\n \nclimate patterns changes\n, the weather may become more extreme, with more floods and droughts;\n \nsome areas of the world could become colder and others warmer. There are also other factors\n \naffecting the climate such as EI Nino and La Nina currents, volcanoes and cloud patterns. James\n \nPainters' research (referred to in question 4) makes the point that scientists think it is misguided to\n \nattribute single weather events to climate change as there is too much uncertainty there. But we do\n \nmention these trends in the Mail's weather reporting - see the article attached 'Monsoon Britain'\n \nfrom January 2013 about how scientists believe downpours will become more common.\n&#xa0;\n6. Do you agree that there are core \nfa\ncts that everyone might agree upon? Where should these\n \nfacts be promulgated?\n&#xa0;\nThe climate is always changing and the vast majority of climate scientists believe there is a\n \nsignificant human impact on it although they disagree about the pace and effects. Climate scientists\n \nare unlikely to write papers saying climate change is not happening. The implications of climate\n \nchange are also looked at by physicists, biologists, chemists, geologists - there is no one authority on\n \nit.\n&#xa0;\n7. As a publisher of news, you communicate with the public on climate issues. Do you think you\n \nattract a broad spectrum of opinion or are you only speaking to like-minded people?\n&#xa0;\nI am not aware that we have polled the views of our readers on climate change, although national\n \nsurveys show a larger proportion of the public are sceptical about it than scientists are. (This may be\n \nbecause our readers will remember just 20 years or so ago scientists used to think the world would\n \nenter another Ice Age.) We try and relate our reporting to our readers lives in terms of possible\n \nextreme weather and flooding, the effect on wildlife and nature, energy bills and energy security and\n \nhealth phenomena, such as hay fever or deaths from cold weather. Climate change can be an\n \nabstract concept so yes it can be better to link it to immediate concerns but we also cover major\n \nreports on the subject, for example these latest predictions from the UN's climate change panel in\n \nSeptember 2013: \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2436113/IPCC-climate-change-report-Humans-causing-global-warming.html\n. \n Our reporting is intended to inform and entertain -\n \nsomething eye-catching the readers may not have heard of before - for example this story on\n \nanimals shrinking as temperatures warm \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2049961/Animals-shrinking-heat-Sheep-deer-bird-reptile-numbers-falling-global-warming.html\n \nmay\n \nget coverage even though it does not directly relate to our readers' lives.\n&#xa0;\n8. Discussions and dissent on climate change policy often focus on uncertainties in the science.\n&#xa0;\nIt is not the role of newspapers to dictate policy.\n&#xa0;\nPolicy is concerned with mitigating the risks of climate change - while trying to make sure other\n \ncountries do their bit and that it does not overburden households and businesses. It is driven by the\n \nscience, which involves uncertainty and the probability of different scenarios. The modelling of past\n \nand future climate has become far more sophisticated in recent years but it is still prone\n \nto uncertainty - the latest IPCC report put the predicted rise in temperature at between 2C and 4.8C\n \nby the end of the century, and revised down how much warming there has been since the 1950s\n \nfrom 0.12C per decade to just 0.05C since 1998. Our readers will want to know how sure scientists\n \nare about different outcomes - especially if it involves tough choices now.\n \nI trust your committee will find this helpful.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
