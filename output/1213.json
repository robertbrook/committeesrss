"VEP 0039\n&#xa0;\nWritten Submission by Professor Julian Roberts and Professor Mike Hough (VEP 0039)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDo you think sentence length is a valid proxy for deciding which prisoners get the right to vote?\n&#xa0;\nIt is the best proxy for offence seriousness, and is preferable to a scheme which excludes certain prisoners, i\n.\ne\n.,\n those convicted of personal injury offences. Yet sentence length is still a poor tool to distinguish between prisoners in order to determine who should be disenfranchised. There is no point on the dimension of sentence length which provides a cut\n-\noff which is anything but arbitrary. The few correctional regimes that use sentence length – such as Canada – did so drawing upon an important\n division of jurisdiction. Thus in Canada, federal prisoners – those serving two years or longer were disenfranchised, while provincial prisoners retained the vote. The federal provincial correctional bifurcation in jurisdiction split in Canada was important but has no \nequivalent \ncounterpart in England and Wales. (In addition the disenfranchisement of federal prisoners \nin Canada \nwas ultimately struck down on constitutional grounds\n in R. v. Sauve)\n. The closest alternative \nin England \nwould be the Magistrate/ Crown court division but using this as the division would \nin our view \nbe overbroad: federal prisoners in Canada represented only \napproximately \n3% of the \ntotal Canadian \nprison population; prisoners sentenced from the Crown Court represent a \nsignificantly\n higher percentage of the total prisoner population.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOur preferred approach would involve \ntwo \nsteps:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat, if anything, is the \nsignificance of four\n years and/or six months in the sentencing of criminals? \n&#xa0;\nAs noted, there is no significance; both are arbitrary thresholds.\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf you were to draw a line between serious and non-serious offences using sentence length, where would it be?\n&#xa0;\nWe would not draw the line, but one possibility would be to disenfranchise anyone sentenced to life imprisonment\n on the grounds that they have committed a crime of such seriousness that the most severe penalty was warranted\n.\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCan you think of an example where the sentence length approach could lead to an anomalous result? (For example, electoral fraud may result in a short sentence.)\nMany cases heard at the Crown Court involve several counts, some relating to the same incident, some relating to completely separate incidents. If a threshold relating to sentence length is applied clear rules will be needed about the way in which total sentence is calculated. Clearly it would be anomalous to sum concurrent sentences, but \nmore \nrational to do so for consecutive ones\n.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt has been suggested by Liberty that the disenfranchisement of prisoners disproportionately impacts on ethnic minority communities. Is this correct?\nAny groups that are less likely than others to secure sentencing discounts – eg for early guilty pleas or for expressing remorse will – other things being equal – be more likely to be disenfranchised. There is evidence that BME groups are \nless likely to enter early guilty pleas.\n&#xa0;\nPeople nearing the end of their criminal careers – aiming to find a route out of crime – may by virtue of their long record actually be sentenced more heavily than those who are not trying to stop. This group may be over-represented.\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccording to a note from the House of Commons Library,\n \napproximately a quarter of those sentenced to less than four years have been convicted of a violent or sexual offence.\n&#xa0;\n Under what circumstances would someone convicted of these types of offences be sentenced to less than four years?\n&#xa0;\n \nAs noted, we are of the view that \nall \ncategory-based exclusions are unwise. Why would you want to disenfranchise someone convicted of a crime of violence against a single individual \nbut\n not someone who has deprived dozens of elderly victims of their life savings \nyet\n who is convicted of a property crime? Crime seriousness is a better yardstick\n than offence category\n, but as we noted, there is no non-arbitrary cut\n-\noff. \nBut to address the question directly, many offenders convicted of a crime of violence would be sentenced to much less than 4 years. For example, the guideline range for common assault carries a ceiling of 26 weeks.\n Section 47 assaults are divided in the \ndefinitive sentencing \nguideline into 3 categories of seriousness, each with its own sentence range. The sentence range for the most serious category (1) is from 1-3 years.\n The guidelines for less serious sexual assault involving an adult victim has starting points that span the custody threshold.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat proportion of convictions results in a custodial sentence?\n&#xa0;\n \n8% (98,047) of all offenders sentenced in 2012  (n = 1,229,827) get a custodial sen\ntence\n. This includes motoring and summary offences.\n55,777\n got a custodial sentence of 6 months or less (ie 4\n.5\n%\n of 1.2m\n)\n89,289\n got a custodial sentence of under four years (ie just over 7%)\n8,758\n got four years or more (or indeterminate)\n – ie 0.7%\nOf the, 1\n,229,827 sentenced in 2012, 1\n,139,263 are sentenced in magistrates courts and 90,564 are sentenced in the Crown Court (ie 7%)\n.\n19,754 offenders out of the 1,160,776 offenders found guilty at magistrates courts are committed for sentence. (not quite 2%)\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow many persons, convicted in the magistrates’ court of multiple offences, are given custodial sentences of more than six months in prison?\n810 of the 1,132,866 offenders \nfor whom\n sentence length data \nare available \nin magistrates\n’\n courts \nwe\nre given sentences over 6 months.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor those convicted in the Crown Court, what proportion are given \na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA custodial sentence \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA custodial sentence of more than six months \n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA custodial sentence of 4 years or more?\nOf those\n 90,386\n \nsentenced in the Crown Cour\nt\n in 2012\n, 50,683\n \n(or 56\n%) \nreceived\n a custodial sentence. \n41,460 got sentences over 6 months (46% of sentenced or 82% of those imprisoned)\n8,758 got sentences of 4 years of more (or indeterminate sentences)\n – 10% of those sentenced, or 17% of those sentenced to custody.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor what sort of crimes are people likely to get a sentence of more than four years?\n(Assuming a not guilty plea): the most serious of domestic burglaries; street robbery involving a weapon); rape and serious sexual offences; GBH with intent; drug trafficking; homicides. \nPeople with previous convictions\n \nare more likely to get longer sentences, other things being equal\n.\n \nOr for under six months?\n \nAs above\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCan you give examples of criminal offences which fall on the threshold – e.g. for which sentences of, say, anything from three to six years, might be given? (i.e. a situation in which two people convicted of the same offence may get different sentences such that one is disenfranchised and the other is not)\nThe range\n of sentences for apparently sim\nilar offences is wide. An early guilty plea will earn a 33% discount. \nGenuine \nremorse will get an additional reduction\n. Aggravating factors can make a large difference: \nprevious conv\ni\nctions; \nyoung or elderly victims; premeditation\n etc. In aggregate, these aggravating and mitigating factors can play as large a part in determining sentence as the charge.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWould considering disenfranchisement in terms of type of offence be more appropriate than focusing on length of sentence?\n&#xa0;\nNo – for the reasons noted.\n (with the exception of offences relating to election fraud and similar), \n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCan you provide a snapshot of the number of people in prison at the last general election who would have been eligible to vote if either of the re-enfranchising options in the draft Bill had been enacted?\nThe prison population is just under 84,000. \nAround 65,000 are se\nntenced prisoners, and \nour guess is that \naround 4\n5,000\n are sentenced prisoners who would normally be \n entitled to vote. The paper produced by the House of Commons Library on \n28 June\n 2013 \n“Prison Population Statistics” present\ns\n MoJ estimates that in June 2012\n:\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n26,683 prisoners who would otherwise be entitled to vote were serving sentences to four years or less. Of these 7,059 were serving sentences for violence against the person or sexual offences.  \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n4,043 prisoners \nwho would otherwise be entitled to vote were serving \nsentence\ns of \nsix months or less\n. \nOf these 1,035 were serving sentences for violence against the person or sexual offences. \n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDo you think it would be feasible to link the right to vote to rehabilitation?  For example, providing prisoners with an opportunity to be educated in civic responsibility and, as part of this, allowing them to apply to be enfranchised? \n&#xa0;\nEnfranchisement c\nould \ncertain\nly be of value in supporting offenders’ \nreintegration. \nBut we cannot say whether a \nscheme \nof this sort would be practical. Those who might feel strongly about being disenfranchised may not regard such a scheme as having any legitimacy. \n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf disenfranchised prisoners were given the option of applying to be re-enfranchised, how would this work in practice?\n \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow easily could sentencing guidelines incorporate an ancillary penalty of disenfranchisement on an individual basis? \n&#xa0;\nIn our view relatively easily, although this is a question for the Sentencing Council to answer\n.\n&#xa0;July 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
