[[[2.   Introduction]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[3.  What should the BBC be for and what]]] 

[[[should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Public service broadcasting refers to TV programmes that are broadcast for the public benefit rather than for purely commercial purposes. (Ofcom)Ofcom measures delivery of programming by public service broadcasters against four objectives, or "public service purposes": (a) informing our understanding of the world; (b) stimulating knowledge and learning(c) reflecting UK cultural identity; and (d) representing diversity and alternative viewpoints. VLV supports these criteria of measurement and believes they are still fit for purpose. 

[[[4.  What is the BBC for?]]]While commercial broadcasters aim to return value to their shareholders or owners, the BBC exists to create public value. In other words, it aims to serve its audiences not just as consumers, but as members of a wider society, with programmes and services which, while seeking to inform, educate and entertain audiences, also serve wider public purposes. Public value is a measure of the BBC’s contribution to the quality of life in the UK.
