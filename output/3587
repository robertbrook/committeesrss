defaultWritten Evidence Submitted by Roy Sherliker t/a Elec-craft Electrical ServicesdefaultSummary
default&#xa0;
defaultPersonal Evaluation of Part P 
defaultI write
default as a self-employed electrician registered with NAPIT. I hold a BEng Degree in Civil Engineering, 
defaulthaving retrained over ten years ago to be an electrician. 
defaultI am a member of the IET, I have C&amp;G qualifications for electrical work
default,
default and have over ten
default years
default’
default ex
defaultperience in the industry
default,
default almost entirely in the domestic sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt would appear that e
defaultlectrical installation work in the UK can be carried out by 
defaultalmost 
defaultanyone who considers themselves to be capable of doing it
default withou
defaultt 
defaultfear of 
defaultretribution
default. The dangers of electricity are ignored by many who should not be doing electrical installation work, but because it can be done behind closed doors and “it works” the potential consequences are often 
defaultdismissed. There is also widespre
defaultad denial of having been involved in doing something when challenged. Quite often people are more than happy to accept complete ignorance of any law when it comes to electrical work which is quite odd when you consider the potential dangers of faulty work,
default such as fires, electric shock and electrocution. When bone fide trades people identify faulty or dangerous work and nobody is prepared to accept responsibility for it they also deny knowledge of Part P. I
defaultf it is not done correctly or doesn’t comply with t
defaulthe Law
default it can easily be covered up and hidden. At a domestic level l
defaultack of 
defaulttraining 
defaultor real understanding 
defaultabout electricity in the home 
defaultdoes not prevent the home do-it-yourself enthusiast from having a go, nor does it adequately ensure companies and indivi
defaultduals who engage in the carrying out of electrical installation work are truly competent to be doing so.
default 
defaultCompetent Persons Schemes were formed as a direct result of the implementation of Part P of the Building 
defaultRegulations because of a
default requirement
default by this Law
default upon an individual to be a member of such a scheme in order that they could self-certify their work and circumvent the alternative to this of calling upon the Local Government Building Control department to 
defaultcarry out that role. Part P was lack
defaulting in its structure to compensate for inadequacies of the LABC to carry out their role and almost total reliance on the CPSs to perform the function. Furthermore there was uni
defaultversal misunderstanding of the n
defaultotification requirements of Part P where certain
default categories of electrical work had to be notified as being carried out, presumably because they were deemed higher risk if carried out incorrectly or improperly. However, the general
default interpretation was that non-notifiable work could be carried out by non-C
defaultPS members.
