[[[Leonard Pope – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I totally agree with, and support, the proposals of the YORKSHIRE DALES GREEN LANES ALLIANCE that&#xa0;

[[[All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate.]]]&#xa0;Until such legislation is implemented, BOAT’s and UCR’s shall continue to be devastated by 4x4’s and motor cycles.&#xa0;&#xa0;Leonard Pope, Walking Section Organiser, Swaledale Outdoor Club&#xa0;&#xa0;11 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
