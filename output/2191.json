"&#xa0;\nSimon Cramp - Written evidence&#xa0;\n1.\n \nI am sorry my submission is so late in the \nday .\n I have had some rotten bad luck and ill health where I nearly lost my life last November when I had a heart attack. \nAnd doing this on my dad’s computer as I don’t have one.\n I have three hidden disability dislysica and dysp\nraxia and mild \naustic\n \nteninies\n.\n But I battle on\n.\n \n2\n. \nAnyway I am getting back to some form of normal life. And want to as I have in the past m\nade contribution to public life.\n3.\n \nJust want to make some comments re the draft deregulation bill. I think it like the recent lobbying bill a dogs breakfast badly drafted the explanatory notes are not in turn with the clauses as don’t give any background and explanation in  the expltory notes are poor and incomplete. And it has no structure it has too much in it.\n4.\n \nAnd need scrapping and renamed the bit and everything and it mate bill \n5.\n \nI wish you well with your inqui\nry.\n6.\n \nAnd sorry to make it brief. I think it only fit for the dustbin and never should be presented in any format and the committee should be clear what a\n complete dog’s breakfast it is.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n16 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
