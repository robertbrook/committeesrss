"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Mallory Wober [FBB0046]&#xa0;&#xa0;Message to the  House of Commons Select Committee Considering the Future for the BBCFrom\nJoseph Mallory \nWober\n  PhD\nRetired; previously Deputy Head of (Audience) Research\n,  Independent\n Television Commission\n&#xa0;\nPrincipal Purposes of Proposalst\no\n \nidentify the\n value developed within the BBC’s life and to help it to continue\nto\n establish a structure which will help the population identify (more than hitherto and\ncurrently\n) with the merits of Public Service Broadcasting\nto\n furnish some detailed suggestions which \nwill strengthen the first two items above\n&#xa0;\nPreamble – 2013 for 2016\n&#xa0;\nWe have a BRITISH B\nroadcasting Corporation \nfor which we are asked to plan a future at a time when we do not know what the future meaning of British will be, in 2016.\n&#xa0;\nIf the Scottish Refe\nrendum opts for continued Union this simplifies the task of saying what British should carry on to mean. It should reflect on the contributions made by Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England to the life and achievements of the United Kingdom.\n&#xa0;\nIf th\ne Scottish Referendum opts for movement away from the Union, the proposals below still hold that the history of the UK has been of a great net value to all the current population, and should continue to resound in the culture and progress of the devolving \nentities for the present and foreseeable future\n. There will be a Monarchy in common, most likely a common currency, certainly a language in common (albeit with differences to conserve and celebrate) and there will continue to be a huge Scottish presence a\nnd influence in the rest of the UK.\n&#xa0;\nP1  I\n propose therefore that the British Broadcasting Corporation should continue to be named, thus – even if the Scottish Broadcasting Corporation (likely based in Glasgow) continues under that name. The SBC would cont\ninue to make and share a great deal of the programming made on both sides of the border.\n&#xa0;\nP2  There should be a Public Service Broadcasting TrustThis would have two Divisions –\n a Cor(poration\n) Division and a Com(mercial\n) Division*The PSBT would look to \nthe public, its audience and encourage \nReithian\n ideals of\nBroadcasting.\n  \nThis ‘outward facing’ stance would serve to:\nhelp\n the population to realize that the whole effort is in “their” \nie\n OUR interest;\nreduce\n the number of people now before the courts as \nl\nicence\n payment defaulters;\nThe PSBT \nCorDiv\n would attend to matters at the BBC.\nThe PSBT \nComDiv\n would attend to all content made and offered on all other “platforms”.\nThe PSBT should be financed by a first slice off the \nLicence\n Revenue – thus\nthe\n regulation\n of BOTH BBC AND COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING would be\npaid\n for directly by the public and rendered answerable to the public.\nThe PSBT should have \na strong and published Audience Research function – measuring\nSatisfaction, and assessing allegations of harms and\n other negative functions\n*this would replace \nOfcom’s\n activities in the regulation of broadcasting; necessary\nlegislation\n would have to be enacted.\n&#xa0;\nThe PSBT (especially \nCorDiv\n) would \ndraw back from dramatizing the ‘emotionalpenumbra’ of sports – footbal\nlers post goal antics, spraying of (mock?) “\nchampagne\n”\nover\n winning\n teams – such \nbehaviour\n simply not being broadcast. Managers and sports\npeople\n would presently learn to reserve their energies for sport, and not apparently\ncontribute\n to “lad culture” acti\nvities.\n&#xa0;\nThe PSBT would \ncontinue to assess fairness in the coverage of politics, with special\nassessment\n drawn from small sectors of the public identified by test as being already well\ninformed\n on matters in focus.\n&#xa0;\nThe PSBT would undertake and publish the\n results of \nrigorous assessment of newventures such as the introduction of broadcasting from court proceedings.\n&#xa0;\nThe PSBT would encourage a return to the use of \n“educated English” in diction and in\ndeployment of syntax.  For announcers of news \nparticularly  but\n also in documentary\npresentation  this\n would entail current best practice including speakers with “\nPerthshire\n”\nScottish and “educated Welsh and Northern Ireland” delivery.\n  It would discourage\n“\nestuarisation\n” (see footnote for observed ex\namples)\n. There should be an internal\nconsultant on pronunciation of foreign words (preferably as foreign speakers say them –\nthus\n “\narf\n-\ngharn\n-is-tarn” rather than \naff\n-\ngann\n-is-\ntann\n, and hybrid variants incorporating\nsome\n long and some short vowels).\n&#xa0;\nThe PSBT should encourage the \nreduction of “gristle” (as in ‘connective tissue’ in the body)\nmanifest\n in continuity and cross channel announcements on BBC and risked at the possible\ncost\n in audience sizes on commercial channels; it should also discourage t\nhe foible of\nshowing\n newsrooms behind the newsreader – the news is NOT about who collects and\npresents\n it – but about the world outside.\n&#xa0;\nThe PSBT should discourage the practice of assuming that 100% of the audience has access\nto\n the internet and will use \nit. The ONS estimates that several million households do not have\ninternet\n access and several million individuals do not have or use telephone access to the\ninternet\n. Thus broadcast invitations to audience members to respond should not, as now,\npoint\n to i\nnternet access but should point out to people that they can write or telephone\nand\n in the latter case that there will be a human being there to answer calls. This is to\nmake response access more fairly available to all.\n&#xa0;\nThe PSBT should \nassess (and publish) responses from people with handicaps of hearing\nand\n of vision as to the quality of attempts to help them – thus speech on radio (and in TV\ndrama\n and documentary) should not be overly encumbered by “atmospheric” music which\nin\n reality provides camouflage,\n and the subtitling services, while often helpful, equally\noften\n are very poor and frustrating. Subtitles in white on a white background are almost\nuseless\n and white text should be shown on a dark background rectangle.\n&#xa0;\nP3   PunishmentsBoth Divisions of the PSBT should have the power to FINE broadcasters for \ntransgressions\nof\n the regulations.  For the BBC to forfeit \nlicence\n revenue would be dysfunctional unless\nbehaviour\n was improved – to encourage this it should be considered to cut \nsalaries of heads\nof\n departments taken to task.  The money collected would go to the World Service arm.\n&#xa0;\nP4   World ServiceIt was not a good idea to have the World Service financed by the Foreign Office\n and nor is\nit\n a good idea to have it paid for by \nlic\nence\n payers many thousands of whom are not able to\nafford\n it for domestic broadcasting.  The occasion of a new charter and \nlicence\n review should\nbe\n used to arrange to have the \nWorld Service paid for from the DFID budget for the most\npart\n, bolstered by ‘as-\nand-when’ additions from fines for contravention of regulations.\n&#xa0;\nP5    Volumes of AdvertisingComDiv\n should retrieve the responsibility for advertising control, relinquished so \nswiftly by\nOfcom\n when it was established – and \nComDiv\n should consider whether \nthe amount of\nadvertising\n broadcast for its own services by the BBC should fall within reasonable limits\nset\n by what research shows the viewers consider tolerable.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nIt has been estimated that there are (in 2011) approximately three quarters of a million of people born in Scotland who live in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, \nwhich\n represents 15 per cent of the population living in Scotland; a smaller though similar\n number of people born in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, live in Scotland. \n \nIt is sometimes said that the era of BROADCASTING has ended and with it, the supremacy of the BBC. Neither of these notions is true. Very recent audience measurements by BA\nRB show that some sort of television or download facility is switched on in a household for over 25 hours a week and the BBC’s two main channels gather over a quarter of “viewing” time.\n   \nSee: \nhttp://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-total-viewing-summary\n&#xa0;\n \nE\ng\n: \nA misogynist culture has recently been \nreported in British Universities and\n,,\n while this is not a direct outcome of ‘the culture of the airwaves’ it \nshould \nbe \nestablished\n that the broadcasting world, in its quest for “youth audiences” is NO\nT abetting an\ny such hostilities.
