[[[Monty the Money Dog ]]]A multi channelled communication approach to helps tenants in East Kent with their rent

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Summary of case study]]]With the country facing some of the toughest economic times set against a background of the biggest welfare shake up the housing industry has seen for decades, it could be considered a small miracle for an organisation to bring down rent arrears and evictions for the second year running.  But that’s exactly what East Kent Housing has done through the implementation of a new multi channelled communications approach which transformed the way they supported tenants to pay their rent.

[[[This new personalised approach included:]]]

[[[What are the successes?]]]The team have brought down tenant arrears for two years running.  This is a reduction of £106,239 compared to when East Kent Housing took over rent collection when we launched in April 2011.  Evictions for rent arrears have fallen by 64%.   The multi-channel communication campaign has been an overwhelming success including 100% increase in website visitors in the last year (10,000 new visits).  Our ‘Tenant made’ Benefit Changes film has had over 1,200 views and over 80% of tenants affected by the benefit changes have been contacted and offered support.
