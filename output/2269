[normal]Our “Mozal” aluminium smelter in Mozambique is a good illustration of how investments 
[normal]by the natural resources industry 
[normal]can support broader economic development
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I
[normal]n 1998 Mozambique was emerging from 17 years of civil war
[normal] and making the difficult transition to a market based economy.  The country was hampered by weak institutions, few people had the training to build or work at a plant like Mozal
[normal],
[normal] and malaria was endemic.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Development of the project was backed by 
[normal]the 
[normal]Mozambique
[normal] government, the UK, 
[normal]the 
[normal]EU and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Wor
[normal]l
[normal]d Bank to help:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With a budget of $1.2 billion, the project was the largest ever foreign investment 
[normal]and largely achieved its goals. 
[normal]Mozambique is expected to become a middle income country 
[normal]and has received substantial overseas investment in recent years. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Mozal
[normal] has made a significant contribution 
[normal]to 
[normal]this progress. The smelter has 
[normal]contributed
[normal] 3-6% of the country’s GDP each year.  It employs 1200 people and 600 contractors directly and contributes to indirect job creation of approximately 6500 people.  Thousands o
[normal]f people have trained at Mozal 
[normal]and 
[normal]93% of its employees are from Mozambique. The government is a shareholder and receives a proportional share of dividends.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Last year, 
[normal]Mozal
[normal] spent approximately $460 million with local businesses, including over 150 small 
[normal]suppliers that were established with support from Mozlink – an enterprise development program implemented by BHP Billiton to help spread the benefits of development. 
[normal] 
[normal]The construction of Mozal also supported the construction of new power lines bringing pow
[normal]er from South Africa to Mozambique 
[normal]providing reliable power to
[normal] the south of 
[normal]the country supporting development more broadly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The company’s successful healthcare programs have reduced the incidence of malaria in the local community from over 85% to less than 6%; and cut the HIV infection rate from 19% to 5%.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition, 
[normal]The Mozal Community Development Trust (MCDT) was establi
[normal]shed by BHP Billiton in 2000 
[normal]and
[normal] has initiated roughly 200 projects, focusing on quality of life, increasing access to healthcare, clean water and sanitation and poverty alleviation.
