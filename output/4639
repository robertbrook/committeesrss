defaultWritten evidence from Colin Weaver (HCS0004)default&#xa0;defaultExcessive Noise in Helicopters causing Crew defaultissues ?default&#xa0;defaultAs I have explained in another note, I worked in the Oil Industry for many years.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat always struck me on the big Helicopters like the Super Puma was the very high noise level in the passenger 
defaultcompartment, even whilst wearing a headset and foam ear plugs.
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom my experience in my early days working in an Oil Refinery Power Station, and later on visiting Oil Platforms, is that even with ear protection, that somehow excessive noise impedes concen
defaulttration, and possibly spatial awareness.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn that helicopters are built to a weight limit (
defaultie
default flimsy), and that the 15 (
defaultish
default) seat helicopters have very powerful and noisy engines, and a gearbox or two whirring away, along with the rotor blade vortex noise,
default I wonder what it is like to be continually exposed to this noise as a Pilot. The crew also have only a plastic windscreen canopy to shield them from noise, along with their headset.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, helicopters can create very low frequency noise, some of wh
defaultich can be felt rather than heard, and which is very difficult to attenuate.
default&#xa0;
defaultI would suggest that some sort of study of the effects of these very high noise levels on pilot performance (and potential hearing loss) is carried out, especially at the end of 
defaulta shift.
