Written evidence from Mrs Christine Talbot (LTC 28)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I am a State Registered Nur
[normal]se and 
[normal]Lymphoedema
[normal] Practitioner, specialising in the care and practice of 
[normal]lymphoedema
[normal] management 
[normal]in the Dorset area
[normal] for seven years
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I see a wide range of patients with both primary and secondary 
[normal]lymphoedemas
[normal], 
[normal]lipoedemas
[normal] and combined pathologies.
[normal] 
[normal]Secondary 
[normal]lymphoedemas
[normal] are as a result of surgery, trauma or chronic illnesses
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the main
[normal] patients pay private
[normal]ly for their treatment;
[normal] 
[normal]until recently a few had Primary Care Trust funding,
[normal] funding
[normal] which has now been withdrawn
[normal],
[normal] regardless
[normal] of necessity.
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]s yet no funded care package has been implemented
[normal] in its place
[normal] by the individual General Practitioner surgeries
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]District Nurses claim they cannot offer such specialised treatment, neither would they have th
[normal]e time to do so, thus as a traditional ‘Nightingale’ nurse, I am
[normal] treat
[normal]ing clinically dependent 
[normal]lymphoedema
[normal] patients for free
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Equally patients on social benefits or very limited incomes and other specific financial short falls
[normal], are seen on a reduced rate, treatment is paramount to their well being
[normal],
[normal] without which they could incur all manner of complications, infection, chronic pain and associated disabilities
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Ironically, 
[normal]without
[normal] 
[normal]my clinical 
[normal]lymphoedema
[normal] skills
[normal], these patients would
[normal] 
[normal]come under the NHS financial umbrella and
[normal] 
[normal]receive costly inappropriate care and medication for their condition.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In general the NHS 
[normal]has
[normal] 
[normal]neither
[normal] the
[normal] training,
[normal] the
[normal] interest
[normal],
[normal] nor sufficient knowledge of 
[normal]lymphoedema
[normal] and its multifaceted complexities
[normal], nor
[normal] any realistic
[normal] understanding of 
[normal]ongoing, lifelong dependency on healthcare
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A few NHS or charity associated 
[normal]Lymphoedema
[normal] Clinics offer a limited service of six monthly limb 
[normal]measurementsappointments
[normal] and supplying of hosiery.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would advocate,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I look forward with interest to the outcome of the House of Commons Inquiry into lon
[normal]g term conditions and care
[normal] requirements
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]So too, as to
[normal] whether there will be future opportunity and funding for education and enlightenment
[normal] with regards to a 
[normal]most debilitating, clinically
[normal] complex and
[normal] socially and psychologically demanding and depressing condition for those afflicted
[normal].
