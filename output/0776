Written evidence from Mrs Christine Talbot (LTC 28)default&#xa0;
defaultI am a State Registered Nur
defaultse and 
defaultLymphoedema
default Practitioner, specialising in the care and practice of 
defaultlymphoedema
default management 
defaultin the Dorset area
default for seven years
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultI see a wide range of patients with both primary and secondary 
defaultlymphoedemas
default, 
defaultlipoedemas
default and combined pathologies.
default 
defaultSecondary 
defaultlymphoedemas
default are as a result of surgery, trauma or chronic illnesses
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the main
default patients pay private
defaultly for their treatment;
default 
defaultuntil recently a few had Primary Care Trust funding,
default funding
default which has now been withdrawn
default,
default regardless
default of necessity.
default 
defaultA
defaults yet no funded care package has been implemented
default in its place
default by the individual General Practitioner surgeries
default,
default 
defaultDistrict Nurses claim they cannot offer such specialised treatment, neither would they have th
defaulte time to do so, thus as a traditional ‘Nightingale’ nurse, I am
default treat
defaulting clinically dependent 
defaultlymphoedema
default patients for free
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultEqually patients on social benefits or very limited incomes and other specific financial short falls
default, are seen on a reduced rate, treatment is paramount to their well being
default,
default without which they could incur all manner of complications, infection, chronic pain and associated disabilities
default.
default 
defaultIronically, 
defaultwithout
default 
defaultmy clinical 
defaultlymphoedema
default skills
default, these patients would
default 
defaultcome under the NHS financial umbrella and
default 
defaultreceive costly inappropriate care and medication for their condition.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn general the NHS 
defaulthas
default 
defaultneither
default the
default training,
default the
default interest
default,
default nor sufficient knowledge of 
defaultlymphoedema
default and its multifaceted complexities
default, nor
default any realistic
default understanding of 
defaultongoing, lifelong dependency on healthcare
default.
default 
defaultA few NHS or charity associated 
defaultLymphoedema
default Clinics offer a limited service of six monthly limb 
defaultmeasurementsappointments
default and supplying of hosiery.
default&#xa0;
defaultI would advocate,
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI look forward with interest to the outcome of the House of Commons Inquiry into lon
defaultg term conditions and care
default requirements
default.
default 
defaultSo too, as to
default whether there will be future opportunity and funding for education and enlightenment
default with regards to a 
defaultmost debilitating, clinically
default complex and
default socially and psychologically demanding and depressing condition for those afflicted
default.
