[[[ Diabetes (LTC 34)]]]Sanofi Diabetes works closely with healthcare professionals from across the diabetes care pathway, including diabetologists, diabetes specialist nurses and GPs with a special interest as well as allied and public health professionals. Through its support of the Diabetes Parliamentary Think Tank, chaired by Adrian Sanders MP, and its work with the Primary Care Diabetes Society (PCDS), Sanofi has developed a picture of the current management of diabetes in the NHS and the concerns of those working to deliver diabetes care. The following written submission draws on discussion and consultation with these individual groups, but is representative of Sanofi’s position only.

[[[Summary]]]

[[[Response ]]]Local professional networks are also valuable in engendering the flow of information, skills and knowledge across the pathway. At a time when professional education budgets are severely restricted, professional clinical networks can play a significant role in improving levels of specialist knowledge in the community. Secondly it is vital that commissioners and providers have access to data relating to individual patients, local health outcomes and service performance from across the pathway, both nationally and from within their own locality. The KPDOH Expert Working Group recommended that strategies for sharing patient information should be explored, specifically taking on the challenge of patient consent. Patients expect healthcare professionals to have all of the information necessary to make informed decisions about their care, yet barriers remain that prevent the necessary transparency. We welcome the publication of Best practice for commissioning diabetes services: An integrated care framework, a document co-produced by NHS Diabetes, the Department of Health and leading patient and professional associations. It was further observed that the present system of tariff payments provides secondary care diabetes specialists with a perverse incentive, encouraging them to treat simpler cases to maximise profit for their Trust, rather than focus on the more complex patients who require more attention and therefore more resource. The Think Tank agreed that in order to enable greater integration of care, the financial model needs to match the model of care that it is meant to deliver. It was suggested that if healthcare professionals were placed within an incentive system which encouraged joint working, the service would transform itself accordingly. Furthermore, there needs to be greater clarity as to the exact size of local diabetes budgets, and who is responsible for the allocation of funds across the entire integrated pathway. In addition to redressing the balance of incentives, it is imperative that Health and Wellbeing Boards place emphasis on the importance of integrated diabetes service provision in their Joint Strategic Needs Assessments (JSNAs). There are a number of integrated diabetes care models working successfully in the NHS including models in Derby, Portsmouth and North West London. However, it is important to note that there is no ‘one-size fits all’ model which commissioners should seek to deliver in every locality. The availability of a choice of models will be greatly desirable in providing a service tailored to the specific needs of the local health economy. &#xa0;Full details of these case studies are available here (pp.23 – 39): http://www.pcdsociety.org/media/Keeping_People_with_Diabetes_out_of_Hosptial_-_A_report_by_the_Primary_Care_Diabetes_Society.pdf&#xa0;Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust has developed a model for managing and treating people with diabetes in their care. A diabetes lead has been appointed within the Trust to support this vulnerable group of patients. Early evidence demonstrates a positive impact on patient outcomes. More details of this model are available in the KPDOH Expert Working Group’s report.May 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; The Diabetes Think Tank is a parliamentary forum chaired by Adrian Sanders MP. The Think Tank has been meeting in Westminster since 2008 and is designed to bring together policy makers, patient group representatives and clinical diabetes specialists from across the diabetes care pathway to discuss and propose solutions to current challenges faced by the diabetes community. Sanofi supports the Think Tank by the way of a grant and has no editorial control over its recommendations.  In 2011, the Primary Care Diabetes Society (PCDS) convened the Keeping People with Diabetes out of Hospital (KPDOH) Expert Working Group. This group produced a policy report on hospital avoidance strategies in diabetes available here: http://www.pcdsociety.org/media/Keeping_People_with_Diabetes_out_of_Hosptial_-_A_report_by_the_Primary_Care_Diabetes_Society.pdf Sanofi supported PCDS with the KPDOH project by the way of a grant and had no editorial control over its recommendations.
