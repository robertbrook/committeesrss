[[[ ANNOUNCED]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]“The Government will secure the universal postal service for the benefit of all users by securing Royal Mail’s future through the introduction of private sector capital and associate disciplines. This will be achieved through:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; delivering a sale of shares in Royal Mail within this Parliament;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; creating an employee share scheme that, as Parliament has decided, will lead to at least 10% of the company in employee ownership, to drive stronger staff engagement; and&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; delivering a financial outcome for the taxpayer, which when considered in the context of the overarching policy objective, represents overall value for money.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The institutional offer and the retail offer opened on 27 September and are expected to close on 8 October 2013. Conditional dealings are expected to commence on 11 October and Admission to the London Stock Exchange is expected to take place on 15 October.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; HMG intends to dispose of a majority stake including, leaving HMG with a residual holding between 30%. and 49.9%. The Base Offer size will be between 40.1 per cent. and 52.2 per cent. of Royal Mail’s share capital, with additional shares representing up to 15 per cent. of the Base Offer also being made available through over-allotment Arrangements. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, 10 per cent of Royal Mail shares will be made available for free to around 150,000 eligible UK-based Royal Mail employees under the Employee Share Scheme. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The expected Offer price range is 260p to 330p per Share, implying a market capitalisation on Admission of between £2,600 million and £3,300 million.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; HM Government currently envisages that around 70 per cent. of the Base Offer will be allocated to institutional investors.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The IPO includes a Retail offer, enabling members of the public located in the UK to apply for shares through intermediaries or direct to Government. The minimum application size for members of the public is £750. Eligible Royal Mail employees can apply through the Employee Priority Offer which has a minimum application size of £500. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Royal Mail intends to propose a final dividend only, to be paid in July 2014, of £133 million.
