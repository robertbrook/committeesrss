"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Bbf Biochar Cic (CCS08)&#xa0;\nBiochar is the charcoal-like solid product of heating biomass in very low-oxygen \nconditions. Biochar usually contains a lot of carbon which is tightly fixed in molecules that are resistant to microbial breakdown, meaning that the carbon persists in soil for hundreds to thousands of years  - long enough to be a useful way of reducing th\ne CO\n2\n concentration in the atmosphere. Biochar is also a soil improver – it adds nutrients, modulates the pH, helps to store moisture in dry soils, increases the microbial activity, changes the soil structure, and so on. Biochar can make a major contribution to\n the \nUK\n’s decarbonisation ambitions – especially in relation to the land-use, agricultural and bioenergy sectors – while enhancing the long-term health of soils. \nThe \npotential\n role of biochar in reducing carbon is between \n3.5 to 22 million tonnes CO2 abatement per year \n(benefitting\n \nbetween 4 and 28%\n of \nthe \nUK\n’s\n agricultural land\n over a 20 year period\n)\n.\n \nHowever, biochar is a relatively new idea and much work remains to be done on making the underpinning technologies reliable and economically viable and on de\nmonstrating the value of biochar in agricultural and other settings.  The UK Government can assist by establishing a carb\non offsetting value for biochar \nallowing trading into the EU ETS  (as is already allowed for CO\n2\n capture and geological storage) and/or\n allowing biochar to contribute to meeting company or organizational carbon\n emission reduction\n targets.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe British Biochar\n Foundation (BBF) CIC\n. was founded in 2013 to represent the wide range of individuals, groups, companies and other organisations in the UK which have an interest in biochar. The BBF has 197 individual members (as of August 2013) and the members come from research and developme\nnt, private sector, consultancy, public sector, nature and conservation bodies, community groups and charities. In June 2013, 110 BBF members participated in the BBF’s inaugural event in Oxford.  In August 2013, a new Board has been established and will me\net for the first time in September. The aim of the BBF is to represent the emerging biochar sector in the UK in all its diversity. Our submission reflects the opinions of the BBF Board.  \n&#xa0;\nBiochar is a solid \ncharcoal\n-like\n \nmaterial, \nobtained from thermochemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment that is used for the long-term storage of carbon in the environment and for soil improvement. Because the carbon in \nbiochar is derived from CO\n2\n through photosynthesis, there is the potential for biochar to be a carbon-negative energy generation \ntechnology\n, through beneficial use of the energy produced during its manufacture.\n A study undertaken for DEFRA and DECC in 2009\n \n(\nShackley and Sohi, 2010\n)\n \nconcluded that biochar could contribute between\n 3.5\n million tonnes\n (Mt)\n C\nO\n2\n (equivalent) abatement per year to \n22\n \nMt\nC\nO\n2\neq\n abatement per year \ndepending on \nscenario, this representing 0.3 – 3% of 1990 UK greenhouse gas emissions or\n 1.5 – 10% of the emission r\neductions required by 2020 (\nTable 1).\n (In this note, we will convert all carbon and non-CO\n2\n greenhouse gases into units of CO\n2\n equivalence or CO\n2\neq using conventional conversion factors). \nThe wide range is explained by uncertain\nty regarding the quantity of available biomass feedstocks, with the very high scenario implying that a reasonable percentage of suitable, sustainable biomass feedstocks are directed towards biochar production. \nCarbon abatement from agriculture and forestr\ny as whole f\nor the UK is c. 50 M\ntCO2eq. A study for the Committee on Climate Change calculated emissions reductions from UK agriculture and soils of between 1.5 and 10  MtCO\n2\neq per year (assuming a maximum abatement cost of ≤£100/tCO\n2\neq) (MacLeod et al., 2\n010). The potentially large \nrole of biochar\n in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from \nagriculture \ncomes from using\n a large amount of organic waste\n (\nmuch of which is not currently used effectively for other purposes)\n and avoiding its decomposition to methan\ne\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAgricultural land application of biochar under two scenarios of \nbiochar use: 10/1 and 30/1 (in million hectares)\nFeedstock availability\nCO\n2\neq abate\nd in million tonnes \nBiochar production in million tonnes  \n10 t ha\n-1\n first year, then 1 t ha\n-1\n \n(20 y horizon)  \n30 t ha\n-1\n first year, then 1 t ha\n-1\n \n(20 y horizon)  \n% of existing agricultural land (11.9 million ha) \nLower resource  \n3.6\n1\n0.7\n0.4\n3.5 - 6 %\nHigher Resource\n15.9\n3.5\n2.4\n1.4\n12 – 20% \nHigh resource\n21.9\n4.7\n3.3\n1.9\n16 – 28%\n&#xa0;\nTable 1: Preliminary and provisional estimate of annual biochar production and carbon abatement in the UK using three scenarios for virgin and non-virgin biomass feedstock and the resulting land-use implications.  \n(source: Shackley et al. 2011\n).\n&#xa0;\nTable 1 a\nlso indicates the area of land which might be implicated in biochar deployment under each scenario. The key message is that available or suitable land is much less likely to be a constraint than availability of suitable feedstocks.\n \nA methodology has been d\neveloped\n, based upon \nadapting \nexisting\n \nLCA tools, \nfor calculating the CO\n2\neq benefits of biochar across its life-cycle and published in the Biochar Quality Mandate (2013). \nThe UK government has\n \nno policy on encouraging biochar, though some government agencies such as the Environment Agency, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and WRAP have expressed s\nupport for re-using wastes more\n \nproductively\n \n through biochar production. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhether the \nUK\n will benefit from biochar depends upon: a) the biochar sector taking off globally, b) the \nUK\n supporting an active involvement in the sector.  It will come as no sur\nprise to the Committee, that we are firmly of the view that (a) will happen and that (b) is highly desirable. The \nUK\n has expertise in soil science, soil amendments, agricultural research (arable, livestock, \nhorticulture) and pyrolysis engineering and techn\nology which, together, constitute the key\n resources and capabilities required to enable successful biochar innovation. \n&#xa0;\nBiochar is not only about carbon \nstorage, it is\n also a way of improving soil fertility and crop productivity. \nDespite a high variabilit\ny of UK field trial results, there are examples of statistically significant yield gains\n in barley and grasslands (Jones et al., 2012; Hammond et al., 2013). \nFurther R&amp;D is underway to understand the optimum crop-soil-weather-management regimes required \nfor biochar benefits in the UK. At the global scale, a recent meta-analysis of 371 independent studies reported that the addition of biochar to soils resulted, on average, in increased above ground productivity and crop yield (Biederman &amp; Harpole, 201\n3\n)\n. \nR\necent research in China and Australia has been testing blends of biochar and synthetic chemical fertilizer and this has been showing some impressive crop yield increases, suggesting that the way forwards is to use smaller amounts of biochar more productive\nly. \n \nThere is reasonable evidence that biochar allows the more efficient utilisation of added nutrients, especially nitrogen. The same \ncrop yield may be obtained with a lower synthetic fertiliser input as a consequence, reducing: costs, associated GHG emis\nsions from fertiliser manufacture and potential nitrate run-off pollution: all-in-all \ncompetitive low carbon farming.\n&#xa0;\nAt present\n charcoal production is \ndeployed around the world at small\n scale, and there are several manufact\nurers of medium scale devices.  \nHowever the larger scale plant, for continuous production of biochar, syngas and/or bio-liquids\n,\n  is not at a high technology readin\ness level due to lack of demand hence investment. \nUnti\nl such time as there are reliably operating pyrolysis plants at the right cost, biochar will not be deploye\nd  on any large scale.\n \nThere are, nonetheless, pioneering companies which are developing clean, efficient and controllable biochar production at smal\nl to large scales\n (e.g. Pyrreg and Black is Green)\n. \nTo develop such technical systems requires sufficient \ninvestment by the private sector, including firms with the necessary technical and engineering competencies. This investment will occur when one or mo\nre of the fo\nllowing happen: \n&#xa0;\n \nOnce re\nliable larger scale systems have been deve\nloped, the costs of producing biochar \nin the UK\n \nare likely to range from £-100/t to £400/t.  \nThe negative figure \nwould be where organic waste streams are used, with a gate fee  for waste\ns input to the production pl\nant \n(Shackley et al., 2011). The average production cost across a wide range of feedstocks (including organic wastes) is £118 per tonne biochar. \n&#xa0;\nThe marginal abatement cost for carbon (MACC) ranges from £200 per tCO\n2\n to £-150 per tCO\n2 \n(ibid.), with an \naverage value of £57 per tCO\n2\n (ibid.). If only clean non-waste feedstocks are considered both production cost and MACC are may be 1/3 higher. The MACC value is competitive with energy technologies such as CCS (geological variant) and offshore renewables, t\nhough the levelised cost of electricity generation is higher than conventional biomass (depending on how efficiently li\nquids and gases are utilized\n and \non the \nefficiency of heat recovery in conventional biomass utilisation\n).  \n&#xa0;\nThe agronomic value of bioch\nar wi\nth current applications is \nunlikely to be as high as \nthe average biochar production cost (\n£118 per tonne\n)\n. As a rule of thumb, one tonne of biochar abates one tonne of CO\n2\neq.\n \n DEFRA has set the shadow cost of carbon at between £25 and £60 per tonne C\nO\n2\neq and, if we take a nominal value of £40 per tonne CO\n2\neq\n reduction\n, this would \nrequire \na\n minimum agronomic value of £7\n8 per t\nonne biochar \nto cover production costs.  This is feasible \nin certain niche applications; biochar production costs will in any case be a lot lower than \n£118 per tonne\n in many instances. \nFor instance, if a biochar is used with a negative production cost, it would, in principle, be possible to return a profit from b\noth carbon abatement and agronomic dimensions. \n&#xa0;\nThere is\n \nno carbon credit available for biochar. The EU ETS does not include biochar and pyrolysis is unlikely to quality for entry into the EU ETS. The non-traded sector does not permit carbon off-setting o\nptions, so biochar cannot be included. Without carbon financing, successful  \nlarge scale\n development deployment of biochar is much less likely. \n&#xa0;\nRegulation is a further possible barrier to biochar development and deployment in the UK.  This is because of \nthe high level of complexity surrounding regulation of soil amendments and use of wastes.  These issues have been thoroughly addressed in the Biochar Quality Mandate (BQM),\n a document prepared by a consortium of regulators, scientists and with input from t\nhe industry and technical experts, \nwhich is c\nurrently undergoing revisions. \nBoth SEPA (201\n2\n) and the Environment Agency (2013) have issued Regulatory Position Statements (RPS) \n(\non the manufacture and use of biochar from specified wastes\n \n(mostly untreated w\nood wastes) (WST-PS-031). \n&#xa0;\nSafety issues arise from the potential risks introduced by toxicants in the biochar (heavy metals, organic molecules), from pyrolysis operations that are dirty and produce particles and fugitive emissions of gases\n such as carbon monoxide, methane and nitrous oxide (greenhouse gases) and from the unsustainable sourcing of biomass. Other minor health and safety issues concern application of a dusty material to soil requiring good practice such as wetting and wearing \nface masks, etc.  All these issues have been addressed in gu\nidance and assessment documents \nincluding those of the International Biochar Initiative (IBI), the European Biochar Certificate (EBC) and the BQM for the UK context in particular. The bottom-line \nis that if biochar is sourced from carefully managed feedstocks, is produced from modern controlled pyrolysis equipment and is properly tested prior to soil addition, safety concerns can be adequately addressed. \n&#xa0;\nSeveral \ncountries have provided incentives for biochar RD&amp;D, in particular China and the USA. Schemes in China have been promoting removal of straw from fields for use as a biochar feedstock rather than straw burn\ning in\n \nfield which causes air pollution.  Pyrolysis\n can be included in existing \nrenewable bioenergy\n incentive schemes \nthrough electricity generation from syngas (\nin the UK\n via ROCs and FiTs\n), though more mature technologies such as direct biomass combustion \nare \nlower risk.  \nB\niochar is an energy dense by-pr\noduct, reducing the generation of bioenergy from a given mass of\n biomass compared to combustion, even though the overall carbon abatement of pyrolysis-biochar is greater\n than that from direct combustion\n. \nCurrent \n&#xa0;\n \nIn Japan, biochar has been officially rec\nognised and permitted as a soil amendment since 198\n4\n. In April 2013,  \n Switzerland \nbecame the first European country to \nofficially permit biochar production and use in soil, adopting the requirements of the European Biochar Certificate. \n&#xa0;The \nkey value of biochar is in carbon sequestration, where carbon\n \nis removed from the atmosphere for\n 100’s to 1000’s of years. T\nhe atmosphere \nalready \nholds 400ppm\n yet the safe level is believed to lie somewhere between 350 and 45\n0ppm with no let-up in CO\n2\n emis\nsions to atmosphere. \nTherefore regardless of actions to decarbonise the UK’s energy system it is necessary to also remove CO\n2 \nfrom the atmosphere to reduce present concentrations to a safe level. Biochar provides a relatively safe and cheap method of doing\n this, which can be deployed at various scales and at speed should it be so desired.  The UK potential\n for biochar is estimated at \n3.5 to 22 million tonnes CO\n2\n abatement \nper year\n \n(benefitting\n \nbetween 4 and 28%\n of \nthe \nUK\n’s\n agricultural land\n over a 20 year p\neriod\n)\n.\n \n&#xa0;References Biederman, L., Harpole, S.

(2010),  An Assessment of the Benefits and Issues Associated with the Application of Biochar to Soil,  Defra + Decc,  London. \n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nDepending \nupon feedstock and technology-scale, avoided emissions were 1.0–1.4\n&#xa0;\nt\n&#xa0;\nCO\n2\neq\n&#xa0;\nt\n&#x2011;\n1\n&#xa0;\noven \nd\nry (o.d.)\n feedstock in slow \npyrolysis.\n This compares with an avoided emission of 0.55 t CO\n2\neq t\n&#x2011;\n1\n o.d. for straw combustion at 33% efficiency. Hence, for straw, there is \nan additiona\nl 80% carbon abatement from pyrolysis-biochar \n(on an LCA basis) compared to combustion. The Carbon A\nbatement Efficiency (CAE) of pyrolysis-biochar\n compared to combustion improves as the full life-cycle impacts are incorporated, this being due t\no the indirect effects of biochar in the soil. The l\nargest contribution to pyrolysis-biochar carbon \nabatement (40–50%) is from stabilised feedstock carbon. The next largest contribution is from the indirect impacts of biochar in the soil (lower crop \nfertiliser requirement, lower soil N\n2\nO emissions, increased SOC, etc): these hypothesised impacts are based only upon a few studies and stand in need of far better evidence. The indirect impacts account for 25–40% of CA, the proportion changing with the si\nze of other CA categories. The final major CA category is fossil-fuel offsets from renewable electricity generation, 10–25% of total CA. \n \nExpressed in terms of carbon emissions \nper unit of delivered energy, pyrolysis-biochar \nabates (i.e. avoids the emissi\non of) between 1.5–2.0\n&#xa0;\nkg\n&#xa0;\nCO\n2\neq\n&#xa0;\nkWh\n-1\n. This compares with an average emission of 0.5\n&#xa0;\nkg\n&#xa0;\nCO\n2\n&#xa0;\nkWh\n-1\n arising from the national electricity grid in 2008. The Environment Agency estimates that the carbon emission factor for electricity generation from many biom\nass feedstocks is between 0.05–0.30\n&#xa0;\nkg\n&#xa0;\nCO\n2\neq\n&#xa0;\nkWh\n-1\n \n(Environment Agency, 2009)\n. Hence, \npyrolysis-biochar\n may be a more efficient way of abating carbon than alternative uses of \nbiomass feedstock\n. Likewise, it \n results in the abatement of approximately 7–30\n&#xa0;\nt\n&#xa0;\nCO\n2\neq\n&#xa0;\nha\n-1\n&#xa0;\nyr\n-1 \nfor dedicated feedstocks\n. These numbers fall within, but also exceed, the range of the first generation biofuel system with the highest CAE – namely bioethanol from sugarcane\n \n(10–16\n&#xa0;\nt\n&#xa0;\nCO\n2\neq\n&#xa0;\nha\n-1\n&#xa0;\nyr\n-1\n) and are much larger than most bioenergy crops and biofuel feedstocks (e.g. biodiesel from rapeseed, soy or sunflower gives a saving of 0.5\n–4.0\n&#xa0;\nt\n&#xa0;\nCO\n2\neq\n&#xa0;\nha\n-1\n&#xa0;\nyr\n-1\n) \n(Cherubini et al., 2009)\n; UK bioelectricity systems, meanwhile, give a saving of between 1–7\n&#xa0;\nt\n&#xa0;\nCO\n2\neq\n&#xa0;\nha\n-1\n yr\n-1\n \n(Thornley, 2009)\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
