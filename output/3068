defaultPreliminary work and emerging findingsdefault&#xa0;defaultTo date the SPRC has collected evidence from stake holders at local, national and at EU level on a range of initiatives to tackle 
defaultyouth unemploymentdefault across England.  In addition, we are investigating how EU initiatives may be shaping national and local policies in the English context. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the next phase of the study we will be working closely with schools to collect both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (in-depth interviews and focus groups) on young people’s aspirations and expectations around schooling, training and employment as well as their involvement in specific programmes and initiatives. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThus, although we have limited evidence to share with the select committee at this time, over the next few years, for example a first project paper with preliminary findings on 31 January 2014.  In subsequent years we will have rich data addressing these important issues.
