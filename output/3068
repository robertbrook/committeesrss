[normal]Submission to the Select Committee on the European Union[bold]Call for Evidence on EU action to tackle youth unemployment [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]Social Policy Research Centre (SPRC) at Middlesex University[bold] is the UK partner in a new research project, funded by the EU Framework 7 programme, to investigate early school leaving across nine partner countries.  
[normal]RESL.eu[bold] (Reducing Early School Leaving in Europe) runs from 2013-2018 and has the following objectives:

[normal]Further information of the project are available on the SPRC website
[normal]http://sprc.info/reducing-early-school-leaving-in-europe/
[normal]and on the official RESL.eu website:

[normal]Preliminary work and emerging findings[bold]&#xa0;[bold]To date the SPRC has collected evidence from stake holders at local, national and at EU level on a range of initiatives to tackle 
[normal]youth unemployment[bold] across England.  In addition, we are investigating how EU initiatives may be shaping national and local policies in the English context. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the next phase of the study we will be working closely with schools to collect both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (in-depth interviews and focus groups) on young people’s aspirations and expectations around schooling, training and employment as well as their involvement in specific programmes and initiatives. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Thus, although we have limited evidence to share with the select committee at this time, over the next few years, for example a first project paper with preliminary findings on 31 January 2014.  In subsequent years we will have rich data addressing these important issues.
