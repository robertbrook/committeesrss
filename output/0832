default&#xa0;
default1. Introductiondefault and summarydefault&#xa0;default1.1 defaultThe Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) is the leading medical authority on mental health in the United Kingdom and is the professional and educational organisation for doctors specialising in psychiatry.
default&#xa0;
default1.2default defaultLiaison psychiatry is the sub-specialty which provides psychiatric treatment to patients attending general hospitals, whether they attend out-patient clinics, accident 
defaultand
default emergency departments or are admitted to in-patient wards.
default&#xa0;
defaultTherefore it
default&#xa0;
defaultdeals with the interface between physical and psychological health.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is now abundant evidence that medical and surgical patients have a high prevalence of psychiatric disorder which can be effectively treated with psychological or pharmacological methods.
default&#xa0;default1.3default 
defaultOur e

default on the interaction between mental health problems
default,
default such as depression and anxiety, and long
default-
defaultterm physical health conditions, and the implications 
defaultof this interaction 
defaultfor individuals, clinicians, healthcare providers and commissioners. This evidence will also be relevant to other issues under consideration by this

default&#xa0;
default2. defaultWhat constitutes a default‘defaultlongdefault-defaultterm conditiondefault’?default&#xa0;default2.1default 
defaultLong
default-
defaultterm conditions are those conditions that are long
default-
defaultlasting and not curable, but are manageable with drugs and treatment. Such conditions include 
defaultlong-term
default physical health conditions (some of which are medically unexplained) and 
defaultlong-term
default psychiatric conditions. Depression and anxiety are treatable but chronic and recurrent disorders, result
defaulting
default in considerable distress and disability. In the recent government report 
defaultLong-term
default conditions compendium of information
default, 
defaultdepression constitutes the second most common LTC, affecting nearly 5 million individuals, according to Quality and Outcomes Framework disease registers. The WHO identifies depression 
defaultas 
defaultthe leading 
defaultcause of disability in high
default-
defaultincome countries
default. Depression and anxiety must be considered when planning services for people with LTCs.
default&#xa0;default3. defaultThe problem of multimorbiditydefault&#xa0;default3.1default 
defaultThe prevalence of 
defaultlong-term
default conditions is predicted to remain fairly stable over coming years, but the prevalence of multimorbidity, where people suffer from more than 
defaultone
default LTC is likely to increase with 
defaultthe 
defaultaging of the population
default1
default. A significant proportion of this multimorbidity arises due to the co-occurrence (i.e. co-morbidity) of depression and / or anxiety with a 
defaultlong-term
default physical health condition. Around 10-20% of people with
default a
default 
defaultlong-term
default physical health condition also suffer from depression, which is about 2 to 4 times the prevalence seen in the general population. A similar percentage of people suffer from a range of other common mental disorders and symptoms, including anxiety, adjustment disorder
default and
default worry
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.2default 
defaultThe importance of depression and anxiety when present in someone who also has a 
defaultlong-term
default physical health condition is that they are associated 
defaultwith 
defaultmuch worse outcomes for the physical condition, including doubling of mortality and morbidity, worse health-related quality of life, greater healthcare utilisation and increased healthcare costs. Depression and anxiety probably exert such effects by complicating self-care
default, reducing adherence to medication, healthy diet, and exercise, and increasing maladaptive health 
defaultbehaviours
default, 
defaultsuch as
default smoking, drinking and taking illegal drugs. It has been estimated that up to 18% of the NHS costs of managing LTCs is attributable to the presence of co-morbid depression and anxiety
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4. defaultWhere is the majority of healthcare for defaultlong-term conditionsdefault provideddefault?default&#xa0;default4.1default 
defaultSpecialist secondary care services mostly focus on single diseases or disorders affecting single bodily systems and (with few exceptions) are not equipped to manage the growing numbers of people with multimorbidity. Consequently the majority of care for people with 
defaultlong-term
default conditions, particularly those with 
defaultmultimorbidity
default,
default is managed within primary care, with support for the management of specific disease provided by secondary care.
default&#xa0;default5. defaultProblems in the current systemdefault&#xa0;default5.1default 
defaultCurrent health services are not well organised to support an integrated response to patients with complex healthcare needs due to multimorbidity, because care is organised around single conditions
default. This has always been a problem in secondary care specialist services, though introduction of health policies and service targets that mostly focus on single disorders (National Service Frameworks, NICE guidance, Quality and Outcomes Framework targets) mean that primary care in now similarly affected. There is limited service organisation around multimorbidity and when multiple conditions co-exist, they are dealt with “in series” rather than “in parallel”
default, with the result than treatment of some conditions is prioritised over that of others, and some conditions never receive adequate attention. Professionals recognise the tension
defaults
default between focusing on disease
default-
defaultorientated targets and providing care that focuses on the individual needs of the patients, and that they are exacerbated in people with co-morbidity.
default&#xa0;
default5.2default 
defaultThe institutional and professional separation of mental and physical healthcare means that care becomes particularly fragmented when physical and psychological health problems co-exist
default. Depression and anxiety among people with 
defaultlong-term
default physical health conditions are often not detected, and even when they are detected often remain under-treated, due to
default:

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaulta lack of time to assess, diagnose and negotiate treatments for depression and anxiety.
default&#xa0;
default5.3default 
defaultSupport / supervision 
defaultavailable 
defaultfrom secondary care to manage such patients is very limited. For patients this failure to treat depression and anxiety leads to persistence of unpleasant psychological symptoms and 
defaulttheir 
defaultcontinued adverse impact on physical health. Inefficient and poorly co-ordinated care further adds to 
defaultthe 
defaultillness burden on patients, with repeated visits to multiple professionals. For primary healthcare professionals, depression and anxiety complicate 
defaultboth 
defaultassessments and management decision
default-
defaultmaking
default; they
default also place 
defaulta 
defaultstrain on limited resources
default, such as
default short appointment times. Such care is often split between professionals
default, for example 
defaultbetween practice nurses and psychological therapists, so inter-professional communication becomes more important but also more complicated and therefore likely to fail
default. Under such circumstances, the quality of patient care is poor and patients’ confidence in and satisfaction with the
defaultir
default healthcare can suffer as a consequence.
default&#xa0;
default6. defaultWhat do patients with multimorbidity and complex healthcare needs wantdefault?default&#xa0;default6.1default 
defaultIn a survey of public opinion, patients with LTCs sa
defaultid
default that they want 
defaultto be 
defaultsupport
defaulted
default to engage in their care and to contribute to the decisions made
default about it.
default 
defaultThey also
default want a proactive and seamless service, in which the NHS acts as a team and they are treated as a whole person
default. This is very consistent with the preferences stated by individual
defaults
default with multiple 
defaultlong-term
default conditions
default, who stressed convenience of access, continuity of care, clear communication, care that is individualised around their own unique requirements and to have their opinions heard. Considerable value is placed on care being integrated around the needs of individual patients, rather than fragmented due to 
defaulta focus on a 
defaultsingle disease
default.
default&#xa0;
default7. defaultWhat is needed to address the problems in the current systemdefault?default&#xa0;default7.1default 
defaultSome of the problems around the detection and management of depression and anxiety in people with 
defaultlong-term
default physical health complaints relate to the inadequate training of professional
defaults
default in primary and secondary care. In medical and nursing schools the emphasis on psychiatric training is placed on diagnosing and managing hospital patients with psychosis, despite the fact that very few trained doctors / nurses are ever required to treat such severe disorders. Training around detection and management of depression and anxiety in people with 
defaultlong-term
default physical health problems is virtually non-existent, despite the fact that all doctors will encounter these problems. Training in mental healthcare among qualified professional
defaults
default usually does not extend to the complexities of diagnosis and management 
defaultof
default people with 
defaultlong-term
default physical health conditions (even among psychiatrists). 
default&#xa0;
default7.2default 
defaultIn additional to training, there are broader and more deeply ingrained problems around the management of patients with multiple problems. When faced with a patient with complex needs, commonly a professional will formulate a problem list, with objectives ranked and addressed from those perceived to be 
defaultthe 
defaultmost important downwards. In current circumstances
default,
default in which resources
default, not least 
defaulttime
default, 
defaultare limited, this frequently means that not all problems 
defaultare given
default adequate priority. Mental health problems are usually seen as having minor importance, and consequently are not dealt with at all. 
default&#xa0;
default7.3default 
defaultSystems of care, such as collaborative care, which integrate psychological and physical care, have been shown to be cost-effective in primary and secondary care settings. In such care, depression and anxiety are treated at the same time as the 
defaultlong-term
default physical health condition, by the same healthcare professionals
default,
default using synergistic treatments that are coordinated. Such care is most effective when supported by supervision from experts in physical and psychological health
default, for example
default by a liaison psychiatrist. 
defaultHowever, i
defaultntegrated care such as that delivered by collaborative care is seldom available
default.
default Most of the evidence supporting 
defaultits
default use comes from the US; it remains unclear whether 
defaultit 
defaultis effective in NHS primary care setting and how 
defaultit is
default best implemented, indicating that further research is required.
default&#xa0;default8. defaultConclusionsdefault&#xa0;default8.1default 
defaultThe natural home for management of people with multimorbidity, particularly with combined physical and psychological problems, is primary care, with specialist support easily available from secondary care.
default&#xa0;
default8.2default 
defaultDepression and anxiety are common in people with 
defaultlong-term
default physical health conditions, predict worse medic
defaultal outcomes and increased costs. 
default&#xa0;
default8.3default 
defaultDepression and anxiety are usually under-detected and under-treated in people with 
defaultlong-term
default physical health conditions due to:
default&#xa0;
defaulti)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaulta lack of knowledge and skills to detect depression and anxiety, then to negotiate, initiate and monitor evidence

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultlimited resources to manage people with complex healthcare needs arising 
defaultfrom
default combined physical and psychological problems
defaultiii)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultsystemic barriers that prevent easy access to supervision and support from specialists with expertise in managing people with complex physical and psychological healthcare needs
default.
default&#xa0;
default8.4default 
defaultSystems of healthcare that integrate physical and psychological care are available, but their effectiveness in the UK is unclear, as is the best means to implement them.
default&#xa0;
default9. defaultSpecific recommendationsdefault&#xa0;default9.1default 
defaultInformed and supported self-care should remain the basis of care for many people with LTCs.
default&#xa0;
default9.2default 
defaultAppropriately resourced general practice should remain the main location 
defaultfor
default manag
defaulting
default the majority of care for people with LTCs, including patients with depression, anxiety and 
defaultlong-term
default physical health conditions. Primary healthcare professional
defaults
default skilled in the detection and management of depression and anxiety would provide integrated healthcare for 
defaultlong-term
default physical and psychological problems. For patients with the most complex needs, specific professionals could work across practices, to coordinate care, maintain continuity, promote inter-professional communication and to ensure healthcare needs are met. This professional role might look something like that of Community Matrons, though with enhanced training in the management of depression and anxiety, which was not previously considered a significant part of the professional role. Access to high
default-
defaultquality liaison psychiatry support in primary care, either via out-reach from secondary care or the development of primary care liaison psychiatry services, would assist with the supervision of care of the complex patients. Other specialist secondary care services should be available as required and available within the primary care setting wherever possible.
default&#xa0;
default9.3default 
defaultTraining of generalist healthcare practitioners in primary care should include 
defaultan 
defaultincreased focus on the causes, effects and treatments of depression and anxiety in people with 
defaultlong-term
default physical health conditions. This training should start in medical and nursing schools and should extend to qualified healthcare practitioners, with appropriate expertise being a required outcome of professional training.
default&#xa0;
default9.4default 
defaultSystems of healthcare are required 
defaultwhich 
defaultdirect delivery of treatment, maintain continuity of care, and which integrate care across 
defaultthe 
defaultboundaries of professional expertise, healthcare setting
defaults
default and service providers. Such models of care are available, some are even known to be cost-effective and are 
defaultpart of current healthcare policy, such as collaborative care (in which a particular healthcare professional takes responsibility for coordinating and integrating care), stepped care (where care is escalated to meet patient needs), and shared care (in which care for patients with specific combinations of health problems is shared between professionals). 
default&#xa0;
default9.5 defaultLack of information on the effectiveness 
defaultof these approaches 
defaultwithin the UK N
defaultational Health Service
default and guidance on how to implement these complex systems of care
default, for example
default when to change care in stepped care, 
defaultand 
defaultwhich professionals deliver collaborative care
default,
default mean that delivery of such care is patchy and incomplete. Much of the evidence supporting the use of these complex healthcare systems has been developed in the US and does not necessarily transfer to the UK NHS. More research is required to identify 
defaultthe 
defaultmodels of care most appropriate for use in the NHS, and t
defaulto produce evidence to support the successful implementation of such models of care.
default&#xa0;
default9.default6default 
defaultIT systems should be developed that facilitate
