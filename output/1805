[normal]Written evidence from Margot Fish (TIC 101)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The village is 5 miles east of Cockermouth, ten miles west of Keswick.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Please bear in mind, some years ago the Ombudsman declared that although some children live inside the three-mile limit, th
[normal]e education department must nevertheless send children to school by bus and at the County's expense, in view of the isolation of the community and the speed of the road transport.
[normal]There is a bus service which runs through the village however it is only any
[normal] good to the people who live on the north road.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It is not accessible to the village of Wythop because a) villages separated from Embleton by the A66 - very busy and very fast road which very few people will feel safe to cross
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The population is mostl
[normal]y elderly and would
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]be entirely unable to access this service.
[normal]The bus service
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]is quite frequent and for those who live on the north road it is very good.
[normal]For those who live in Wythop the bus service is inaccessible, because of the A66 and the distance fro
[normal]m the bus stop.(up to 2 miles).
[normal]If it was possible, a community bus could be used, either to transport people to the north road in time to catch the service bus, or can be used as a community bus.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Schoolchildren use the service bus and also the young ones
[normal] who attend the primary school at Lorton are taken to school by contracted transport. 
[normal]Might it be possible to extend this contracted service, please?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is also a community bus in the area, run by
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] ACT. I believe it is managed by the Cumbria County
[normal] Council - I am not certain so you would have to check this to discover who actually is responsible for the community bus.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This service is accessed by such organisations as the youth club and the seniors club, but it is hired out each time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This is a gre
[normal]at drain on finances for both clubs.
[normal]I would love to see a community bus, available for the people of the community, with a timetable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This could then be either put at the disposal of the youth club and the seniors club â€“ and any other club that required 
[normal]it.
[normal]It is my contention that a lot of people who use their cars simply to go shopping in Cockermouth or Workington would in all likelihood use the community bus because it would be cost-effective and if it is smaller it can be accessed much more easily by 
[normal]the elderly and disabled.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] A small bus can go around the villages to collect passengers and deliver them back near their homes at set times.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I think that this would be very popular, particularly in these days when petrol is so costly and we are
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]adjured to
[normal] save precious resources of.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The bus can also be used to take people to and from the cottage hospital.
[normal]I look after the seniors club and fund manage for the youth club.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I am aware that many people are in their 60s, 70s and 80s in the village and think
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a 
[normal]feasibility study, properly conducted, would show a real need for a community bus.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I am very well aware of the dangers of a community bus being purchased and standing idle for most of the time but I think that you will appreciate just how much this bus wi
[normal]ll be utilised.
[normal]I have thought about this very carefully but I am not sure that I am providing it in a fashion to be of help to your inquiry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I just hope that it is.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] May I explain it in this way: I worked for five years to learn how to get a village hall
[normal] from the big lottery.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I had to go on many training courses and follow a very circuitous route.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The village Hall has been erected for two years, thank God.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] At the same time as I worked for the village Hall I learned from the community that there is a gr
[normal]eat need for a community bus. 
[normal]If a feasibility study is required, I am quite sure that we can undertake the community aspect of it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We have a very active village hall trust, a rural safety group trust, and youth club trust,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] if you explain the aspects wh
[normal]ich you would like, I am sure we can
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]undertake it on your behalf, but which will save a lot of money.
