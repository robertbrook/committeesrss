defaultWritten evidence from Margot Fish (TIC 101)
default&#xa0;
defaultThe village is 5 miles east of Cockermouth, ten miles west of Keswick.
default&#xa0;
default Please bear in mind, some years ago the Ombudsman declared that although some children live inside the three-mile limit, th
defaulte education department must nevertheless send children to school by bus and at the County's expense, in view of the isolation of the community and the speed of the road transport.
defaultThere is a bus service which runs through the village however it is only any
default good to the people who live on the north road.
default&#xa0;
default It is not accessible to the village of Wythop because a) villages separated from Embleton by the A66 - very busy and very fast road which very few people will feel safe to cross
default&#xa0;
defaultb).
default&#xa0;
default The population is mostl
defaulty elderly and would
default&#xa0;
defaultbe entirely unable to access this service.
defaultThe bus service
default&#xa0;
defaultis quite frequent and for those who live on the north road it is very good.
defaultFor those who live in Wythop the bus service is inaccessible, because of the A66 and the distance fro
defaultm the bus stop.(up to 2 miles).
defaultIf it was possible, a community bus could be used, either to transport people to the north road in time to catch the service bus, or can be used as a community bus.
default&#xa0;
default Schoolchildren use the service bus and also the young ones
default who attend the primary school at Lorton are taken to school by contracted transport. 
defaultMight it be possible to extend this contracted service, please?
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is also a community bus in the area, run by
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default ACT. I believe it is managed by the Cumbria County
default Council - I am not certain so you would have to check this to discover who actually is responsible for the community bus.
default&#xa0;
default This service is accessed by such organisations as the youth club and the seniors club, but it is hired out each time.
default&#xa0;
default This is a gre
defaultat drain on finances for both clubs.
defaultI would love to see a community bus, available for the people of the community, with a timetable.
default&#xa0;
default This could then be either put at the disposal of the youth club and the seniors club â€“ and any other club that required 
defaultit.
defaultIt is my contention that a lot of people who use their cars simply to go shopping in Cockermouth or Workington would in all likelihood use the community bus because it would be cost-effective and if it is smaller it can be accessed much more easily by 
defaultthe elderly and disabled.
default&#xa0;
default A small bus can go around the villages to collect passengers and deliver them back near their homes at set times.
default&#xa0;
default I think that this would be very popular, particularly in these days when petrol is so costly and we are
default&#xa0;
defaultadjured to
default save precious resources of.
default&#xa0;
default The bus can also be used to take people to and from the cottage hospital.
defaultI look after the seniors club and fund manage for the youth club.
default&#xa0;
default I am aware that many people are in their 60s, 70s and 80s in the village and think
default&#xa0;
defaulta 
defaultfeasibility study, properly conducted, would show a real need for a community bus.
default&#xa0;
default I am very well aware of the dangers of a community bus being purchased and standing idle for most of the time but I think that you will appreciate just how much this bus wi
defaultll be utilised.
defaultI have thought about this very carefully but I am not sure that I am providing it in a fashion to be of help to your inquiry.
default&#xa0;
default I just hope that it is.
default&#xa0;
default May I explain it in this way: I worked for five years to learn how to get a village hall
default from the big lottery.
default&#xa0;
default I had to go on many training courses and follow a very circuitous route.
default&#xa0;
default The village Hall has been erected for two years, thank God.
default&#xa0;
default At the same time as I worked for the village Hall I learned from the community that there is a gr
defaulteat need for a community bus. 
defaultIf a feasibility study is required, I am quite sure that we can undertake the community aspect of it.
default&#xa0;
default We have a very active village hall trust, a rural safety group trust, and youth club trust,
default&#xa0;
default if you explain the aspects wh
defaultich you would like, I am sure we can
default&#xa0;
defaultundertake it on your behalf, but which will save a lot of money.
