[normal]Written Submission from [bold]Prof Tim Benton, University of Leeds[bold]Summary[bold]The UK’s food security can be improved by (a) increasing productivity and its resilience locally, (b) increasing the resilience of the international food supply chain, accounting for 40-50% of our food use, (c) reducing waste of food already grown/imported, (d) helping people manage diets and dietary choices better, and reducing over-consumption.  Arguably, greater impacts on local food security will arise from (b-d) than from increasing productivity locally.  Ensuring both sustainability and resilience are key issues, even if they “cost” in yield terms.  Taking a food systems view is crucial in planning for a world made more variable by climate and where food and other resources are increasingly competed for.
