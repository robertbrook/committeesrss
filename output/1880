defaultWritten submission from Oxygen Finance (LPG 52)default&#xa0;
defaultI am pleased to submit written evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee Inquiry into local government procurement on behalf of Oxygen Finance Ltd. Oxygen welcomes the establishment of the Inquiry and congratulates the Committee on its initiative.
default&#xa0;
defaultOxygen Finance Ltd is a small, relatively new company based in London. Our website (
defaultwww.oxygen-finance.com
default) gives detailed information on our products and services. We work with private and public sector organisations to help them improve their procurement processes to generate new sources of income, produce efficiency savings and to deepen and improve their relationships with their suppliers through the implementation of supplier early payment. An indirect benefit of our work with our Local Authority clients is to improve the vitality of their local economy by increasing the velocity of money in the area through early payment of invoices. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur company entered the UK Local Government sector in the past two years and now have significant engagement with over 40 Councils throughout the country. We also work with the private sector and public sector in the USA and Europe. We provide specialist expertise in Electronic Payment Systems, Information Technology and procurement processes. We consider ourselves to be world leaders in this field. We have recently been awarded a UK wide, OJEU approved, procurement framework for our solution and are accelerating our programmes in the UK Local Authority sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur schemes provide Local Authorities with the ability to implement a rebate based early payment scheme which ensures, on a voluntary basis, that suppliers can be paid within a few days of invoicing in return for a small, agreed fee. This generates a revenue for the Council, a huge boost to the cash flow of the suppliers, efficiency savings for both, an improved purchaser/supplier relationship and a tool to improve sustainability in the local economy.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe recognise that in the wake of unprecedented budget cuts and a severe shortfall in Government funding, the need to deliver good value for money whilst protecting front line services has never been greater. The role of Local Government in balancing the everyday needs of its people whilst overcoming a 28% reduction in funding since 2010 is both challenging and critical.
default&#xa0;
defaultLocal Government has had to respond both quickly and pragmatically; finding new and innovative ways of working to adapt to a fast changing economic climate.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis submission of evidence is intended to highlight how recent advancements and innovation in technology and best practice have paved the way to implement such change, and that there are significant benefits to be had for all parties in the procurement relationship from this change.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have developed a new and innovative solution that is currently proven and live in Local Government today. The solution is premised on delivering a new, risk-free income stream to buyers by paying supplier invoices early in return for a rebate 
default(“Early Payment Programme”). At no cost, and offered on a fully contingent basis, this is truly a ‘win-win’ solution for both buyers and suppliers alike; buyers receive rebates as new income, and suppliers receive much needed cash early.
default&#xa0;
defaultHaving spent over £87.5billion with suppliers in 2011/12 alone, Local Government is both a large and significant purchaser of good and services within the UK; we believe that Early Payment could generate £1.5bn of new income for the taxpayer through Local Government, at no cost.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn real terms, this equates to:
default&#xa0;
default•
default              
defaultEmploying 69,483 new teachers for a year;
default•
default              
defaultBuilding 10 new hospitals; or 
default•
default              
defaultRunning Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service for a year.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a consequence, we have developed an expertise and knowledge in Local Authority procurement which we are happy to share with the Committee and would welcome the opportunity to give detailed evidence.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Problem - SummarydefaultLocal Government operates the running and provision of services for millions of people all across the United Kingdom every day. With on-going and impending budget cuts and the reality of a demographically-driven increased demand for services in years to come, Local Government is facing a once in a generation challenge. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe need to find savings in current expenditure and to find new income streams for the future is something that all Local Government bodies are facing up to. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs such,

default, defaultthose responsible for the purchasing of goods and supplies within councils, 
defaultis becoming more demanding and prominent.
default&#xa0;
defaultDelivering best value for money, whilst ensuring that social, economic and environmental objectives are met, has become more critical than ever. We believe that the structures and organisation of Local Government procurement at a micro level have allowed individual councils to function and provide these everyday services sufficiently up until now. However, at a macro level, the dispersed and segregated nature of this structure has cultivated inefficiencies and dis-organisation within Local Government that are hindering its progression and viability.
default&#xa0;defaultCentralisation and collaboration are key elements
default of any procurement function that seeks to gain best value; the leveraging of collective purchasing and combination of skills and expertise. The current organisation of Local Government does not support this.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example; through our own research undertaken on ten councils within the North East, we found that 45% of supplier spend applicable to an Early Payment Programme overlapped between two or more councils in the region. Thus, if one was to aggregate this spend, procurement could leverage this to secure further value for 
defaultmoney. Indeed, by encouraging local authorities and bodies to talk and collaborate with each other, this opens up the opportunity for suppliers to gain access to new buyers 
default–

defaultanother 
default‘

default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe opportunity to collaborate and leverage spend amongst suppliers both locally and nationally is both apparent and necessary.
default&#xa0;
defaultMoreover, we have found that a lack of available resource within Local Government has impeded the functional and efficient running of the procurement function. Often, a combined lack of funding for the right equipment and lack human resource leave the procurement function overstretched.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Solution default–default defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;defaultWe, Oxygen Finance, have developed a unique solution, based upon proprietary technology and world-class partnerships that allows buyers (Local Government) to leverage their spend in a closed look network by negotiating Early Payment rebates with suppliers for payment of invoices early.
default&#xa0;
defaultUnlike other ‘Supply Chain Finance’ models, Oxygen was created to overcome some of the hurdles associated with such programmes, such as low supplier adoption rates and limited implementation resource.
default&#xa0;
defaultOur first client was Oldham Council, based in the North West of England. Having been awarded an AGMA (Association of Greater Manchester Authorities) framework for our Early Payment solution, Oxygen began implementing the Early Payment Programme in early 2012; a pioneering undertaking. Projections, based on the expenditure so far recruited into the programme, indicate Oldham generating c. £2m of new income over four years with further efficiency savings to the Council of £100,000 pa. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the spring of 2013, we invited CIPFA to undertake an independent report of our scheme in Oldham. The report is attached to this submission.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith strong early indications of success and high levels of supplier adoption, our model was beginning to prove itself. Our rapid growth and success was soon noticed by the NHS, when soon after Imperial College Healthcare Trust signed up to the programme. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSince then, with four live programmes running in Local Government and over £11bn of expenditure under contract with ourselves, we believe the potential for Local Government to take advantage of untapped value in their expenditure is immense.
default&#xa0;
default1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo what extent is local government procurement organised to deliver value for money and social, economic and environmental objectives, including stimulating the local economy? To what extent are local authorities achieving the involvement of local residents in delivering value for money? To what extent are local authorities able to develop long-term relationships with contractors?
defaultLocal Government faces a paradox between procurement and sustainability. Value for money imperatives and existing tendering processes, intended to promote 
defaultfairness in competition, mitigate in favour of larger suppliers who can benefit from economies of scale. Similarly, payment terms require credit availability that is usually only available to larger turnover supplying companies. On the other hand, local economic sustainability and growth objectives as well as social and environmental objectives are often, but not always, only available to smaller, locally based suppliers who cannot achieve economies of scale and whose tendered prices include the cost of credit (to cover cash flow and investment) which render their supply uncompetitive on paper but are often the most efficiently produced. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA key lesson learned from the Oxygen solution is that, in addition, to the direct financial benefits achieved, the transformation in the relationship between the Local Authority and its supply chain brings huge mutual benefits. This is, in essence, because a fee based early payment scheme connects the supplier to the financial functions (treasury, accounts payable, finance) of the Council as well as the actual procuring department or decision maker. We are aware of similar benefits achieved where discount based early payment schemes have been implemented in Councils.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have little experience of the involvement of residents in delivering value for money excepting that the changed relationship with the supply chain, described above, harnesses the locally based SME supplying companies whose management and staff, as local residents themselves, contribute positively to the Councils' savings agenda, sometimes even when not directly in their companies interest. 
default&#xa0;
default2. Do authorities take sufficient advantage of collaborative and joint procurement opportunities, including those available from central government? In addition, the Committee would welcome information on PFI contracts and their operation with local government.
defaultAs described in our summary, our experience is that Authorities do not exploit such opportunities. However, this is primarily because of the paucity of data on the actual and potential supply chain. The connectivity provided by our scheme, and the management data that flows from it, enables such collaboration in tendering and procurement.
defaultWhilst being supportive of central government initiatives to improve joint procurement, the fact is that without transparent and known financial incentives and rewards such as those provided by the Oxygen solution, such initiatives are not maximised to the benefit of the taxpayer.
default3. How can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives? More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies
default—
defaultlocally and regionally. If not, how can deficiencies be addressed?
default&#xa0;
defaultOur view on this matter is based on our management team's years of experience in developing IT based procurement programmes and engagement in a huge number of electronic payment systems. Indeed our senior managers can credibly claim to have invented electronic payment. 
defaultOur experience is that Local Authorities cannot access the capacity to achieve these objectives because existing payment schemes do not provide the data or the 
defaultaccessible knowledge of the supply chain required to do so. In metaphorical terms, our schemes provide the organizational equivalent of credit card statements as opposed to, at worst shoe boxes full of invoices and receipts to, at best, old computer systems that are too cumbersome to provide the data required. 
defaultThe understanding of the financial data, supply chains and comparative markets is simply not available to the right quality. Our work with our Local Authority clients is delivering such improvements and whilst we would ask the Committee to respect our intellectual property, we would, of course, be willing to give detailed evidence on this matter.
default4. To what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are tailored to product and supplier market places? More specifically, do local authorities maintain and operate effective client management functions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow the flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget reductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered?
defaultOur experience on this point is that risk understanding is widely varied across the sector and within individual Authorities. 
defaultEffective client management functions similarly vary enormously. However, connectivity with the supply chain can only be achieved, in our view, through a systematic and IT data based approach which requires an incentive to provide the quality of information required. This is why, we believe, a fee based early payment scheme is preferable to a discount or alternative scheme. Contract management requires information to be available in the financial and procuring departments as well as mutually beneficial relations.
default5. How is regularity and propriety of procurement secured and are the arrangements for detecting and addressing impropriety and fraud effective?
defaultWhilst the remit of our contractual arrangements with Local Authorities does not cover this point directly and our experience is limited, our view is that our Early Payment Scheme which connects the procurer (the Local Authority) with the supplier, enhances transparency within the Authority since it connects the accounts payable, treasury and finance functions with the procuring department as well as the supplier, giving greater information sharing, comparability and time-lines. This effect is seen prominently in our private sector clients.
default6. Is local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress? Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective? More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered?
default&#xa0;
defaultA fuller description of how our electronic payments systems enhance the data available to managers and elected Councillors is available from Oxygen and our partners, KPMG and ATOS. The systems we implement provide significant enhancement to existing electronic payment systems. Moreover, because of the transparency inherent in our system (by virtue of the creation of an income stream which provides for an income as well as expenditure line with the suppliers), financial relationships between the Authority and the suppliers are transformed.
default&#xa0;defaultConclusion and recommendationsdefaultThe Oxygen solution transforms the relationship between the Local Authority and its supply chain by the creation of data availability and by incentivising procurement to recognize and realize the cost and velocity of money. 
defaultGovernment have recognized the benefits to the taxpayer of rebate based early payment schemes (see HL6176 Viscount Leckie PQ answer to Lord Harrison). We recommend that the committee asks the Government to carry out an assessment on the benefits of this policy in regard to procurement policy in respect of:
defaultHow the role of early, as opposed to prompt, payment schemes in procurement can be used by Local Authorities and the wider public sector to benefit their local economies through  enhancement of the supply chain.
defaultHow Electronic Payment Systems and rebate based procurement payments can improve data availability and what the consequential benefits are.
defaultThat the Committee should engage with Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council,  CIPFA and the supply chain in Oldham to inquire about the first year operation of the early payment scheme and the benefits for procurement policy.
