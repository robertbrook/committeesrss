defaultWritten evidence submitted by Lorraine Waplingdefault, Disability Inclusive Development ConsultantdefaultAbout medefault: I am a trained teacher by profession with 18 years experience working in international development; my particular focus is on disability inclusion; I have conducted research, managed projects working with disabled people, designed training for disability inclusion, and evaluated a range of disability inclusive programs for INGOs and government agencies across Africa, Asia and the Pacific; I spent two years as the Disability Specialist for DFID in their Policy and Research Division and was the Disability Specialist for the 2012 Mid Term review of 
defaultAusAID’s
default 
defaultDevelopment for All
default disability inclusive development strategy. I am profoundly deaf.
defaultIn this submission, I will address the following:
default1.1
default              
defaultDisability is present in all communities, cuts across all sectors and affects every generation regardless of gender, ethnicity, or class. This reason alone makes it a compellingly relevant issue in development. With
default over 
defaultone billion persons with disabilities defaultin the world, of whom between 110
default 
default-190 million 
defaultexperience impairments that have a direct impact on their life choices 
default(WHO, 2011)
default, it might be anticipated that disability would feature in many development programs
default. 
defaultYet with exceptions, disability hardly features at all in the work of international agencies. Some reports suggest as little as 3-4% of global development directly benefits disabled people (
defaultAusAID
default, 2011). Its absence from international frameworks like the Millennium Development Goals means not only have disabled people failed to benefit from much of the recent progress brought about by their focus but there is growing concern that 
defaultthe
defaultir
default living conditions may 
defaultactually 
defaultbe 
defaultdeclining in relative terms default(UN, 2010)
default. With the 
defaultprevalence of disability growing defaultdue to population ageing and the global increase in chronic health conditions (WHO, 2011)
default the issue of disability and its impact on development outcomes will increase in significance. 
default1.2
default              
defaultThere is a significant 
defaultlink between poverty and disabilitydefault, especially chronic poverty 
default(
defaultMitra
default, 
defaultPosarac
default, &amp; Vick, 2011).
default There is a significant risk of becoming disabled if you are poor because of the conditions in which you live. You are less likely to be able to access timely and appropriate health care, you are more vulnerable to malnutrition and disease, and more likely to live in low quality housing with poor sanitation, in areas that are at higher risk of natural disaster, environmental damage and violence (
defaultGroce
default, 2011).  Those with a disability are more likely to experience poverty more intensely. 
defaultHouseholds with disabled members have considerably 
defaultreduced economic resilience and can be subject to repeated economic shocks from a lack of access to the goods and services they need. Many disabled people face constraints over ownership of land, assets 
defaultand access to credit due to attitudinal and environmental barriers. Since many are denied the opportunity to take part in political processes by these same barriers, they also lack the voice to challenge the situation (ILO, 2013). 
default1.3
default              
defaultThe cost of living with a disability may also contribute to increased household poverty
default meaning disability affects not just individuals but also their families and communities
default. Disability can reduce an individual’s opportunity to earn a sufficient income but that may be compounded by a need for increased spending linked to their disability. Households that contain a disabled member may have to spend more in order to rea
defaultch a minimum standard of living
default. T
defaulthis extra level of expenditure 
defaultmeans that where there are few or no state supported disability services, households with disabled members are at an increased risk of falling into poverty (
defaultMitra
default et al, 2011). 
default1.4
default              
defaultThe 
defaulteconomic benefits of disability inclusive developmentdefault are starting to become clearer although this is an area that needs more focused research. It is reasonably well established that constructing physically accessible infrastructure adds only 1-2% to the overall costs if built in from the start using Universal Design guidelines. But that only accounts for the direct spend, what it doesn’t show is how much is generated from having increased numbers of disabled people active in the economy. 
default1.5
default              
defaultWith at least 
default780 million disabled people of working agedefault in the world today there is considerable economic potential. However, we consistently find that disabled people are excluded from the workforce and 
defaultin addition
default are dependent on their families for support. Around the world 
defaultdisabled people 
defaultare
default more likely to be unemployed than non-disabled people, be lower paid, have fewer promotion prospects and less job security. A lack of education, inaccessible workplaces
default and transport
default 
defaultalongside
default negative attitudes
default and discriminatory practices
default 
defaultall 
defaultwork against 
defaultdisabled 
defaultpeople 
defaultwho strive to make a living
default (ILO, 2013).
default1.6
default              
defaultIf disabled people are given appropriate access to education, social protection, employment and livelihood opportunities they have the potential to play an important role in the economic and social development of their countries. A 2011 study from Australia highlighted that it could experience a 
default$43 billion increase in GDP over the next ten years if the gaps between unemployment and 
defaultlabour
default market participation of disabled and non-disabled
default people are reduced by just a 
defaultthird (Deloitte, 2011).
default An ILO study of ten low and middle-income countries in Asia and Africa found significant levels of economic loss, ranging from 3-7% of GDP directly related to disability (S. Backup, 2012). Evidence is growing therefore around the extent to which 
defaultimproved economic indicators could be gained from investing in disability inclusive developmentdefault.
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultThe landscape within which development agencies now operate has changed considerably since 2008 when the 
defaultUN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilitiesdefault came into force. 
defaultThis reinforced the paradigm shift that has been taking place in the way disability is framed (driven by the disability movement), away from its medical/charity focus to one based on rights and equality of opportunities. The CRPD intends that members States 
defaultcreate positive 
defaultand
default enabling environment
defaults both
default domestically and internationally for 
defaultdisabled people.
default 
defaultGovernments should focus on identifying and removing the barriers that prevent 
defaultdisabled 
defaultpeople from 
defaultenjoying
default their rights
default and fundamental freedoms. In fact the CRPD is unique in being both a human rights and a development tool because it is currently the only rights framework that has a specific article on international cooperation. 
defaultArticle 32default mandates that 
defaultalldefault 
defaultinternational cooperation ‘…is inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilitiesdefault.’ This makes it highly relevant to the work of DFID and other bilateral, and multilateral agencies.
default2.2
default              
defaultThe 
defaultUK government ratified the CRPD in 2009default which give
defaults
default DFID the mandate and the responsibility to build disability into its bilateral 
defaultaid discussions, humanitarian responses, research and development funding. Although DFID aims to ‘
defaultwork to end extreme poverty
default’ 
default(see website)
default and targets areas such as education, health, and economic growth it does not as yet have a coherent, time-bound, measurable and resourced strategy for disability inclusive development. As a result, it is not possible to measure the extent to which DFID is able to fulfill this mandate which was highlighted by the poor quality of information on international cooperation presented in the 2011 Initial Report to the UN on the CRPD
default (ODI, 2011)
default. 
default2.3
default              
defaultMy work takes me to many countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific 
defaultwhere
default I meet with DPOs and those engaged in supporting disability inclusion. I also get to see the work of bilateral agencies, multilaterals and mainstream development 
defaultorganisations
default. What I see on a regular basis is an almost total disconnection between mainstream development and disability. There are very few examples where poverty alleviation, education, WASH, HIV, health or livelihood programs actively include disabled people alongside their non-disabled peers. DFID is not currently making 
defaultany visible 
defaultefforts to understand if its mainstream programs are improving the lives of disabled people despite recognizing back in 2000 (when it produced its Disability, Poverty and Development Issues Paper) that “Disability is both a cause and a consequence of poverty”.
default2.4
default              
defaultDPOs continue to struggle to source longer term development funding because they find it hard to meet the criteria set by donors and because there are very few funding opportunities offered to them.  
defaultWhilst the Disability Rights Fund (to which DFID has been contributing since it was established in 2007) 
defaultis an excellent source it only works in 24 countries (only 4 of those in Africa) and has limited resources to offer
default individual grantees
default. The fact disabled people are often not included in mainstream programs either, means there is very little in the way of opportunity presented to most disabled people from development cooperation. 
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultLearning from defaultAusAIDdefault. In 2012 I was one of two consultants hired by 
defaultAusAID
default (now Australian Aid) to carry out a Mid-Term Review of their 
defaultDevelopment For All
default (
defaultDfA
default) disability inclusive development strategy. As a result I have seen at 
defaultfirst hand
default how a bilateral agency can embed the principles of disability inclusion into their aid program. Whilst the report itself is freely available (
defaulthttp://aid.dfat.gov.au/aidissues/did/Pages/home.aspx
default) there are a number of lessons I would like to draw attention to because I feel they are areas which DFID could well benefit from considering.
default3.2
default              
defaultStrategic level commitments.default The 
defaultDevelopment for All
default 
defaultstrategy has been a central driver of change within the 
defaultorganisation
default. It is a 
defaultclear, measurable, time-bound agency-wide strategy, supported at senior level and overseen by a core Disability Policy Section. Its inception had 
defaulthigh level political support – launched by the then Parliamentary Secretary Bob McMullan and publicly supported by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Smith and Prime Minister Rudd. But it maintained its profile with successive Ministers and Prime Ministers publicly supporting and promoting it. It continues to have senior 
defaultAusAID
default support in Canberra reflected in its 
defaultinclusion in 
defaultAusAID’s
default Top 10 development priorities 
default(
defaults
defaultee “Helping the World’s Poor thr
defaultough Effective Aid: Australia’s 
defaultComprehensive Aid Policy Framework to 2015-16”, page 7)
default. During the review process I was particularly struck by the number of senior personnel (in fact all personnel I met) who were confident about discussing disability inclusion and were willing to talk about its benefits and challenges.
default3.3
default              
defaultThe 
defaultprocess
default of creating this strategy also helped raise the profile of disability inclusive development. They had over 500 written submissions and held consultations in 20 countries which helped to generate considerable interest. In fact it was as a direct result of the consultation process that the Samoa Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development made a request to 
defaultAusAID
default to be included as a focus country. The bilateral work that resulted from this initial request has been significant, especially in education.
default3.4
default              
defaultResourcingdefault. The strategy contains three enabling outcomes, two of which focus on what 
defaultAusAID
default needs to have in place to implement inclusion, with funding allocated to the 
defaultDisability Policy Sectiondefault (additional funding is also made available across the 
defaultorganisation
default for programs that are working on disability inclusion). In recognition of the fact that most of the strategy has to be implemented by country offices (in 
defaultAusAID
default, referred to as Posts) there is a network of 
defaultDisability Focal Pointsdefault at Posts. These focal points directly engage with DPOs, 
defaultorganisations
default and institutions working with disabled people and the relevant government ministries. Although informal at first, the role of focal points was formalized with training and support opportunities made available. 
default3.5
default              
defaultThere are also two 
defaultDisability Inclusive Development Specialistsdefault defaultbased in Asia and 
defaultthe Pacific with Inclusion O
defaultfficers 
defaultplaced 
defaultin 
defaultthe 
defaultAsia and Pacific regional Divisions. So 
defaultwhilst there is a central Disability Policy Section who are able to monitor and promote the strategy the agency benefited from a whole network of personnel working on disability. It was not therefore confined to a 
defaultsingle thematic area thus encouraging the sense of ownership needed to mainstream disability inclusive development.
default3.6
default              
defaultAusAID
default also realized they needed to provide 
defaultgood qualitydefault 
defaulttechnical supportdefault to Posts and Divisions as their experience in disability was minimal. For this they set up a partnership with CBM Australia, which worked by making resources rapidly available and by strengthening the skills and capacity of a wider group of stakeholders (via CBM-
defaultNossal
default Institute Partnership in Disability, based at The University of Melbourne). This helped to develop the capacity of local universities and DPOs to research key disability issues and gave 
defaultAusAID
default staff access to important data and technical advice.
default3.7
default              
defaultEngagement with disabled peopledefault. One of the most impressive findings from the MTR was the extent to which 
defaultAusAID
default staff, at Post and in Canberra were connected to and engaged with disabled people. The creation of a 
defaultDisability Reference Groupdefault (DRG) has been very important. This consultative body is made up of the majority disabled people, who are active in the field of disability inclusive development. It contains several highly regarded disability leaders from around the world and provides 
defaultAusAID
default with a high level of technical advice and support as well as good networking and a legitimacy to their work. Members can be called on to support 
defaultAusAID
default at international and national forums (e.g. 
defaultMs Charlotte McClain-
defaultNhlapo
default – Coordinator, Office for Disability and Inclusive Development, USAID
default and 
defaultMr 
defaultSetareki
default S. 
defaultMacanawai
default – CEO, Pacific Disability Forum
default both made presentations at 
defaultAusAID’s
default side event at the UN’s Conference of States Parties to the CRPD in July 2013)
default defaultand it established good links with senior management, Ministers and cross party politicians. 
default3.8
default              
defaultThe strategy contains a clear commitment to 
defaultsupporting the participation of disabled peopledefault, defaultpart of which focuses on building the leadership potential of disabled people and DPOs. They have, for example been very supportive of the Pacific Disability Forum (PDF) helping PDF to promote the voice of disabled people at national and international forums. In country, there were many examples of where focal points were in touch with DPOs helping them source potential areas of funding and connecting them to forums and training opportunities. In Fiji for example, this relationship enabled the Fiji 
defaultDisabled People’s Federation
default to link with the Red Cross to ensure disabled people are now 
defaultincluded in the national disaster framework
default.
default3.9
default              
defaultIncreasing the impact of aid.default There was clear evidence from the review that 
defaultAusAID
default were using innovative approaches to enable the inclusion of disabled people in their activities and therefore increasing the impact of their aid. Mainstreaming is happening in the two focus areas of infrastructure and education. Both established their own policy base in line with the strategy and are increasingly able to demonstrate, through key performance indicators that they are reaching disabled people. This means the disability inclusive mandate extends beyond the strategy itself and has become much more of a shared responsibility. 
default3.10
default              
default Mainstreaming is also starting to emerge at Post. There were a number of examples of where programs were adapted to become inclusive – the electoral program in Philippines (“Fully 
defaultAbled
default Nation” implemented by the Asia Foundation and designed to increase participation of disabled people in the 2013 Mid Term elections) and education in PNG (a flagship program which began using the Accessible Design principles to look at how to construct more accessible classrooms). The original program designs did not pay attention to disability issues at all but 
defaultAusAID
default staff were successful in introducing small but strategic changes to increase inclusion.
default3.11
default              
defaultThe strategy has also played a role in empowering governments to request the support of 
defaultAusAID
default to help them implement disability inclusive activities. In PNG for example the government used the strategy to request assistance to help in the CRPD ratification process. Through its 
defaultDemocratic Governance Programdefault 
defaultAusAID
default engaged with the Department for Community Development
default 
defaultto support its work as Chair of the National Advisory Committee on Disability. This cross-departmental group was tasked with ensuring the government could comply with the CRPD. They achieved ratification this year. 
default3.12
default              
defaultSimilarly in Samoa part of their 
defaultbilateral aid agreementdefault (Australia Partnership for Development – Education) contained a target (one of five) on 
defaultIncreased access of boys and girls with disabilities to quality education
default. The Ministry of Education, Sport and Culture is being supported to create a strategic framework that will ensure the education of disabled children is effectively implemented through mainstream services. To ensure they set up the most appropriate provisions 
defaultAusAID
default are supporting a pilot, the Samoa Inclusive Education Demonstration Program (SIEDP), which is generating important evidence for them to work with. This is an example of a highly innovative bilateral relationship.
default3.13
default              
default Mainstreaming is also happening in areas that were not specifically targeted by the strategy. One particularly impressive example is the 
defaultvolunteer programdefault (Australian Volunteers for International Development) which started to mainstream disability because it saw the potential importance. It has since increased its work in the disability sector and hired increasing numbers of disabled volunteers. They also now have a policy which helps embed disability into all aspects of their work.  
default3.14
default              
default There are other ways in which 
defaultAusAID
default is helping to promote disability inclusive development at the international level. It supported the regional based Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat to hold its first Disabled Ministers’ meeting in 2009 which resulted in the Pacific Regional Strategy on Disability (2010 – 2015). Many Pacific Islands are now signatories or have disability policies. They are highly visible at UN forums and meetings and generate a lot of opportunities to promote the voice of disabled people.
default3.15
default              
defaultThey are also 
defaultfunding strategic partnershipsdefault with a disability focus. UNICEF, WHO and UNDP all have the promotion of disability inclusion as part of their partnership agreements.  UNICEF and WHO have funding to support specific personnel to work on disability inclusion. During interviews with UN partners they welcomed the opportunity that 
defaultAusAID
default stimulates 
defaultto work on disability and even suggested that stricter targets from 
defaultbilaterals
default would help them move towards inclusion more quickly. 
default3.16
default              
defaultDFID needs to be strategic in its approach to disability inclusion, ensure there are sufficient resources available, especially in-country, engage directly with disabled people and pay attention to monitoring the effectiveness of its aid on reaching disabled people.
