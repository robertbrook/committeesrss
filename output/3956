[normal]Written Evi[bold]dence from Nick [bold]Hurd[bold] MP and [bold]Rt[bold] Hon Michael Fallon MP[bold] [OD 28][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Many thanks for providing us with the opportunity to provide further written evidence to the Committee. We are very proud of the progress that the UK has made in transparency and open data over the last three years and for the recognition that we are world leading. We appreciate that the challenge for us will be to remain at the forefront of this agenda. We want to support those countries that are newer to the transparency and open data
[normal] 
[normal]initiative, sharing our expertise, knowledge and experience with them to help them get further faster. The Cabinet Office lead the cross-government open data agenda with our priorities set out in the Open Data White Paper, the Government Response to the Shakespeare Review, the G8 Open Data Charter and the Open Government Partnership (OGP) UK National Action Plan. Over the next nine months, the key priorities are to: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1) get high quality open data out of government and into the public’s hands; 
[normal]2) bring the power of open data to a wider audience; and 
[normal]3) maintain Britain’s global position as a leader on open data and transparency. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are a number of areas where we are keen to share further information and detail with the Committee to support them in writing their report. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Data Capability and Skills [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]On 31 October 2013, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills published ‘Seizing the Data Opportunity: a strategy for UK data capability’. The strategy, which was developed in partnership with industry and academia, sets out a vision and course of action to enable the UK to be at the forefront of extracting knowledge and value from data. The strategy looks at the UK’s capability to make best use of data, and contains a range of actions for government, industry and academia around three key areas: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The strategy is not intended as an end point, but is instead the start of an ongoing commitment by government to continue to work with industry and academia on this important and growing agenda. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The strategy does recognise that, with increasing amounts of data being produced, the government must continue to develop the skills of its own workforce in handling and analysing data. There are a number of measures being taken in this area, and these include: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Civil servants are also able to develop their skills through the training and support provided by organisations such as the Open Data Institute and the Open Knowledge Foundation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The key focus of the transparency and open data agenda is to put data in the hands of users to increase accountability, drive efficiencies in public services and stimulate economic growth. Increasingly we are seeing departments consume their own and other departments’ data to drive their policies and programmes. The Department for Transport uses a mixture of their own data and private data to support projects such as Transport Direct and an initiative to understand the impact of better information about incidents on the A4. The Department for Communities and Local Government’s Whole Place Community Budgets and Troubled Families programmes have shown that information sharing is key to designing and delivering services and achieving better outcomes for vulnerable people. In addition, the government run website, police.uk (run by the Home Office) uses both Home Office and Ministry of Justice data to provide an informative and valuable service for the public. As the
[normal] 
[normal]skills and capability develop, so will the departmental understanding and use of open data. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Supporting economic growth and the open data ecosystem [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]One of the main objectives for this agenda is the stimulation of economic growth through the exploitation of open data. The UK’s open data portal, data.gov.uk, is an interactive platform that allows users to engage with the datasets. The Open Data User Group represents the views of a broad community and provides the business case for the release of open data for economic growth. The Public Sector Transparency Board now has a greater focus on the needs of the business community and the departmental transparency sector boards convene both users and owners to ensure that the value and benefit of releasing open data is communicated. There are extensive interactions between civil servants and the open data community both in person and via social media which all help increase the understanding of what support is needed to enable economic growth. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The creation of the Open Data Institute, founded by Professors Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Sir Nigel 
[normal]Shadbolt
[normal], was a substantial effort to stimulate potential economic growth and 
[normal]familiarity with the wider open data agenda. We are investing £10 million, through the Technology Strategy Board, into the Open Data Institute - the first Institute of its kind in the world. This investment has enabled the institute to provide support and incubation space to innovative open data start ups such as Demand Logic who have recently helped Kings College London to identify £390,000 a year savings in energy costs; Mastodon C who are one of the partners to have developed the Prescribing Analytics project which has identified a potential saving of £200 million a year to the NHS; and 
[normal]Placr
[normal] who have successfully integrated transport data and now provide services to Transport for London and 
[normal]CityMapper
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Over the last couple of years, the Government has introduced a range of new programmes to help companies use open data to develop new commercial opportunities. These programmes include the Open Data Challenge Series which will provide over £1.2 million to support companies developing new products and services which will address societal and sector challenges, and a £1.5 million Innovation Voucher programme (managed by the Technology Strategy Board) which will assist SMEs in working with new suppliers to develop new business ideas using open data. We have also set up a £5 million Breakthrough Fund to help government departments and local authorities tackle short term technical barriers that are holding back the release of data. This fund will result in more data becoming available that can be commercially exploited by businesses. In addition, there is a fund that was previously managed by the Data Strategy Board and has now transferred to the Public Sector Transparency Board which allows the government to purchase additional data for free release, based on business cases put forward by the Open Data User Group. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Trading Funds [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The 2011 Autumn Statement announced the creation of the Public Data Group (PDG), a group of Trading Funds (Companies House, Land Registry, Met Office and Ordnance Survey) tasked with working with the Data Strategy Board (DSB) initially to maximise the value of the data they hold, as well as working together to identify synergies and opportunities to collaborate among the members and with the wider public sector. These were additional objectives to the individual objectives with which each Trading Fund was charged. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As part of the Government’s response to the Shakespeare Review of Public Sector Information in summer this year the DSB was disbanded and its functions merged with the Public Sector Transparency Board. The PDG has continued despite the formal relationship with the DSB no longer existing, focusing on the sharing of the best practice and collaborations between members, and on supporting the open data agenda. The PDG is independently chaired by Claudia 
[normal]Arney
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Trading Fund Support for users of Open Data [bold]In addition to releasing data Public Data Group members are also actively involved in realising the benefits through increased promotion of what data and support is already available to raise greater awareness. They are working to ensure wider promotion of data availability going forward via co-ordinated publicity, and will support wider government efforts to give clarity to existing and future data releases. Specific examples of this include:

[normal]Ordnance Survey 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Ordnance Survey offers several licensing options to support developers. One is the Developer Licence for its paid for products. The licence enables developers to take 10% of the country, or a larger area on request. This is free unless it is OS 
[normal]MasterMap
[normal] Topography Layer, where a fee of £500 is applied. No royalties are required while the developer is 
[normal]building their solution and the licence includes a ‘Try before you buy’ option which allows live usage of the developer’s solution for three months without any royalty return. Since April 2011 over 600 organisations have taken one of the suite of developer licences to explore a range of paid-for datasets for free. Additionally, Ordnance Survey have also recently launched a free Software Development Kit (SDK) enabling developers to easily develop and experiment with OS 
[normal]OpenData
[normal] and OS 
[normal]OpenSpace
[normal] to create maps on both 
[normal]iOS
[normal] and Android. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Another example of how licensing can be used to enable space for businesses to develop is the fair use policy applied to the Met Office’s 
[normal]DataPoint
[normal] offer. Met Office provide this industry standard data as a free service providing an individual’s usage does not exceed certain parameters. This allows developers to experiment and trial the appeal of potential products built on this data without any financial commitment. A good example of this is Scope Nights (which identifies clear nights for star gazing), a revenue generating development built on 
[normal]DataPoint
[normal] data whose founder Martin Dodd commented: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"The Met Office 
[normal]DataPoint
[normal] service makes this sort of app development much easier and simpler by providing forecast data in industry-standard formats. The fair use policy does not penalise small, start up businesses and lays out very reasonable terms of use. Well done Met Office!" 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Postal Address File (PAF) 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following discussion with Government, in July 2013 Royal Mail announced that it would allow independent micro-businesses to have free access to the PAF for one year. In addition, Royal Mail is in the process of a large-scale licensing and pricing simplification exercise that will benefit all users. 
[normal]Targeting micro-businesses will ensure that Royal Mail focuses its support on the new users and start-ups that will drive future growth. In extending this offer to micro-businesses, Royal Mail will already be reaching 83% of UK SMEs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Open Data provided by Trading Funds [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Public Data Group have made available a large amount of open data. The Government Response to the Shakespeare Review provided a comprehensive list but highlights include: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Census Data [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Committee asked about the information that the Office of National Statistics (ONS) collected for the purposes of the 2011 census. The ONS conducted a valuable exercise in quality assuring addressing data collected by different bodies. Since the 2011 census, 
[normal]GeoPlace
[normal] has been set up. 
[normal]GeoPlace
[normal] has been established to provide definitive sources of publicly owned spatial address and street data. The work that ONS did to verify and assure the sources of addressing data has been fed in to 
[normal]GeoPlace
[normal] to create a high quality address register. It is a misconception that the data has been destroyed or lost. ONS’s work has helped with the development of 
[normal]GeoPlace
[normal] as an authoritative source of addressing data. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Privacy [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The government’s position is that data should be open by default. By definition open data is not personal data. The government takes the issue of privacy seriously. Our work is underpinned by the Data Protection Act, and releases from departments are handled by statisticians working to a professional code. The Information Commissioner’s Office provides this guidance which all departments use to ensure that data is appropriately 
[normal]anonymised
[normal]. These 
[normal]anonymisation
[normal] techniques mean that data can still be released while providing protection to the individual citizen, e.g. crime data is grouped at the level of a few streets to prevent victims being identified. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Committee asked us specifically about medical data. Following on from the publication of the Department of Health's Information Strategy last year, Jeremy Hunt set a challenge in January for the NHS to go paperless by 2018. Embracing the many benefits that technology can bring will enable NHS staff to spend more time with patients not paperwork and provide patients with the 21st century services they expect. Appointments, prescriptions and test results can and should only be a click away. Records, which help patients work in partnership with their doctor to manage their care, also need to be easily accessible. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The government asked Dame Fiona 
[normal]Caldicott
[normal] to lead an independent review to see how best to balance the need to keep patient information secure with the need to share it among health and care professionals for legitimate reasons. The review, 
[normal]Information: To Share Or Not To Share?
[normal], was published on 26th April 2013. It looked at how to strike the right balance between sharing people’s health and care information to improve health outcomes and 
[normal]respecting the privacy and wishes of the patient with regard to their sensitive personal information. The government’s response to the 
[normal]Caldicott
[normal] review was published on 12th September and can be found at 
[normal]www.gov.uk 
[normal]by searching for ‘
[normal]Caldicott
[normal] response’. The response accepts the recommendations of the original report and confirms again that while information sharing is essential to provide good care for everyone, only the minimum amount of information should be shared and there must be strict rules to govern it. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In terms of health and care medical records the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) collects both 
[normal]anonymised
[normal] and patient identifiable data depending upon the business requirement. Provisions in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 are designed to strengthen and clarify the role of the HSCIC, so that information can be collected, held securely and made readily available to those who need it in safe, de-identified formats, with crucial safeguards in place to protect the confidential data it holds. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst the effective sharing of patient information as part of someone’s care is almost always essential and there is enormous potential and laws that allow this information to be used to improve services and treatments, patients should be given a much greater say over how their personal information is used beyond their care. Any patient that does not want the personal data held in their GP record to be shared with the HSCIC will have their objection respected. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, the HSCIC is required to make available all the data it collects available in large aggregated, 
[normal]anonymised
[normal] datasets to allow others to use it for analysis. The prescribing data referred to in the PASC meeting is just one example of this. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We hope that the above information helps you in writing your report and recommendations on this exciting agenda where the UK leads the world.
