defaultform a significant minority group with

defaultr access to education, skills development, employment, health services and society more broadly on an equal basis with others. 
defaultWhile reliable, comparable data on the labour market participation of people with disabilities is not widely available, common p
defaultatterns are reported in countries at different levels of development. Compared to non-disabled persons, people with disabilities are less likely to be in full-time employment; more likely to be unemployed; and significantly more likely to be economically i
defaultnactive. In developing countries, they are more likely to work in the informal economy.  When in employment, workers with disabilities are more likely to count among the working poor, as they are frequently in low-paid jobs with poor career prospects and w
defaultorking conditions. Disabled women are less likely to have a decent job than either non-disabled women or men with disabilities, and people with certain types of disability – such as intellectual and mental health disabilities face greater difficulties in f
defaultinding and retaining employment.

defaultThese patterns reflect a serious waste of human 
defaultresources that

defaultA 
defaultrecently published 
defaultILO 
defaultstudy 
defaultfound that the annual loss of Gross Domestic Product attributed to the exclusion of persons with disabilities from employment opportunities ranged from 3 to 7 per cent in ten selected Asian 
defaultand African countries. 
defaultBuilding on previous research, this study developed a new approach that takes two drivers of economic losses into account: Firstly, the gap between the potential and the actual productivity of people with disabilities; This is essen
defaulttial to indicate that people with disabilities are less productive not because they are “disabled” but because they live and work in environments that are “disabling”. The second driver that is taken into account is the difference between unemployment and 
defaultinactivity rates of non-disabled people and people with disabilities. Together, these drivers yield the costs that society has to bear for excluding people with disabilities from the world of work.

defaultThe ILO promotes the employability and employment of women and men with disabilities through its standards on discrimination and disability, the development of knowledge on good practice in training and employment, policy advisory and advocacy work, and do

defaultThe key elements of a rights-based approach 
default–
default equality of opportunity, equal treatment and non-discrimination 
default–
default are contained in ILO Conventions concerning employment in general and persons with disabilities in p

default, the
