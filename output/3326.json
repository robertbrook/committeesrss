"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from The Civil Service Pensioners’ Alliance (PEX 0007)&#xa0;\nWith nearly 60,000 members and 100 local groups in England and Wales and branches in Malta, Northern Ireland and Scotland, we are a powerful voice for \npensioners.\n&#xa0;\nA number of concerns have been brought to our attention by our members \nover the current proposals for older people in the care system\n in England\n.  There does not seem to be a lot of clarification around these points in the public domain at pre\nsent, but \nwe have noticed \nthere is a great deal of anger.  The following is a summary of what people are saying\n.  \nIf people’s perceptions are accurate, and they act as stated, \nthe\nre is \na potential\n \nimpact\n on public expenditure \nfor\n both care and health\n:\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf \nsomebody has a house to sell are they going to be able to use that to get extra choice and a better care home?  Does that mean people like me will be put in one of those homes that are cheaper for the local authority, but are really badly run?  I have hear\nd about places like Orchard \nV\niew and I am scared.\n \n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf I am being cared for at home and can’t afford to pay, will I be left with minimum hours, or nothing at all, as nobody can make a profit from me? \n(They had heard of a case in which an 84 year old had bee\nn refused help from a private provider for being unprofitable).\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe feel that care homes are \nsometimes \nbeing set up by people with no background in care, \nand the press has shown that\n \nstaff in some homes \nare badly trained and bullied\n by \nmanagement\n. Older peo\nple, even if they are paying a great deal of money, can end up abused and neglected.  \nNot all homes are like this, but too many are, and there is not always a choice as the good homes are filled up. \n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThey seem to want us to give up everything we have worke\nd for all our lives.  Well I am not paying a penny, I would rather die first. This\n reply\n, now becoming increasingly common,\n was often added as a further response to the other comments we have \nsummarised\n.  \n(\nWe feel that this\n \nruns the risk \nof leading\n to more\n A&amp;E and hospital visits \nand admissions,\n thus\n putting a greater strain on the NHS. If people refuse to pay, care services may be lost, too.\n)\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThey are talking about taking our houses and valuables.  When will they do this?  Even if they don’t throw my husba\nnd out of our house\n straight after I die\n, will they be coming for my personal possessions?  If I am the last survivor, will they be after even the rings I want to be buried in.  Will this override my will?  I want to give family stuff to my children…this \nis like something out of Dickens.\n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhy should we pay all this money to live in cramped conditions, share a bathroom, and be fed overcooked bland food, followed by sitting in a circle around a TV?\n&#xa0;\nOur \norganization is\n concerned that \ncurrent\n proposals have th\ne potential to lead to a two tier system, \nwhere\n \nfrail \nvulnerable \nolder \npeople, without the means to pay, \nwill be increasingly \ndenied funding\n on the grounds they are not eligible\n (even if they are very frail and vulnerable)\n, by cash strapped Local Authoriti\nes. \nThe\nre is\n also\n the fear of\n being sent to “second class” care homes\n, since\n they are relying on a Local Authority that may not have the money available to pay extra for a better placement. \n&#xa0;\nP\neople\n \nare \nalso \nworried that,\n seeing a potential for profit\n fro\nm self funders\n,\n \nbut lacking the appropriate background and ethos, entrepreneurs and businesses \nwill look to set\n up care homes\n which \nonly just \npass as acceptable,\n but which the\nir\n local authority\n and other agencies\n may tolerate\n \ndue to a lack of suitable plac\nes\n,\n since really good care homes \ncan be\n scarce, and very often full.  They fell that as a result\n those\n less good homes may be all that is available\n to them,\n ev\nen though they are paying a lot of money and using all their assets.\n&#xa0;\nWe are also concerned that\n, if people refuse to pay\n for care\n, essential \nservices \ncould be\n lost, and the NHS \nwould be \nstretched as a consequence.  If too many\n older people\n \nrefuse to pay for care, will this \nhave the potential to \ndrive down\n their overall health, function and wellbeing\n - and\n \nperhaps \naverage \nlife spans?  \nThis would \npossibly \nhave a detrimental effect on the NHS\n ability to deal with the increasing numbers of older people,\n and drive up its costs.\n&#xa0;\nYounger relatives, particularly women, may be forced to give up work to look after elderly parents \nor relatives \nwho refuse care, which would be a backward step for women in employment, and for the economic health of the country.  O\nther elderly frail and v\nulnerable\n people\n may not have r\nelatives nearby\n,\n or \ntheir\n relatives \nmay not be\n in a position to help with care\n.  If they refuse formal care it seems likely they would \nbe at increasing risk\n, and end up costing the NHS and other services more. \nFrom the commen\nts of our members it seems that o\nlder people may avoid all services\n, not just care,\n as they fear being \nbrought to the attention of the social care service, being \nforced to accept care or a care home place by officials, and los\ning\n their homes and valuables.\n&#xa0;\nWe would very much welcome a clarification around these points to submit to our members.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
