"&#xa0;\n              \n              \n \nWritten evidence submitted by Prof. Phil Redmond [FBB0076]&#xa0;\nIntroductionThis submission is made in a personal capacity, but informed by having worked in television for over thirty years and engaged professionally with the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 at many levels.\nI created Grange Hill for the BBC and Brookside and Hollyoaks for Channel 4, and through that Mersey Television, based in Liverpool, \nwhich \ngrew to become the UK’s largest independent drama production company and a global centre of technical excellence.\nIn latter years, in my public roles as Creative Director of European Capital of Culture 2008 and then Chair of the Independent Advisory Panel to the UK City of Culture, I have witnessed the collaborative and supportive power of the BBC as the UK’s primary public service broadcaster. It’s scale and reach is something that should not be diluted but \nstrengthened, \ncherished but, \nalso be \nencouraged to better promote cultural and creative activity across the UK.\nIt will not take much. Just a small shift from competitive media company to a refocused public service facilitator. In other words, the BBC does not have \nany UK competitors for its public service remit, it does not need \nto do everything itself, but it can facilitate so many others to do \nso much \nmore.\nThis paper cannot fully expand that argument within the constraints set, but does try to answer the questions as set by the terms of reference, and in the same point order.\n \n&#xa0;\n \nSykes Committee 1923\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6 December 2013\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
