defaultIntroductiondefaultBroomley
default &amp; 
defaultStocksfield
default Parish is a community of around 1300 
defaulthouseholds with a population consisting of a broad mix of ages, incomes, and abilities.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe parish is situated to the south of the A695 which runs between Prudhoe and Hexham in Northumberland.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe parish consists of the larger settlement of 
defaultStocksfield
default w
defaultith additional satellite settlements of New Ridley, 
defaultHindley
default and 
defaultBroomley
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultBusesdefaultCurrently the parish is served by a half hour bus service seven days a week (no 10) operated by Go North East.  This is a good service but runs along the A695 and does not ser
defaultve the other parts of the parish.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe only other regular commercial service is the 
default613 between 
defaultWhittonstall
default and Hexham which travels around 
defaultStocksfield
default and some of its satellite communities.   Thi
defaults bus only operates on Tuesdays and is a much valued weekly
default service to an unsustainable community.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the recent past the route from 
defaultWhittonstall
default to Branch End (
defaultStocksfield
default) was served by a service on a weekday basis (2 buses a day each way) to Newcastle.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the distant past New Ridley was served by a regular se
defaultrvice to Newcastle which operated 7 days a week and 3-6 times a day from early morning to late at night.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor many of the residents in the parish of 
defaultBroomley
default &amp; 
defaultStocksfield
default the current bus route is up to 20 minutes walk from their homes.   In the satellite 
defaultsettlements this route is only accessible by car or bike.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany of the residents of New Ridley and New Ridley Road in particular form part of our aging population and once they are unable to drive will be isolated in their homes as the bus service does not
default meet their needs.  New Ridley is 1.5 miles from the A695 (a good 40 minute walk for a fit person
default)
default and the southern parts of New Ridley Road are also up to a 30 minute walk from the A695.
default&#xa0;
defaultTrainsdefaultThe current train service is good and offers a regular servi
defaultce to Newcastle and beyond in the east and Hexham and Carlisle to the west.   However, the rolling stock is very old and passengers would appreciate newer if not new carriages and trains.
default   Passengers travelling from the further points of the parish must u
defaultse cars or bikes
default to travel to 
defaultStocksfield
default station.
default&#xa0;
defaultComments from defaultBroomleydefault default&amp; defaultStocksfielddefault Parish Council default&#xa0;defaultIn order to identify demand for passenger 
defaulttransport in isolated communities, Government and local authorities need to consult widely with the residents of all communities in order to establish where potential passengers need to travel, at what times of day, and how frequently the services might ne
defaulted to operate.   Local authorities need to consult in as many ways as possible, e.g. through household surveys, local press, local parish and town councils, etc.   It is not enough to consult only on-line as many people do not have 
defaultdirect access to on-line
default services and do not necessarily connect to local authority and government websites.
default&#xa0;defaultThe current 
defaultbu
defaults 
defaultservices offered to the more remote and isolated parts of the parish are inadequate and do not meet the needs of people with disabilities, older or younger people.   The service most recently offered to residents in New Ridley did not meet the needs of p
defaultotential travellers, in that it did not go to the destinations to which they wished to travel.
default  
defaultThis mean
defaultt
default that it was not used by many passengers.
default This service no longer operates.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe
default appreciate that not all 
defaultof 
defaultthe wishes of potential travellers can be me
defaultt, but it 
defaultseems to us 
defaultthat the bus services are 
defaultoften 
defaultrun for the convenience of the operators and not the travelling public.
default&#xa0;defaultThe main challenge associated with funding transport services in isolated communities is the fact that by the nature of their isolation, the number of passengers is unlikely to be sufficient to make the services sustainable.   In addition, the cost of prov
defaultiding the service is likely to be high and this will naturally affect the fares.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn an ideal world, residents of isolated communiti
defaultes should not be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive services.  In the “real” world however, these services must be seen as a means of linking these communities with their larger neighbours.   However, schemes must be introduced which are
default competitive for passengers but also enable the operators to make a sustainable living.
default&#xa0;defaultThe main challenge with providing better services is to ensure that th
defaulte services offered are fit for purpose and cover routes that suit the needs of passengers.
default  There is also a need to consider cost-effective ways of providing short, additional bus routes in isolated communities which link with the regular services operatin
defaultg in nearby more densely populated areas.
