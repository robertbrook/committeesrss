default&#xa0;
defaultThe long term reform of public services focuses on choice, empowerment and personalisation for individuals and communities. The benefits centre on capacity building as well as outcomes. However, it is a time-consuming and resource intensive process to deve
defaultlop local innovative approaches to service delivery. There is, thus, a danger that radical models will remain at the margins rather than becoming part of the mainstream. One of the ways of addressing this challenge is to learn the lessons from other countr
defaulties.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTo what extent is the Government’s public service reform 
defaultprogramme
defaultsucceeding in:
defaulta. Empowering citizens?
defaultb. Improving public services?
defaultc. Ensuring that public services are accountable to the people
defaultwho use them, and to elected 
defaultofficials?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe current Government’s 
defaultprogramme
default is a continuation of the work of previous administrations on putting the customer first in the design and delivery of public services. It represents a positive shift from the paternalistic ‘professionals know 
defaultbest’ approach. The principles of empowerment, choice and 
defaultpersonalisation
default are the three key elements of a long term consensus that is also apparent in many other Western European countries. For the purpose of clarity, ‘empowerment’ relates to the provision
default of information so that the 
defaultuser has the knowledge of what is on offer, by whom and how. ‘Choice’ 
defaultcentres
default on the opportunities for users to choose the content and level of service, the provider and form of access. ‘
defaultPersonalisation
default’  refers to the ability o
defaultf the user to actively make informed decisions
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs public service reform is a long term project, it is difficult to evaluate the impact of the current government’s policies. Major changes take a long time to design and implement. For example, the previo
defaultus administration’s target set in 2002 that 100% of councils and their partners should be using choice-based lettings in social housing by the end of 2010 was achieved, as less than 5% failed to meet this requirement. In relation to community land trusts, 
defaultthe previous Government’s Green Paper on Housing in 2007 
defaultemphasised
default their role. This has been further strengthened by this Government in its housing strategy in November 2011. In research that we undertook in 2012, we concluded that there was considerable 
defaultinterest with over 150 active 
defaultorganisations
default. But outcomes in terms of new affordable homes and community-owned and managed facilities were limited. For example, less than 100 homes had so far been completed (see below). This was mainly because of the time 
defaultrequired by communities to build up their skills and to go through the development process, which can be between 3-5 years.       
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat evidence is there that citizen-
defaultcentred
default approaches to public
defaultservice design, delivery and choice of provi
defaultder can deliver better
defaultoutcomes—ensuring not only better value for money, but also
defaultgreater social, economic and environmental value?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn relation to community land trusts (CLTs) and similar initiatives, progress on
default the development of specific projects since the Quirk Review on community asset disposals in 2007 has been slow. In a study of CLTs in 2012, we found that although there were over 150 active 
defaultorganisations
default, less than 100 affordable homes had been completed.
default Nevertheless a re-occurring theme from this and earlier research highlighted the benefits to communities and individuals in building up capacity, confidence, skills and trust. For example, 
defaultthe development of a small CLT in 
defaultCumbria
default contributed to the abili
defaultty of the local community to take over the ownership and management of the village pub, thus saving it from closure.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would conclude that while outcomes are vital, one should not ignore the benefits of the process for communities and individuals. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion Three 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the risks and opportunities of opening up public services to
defaultalternative forms of ownership, provision and accountability?
defaulta. How do we ensure open access to public services under
defaultalternative forms of ownership, provision and 
defaultcontrol?
default&#xa0;
defaultIn relation to community- based initiatives, our research over the last decade highlights the following three points on the process of community empowerment and service delivery:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom
default a government perspective, delivery can appear slow because of the time to build up community capacity and then design and implement schemes. There is no fast-track solution to this without disempowering communities by imposing external solutions to speed 
defaultup delivery. A balance, therefore, has to be achieved between speed and community empowerment. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNevertheless, as has already been pointed out, the opportunities outweigh the risks in terms of building up the capacity of individuals and communities as well
default as outcomes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion Four 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the challenges and opportunities in moving power away
defaultfrom Whitehall and into the hands of citizens?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe fundamental issue is one of achieving a balance between local autonomy for councils and citizens and ensuring
default a satisfactory standard of services. We need an open date on the extent to which we are prepared to have a ‘post code lottery’ with different levels and types of services in each area. Other Western European countries have well-established and different p
defaultrinciples on central-local government relations. In the Netherlands, legislation tends to be facilitating rather than directive. For instance, there is a requirement to have a social housing allocations and lettings policy, but it is not prescriptive or de
defaulttailed. The Netherlands is the home of choice-based lettings. It was developed by the City of Delft as an advertising model in 1990. It is now widely used, but not every municipality has adopted this method. In addition, the Netherlands system of financing
default local government relies on single pot funding rather than many different streams of ring-fenced financial support. Finally and most importantly, the local government culture is one of facilitating the provision of services through strategic commissioning 
defaultrather than direct provision. There is, thus, a wide range of public, private and third sector providers. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is not to suggest that one should transfer the Dutch model to England, as the economic, political and social systems are different. However, instead, it can be used as a starting point for an informed debate about the relationships between citizens, c
defaultouncils and government.    
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion Five 
default&#xa0;
defaultHow successful have the Government’s reforms been in opening up
defaultpublic services to grassroots community groups, rather than to large
defaultprivate or third sector 
defaultorganisations
default?
defaulta. How can public service contracts be 
defaultdesigned to enable service
defaultusers to choose from a wider range of providers, including
defaultcommunity-based providers, to achieve self-defined outcomes?
defaultb. What impact has the Community Right to Bid, Community Right
defaultto Challenge, and Community Right to Build had
default on local
defaultcommunities?
default&#xa0;
defaultIn relation to (a), the social value legislation that came into force in February 2013 requires public authorities to take into account the social and environmental issues in awarding contracts through the commissioning process. Thi
defaults might include, for instance, training and jobs for local people offered by a local social enterprise. However, we should be under no illusion that in a competitive market with private companies willing to make extremely low bids and public agencies faced
default with severe funding cuts, the prospects are not good. Indeed, despite broad Government support for 
defaultmutuals
default, there is frequent coverage in the online ‘social enterprise UK’ of closures of companies. Nevertheless, examples such as Bristol and Plymouth that 
defaulthave become the first social enterprise cities is an encouraging way forward in terms of setting a strategic agenda. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn relation to (b), as has already been pointed out, the localism initiatives on community rights are starting to have an impact on 
defaultneigh
defaultbourhood
default initiatives. But it will be a number of years before there are tangible outcomes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMore generally, there is much to commend about the government’s community rights approach including 
defaultneighbourhood
default planning. However, from our research on community
default land trusts, there is a danger that the 
defaultneighbourhoods
default in most need of such initiatives will be excluded. This is because of the lack of support from central and local government for socially excluded areas. For example, while there has been interest in u
defaultrban community land trusts, none so far have progressed to the development stage. Yet it is often inner city 
defaultneighbourhoods
default and peripheral social housing estates where there is a need for and the potential of grass-roots action. The Government has put in p
defaultlace funding for 
defaultorganisations
default to provide support, but it is relatively insignificant and not targeted at areas that most require it.    
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion Six 
default&#xa0;
defaultHow well do different tiers of government or different parts of single
defaultpublic sector 
defaultorganisation
default, at 
defaultcentral, local authority or district
defaultcouncils level, work together to deliver public services?
defaulta. What impact does the Whitehall federal department structure
defaulthave on contracting for public services that fall across
defaultdepartmental or 
defaultorganisational
default boundaries
default?
defaultb. How does the Government ensure that public services develop
defaultthe right kind of leadership as they become more open, more
defaultsubject to scrutiny and more customer-focused?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe relationship between central and local governments has been covered in the 
defaultresponse to question four. From a community and a user perspective, we would like to highlight that there is often bewilderment over the number and type of public agencies and public private partnerships involved in the design and delivery of services. We 
defaultundertook a project in 2009 /10 in collaboration with Hull City Council on local delivery vehicles
default. We found that in East Hull, there were over 20 partnerships and local delivery vehicles. Residents welcomed the investment especially through the Goodwin T
defaultrust (one of the largest social enterprises in the country), but were perplexed over ‘who was doing what’ and ‘whether it was co-
defaultordinated
default’. One of our recommendations was that the local authority should consider a broader facilitating and co-ordination ro
defaultle. This contributed to some 
defaultrationalisation
default over the plethora of delivery 
defaultorganisations
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion Seven 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat examples are there of innovative ways to deliver better public
defaultservices in local government, from other countries or from other
defaultpublic service
default providers?
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is value in exploring the design and delivery of public services in other countries. But it is essential to avoid simplistic policy transfer as the ‘grass is often not greener’ elsewhere! Instead we argue for lesson learning from other c
defaultountries so as to stimulate an informed debate on innovation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFour illustrations relevant to the material in this submission are: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have already made reference to other Dutch examples in our response to question four. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are two interrelated and imp
defaultortant points arising from these illustrations. Firstly, governments can foster innovation through facilitating legislation. Secondly, grass-roots 
defaultorganisations
default can flourish and grow but they need local and national support.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion Eight 
default&#xa0;
defaultHow 
defaultrealistic is it that “choice” can be exercised in public service
defaultprovision or should we be looking instead at greater control by users
defaultso they can ensure that public services become more responsive to
defaultchanging needs?
defaulta. How do we make sure that all citizen
defaults are able to influence
defaultpublic services?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe example of choice-based lettings illustrates the importance of choice. But it cannot be separated from empowerment and 
defaultpersonalisation
default. Customers 
defaultare only empowered if they are provided with advice and information on the realistic choices that are avai
defaultlable. There are too many cases where, for example, housing advice services are not integrated with lettings. Similarly, we have come across examples where vulnerable households have been set up to fail, as support has not been available to help them make 
defaultinformed decisions. This is especially as 
defaultpersonalisation
default requires that the customers can make informed decisions on their individual unique requirements. The choice agenda has to engage with that of equality and diversity. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore, the prospects for
default choice, empowerment and 
defaultpersonalisation
default are uncertain in the current public sector financial climate – they are at a tipping point. There could, firstly, be a service retrenchment leading to reduced eligibility for services. In this case, choice would be 
defaultextremely limited in terms of scope and availability. Secondly, there might be a return to a traditional paternalistic model. Thirdly, and more optimistically, fiscal austerity might lead to a radical rethink that promotes mutualism. There are examples of 
defaultthe latter taking place . 
defaultRochdale
default 
defaultBoroughwide
default Housing, for instance, has taken over the ownership and management of over 13,000 council homes. It is a mutual 
defaultorganisation
default wholly owned by tenants and employees. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion Nine 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat safeguards should be i
defaultn place to deal with service providers
defaultwho fail to deliver services, or who deliver services of an insufficient
defaultquality?
default&#xa0;
defaultReactive responses to service failure are an essential requirement. The starting point has to be an effective in-house system. Neverth
defaulteless, there has to be external regulation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur work in Hull highlighted that residents felt that it was the role of the local authority to call local delivery vehicles and public private partnerships to account. In fact, this type of approach is common 
defaultin the Netherlands. Nevertheless, it is not appropriate where the council runs local services.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion Ten 
default&#xa0;
defaultHow do we ensure that best practice is shared so it can be replicated
defaultin the context of greater diversity of provision?
defaulta. Are there any types 
defaultof public services that you think should not
defaultbe opened up to new models of design, delivery or provision?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe basic issue is that many case studies are 
defaultlabelled
default as best practice without any transparent evidence. Websites and reports frequently cite good practice, but it is far from clear how and why they have been selected. In our opinion, they have to be robu
defaultstly and independently evaluated on process and outcomes before being accredited as best practice. There are lessons to be learnt from the Dutch example of the work of the social housing experiment unit (SEV) – see above. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHow well has t
defaulthe system of Payment by Results worked in the
defaultdelivery of public services and how do we make it work better?
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are unable to make a response to this question.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion Twelve 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat progress has been made in setting up 
defaultmutuals
default as an effective
defaultway of d
defaultelivering public services?
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have used above the example of 
defaultRochdale
default 
defaultBoroughwide
default Housing. It illustrates similar issues to the slow growth of community land trusts and community rights. Firstly, it takes time and resources to develop and deliver innovati
defaultve approaches to public services. Secondly, active community and employee involvement is not straightforward. There is often initial 
defaultscepticism
default and cynicism over such initiatives. These cannot be quickly overcome. Thirdly, while the legislative and regulat
defaultory environments are not necessarily obstacles, they nonetheless have to be addressed. Progress, therefore, can appear to be slow and protracted. But this is the inevitable part of developing radical innovative solutions.
