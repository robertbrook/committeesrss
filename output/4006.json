"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Hartswood Films [FBB0027]&#xa0;\nThe BBC is there to supply public service broadcasting, and in my \nopinion does this admirably.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is respected throughout the world.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n It is a difficult task to cover ‘Drama, Comedy, Arts, Sport, Current Affairs, \nScience, Natural History, News, and the public are fortunate that they have access to such a wide spe\nctrum at such a small cost.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTelevision plays a great part in people’s lives, across all ages, particularly the older generation, the size of which is inc\nreasing.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Some programmes, such as Natural History, take a great deal of time and money, and brilliant talent, to make and deliver to the public, and most commercial companies wouldn’t bother as they would not cons\nider it financially viable.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe BBC th\nerefore offers programmes that other\ns do not make.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nApart from the entertainment value, many programmes are great learning tools for the population, particularly the young.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n My own young grandsons are testimony to that.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n The News is valued, and more im\nportantly trusted.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n If ever there is a disaster, or big event in the world, viewers seem to naturally turn to the BBC News for their information.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nI believe that the Independent sector has added considerable value to the BBC, both as to the diversity \nand talent of their programmes, but also in recognising cost control, and their ability to obtain co-production value with other countries, and increase the export value of their programmes to the advantage of the BBC and the UK generally.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n At the moment\n the Independent sector are guaranteed 25% of output (with certain exclusions), BBC in\n-\nhouse 50%, with 25% to be shared according to acceptance of ideas.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n I believe it would be to the advantage of the BBC if the programme output w\nas shared 50/50 between \nin-\nhouse and Independents, which would contribute not only creatively, but more importantly to the financial benefit of the BBC.\n&#xa0;\nI have recently been in America and watched a lot of their Network television with interest – and disma\ny.\n&#xa0;\n I dread the day whe\nn the standard of our British television would sink so low to p\nlease the common denominator.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe BBC is unique in supplying programmes that cover so many viewers’ interests, some of them even niche viewing.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nPlease let the BBC have the opportunity \nto \ncontinue with proper support, respect,\n&#xa0;\nand understanding of their achievements.\n&#xa0;\nBE\nRYL VERTUE OBE\nProducer and Chairman, \nHartswood\n Films\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
