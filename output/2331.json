"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the National Pensioners Convention (TIC 108)1. INTRODUCTION\n1.1 The National Pensioners Convention (NPC) is Britain's largest pensioner organisation \nrepresenting around 1.5m older people, active in over 1000 affiliated groups. The NPC is run by \nand for pensioners and campaigns for improvements to their income, health and welfare.\n1.2 This outline submission by P.G.Rayner FCILT and Vice President of NPC\n is not detailed as NPC \nis not resourced for a detailed submission of this complexity.\n1.3. Whilst recognising the Inquiry is not focused solely on older people it must be recognised \nthat older people make up a substantial user of Rural Transport.\n2 \nSPECIFIC QUESTIONS. (Bullet points 1 to 6)\n2.1. As stated in 1.2 above it is not possible to answer the specifics without considerable \nresearch. That research NPC is trying to commission if funds (3k) can be found. The need is to \nestablish the position nat\nionwide because the provision varies location by location with regard \nto what is loosely described as \"Community Transport\". In some places this is free, in others a \ncharge is made, albeit to cover costs of volunteer people et al. Nevertheless it means in \neffect \nthat a disabled or PRM (Person of reduced Mobility) older citizen is disadvantaged as the use of \nthe Bus Pass is not permitted on many community transport schemes.\n2.2 Local Bus and sometimes Train Services are reduced and this is happening at the s\name time as Post Offices are closing along with other previously provide facilities, drop in centres, local \ngroup meetings, all of which funds are being withdrawn from.\n2.3 With the cessation of Taxi card, Dial a Ride, Post Bus etc. which co\nmpounds many of the \nproblems it means the most vulnerable in society are disadvantaged.\n2.4 The summation of the questions posed by the Committee lead inexorably to one question, \nthat of cost. Setting aside clich√©s like \"Main Challenges\" and \" Identify Demand\" the real \nquestion is Bullet Point 6 which comes down simply to how do you fund transport in isolated \ncommunities.\n2.5 The simple answer is that society has to accept that giv\ne older people Inclusion and the \nprovision of adequate transport is part of that Inclusion, they are able to contribute.\n2.6 Not all older people are without some disposable income which they will spend in the Towns \nand villages, if they can get there. Older person's health and well-being is better which is a cost \nbenefit to NHS. Car usage is reduced which has environmental advantages.\n2.7 Most importantly by the mobility Inclusion brings older people do much voluntee\nr work of \ngreat financial benefit to the wider society.\n2.8 Attached is some research solely directed at assessing that value. It is acknowledged that \nthe example is not of a rural nature but the principle is the same. There are also other erudite \nexamples\n of research which are available to illustrate this point.\n2.9 It is essential adequate Rural Transport is provide for if by that Inclusion older people are \nable to leave their homes they will not be seen as tomorrows problem but part of tomorrows \nsolution\n.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
