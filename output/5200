default&#xa0;defaultWRITTEN EVIDENCE SUBMITTED BY THE PRIMATE SOCIETY OF GREAT BRITAIN TO THE ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEEdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultINQUIRY INTO THE KEEPING OF PRIMATES AS PETSdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default1default4defaultthdefault January 2014default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultSummarydefault1.1.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultPrimate Society of Great Britain (PSGB) is a UK learned society (Registered Charity No. 290185
default, 
defaulthttp://www.psgb.org/
default) 
defaultaffiliated to the International Primatological Society and the European Federation for Primatology. P
defaultSGB was founded in 1967 to promote research into all aspects of primate biology, conservation and management
default 
defaultwith the publication of the useful results of such research. The 
defaultSociety is very strong scientifically and holds regular scientific meetings. 
defaultPrima
defaultte Eye
default is the PSGB journal, and the Society has also recently adopted 
defaultFolia Primatologica
default as another official PSGB publication. It also awards several medals to mark individual contributions to primatology. PSGB has three permanent working parties: the Cap
defaulttive Care Working Party, the Conservation Working Party, and the Research Working Party.
default1.2.
default 
defaultThe Captive Care Working Party 
default(CCWP) 
defaultconsiders all issues that relate to the use, maintenance and breeding of primates in captivity. It 
defaultprovides expert advice to inte
defaultrested parties within and outside the Society and co-ordinates action on matters relating to the welfare of primates in 
defaultall
default captive settings.
default CCWP also awards grants to support research that benefits primate welfare in captivity, and to assist education pr
defaultojects about captive primate welfare. 
defaultMembership of the CCWP 
defaultincludes
default 
defaultthose
default with specialist knowledge of,
default or a professional interest in, the care of primates in captivity. Currently, membership comprises both researchers and animal welfare representatives who have experience with a range of primate species (
defaultXXX
defaultStrepsirhines
default, New World monkeys, Old Worl
defaultd monkeys, and apes) in a variety of captive settings. One of the challenges facing the CCWP is to form stronger links between all institutions housing primates, particularly research faci
defaultlities, zoos and rescue centres.
default1.3.
default 
defaultPSGB feels that this inquiry is tim
defaultely and that the three areas for focus for the inquiry are vitally important to determining the extent of primate pet ownership, the effectiveness of regulation and the crucial issue of whether primates should be kept as pets at all.
defaultPSGB is 
defaultunable
default to comment with authority on this issue however RSPCA figures from 2009 
defaultindicate there are between 2500-7500 primates kept by private individuals in Great Britain
default.
defaultPSGB submitted a comprehensive review of the Draft Code of Practice on the Welfare of Privately Kept Non-human Prima
defaulttes as part of the Animal Welfare Policy Team Consultation in April 2010. As we are opposed to the keeping of primates as pets
default,
default as detailed below
default,
default we do not believe that the Code of Practice or existing regulatory framework can adequately ensure the necess
defaultary conditions exist
default to make pet ownership acceptable. Other organisations, such as the RSPCA, with more experience of the implementation of regulation are better placed to provide evidence in this area.
defaultThe first part of this is the major area where PSGB can express an authoritative opinion and 
defaultit is the 
defaultmajor 
defaultfocus
default of our submission detailed below. The implementation of a ban would necessarily involve m
defaulticrochipping and registration of all pet primates. They would also all need to be removed from private ownership and placed in 
defaultapproved, licenced facilities where adequate care can be provided
default for the rest of their natural lives or until their quality of l
defaultife is judged to be sufficiently threatened as to require humane euthanasia
default.

defaultAs affiliates
default of the International Primatological Society (

default) PSGB endorses and supports a common policy on the Private Ownership of Nonhuman Primates 
defaultwhich opposes the keeping of nonhuman primates in captivity by individuals for any non-scientific, non-certified educati
defaultonal or non-registered/accredited sanctuary purposes, including the possession of nonhuman primates as pets or companion animals as well as engaging in importation, breeding and trading for these purposes.

defaultThe International Primatological Society therefore opposes the ho

default”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis section is structured on the above paragraphs (2.2.1 to 2.2.8)
default3.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultConservation status of primates in the wild
defaultThe survival of a great many primate species is threatened. Indeed the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species identifies that 54% of 
defaultaround 400 
defaultprimate species and subspecies for which information on conservation status is available are threatened with extinc
defaulttion. While many primates currently held as pets will have been bred in captivity
default,
default continuing demand is likely to fuel 
defaultthe often illegal 
defaultcapture 
defaultand trade 
defaultof individuals from the wild. 
defaultOnly a fraction of live primates extracted from the wild survive for lo
defaultng enough to become pets. 
defaultThe absence of definitive and rigorously applied tests to demonstrate the origin of individual animals creates loopholes for the continued extraction of animals from increasingly threatened wild populations resulting in further th
defaultreats to the survival of 
defaulttheir species in the wild.
default 
defaultIn the wild primates 
defaultlive in complex societies and 
defaultplay an important role in maintaining the health and viability of forest and woodland ecosystems, including pollination and seed dispersal, thereby ensur
defaulting forest sustainability and diversity. Therefore, all trade in wild primates has consequences for both ecological and social group stability and is regulated by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species).
default3.2 
defaultPrimates are highly inte
defaultlligent animals
default              
defaultThe very features that make primates attractive to some people as pets result in them not always coping well with captive conditions. Compared to most other animals primates have very large brains relative to their body size
default, and 
defaultthey are 
defaultalso cognitively advanced “
defaultwith complex emotional, social and physical needs and capabilities
default”
default.
default Typically, unless these needs and capabilities are met in a species-appropriate way significant stress and even distress may result and consequently the animal(
defaults) may manifest a range of serious symptoms including aggressive behaviour (directed to themselves or their keepers), stereotypic behaviour, immune suppression, and social withdrawal
default 
default(
defaultNovak et al, 1994; 
defaultMallapur &amp; Choudhury, 2003
default; Hosey &amp; Skyner, 2007
default)
default. Ev
defaulten with the application of significant resources and expertise it is difficult to provide adequately for captive primates in this regard. A pet keeper is unlikely to be able to approach acceptable standards let alone achieve Best Practice standards in this
default area.
default A key aspect for provision for primates is their social environment: humans are not appropriate social partners for nonhuman primates. Primates should be kept in species-typical social groupings in structura
defaultl
defaultl
defaulty
default complex environments wherever possible
default to help 
defaultprovide
default all opportunities to display a natural range and frequency of desirable species-typical behaviour
default 
default(
defaultWolfensohn &amp; Honess, 2005
default; Jennings et al., 2009
default)
default.
default In most cases these conditions will be too challenging for a pet keeper to meet (and perhaps for regulating bodies to assess) and generally require specific primatological expertise to implement and evaluate.
default3.3 
defaultDevelopmental challenges
default              
defaultCaptive breeding
default and wild capture 
defaultpractices
default often involve the forced removal of an infant from its maternal setting at an earlier age than would occur during natural weaning. It is 
defaultinfants or young juveniles that are typically supplied as pets as they exhibit desirable ch
defaultaracteristics of dependency and 
defaultbaby-features. Primates are characterised by having long periods of development during which the norms of behaviour, appropriate social interaction, food safety and safe environmental exploration are moderated by adult group
default-mates, particularly their mother
default 
default(
defaultPrescott et al, 2012
default)
default.
default Removing an infant from its mother early prevents its appropriate behavioural development and may result in imprinting on human keepers and subsequent development of sexual and aggressive behaviour towards their keeper or other humans
default.
default It may be equally d
defaultamaging for an infant to be parented by a conspecific which has experienced an abnormal development
default 
default(
defaultSuomi, 2006
default)
default.
default3.4 
defaultPrimates as physical threats
default              
defaultNonhuman primates can pose a hazard to human health and safety in the form of physical attacks that can res
defaultult in serious injury or even death when the primate is not adequately maintained and securely contained. 
defaultMany primate species may grow to be quite large and powerful and without appropriate containment may pose a significant threat to 
defaultowners or innocent 
defaultbystanders
default. Even many of the smaller species often favoured as pets are capable of inflicting serious bite wounds. Poor husbandry, inadequate social and environmental provision, and inappropriate development (see paragraph 3.3) may increase the likelihood 
defaultof the display of dangerously aggressive behaviour
default 
default(
defaultHoness &amp; Marin, 2006
default)
default.
default3.5 
defaultPrimates and disease
default              
defaultDue to their genetic proximity to humans, primates are highly susceptible to a number of human diseases and in some cases (e.g. tuberculosis
default, herpes simple
defaultx virus
default) are more susceptible than humans. In addition there are diseases which have a lesser impact on primates that are extremely serious, even fatal (e.g. simian herpes B virus) when contracted by humans
default 
default(
defaultWolfensohn &amp; Honess, 2005
default)
default.
default 
defaultIn many cases disease may pass in both directions. Exposure to disease among children or 
defaultolder
default is likely to have greater consequences.
default3.6 
defaultProvision of adequate care
default              
defaultAs noted earlier (paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3) primates have very specific care requirements
default. 
defaultResponsible, accredited and well-resourced institutions that maintain captive primates for educational, research or sanctuary purposes may be able to provide adequate care
default, where they meet appropriate sources of guidance on best practice in primate care (
defaulte
default.g. large peer reviewed scientific literature,
default 
defaultIPS International Guidelines for the Acquisition, Care and Breeding of Nonhuman Primates
default [IPS, 2007]
default,
default 
defaultAZA/EAZA husbandry manuals
default, and 
defaulthttp://marmosetcare.com/
default)
default. 
defaultProper care of primates is expensive and 
defaultrequires careful monitoring
default, particularly given that they are long-lived 
default(up to 40 years in some species) 
defaultand require correspondingly enduring 
defaultcommitment
default. 
defaultWithout sufficient 
defaultfinancial 
defaultresource
defaults
default or expertise (as established objectively) a pet owner will be 
defaultunable to meet the most basic environmental, social or cognitive needs of t
defaulthe animal. Indeed it is also 
defaultun
defaultlikely that appropriate specialist veterinary expertise will be available for the pet keeper to provide for the security of the animal’s health
default 
default(
defaultHoness &amp; Wolfensohn, 2010
default)
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.7 
defaultRegulation of primate keeping
default              
defaultPSGB recognises the importance of existing UK laws
default,
default regulations 
defaultand Codes of Practice 
defaultthat apply to the keeping of animals
default,
default such as primates
default,
default in captivity. Educational and scientific use of pr
defaultimates is subject to regulatory oversight that has considerable public and expert, including PSGB
default,
default support. The difficulties of providing adequately for 
defaultany 
defaultprimate in captivity
default and their very specific requirements mean that
default, in
default our expert opinion
default,
default it is virtually impossible for the private individual to meet the appropriate needs of a pet primate and it is equally difficult to evaluate the adequacy of husbandry and care provision without sufficient expertise. It is unlikely that existing licencing 
defaultand inspecting authorities possess such expertise. Further considerable difficulties exist around the clear demonstration of sourcing the animal from an appropriate and licenced supplier. In many cases chains of ownership are unclear and subject to fraud w
defaultith wild-caught animals being passed-off as captive bred.
default3.8 
defaultCaptive breeding of primates
default              
defaultPrimates may be justifiably bred in captivity for a variety of purposes (e.g.  conservation, education and research) by a variety of regulated organisations and ins
defaulttitutions. PSGB does not believe that the captive breeding of primates for pet ownership is justified and we oppose it.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe IPS policy to which PSGB subscribes makes a clear case against the keeping of primates as pets. This written submission 
defaulthas sought to add to the summary points in the IPS policy to provide greater weight to the case against 
defaultkeeping 
defaultprimate
defaults
default as pets. A basic inability to provide adequately for their social, cognitive, environmental, veterinary
default,
default and in some cases dietary needs alone 
defaultshould rule them out as legal pets. A paucity of adequate expertise for the existing assessment, licencing, inspection and enforcement of regulations relating to keeping primates as pets simply adds weight to the argu
defaultment. 
default              
defaultAll our evidence applies to primates that may be kept as trained aids to people with disabilities. 
defaultIn short, the personal benefits to handlers and breeders resulting from the trade in primates as pets are small compared to the costs in terms of anim
defaultal welfare, human safety and the conservation of intact wildlife habitats.
default Primates do not make good or appropriate pets
