defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultWe are in a rather bigger room than usual and you look rather a long way away.  I hope that does not make any difference to the way we conduct ourselves.  Let me first of all say I am not the Chairman of the Committee, 
defaultal
defaultthough some will remember that for many years I was.  Lord MacGregor is away today so I have been asked to take the Chair instead.  I know the familiar faces down there and you know the routine very well.  We are delighted to see you
default, 
defaultMr Haskew, Ms Barbour and Mr Roy-Chowdhury.  I do not know whether you want to make an opening statement, or do we g
defaulto straight into the questions?
defaultFrank Haskew: defaultStraight into the questions.
defaultThe Chairman:default If I should be the one to start, then, have you been able to review the report on partnerships published recently by the Office of Tax Simplification?  If so, can you give us your initial reactions to that?
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: I have been on the OTS panel looking at partnerships, so I will start with a preamble.  I looked at the draft in a lot of detail, and I 
defaulthave 
defaultprobably not been through 
defaultthe final version 
defaultin as much detail as I would like.  
defaultACCA
default, as an organisation, will make a separate submission.  A lot of work has gone into the report.  As it says on page 13, there have been 50 meetings around the country.  Various groups have been consulted.  It is an interim report and has been categorised into quick fixes, medium-term and long-term.  
defaultIn 
defaultthe 
defaultlong-term
default category
default, and I know we will come on to this later on, I would be very keen to see the LLP legislation incorporated in.  We would perhaps look at a much more holistic report at the end of the day on partnerships.  One of the problems 
defaultthat 
defaultwe had in the OTS committee is that the LLP draft legislation only came out 
defaultwhen 
defaultthe final report was about to be produced.  I know it says in the interim report that it was not within 
defaultits 
defaultremit, but it could not have been in 
defaultits 
defaultremit because the legislation was not available at the time.  That is something we probably need to pan
default 
defaultout and look at more later on.  
defaultIn terms of the timetable, the OTS is going to be looking 
defaultat other aspects 
defaultof partnership
default 
defaultlate
defaultr this year
default, if it is allowed to continue.  
defaultT
defaulthere is an election next year, so we are probably looking at legislation
default 
defaultin 2016
default 
defaultat the earliest
default.  Within that time, we probably have enough time to look at the current proposals on LLPs, et cetera.
defaultFrank Haskew: defaultI very much concur with what
default defaultChas has just said.  As you know, the OTS report came out 
defaultat 
defaultpretty much the same time.  Our initial view is that the OTS, as 
defaultit has 
defaultconsistently done, 
defaulthas
default made some very telling, useful and helpful contributions about the way the tax system can be simplified.  It could be seen 
defaultas their being 
defaultlet down somewhat by the fact that we have 
defaultg
defaultovernment policy going on in parallel, at the same time.  It makes it very difficult when you have almost a twin-track approach.  Really, we need to bring it all together and have one consistent approach.
defaultCharlotte Barbour: defaultICAS is in a similar position
default.  defaultWe worked
default defaultwith John Whiting.  He came to meet a lot of our members and we were really pleased with the conversations.  They were robust; they were interesting.  A lot of our members
default’ concerns
default have come into the OTS report.  We are really pleased to see that.  In the short term, that may be refocusing HMRC activities and how we support partnerships.  To remember they are not the forgotten partner would be helpful.  In policy terms, it would be nice to see a bigger picture, and we concur 
defaulton 
defaultdoing everything collectively in one place, rather than piecemeal.
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Rowe-Beddoe:default defaultThe draft legislation does not impose the general partnership law tests to determine whether a member of an LLP is a partner or an employee for tax purposes.  It said 
defaultthat 
defaultit produces some detailed mechanical tests.  Could it not have been simpler, is the question, and more coherent to have extended the general partnership law rules to LLPs?  Why did you think the Government chose not to?
defaultFrank Haskew: defaultThat is quite an interesting question.  I do not think it is very clear why they went down that route.  The original May 2013 consultation effectively talked about using the existing tests.  Somewhere along the line, it seems as though that view was changed in favour of these totally different tests.  We would still question whether the fundamental basis
default for the way the Government have 
defaultapproached this is correct.  Section 4.4 of the Limited Liability Partnerships Act talk
defaults
default in terms of a member of an LLP being treated as a partner.  It then go
defaultes
default on to say
default that 
defaultif they were treated as an employee under the existing partnership rules, that would still apply.  On the face of it, you would say 
defaultthat 
defaultthe LLP rules and the existing partnership rules are pretty much coherent, and I still do not think we have had a satisfactory answer as to why it seems 
defaultthat 
defaultthat is not regarded as the case.  
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: There certainly has not been any kind of discussion of it.  It was mentioned briefly in the initial consultation paper last May.  It discussed, much as Frank has, the differences between partnership and limited liability partnership, and that members of an LLP should be treated as a partner.  I suppose the only difference there is that you do have limited liability.  My reading of it is that perhaps
default 
defaultdraft
defaulting
default the tests of what is or is not an employee or disguised employee is quite difficult, allowing for the limited liability.  
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: I fully agree with Frank and Charlotte.  One of the key reasons, I guess, behind why we have the three tests is to create no requirement for clearance, uncertainty or ambiguity for self-assessment purposes.  So, yes, it probably helps the HMRC and the Treasury, but at the same time it seems as though the Treasury thought of these tests outside the consultation.  They did not appear anywhere in the consultation.  Looking at the consultation again for the purposes of today, the three tests appeared from left field.  I am not sure other than for certainty why these tests appeared, or how they were devised.
defaultLord Rowe-Beddoe:default Is it right that the original policy aim was to place members of LLPs in the same position for tax purposes as a partner in a general partnership?  Would you agree with that?
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: Yes.
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: I think 
defaultS
defaultection 4.4 of the LLP Act makes it quite clear that that was the policy intentio
defaultn.
defaultLord Rowe-Beddoe:default So why do you think the legislation that was introduced in 2000 did not achieve the then
default 
defaultstated policy objective of aligning the tax treatment of LLPs with general partnerships?
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: It would probably be our view that it did, and that perhaps things have moved on.  Back in 2000, it did work.  Some partnerships became LLPs
default, 
defaultthose that were partners became members
default, 
defaulttaxation rolled on with limited liability for the bigger firms, and that worked well enough.  Over the process of the last maybe 14 years, various factors all combine to make national insurance more expensive
default, such as 
defaultemployee rights
default and 
defaultperhaps auto
default&#x2011;
defaultenrolment.  Employees are quite expensive, and perhaps that is the driver.
defaultLord Rowe-Beddoe:default Has the option of realigning with general partnerships been sufficiently explored, and has it been sufficiently explored clearly with the Government?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: Our answer to that would be that the initial consultation document back in May was very much along those lines.  
defaultC
defaultlearly a lot of submissions 
defaultwere 
defaultmade to that.  However, we took the view that we should work with what we had
default. W
defaulte should work as best we could within the existing rules, which at least have the benefit of having been with us for many years.  It seems, somewhere along the line, 
defaultthat 
defaulta decision was made to change that, but I do not think that was really communicated very properly and a detailed case made as to why these new tests had been devised.
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: I would go back to what I said earlier about the OTS.  We need to defer this legislation coming into effect retrospectively from April before the legislation is even enacted in July, or whenever the Finance Bill passes to become the Finance Act.  Let us actually look at these tests
default. L
defaultet us actually look at the proposals for LLPs and come back to them fully under the OTS umbrella, rather than just dealing 
defaultpiecemeal 
defaultwith partnerships the way that this has.  It creates a lot of uncertainty
default and 
defaulta lot of administrative burdens, which we will go on
default 
defaultto in the next question.  It is something 
defaultthat 
defaultwe could do in a much better way, rather than the way that is being proposed at the moment.
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Leigh of Hurleydefault:default defaultI wanted to look at the detailed tests to determine whether an LLP member should be treated as an employee for tax purposes.  I have read them with care.  I would be very interested in your views on how you think they might or might not work in practice.  Condition C 
defaultin particular 
defaultis troubling me, but I would be interested to see how you would see 
defaultit working in practice.
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: We are equally struggling with them, I think it is fair to say.  As you say, we have this three-part test.
default  You run into trouble straight
defaultaway where you have words like “reasonable to expect”
default, and you 
defaultget to Condition B, where a person needs significant influence.  That may not be the case in a large partnership with individual offices, where profit-sharing arrangements may be by office rather than the wider partnership.  Even before you get to C, you get into trouble with Condition B, for instance.
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: It is very difficult to fulfil.  Whoever thought up these tests do
defaultes
default not seem to understand how partnerships, say accountancy practices across different jurisdictions, across different countries, come together and how you would have to change the partnership agreements to be able to fall within these tests.  
defaultThey do 
defaultnot seem to properly understand commercial reality and how businesses operate in partnerships.  
defaultThey are 
defaulttrying to hit a tax
default 
defaultavoidance nail on the head and missing, and then using a sledgehammer to do that.
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: Anecdotally, we have had a lot of feedback from our members, and all of them seem to be considering their partnership agreements and worrying about it.  There certainly seems to be quite a bit of feedback from members that they are concerned about the tests as well.  We are all sitting here looking at tests that are not that easy to get to the bottom of, quickly and easily.  Again, relying on guidance is questionable
default,
default too, for a statutory test.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurleydefault:default Are you seeing people in practice restructuring their partnership agreements?
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: Our members are coming back to us and saying 
defaultthat 
defaultthey are looking at it.  I do not know if they have actually done it yet.  Of course, they are concerned too, as April is not far away, and in a big business—
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: The draft legislation was only published on 10 December.  We have had Christmas.  The tax-return season, January, is an extremely busy period for professional partnerships, so with the best will in the world we effectively have two months now to try to implement legislation that is actually quite difficult.  When you look at the anti
default&#x2011;
defaultavoidance provisions, I think in 863(c), you have some very difficult provisions to apply.  On the face of it, anything you do to get you out, you ignore.  
defaultThe 
defaultHMRC guidance then goes on to give examples where clearly they take the view that normal arrangements will not be caught.  That is very helpful and welcome, but it is all in guidance.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurleydefault:default Yes.  Again in practice, when your members and your clients are trying to determine who is a partner and employee, have you seen similar tests, and in particular capital contribution tests, as being a fundamental part of their decision
default&#x2011;
defaultmaking process as to whether or not people are equity partners, as far as they are concerned?
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: That is going to happen after this month.  A lot of partnerships, especially a lot of ACCA members, 
defaulthave 
defaultprobably not even woken up to some of the problems 
defaultthat 
defaultthey have.  So after the tax return season is over I think they will be getting down to looking at these things.  As we have said in our submission, we have a situation where somebody might be an employee under this legislation and have to pay national insurance, but they would not be an employee under employment law.  All round, there seems to be a greater complexity and things that have not been properly thought through.
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Joffe:default In relation to partnerships with mixed membership, the policy objective of the draft legislation is to prevent the tax
default&#x2011;
defaultmotivated allocation of profits and losses.  To what extent does this happen in practice, and are their bona-fide commercial arrangements likely to be 
defaulta
defaultffected?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: Again, we are seeing more evidence of mixed-partnership structures coming through.  That has certainly been feedback that we have been getting over the years.  The fact is that people are responding to the changing business environment here.  LLPs have been with us now for some years.  We have a large disparity between income-tax rates, and particularly marginal income-tax rates.  If you are just over £100,000, your marginal income
default&#x2011;
defaulttax rate, including national insurance, is potentially 62%.  That compares to a corporation
default 
defaulttax rate that will be 20%.  So there are huge distortions within the tax system.  
defaultWe are increasingly seeing, obviously, people looking to take advantage of lower rates because of commercial reasons, such as wanting to retain working capital.  We do know that there are a lot of existing mixed partnerships that historically have had corporate partners within them.  Our initial view is that there are a lot of arrangements out there, but a lot of this is fairly normal, conventional tax planning.
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: I thought 
defaultthat 
defaultsome of the OTS statistics were helpful and useful on this, because we did not have much of a handle on it.  In family businesses, rural and estate
default&#x2011;
defaulttype businesses where you may have three generation businesses, there are bigger structures to accommodate farms, 
defaultthe 
defaultbits and pieces that they do, 
defaultand the 
defaultdifferent commercial operations within a family business.  In the professional world, by way of numbers, it is only in the last three or four years that our institutes have changed the rules to allow mixed groups.  
defaultN
defaultot that many partnerships are mixed partnerships with corporate.  There are more, and they are becoming more common.  It is one of the reasons 
defaultwhy 
defaultthe rules were changed.  They are definitely in a small minority at the moment.
defaultLord Joffe:default The second part of the question was what commercial arrangements are likely to be 
defaulta
defaultffected
default.
default  Could we have a few examples, perhaps putting aside Scottish agricultural properties?
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: Why would we do that, now?
defaultLord Joffe:default It is fairly limiting.
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: Family businesses perhaps are in a similar position.  You might have had a business that started as unincorporated
default and 
defaultstayed as unincorporated.  It may have been set up with one young member of the family to do a particular venture
default,
default and you might want to limit your liability there, so you would perhaps park that in a separate company.  That might be an instance where you end up with a mixed group.  That is a possibility.  Also, in family businesses your succession planning can be important, 
defaultso 
defaultcoming down the generations you might want to stay unincorporated rather than incorporated.
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: What 
defaultCharlotte
default has said is entirely right.  It is important to remember that in recent years incorporation has become very much the vehicle of choice.  Perhaps 20 or 30 years ago, people did not tend to set up companies, certainly at family level, because of all sorts of reasons, not just tax but others as well.  The environment has become very much more favourable towards companies in policy terms in the last 20 years, not just in tax, but in terms of company law and reporting. It is much easier now to use corporate vehicles within larger structures in a way that 20 years ago it was not.
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: A lot of policy has driven people towards incorporating.  The tax rates are a good example of that.
defaultLord Joffe:default Why, if the solution is corporate, is it necessary to change the law in relation to non
default&#x2011;
defaultcorporates?
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: That assumes that you think it is appropriate, and that everybody should want to have their vehicles driven by tax into a corporate.  About 10% of business
defaultes
default are still unincorporated in partnerships.  There are sole traders.  It is a moot point as to whether you should start out as a corporate in the first instance.  If somebody came for advice, you would probably say, “Start up as a sole trader
default, 
defaultstart up in a smallish partnership
default, 
defaultsee how things go
default, 
defaultmove onwards”
default.
default  It is a much more flexible means of doing business.
defaultThe Chairman:default There was evidence previously from people who said to us, “A lot of the smaller businesses ought to be companies rather than partnerships, because that has more flexibility
default”.
default These proposals will increase that tendency, will they not?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: That is likely.  It is rather strange that at the same time we have all this
default legislation, the Government have
default asked the OTS to undertake a review of the competitiveness of the UK tax system with a view to making recommendations about how it can be improved.  What we are seeing on the LLPs and structuring is a reasonable use of LLPs in a competitive environment.  It seems rather odd that we have a review of competitiveness going on but at the same time we seem to be clobbering LLPs and mixed partnerships in this way.  On the face of it, they are undertaking transactions in a commercial way that you might say is fairly reasonable.
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: The OTS interim report says that LLPs are not there as a tax
default&#x2011;
defaultavoidance measure, by and large.  It is something that has been examined.  When we talk about partnerships, we are talking about £150 billion in the 
defaultUK
default economy.  It is quite a significant amount.  We need to be very careful about what we are doing
default when we 
defaultchang
defaulte
default the rules and the law 
defaultin the 
defaultvery piecemeal way 
defaultthat 
defaultit seems 
defaulthas been done 
defaulthere, which is going to impact a lot of LLPs and partnerships
default directly
default.
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Joffe:default One of the reasons 
defaultwhy 
defaultthat has been advanced is
default that 
defaultthere is a move to change the law to allow LLPs to retain capital, one of the consequences of which would be to pay tax at a lower rate.  Now, I wonder why there 
defaultshould 
defaultbe a tax incentive to companies or LLPs to retain profits when they can retain profits in any event at the normal rate of taxation
default.
default  Why should there be an additional incentive?  What is the justification?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: Since the previous Government, we have seen a move to encourage the use of companies.  The previous Government and this Government have always been keen to encourage growth and to retain and reinvest as a fundamental policy.  We saw that with the last Government
default and the 
defaultzero rate of corporation tax.  So there is a policy to try to encourage people to retain earnings.  A mixed partnership is one way of achieving that but within a wider LLP.
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: A mixed partnership allows you to use the corporate member to retain profits.  That is no different from if you had totally incorporated your whole business.  It allows you to use the legislation in a different way but to achieve the same result.  I do not think you should differentiate between the two.  To me, it is a perfectly sensible proposition that you could retain capital for working capital to reinvest.  Of course, the other thing with mixed partnerships is that they do not always get access to some things that companies have, so that is another reason for allowing them to retain it as working capital.  As and when money comes out into the hands of the individual owners, they are still going to be paying inco
defaultme tax at whatever their income-
defaulttax rates are.  It is purely to allow reinvestment, which is one aspect of policy.
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Bilimoria:default I have declared all my interests, including being a Fellow of the 
defaultInstitute
default of 
defaultChartered Accountants
default in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default.  May I build on some of the points you have just made with regard to competitiveness of the 
defaultUK
default tax system?  
defaultT
defaulthe blunt question is 
defaultwhether 
defaultthese changes 
defaultthat are 
defaultbeing proposed 
defaultare 
defaultgoing to make us
default 
defaultmore competitive or less competitive
default.
default  Secondly, the 
defaultInstitute
default of 
defaultChartered Accountants
default in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default has this excellent list of 10 tenets for a b
defaultetter tax system, which include
default competitiveness.  How many of these 10 tenets do you think this new proposal ticks?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: Not very many would be a short answer to that.  To give you a longer answer, these rules are not competitive.  We do seem to have a bit of a dysfunction here between a Government keen to encourage competitiveness and encouraging the OTS to look at the tax system in that regard, and provisions such as we are talking about at the moment.  Administratively, trying to comply with this is going to be very, very difficult.  Every year, you are going to have to look at these three-part tests to see whether you are complying with them.  That is not a very competitive tax system, because the costs of trying to administer it and deal with it for both taxpayers and HMRC are going to be quite substantial.  We have a problem with the costs of these measures being anti
default&#x2011;
defaultcompetitive.  
defaultGoing back to the 10 tenets, I am delighted that you have them there.  Certainly competitiveness is one of them, but it is one of 10.  While we have not looked at these provisions against our 10 tenets, I can pretty much put my hand on my heart and say 
defaultthat 
defaultI do not think
default they
default are 
defaultactually 
defaultvery simple.  They are certainly not very certain.  By and large, the provisions do not really match up to our 10 tenets.
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: One of the areas where we would have a question mark over competitiveness is
default that 
defaultif you have income tax and corporation tax at significantly different rates, whether we like it or not it is going to become part of a driver of what you do.  Your competitiveness should not be driven by that.
defaultLord Bilimoria:default It is not our remit to question the tax rates, but you have made a very valid point there.
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: It is not really 
defaultabout 
defaultrates.  It is more 
defaultabout 
defaultpolicy as to whether you want them 
defaultto be 
defaultso different.
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: It is also 
defaultabout 
defaultnational insurance.  That is really what the legislation is all about, as well.  There is a big disparity between the self-employed rate and the employee rate, which is driving this.  We need to be very careful, in terms of 
defaultUK
default competitiveness, where we are going.  Just to redress the balance, the ACCA published 12 tenets of taxation about four years ago, which is available on the ACCA website.  We have circulated it to this Committee in the past and would be very happy to do so again.
defaultLord Bilimoria:default May I just ask another very simple question, based on what you just said?  Do you think on the whole
default that
default people create LLPs for the protection of the limited liability or for tax reasons?  Do these new rules change that?
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: I think quite honestly 
defaultthat 
defaultthey create them first of all for limited
default&#x2011;
defaultliability and 
default“
defaultif
default 
defaultthey
default 
defaultfall
default 
defaultout
default 
defaultwith
default 
defaulttheir
default 
defaultpartners
default”
default reasons.  They are an evolution of the partnerships that probably existed previously with unlimited liability, and they then formed LLPs.  Tax cannot be ignored, but I think 
defaultthat 
defaultthe main driver really 
defaultis 
defaultnot tax but the commercial-liability issue.  As I say, the OTS report accepts that 
defaultthat 
defaultis the main driver behind LLPs.
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: LLPs were introduced entirely for commercial reasons.  They are a valuable extra way of operating a business in the 
defaultUK
default, alongside companies and traditional partnerships.  The danger is that these provisions will potentially put people off using LLPs, which would seem anti
default&#x2011;
defaultcompetitive.  You want to adopt whatever business structure is the most appropriate for your needs.  LLPs should not necessarily be disadvantaged.  We have been approached by another 
defaultgovernment department 
defaultin the last month or so to say LLPs are disadvantaged as compared to companies
default, and 
defaultdoes that
default not 
defaultneed
default t
defaulto be addressed?  The answer is that 
defaultit is going to get worse if we have these rules coming through.
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Leigh of Hurleydefault:
default Can I just re
default&#x2011;
defaultdeclare my interests, 
defaultwhich I declared the 
defaultfirst time, which
default include being a member of the j
defaultunior 
defaulti
defaultnstitute to the Scottish 
defaulti
defaultnstitute?  I understand your remarks in respect of the partnerships that moved to LLP
default, and that 
defaultmost of your members will be in that position.  Just re
default&#x2011;
defaultaddressing Lord Bilimoria’s question again, does that apply to organisations that were not partnerships and became 
defaultan 
defaultLLP, or indeed started off life and became LLPs?  Obviously, limited companies come in.  Would your comments apply in those circumstances?
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: Yes.  We must recognise that tax is an issue.  However, the primary reason why they wanted to form a partnership rather than a limited company was because of the liability issue.  Yes, you have the same kind of protections within a limited company, but you do not have the same kind of flexibilities perhaps.  Certainly, things have moved on in terms of corporation tax, et cetera
default, b
defaultut LLPs were really there for liability reasons.  That is why people went into those, rather than for tax savings.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurleydefault:
default But a limited company does that as well.
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: Yes, but if you are in an accountancy practice, or a law practice, you would normally set up as a partnership rather than going to limited company.  Maybe that needs to change, but that is the way it has been inherited in our profession.
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: Once upon a time, you were not allowed to operate, for instance, as a chartered accountant through a company.  That has changed
default,
default but the rules are still quite difficult to get within, so it is still normal that our members tend to operate through LLPs or partnerships.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default  Forgive me
default, 
defaultI am specifically addressing organisations that are not necessarily your members and that are not necessarily accountancy or legal partnerships but that have chosen to become LLPs for reasons that we are trying to understand.
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: 
defaultIt 
defaultwould be quite interesting to take up
default,
default 
defaultperhaps 
defaultin further work with the OTS
default, the matter of 
defaulthow many relatively recent non-professional LLPs have taken up.  I quite accept that there could be some 
defaulton the 
defaultfringes of the low-paid and the highest-paid 
defaultthat
default have gone into it in order to get the benefits of, say, self-employment.  I appreciate that that is a possibility.  I am not aware of any number work that has been done around that, and it would be helpful to try to quantify that before we bring in these rules, which, from our members’ feedback, seem to have a much wider impact than we would expect to target the evil, if it is there.
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default Apart from the measures 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have been discussing, the draft 
defaultB
defaultill also includes proposals affecting alternative investment fund managers and countering the practice of reducing tax liabilities by transferring assets or income streams within a partnership.  None of your written submissions had much to say on these measures.  Are we entitled to read it that you broadly agree with them?
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: I think you have probably singled out the ACCA submissions, where we thought there could be double taxation.  Where we are coming from is that
default 
defaultin 
defaultSection 863(e)(iv)(d) 
defaultin 
defaultS
defaultchedule 1, where the remuneration has been allocated to a specific partner, that partner has to pay, under 
defaultparagraph 
default(iv)(d), a tax
default charge at the additional rate: 
defaulti.e. 45%.  If you like, that payment of 45% is made, and we are not entirely clear 
defaultwhether 
defaultit is held in a pool within the partnership or given to HMRC.  If it is given to HMRC, we appreciate that under 
defaultparagraph 
default(v) of that section, there is not meant to be an additional charge subsequently on those profits
default,
default but from what we can see, if that allocation of profit does not vest with the partner it was originally allocated to, there does not seem to be a mechanism by which that partner could be refunded tax from HMRC, if that is where the tax ends up.  We are just flagging up that there seems to be perhaps, without sufficient information here, 
defaultthe 
defaultpossibility of double tax.
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: We have not commented on this particular part because we have not had a lot of member feedback on it.  I would not take from that that we are either in favour or not in favour.  We are ducking.
defaultThe Chairman:default I added that little bit on the end
default,
default but perhaps I should not have done.  
defaultLord Bilimoria:default To build on what you have just asked, Chairman, Mr Roy-Chowdhury, you just mentioned 
defaultthat 
defaultyour submission concludes that in some circumstances these AIFM partnerships would
default in effect
default be subject to double taxation.  Could you just talk further about that, please?
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: I discuss
defaulted
default with Bill yesterday whether this is too complex to bring to the Committee today, and he said that this is exactly the sort of thing that we should be bringing here.  The situation is that if you have an allocation of profits under this type of partnership, under 
defaultSection 863(e)(iv)
default you are taxed at the time of the allocation and you are taxed at the additional rate
default, which 
defaultat the moment is 45%.  
defaultW
defaulte would envisage
default that that 
defaulthas to be paid across to HMRC, but we accept that without clarification it might be pooled within the partnership itself and then paid across subsequently, in which case some of our concerns about double taxation would disappear.  If it is paid across to HMRC, however, it then says, under 
defaultparagraph 
default(v)
default below that, that HMRC will not double tax the profits.  However, there does not seem to be a mechanism for this example.  Partner A has the profits provisionally allocated
default,
default and therefore has to suffer the 45% tax, but he does not fulfil the requirements where the profits vest with Partner A.  If Partner A does not then get the £100 of profit, say, and he has already paid £45 tax, that profit goes back into a pool and to another partner or a number of partners.  What then happens 
defaultto 
defaultthe tax?  Is it repaid back to Partner A if it has gone to HMRC, or is it purely ignored and is 
defaultthe 
defaultpool of profits 
defaultthat is 
defaultgoing to Partners B, C and D taxed again?  Is that double taxed
default,
default or how is 
defaultparagraph 
default(v) going to be applied so that double tax does not occur?
defaultThe Chairman:default I would ask you to answer that question.  I think we will move in a minute to the new approach, and I am going to ask Baroness Drake to start that, but has anybody got any question on the stages we have reached so far?
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Bilimoria:default If I could just build on this, the other 
defaultpoint 
defaultis that AIFM proposals emerged from the consultation that HMRC had on profit and loss allocation for mixed-membership partnerships.  How much additional yield does this produce?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: It is substantial.
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: Yes, quite a lot, according to the impact assessment.
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: It is about half a billion pounds, I think, according to the impact assessment.  I just need to find it.
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: 
defaultPartnerships: A Review of Two Aspects of Tax Rules
default does not give numbers, 
defaultbut the proposed revisions that they are looking at in the current year are very low
default: £
default125 million in 
default20
default14-15
default, 
defaultbut £1.45 billion in 2015-16.  It then seems to stabilise above £600 million, but we are not entirely sure where these numbers come from.
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: If you look at the figures, the second row is the extra that will 
defaultcome
default from these measures.  In 2015-16, that is £680 million, and you get to over £1 billion when you add in the original measures on the mixed partnerships.  
defaultW
defaulte are talking potentially
default about more than 
default£
default1 billion here from these measures, so 
defaultas you can see it is a substantial revenue 
defaultraiser.
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: That is part of the reason why
default we ask whether some of this is
default double taxation that has been factored in.  I suspect 
defaultthat 
defaultis not the intention, so we are just wondering where it is coming from.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default Can I just ask you to clarify?  You understandably stated that the ABC questions were too rigorous, difficult and mechanical and had administrative problems to implement.  Are you saying that they should not be implemented
default for that reason? We have seen 
defaultevidence that, for example
default,
default about 20,000 fruit pickers 
defaultare 
defaultall partners, 
defaultso are you saying that 
defaultthere should be some sort of tests but that these are the wrong tests
default, 
defaultor are you just saying that there should be 
defaultno 
defaulttests?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: Bearing in mind 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have only seen these tests since 10 December, and 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are going to have to implement them by 6 April, 
defaultin effect, 
defaultwe are saying that this is potentially extremely difficult territory.  We have the OTS also looking at a review of partnerships.  We think that there needs to be more time for this.  Going back to your figure of 20,000, we do not have any experience of partnerships that large.  That is huge and that is not our experience.
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: It does not feel like a partnership, somehow, does it?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: It does not.
defaultLord Leigh of Hurley:default For tax, however, it may be.
defaultThe Chairman:default If the Inland Revenue 
defaulthas 
defaultexamples of that, 
defaultis it 
defaultright t
defaulto want to do something about it?
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: Yes.
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: Precisely, but that is not our experience of the LLP rules.  Just going back to the position, we are not against what the HMRC and Government are necessarily trying to do in policy terms, but we need some rules that are workable, simple
default,
default certain to implement, and not too anti-competitive for the UK.  We think that we need a bit more time to do that.
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: In our first submission following on from the May consultation last summer, we understand that if there is an issue with the extremes of LLP usage, there should be targeted anti-avoidance legislation, and that is 
defaultunderstandable.  The proposed A to 
defaultC tests are quite hard to work with.  We have not had a lot of time to look at them.  There is not a lot of time between now and April.  When you combine that with, say, the work that the OTS is doing, the ideal situation perhaps might be to have these wrapped up back into the OTS work or a wider version of that work, and to look at it in the round before we just bring in these anti-avoidance measures and then think, “Oh, heck, what have we done?”
default.
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: At the very least, do not bring them in retrospectively in April, because we do not even know what the legislation will be, ultimately, in July.  We had the same situation for GAAR—the 
defaultgeneral anti-abuse rule
default—and that was then changed to vesting.  At least that would be the logical time to bring it in if it is to come in this year, but ideally let us think about what we are doing.  None of these three tests 
defaultwas 
defaultput out for consultation
default. They 
defaultjust came totally from left field.  I just do not understand where they came from, other than some ideas within 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury 
defaultthat 
defaultwere then not properly tested.
defaultLord Bilimoria:default You just mentioned GAAR.  Some commentators have said
default 
defaultthat this transfer of assets and income streams could have been better tackled through GAAR.  What would you think of that suggestion?
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: I have seen that, and one of 
defaultmy 
defaultconcerns about GAAR is that we need to keep it at the extreme
default,
default abusive
default,
default end.  I would probably counsel against that, because I think we can get something to work better within the LLP legislation.  In terms of the LLP legislation
default itself, if the Government feel that
default there are abuses, we need to deal with that rather than going through this mechanistic test.  We need to look at that rather than just having a plaster of GAAR over that.  One of the problems we would consider to be an issue is if GAAR then starts mission-creeping down to be
defaulting
default general rather than at the abusive end.  That is why I would probably counsel against using GAAR but get the LLP legislation properly worked through and worked out.
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: I would entirely agree with that.  Part 4 is clearly aimed at abusive situations, so it is quite right and proper that 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment should be looking to counter what seems to be an abusive use of LLPs.  Chas is right that we should not be looking to necessarily use GAAR to tackle that sort of thing.  They probably have the right approach with that.
defaultBaroness Drake:default Could I just ask a question on the AIFM point?  It comes back to your express concern about the risk of double taxation, where retained profits are taxed and then not subsequently vest
defaulted
default back to the individual partner.  I am assuming that that is the issue that you are concerned about.  Are the Government’s proposals in part constrained by the requirements of the AIFM directive, where, as I understand it, there still has to be a tax charge on profits that are deferred, even if the partner cannot access them?  I thought that was a requirement of the directive
default,
default and therefore to some extent HMRC is constrained by having to meet the terms of that directive.
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: Yes.  We do not have an issue about the tax charge.  It is a matter of making sure that the tax then goes back.  The tax overall is 45
default%
default on that 
default£
default100 of profit rather than perhaps being 45
default%
default and then the tax being charged again, where it vests with another partner.  In 
defaultparagraph 
default(v), it is quite clear that that is not the intention, but we would just like more detail to make sure that that is the case.
defaultBaroness Drake:default You think there is a need for clarification of the Government’s response, because presumably they want to discourage people using corporate partners in order to address the directive issues.
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: Yes.
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Drake:default May we get your views on the new approach to tax 
defaultpolicy-making
default using, again, the proposals relating to salaried members of LLPs as an exemplar?  The gulf between some commentators and the Government on this seems to be growing.  Far from iterating back to a point of clearer consensus, the gap seems to be growing, particularly on these economic tests.  Is this a failure of the new 
defaultpolicy-making
default process?  Why do you think this is happening?  Is it a fundamental disagreement of opinion or a failure of the process?  What would you say?
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: One of the issues 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have—and we have probably said quite a lot about the LLP proposals or draft clauses—is that the consultation said one thing and we have ended up with the proposals or draft clauses saying something else.  Clearly, there has been 
defaulta 
defaultdisconnect between the consultation and what has now come out.  A lot of the tax 
defaultpolicy-making
default is vested within 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury.  There are some very bright people in 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury but there is not, perhaps, sufficient tax experience or knowledge there, and perhaps there is not sufficient tax challenge, as used to happen in the past, where HMRC would devise tax policy and there would be quite a lot of challenge from the Treasury.  I think we need to look at the way that policies are challenged within 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury, because it does not seem as though it was done effectively.  We have other examples with the 
defaultchild benefit that has co
defaultme out, which has been universally criticised. There have been a lot of policy issues in the way the final product is then put out in legislation, or the final product itself.  What is it trying to achieve
default,
default and why is it not trying to achieve it in a way that is less complex, to get to the root of the problem in an easier-to-implement way?  
defaultThat is where it has fallen down, and we need to go back to what we are trying to do.  We had a consultation, so let us look at the responses.  If we do not get responses back that are necessarily in tune with 
defaultg
defaultovernment policy, let us go back and do it again.  In some ways, 
defaultwhile 
defaultACCA
default was
default not in favour of GAAR and we are not in favour of GAAR, the consultation process 
defaulton GAAR 
defaultwas very good.  I think the controlled foreign company consultation was very good.  There have been iterations and changes along the way, so that the final product has taken account of input, and that is really what we need to do.  Hopefully, part of the process 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are going through here will affect what finally comes through on LLPs as well.
defaultBaroness Drake:default In your view, then, a weakness in the consultative process is the knowledge base on partnerships
default, 
defaultparticular
defaultly
default contemporary developments in partnership.  This 
defaultquestion 
defaultis for the rest of the panel as well: how do you think the Government should correct that, if that is a valid perception?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: That is the emerging consensus from quite a lot of commentators, and 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment need to recognise that what they have produced still needs further work and consideration, because I do not think 
defaultthey have 
defaulttaken 
defaultfull 
defaultaccount of the real implementation difficulties, for a start, of what is on the table.  There has been a comment that it seems as though HMRC or HM Treasury do not understand what partnerships are about and how they operate commercially.  We need to recognise that and to look at these provisions again and do another consultation.  We seem to have gone from a consultation 
defaultthat 
defaultwas going down one track to suddenly
default 
defaultsomething completely different, with no obvious linkage as to how they really got there, and I do not think that is very satisfactory.
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: I
default thought that 
defaultthe OTS report was quite informative, and perhaps partnerships have fallen somewhere down the middle as a poor man or something like that.  
defaultW
defaulte 
defaultmay 
defaultneed to bring them back up to the table and spend a bit longer looking 
defaultmore widely at how 
defaultpartnerships work.  Maybe everybody is in that boat.  I will admit
default that 
defaultif 
defaultyou 
defaultgo back and look at the consultation paper 
defaultfrom 
defaultlast summer you can see strands that come through now, but there does seem to be a mismatch in understanding.  Maybe folk have not spoken about it enough together.  
defaultOne of the things that was quite interesting for us when this partnership consultation first came out was that our members were really concerned about the mixed partnerships.  We invited HMRC to meet our members to discuss it, and I think 
defaultthat 
defaultfinancial pressures, time pressures and all the rest of it meant that we ended up with a phone call, which was really helpful and it was very good of them to do that.  We 
defaulthad 
defaulta fulsome discussion
default,
default but if I compare that with something like changes to trusts, where the HMRC officials concerned came and met us, in fairness you can have more exploratory and wider discussion on a face-to-face basis than perhaps you would just on a paper consultation and phone calls.
defaultBaroness Drake:default There is a slight tension, is there not, between on the one hand not being onerous and not being anti-competitive in the impact of the tax provisions
default,
default and on the other hand the Government’s concern that people are using LLP status when, in fact, they are employees
default.
default What partnership tests, in your view, would reconcile those tensions, if 
defaultthey are 
defaultnot the economic tests?
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: To take a slightly different tack, one of the interesting aspects here is that when anything is anti-avoidance, it gives a different flavour because the Government will want to stop people from doing things that arguably they should not be doing.  Sometimes, however, it is a moot point as to what is labelled anti-avoidance and what is not labelled anti-avoidance.  I am not convinced that we have seen the full range of evidence yet to demonstrate that these are really big anti-avoidance measures or whether, in actual fact, if we took a step back and discussed them on broader principles we might find out that there is not as much money at stake or that they are not being used as aggressively as perhaps folk think.
defaultBaroness Drake:default Would other panel members like to comment on that tension and how the tests would best resolve that tension between inappropriate use of partnership status and remaining competitive?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: There is a tension, is there not?  There always has been and there always 
defaultwill 
defaultbe.  The OTS report makes exactly that same point
default,
default but there is a danger where the Government ha
defaultve
default always
default in effect 
defaulthad an override on the consultation process for measures that are anti-avoidance.  We subscribe to that and that is entirely fair and reasonable, but the problem starts where you have measures that are probably a bit of both or it is not clear that some of the proposals are anti-avoidance but in fact impact on a much wider population.  That is the problem with this: we are into measures that are trying to tackle a certain area of difficulty but are potentially impacting on a much wider scale.  There is that tension there, and the way to resolve that has to be further discussion, and honest and straightforward discussion, between HM Treasury, HMRC and interested parties to try to make sure that if 
defaultthe Government think that 
defaultthere is abuse in 
defaulta 
defaultparticular area, that abuse is tackled but not everything else with it.
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultBaroness Blackstone:default I want to pursue the subject of consultation.  The ICAS has commented, “Some consultations feel genuine whereas some others leave the sense that they are observing the process rather than the spirit”
default.
default  How far do your organisations share that view?
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: I guess this is directed to Frank and me, is it?  What Charlotte and ICAS have said is specifically true.  As we can see in the LLP consultation, we had one set of proposals on th
defaulte ideas under the consultation, but
default the draft legislation has come up very different.  There is 
defaulta 
defaultdisconnect.  What was taken on board
default,
default or why were those consultation questions asked if the final product is not within that document?  It just seems very odd.
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: Our view is that the consultation process is clearly better, and we have always welcomed that.  The trouble is that it is let down by certain proposals, and this is one of them.  In particular, where there is an anti-avoidance element, it seems as though it is just going to happen, regardless of just how difficult it might be commercially and how expensive it might be to implement for people.  We saw that over the last few years with measures such as the annual tax on envelope dwellings, where you just felt that there was a juggernaut rolling, that this was going to happen and, no matter what you said about it going to be almost impossible to implement, nobody was listening.  By and large, it is better, but there seem to be particular examples where it really needs to be improved.
defaultBaroness Blackstone:default Can you give us a few more examples 
defaultof 
defaultwhere you feel 
defaultthat 
defaultconsultations on this year’s 
defaultB
defaultill have been a mere formality?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: The trouble is that we are still in the consultation process for this year.
defaultBaroness Blackstone:default Do you mean that there are going to be more to come?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: Some of it may come right; we are still in the process.  Other examples 
defaultof 
defaultwhere we are finding potential difficulties are the onshore intermediaries rules, where again we sense 
defaultthat 
defaultthere could be instances that are going to apply in commercial situations that we do not think should be caught.  They are the same sorts of principles.  We are talking and we are hopeful that we will get change
default,
default but at the moment it is fair to say that we do not seem to be making a lot of headway.
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: The HMRC digital self-assessment consultation document was a four-week consultation over Christmas and 
defaultthe new year
default.  The clauses are already in the Finance Bill.  Also, I believe 
defaultthat 
defaultthe employee share
defaults-
defaultfor
default-
defaultrights proposals were already before the House when apparently the impacts were being consulted on.  There has been quite an array of different areas that have been “consulted on” but not really.
defaultBaroness Blackstone:default Do you think that anything more can be done to embed the new approach to 
defaultpolicy-making
default in the way in which both Treasury Ministers and officials are working?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: We have said that improvements 
defaultcould be 
defaultmade to the way impact assessments are drawn up.  Impact assessments are ultimately the bedrock of policy formulation, or at least that is the Government’s position.  We do not feel that those impact assessments are properly taking account of the costs of implementing them.  The cost generally and the processes you need to go through to implement change are completely underestimated.  They also do not take account of what processes businesses have to go through
default,
default and in a way we are seeing it here with the partnership rules, because it does not seem to be reflected in the way the commercial world works.  Our view is that the process could be improved if there was greater emphasis at an earlier stage on getting those impact assessments and the costings of change built in, so that you have a real indication of what it is going to cost to make the changes.
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: It would be very useful if the Cabinet Office principles on consultation were enshrined in law.  At the moment, the Cabinet Office’s principles seem to be being watered down.  I have not brought it with me but the period of consultation used to be 12 weeks; it has gone down and has become an “if you can, consult for a period of time”.  If the requirement for 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment to do that
default was 
defaultin legislation
default, unless it 
defaultrelates to 
defaultanti-avoidance, which would only be very narrowly focused, there should be proper consultation.  That really is a part of why the OTS was set up and part of why draft Finance Bill clauses are published, but we need to look at the other consultations that go on.  They should follow a proper template
default that is 
defaultenshrined in law
default and which 
defaultthe Government should be going through, rather than something 
defaultthat 
defaultthey can cherry-pick and change as they wish.
defaultBaroness Blackstone:default You have not mentioned the Tax Professionals Forum.  Does that have any role in all this?
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: I think you had two members from there giving you evidence on Monday.  Clearly, they look at the administrative side of tax 
defaultpolicy-making
default and implementation
default,
default and hopefully they will comment on this type of thing
default,
default but I am not sure that we are involved in that forum ourselves.
defaultLord Wrigglesworth:default Just before we move on to the next question, I am going to follow up on that.  Where do you think the problem lies?  Is it with officials in HMRC?  Is it with officials in 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury?  Is it with Ministers?  Where is the problem?
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: There seems to be a rush to get things done.  Clearly,
default the 
defaultGovernment 
defaultare
default always under pressure.  There is 
defaultnever
default enough time.  If they spot something, they want to do something about it.  The reality, however, is that where 
defaultyou 
defaulthave something done very quickly, you repent at your leisure, so it is better to do things properly and not come against obstacles like the 
defaultpasty tax or the child benefit 
defaultchanges or something else that has just been thought up and has to be implemented today or as soon as time allows.  There is ministerial pressure and there is also probably pressure within the Civil Service to get things done quickly, but as we mentioned, 
defaultunder the last Government 
defaultthe tax policy quite deliberately moved away from HMRC
default, 
defaultor the Inland Revenue as it was
default, 
defaultto 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury, and we probably need to see some of that 
defaultpolicy-making
default going back to HMRC 
defaultand the Treasury creating the tensions to challenge some of those policies, which is perhaps not happening enough.  That then ties in with the consultation process, which needs to be given sufficient time for people to make a proper submission, and there should then be responses back as to why the Government, for example on the LLP proposals, decided to go in a totally different direction to what was in the consultation document.
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wrigglesworth:default The Scottish
default,
default English and Welsh 
defaulti
defaultnstitute
defaults
default in their submissions have both called for the Government to clearly identify a strategy for different parts of the tax system, 
defaultas they did 
defaultfor 
defaultcorporate tax 
defaultin 2010.  I wonder if you would like to expand on that proposal, and whether the ACCA might give us a comment on it as well.
defaultThe Chairman:default Expand, but not 
defaultfor 
defaulttoo long.
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: Shall I just be very quick?  I entirely agree with ICAEW and ICAS that there should be a strategy of mapping other areas.  Corporate tax has been very helpful and has acted as a road
default 
defaultmap of where the 
defaultUK
default is going in inward investment and business in general.  The same ought to apply for income tax.  There is no reason why we should keep tacking and changing rates and strategies of 
defaultincome tax
default, so, again, a road
default 
defaultmap in that area would be very helpful.
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: We have all been here long enough to see corporate tax and income tax rates do this, and behaviour perhaps follows suit.  It would be really helpful to have a slightly bigger picture rather than trying to nip away at the problems once they become anti-avoidance problems.  That is why I think a bigger strategy picture is needed.  The corporation tax 
defaultroad map
default was really helpful.  It would be great to have a business tax, and that would be for all businesses, as we have been discussing today, regardless of whether they are income tax or corporation tax.  The other really big driver is employee versus self-employed.  To try to get a wider wrapper around would be very attractive.
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: We have said that as well.  We have to recognise that the tax system, particularly on the smaller business end, is facing a lot of pressure points.  IR35 in 2000 was one attempt to try to tackle certain elements of it, but here we are, 14 years on, and we seem to have many more sticking plasters.  Indeed, the LLP provisions are sticking plasters.  There is a need to step back and look at the tax system strategically, which might mean looking at income tax and national insurance
default and how 
defaultthey work together, and whether that is the right way forward.  I do not think that we can duck these questions in the long term if we are going to have a simple and competitive 
defaultUK
default tax system.
defaultLord Wrigglesworth:default You will be aware that the 
defaultsub-committee 
defaultmade a similar recommendation in 2011 but it has not happened.  I just wonder whether you think it is 
defaultbecause of 
defaulta lack of resource, a lack of time or a lack of inclination.
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: It is a difficult mix, is it not?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: It is easy to understand the Government’s difficulty when 
defaultthey are 
defaulttrying to tackle a budget deficit.  It is very difficult to undertake fundamental tax reforms when you are up against needing to shore up a 
default£
default100 million deficit.  It is much easier to have a strategic change in the tax system when you have a budget surplus and you can probably 
defaultmake it 
defaultpart of a tax-cutting agenda.  That is easier to sell. It is difficult.  You need to secure your revenues as a Government, and the one thing that you cannot afford to do is to put your revenue streams at risk at this particular juncture.  One can understand the difficulty of wanting to make major strategic changes to the tax system.
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default We are coming to the end, but listening to what you have said I am not sure that you have not answered this question.  In his evidence last week, John Whiting commented that the partnership between HMRC and the Treasury was working pretty well.  Am I right to conclude that you would not absolutely agree with that?
defaultChas Roy-Chowdhurydefault: What John Whiting seems to have said in the middle, compared to his wrap-up, 
defaultwhich 
defaultwas positive, seems to be contradictory.  He was 
defaulttalking 
defaultabout the tensions and the lack of experience within 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury, which are really the sorts of things we have been saying, so we are not entirely sure how he then comes to say 
defaultthat 
defaultit is very positive.  While we are not negative and doom
default 
defaultand
default 
defaultgloom about the relationship at all or the way that policy is working, we just feel 
defaultthat 
defaultit could work a lot better with HMRC looking at and building policy, and HMT then challenging that policy rather than, 
defaultas it is 
defaultat the moment, producing a policy and challenging it 
defaultitself
default, which is perhaps not the right way.  Looking at yourself and criticising yourself is perhaps not the best way of devising tax policy.
defaultThe Chairman:default We have to end but I am going to ask whether anyone has a question.  Lord Joffe has one.
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Joffe:default I have a few
default,
default but because of a shortage of time I think we might rule out the second one.  This is addressed to Ms Barbour.  In 
defaultClause 14 of 
defaultyour written evidence, you say, “
defaultAlthough it is accepted that there may be some tax ‘schemes’ where there appears to be no or very little commercial purpose other than tax saving, ICAS members have said that in the majority of mixed partnerships this is not the case
default”
default.
default  Bearing in mind that there is a lot of opposition to the 
defaultg
defaultovernment proposals, have you any thought on what sort of legislation could be prepared to deal with the minority who are using this particular process in order to avoid taxation?
defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: That is one of the difficult issues around here, and it 
defaultis 
defaultperhaps reflected in the LLP legislation as well.  It is difficult to write targeted anti-avoidance legislation and, as we have said in our evidence, there are some schemes where you perhaps raise your eyebrows, but I think the vast majority do not do that.  
defaultO
defaultur members have to combine that with a lot of regulatory requirements 
defaultsuch as 
defaultaudit registrations
default and 
defaultinsolvency licences
default—
defaultkinds of things.  It is not necessarily that easy just to nip in and get one tailored measure, which is why we have come back to really welcoming the OTS investigation and 
defaultits 
defaultinterim report, because we think that it raises all the issues and it would help to look at it in the round as to how you solve it, because it is not that easy.
defaultLord Joffe:default It needs to be solved for the minority.

defaultCharlotte Barbourdefault: Thank you.
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: There is no real motive test in this at all.  It is a mechanical test, effectively.  In most anti-avoidance legislation that we have had over the years, there is a clear motive test.  There is a sole or main purpose test being tax avoidance, and there is not really a lot of evidence of that here.  That would normally in the old days have got you out, because you would have a commercial override.  We probably 
defaultneed to 
defaultlook a bit at directing it clearly towards cases where there is obvious tax avoidance.
defaultLord Joffe:default We need a better test, and that was what I was asking: have you any suggestions as to a better test?
defaultFrank Haskewdefault: A better test would be at least having a motive test
default that is 
defaultsimilar to many of our existing anti-avoidance provisions.
defaultThe Chairman:default It has been very nice for me to see familiar faces over all the years, and I would like to thank you very much for coming.  Thank you for your written submissions and thank you for the way you have answered all the questions.  You certainly have not lost any of your skills over the years, and thank you very much indeed.
