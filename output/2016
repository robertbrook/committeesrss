defaultDear 
defaultRos
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther to our recent correspondence, please see our full response to the Draft Deregulation Bill below.  I have set this out in the same order as the provisions appear in the draft bill for ease of reference.
default&#xa0;
default1.

defaultPage 21, 
defaultpara
default 16 - Extension of s147 HA '80 to restricted byways and BOATs: We agree with this new provision however feel that an additional criteria needs to be included in this section to allow limitations to be 
defaultauthorised
default where they are necessary for security, which is a major problem in rural areas in particular.  We also believe that the power should be extended to carriageways in general - many minor unclassified roads have the character of a byway, with a road running into a byway or bridleway with no obvious physical distinction.
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther, the anomalous lack of the ability to rescind 
defaulta
default s147 
defaultauthorisation
default should be addressed.  It is widely known that many authorities have had to come up with alternative solutions because s147 does not allow these functions - this can present LA's with a very awkward situation.
default&#xa0;

defaultpara
default 17 - enabling LA's to recover actual costs and costs of the 
defaultSoS
default:  We fully agree that LA's and the 
defaultSoS
default should be able to recover all of their costs.  However, we also feel that being able to require commuted sums for taking on additional burdens of maintenance would be a more helpful incentive, as is already the case for new road/footpath adoptions under s38 HA '80 Agreements.  In addition, making applicants undertake pre-application consultations with statutory 
defaultconsultees
default and the parish council should be a requirement, in order to weed out weak cases and to ensure that applicants have addressed likely objections before they become a time-consuming problem for an authority to deal with.
default&#xa0;

defaultPage 72, 
defaultpara
default (3) 1A (1): Preliminary assessment using Basic Evidential Test (BET) and notice of applications.  We are in 
defaultfavour
default of this 
defaultprovision,
default it will not take much officer time to check the evidence and decide whether there is a reasonable basis for the application and will also ensure applicants are given feedback on their application shortly after they have submitted it.  Detailed guidance should be provided concerning the way in which an authority should assess whether the BET is met - a 
defaultstandardised
default method should be set out for use across all authorities to ensure applicants are treated fairly and consistently throughout the country.  We also feel that a BET can be applied to 
defaultapplications based on user evidence which could save wasting resources on evidently weak applications.  It is essential that the new legislation specifies what happens when an authority rejects an application, i.e. that the decision is final and is only open to challenge through the Courts (JR) process.  It should also specify whether the applicant can be given a set amount of time within which they may re-submit their application with further evidence.
default&#xa0;

default.
default              
defaultPage 77, 
defaultpara
default 3: New section 53ZA.  We are in 
defaultfavour
default of this new provision, which will potentially enable us to save resources by not having to undertake a full investigation where an error is obvious.  This would of course be dependent on what the regulations require - guidance will need to be comprehensive to help 
defaultminimise
default the potential for a challenge to an authority's decision to deal with an anomaly in this way and ensure fairness to all parties.
default&#xa0;
default5
default.
default              
defaultPage 77, 
defaultpara
default 5: New section 54B.  We are in 
defaultfavour
default of this new provision, which will enable some DMMO applications to be determined much more speedily where the landowners are happy to consent to this, and for a more pragmatic approach to be taken by surveying authorities to the often complicated situations that arise.
default&#xa0;
default6
default.
default              
defaultPage 79, 
defaultpara
default 6: We think it is a good idea for applicants to be required to include an explanation as to why they believe the DM&amp;S should be modified.
default&#xa0;
default7
default.
default              
defaultPage 80, 
defaultpara
default (3)1A(4):  We agree with the proposal for the OMA to contact the landowner, however it will be necessary for guidance to be included on what lengths the OMA should go to 
defaultto
default discover their identity and address and how site notices are to be 
defaultauthorised
default.
default&#xa0;
default8
default.
default              
defaultPage 80, 
defaultpara
default (4) 1B (1): It is essential that the legislation or supplementary guidance specifies who will be responsible for covering the cost of an application to the Magistrates' Court and the subsequent Court costs that are incurred.  This also applies to page 81, 
defaultpara
default 1D (1).
default&#xa0;
default9
default.
default              
defaultPage 81, 
defaultpara
default 1D (1):  It is essential that Magistrates are given full guidance on how to deal with such appeals against non-determination, as many authorities have a substantial backlog of applications and numerous appeals may be made.  In particular Magistrates should have prior awareness of the 
defaultRoWIP
default process and how that often sets out the way in which an authority 
defaultprioritises
default applications and any formally adopted Statement of Priorities that an Authority may have.
default&#xa0;
default10.
default              
defaultPage 83, 
defaultpara
default (8) 3A:  We agree with this provision, as it will prevent cases being considered by the 
defaultSoS
default on more than one occasion, effectively meaning an Inquiry will be held following the appeal if the 
defaultSoS
default thinks the evidence is strong enough to merit this.  The legislation and guidance must however contain adequate provision to ensure that all interested parties are made aware of the appeal/Inquiry so that a situation can be avoided where someone who is affected by the order only finds out about it after the Inquiry has been held, as Orders made following a PI must be confirmed so there is no further right to be heard for anyone who is aggrieved by the order.  The applicant or any owner or occupier of any land to which the application relates are prescribed parties in terms of receiving notice of the appeal, however user groups and local parish councils are not mentioned, therefore we would ask that consideration is given to this, as this will help ensure all potential objectors are given an opportunity to be heard, reducing the 
defaultpossibility of a subsequent legal challenge from an interested party who only found out about the order after the Inquiry.  In general, we believe there is good evidence to suggest that good, thorough consultation is worth the extra upfront work to save resources in the long run and that this principle should be embedded in any new legislation or guidance.
default&#xa0;
default11.
default              
defaultPage 83, 
defaultpara
default (8) 3A (3):  We welcome the ability to decline to submit an appeal to the 
defaultSoS
default if nothing in the grounds of appeal relates to an issue of relevance.
default&#xa0;
default12.
default              
defaultPage 84, 
defaultpara
default (10):  This provision appears to remove the restriction on submission of new evidence at a late stage that was introduced in the PINS rules for public inquiries.  We feel it is important that an authority can still make an application for costs against a party who it feels has acted unreasonably and caused unnecessary expenditure to be incurred.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default              
defaultPage 84, 
defaultpara
default 3B (2) &amp; page 91, 
defaultpara
default (4): We welcome the provision for the 
defaultSoS
default to disregard any irrelevant objections and decline to cause an Inquiry to be held and the ability of the 
defaultSoS
default to make an Order themselves.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default              
defaultPage 87, 
defaultpara
default (11) 4A: We welcome the introduction of a formal procedure whereby one applicant can transfer their application to another person, as this will remove the potential for disputes concerning the validity of an application where the applicant has changed.
default&#xa0;
default15.
default              
defaultPage 87, 
defaultpara
default 7 (2), Page 90, 
defaultpara
default 9(2) &amp; page 92, 
defaultpara
default (2) (a): We strongly support the proposal to remove the need for authorities to advertise both WCA &amp; HA Orders in the press.  This is often very costly and will mean 
defaultless resources
default are expended in this area for authorities and for applicants to who these costs are often passed on to.
default&#xa0;
default16.
default              
defaultPages 87-88 &amp; page 90-91:  We also welcome the proposed new ability for authorities or the 
defaultSoS
default to separate Orders into different parts so that unopposed parts can be confirmed.
default&#xa0;
default17.
default              
defaultPage 88, 
defaultpara
default (4) 7A &amp; page 90, 
defaultpara
default 9(3
default)(
default2ZA):  We strongly welcome the new power for LA's to confirm opposed orders where the objection(s) are not relevant.  However there will clearly be objectors who do not share the LA's view that their objection is not relevant.  In this situation, what avenues are open to the objector to challenge the LA's decision?  Presumably they could contact the LGO, but only after they had been through the LA's corporate complaints procedure or they could apply to JR the decision, although their ability to do this would be reduced by the cost of applying to the Courts.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlso, as the 
defaultSoS
default can also decide whether objections are relevant, some less competent LA's may forward objections to the 
defaultSoS
default for a decision rather than taking the decision that an objection is not relevant themselves.  How can authorities be compelled to treat this role seriously?
default&#xa0;
default18.
default              
defaultPage 88, 
defaultpara
default (5) (2B) &amp; page 92, 
defaultpara
default (7)3A(2):  We support the proposal for the High Court to quash the 
defaultSoS
default decision rather than the Order - this will save resources removing the need for another Order to be 
defaultbe
default drafted and advertised, etc.  However we 
defaultalso feel that the High Court should still be able to quash an Order if it is deemed to be incapable of being confirmed.
default&#xa0;
default19.
default              
defaultPage 89, 
defaultpara
default 6:  The proposed ability for an authority to confirm an Order with modifications itself if the affected landowners consent this 
defaultthis
default will obviate the need for Orders to be sent to the 
defaultSoS
default for modification where for example, a minor mistake has been made in the wording.  This will save the 
defaultSoS
default and OMA considerable amounts of time and is therefore supported.
default&#xa0;
default20.
default              
defaultPage 184, 
defaultpara
default 316 removal of "Reasonably alleged to subsist":  We agree that this test should be removed for claims based on documentary 
defaultevidence,
default however feel strongly that it should be retained for cases based upon user evidence.  We consider that it would be dangerous in the interests of natural justice to remove the 'reasonably alleged to 
defaultsubsist'  test
default for user-based claims, effectively changing the evidential threshold.  Conflict of evidence cannot be 'balance of probability' (
defaultEmery
default case).
