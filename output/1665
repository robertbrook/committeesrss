defaultGHPs are the only key renewable heating solution currently not supported under the RHI.  The European Commission decision on establishing guidelines on calculating renewable energy from heat pumps confirms that GHPs 
defaultare a renewable solution, on par with electricity driven heat pumps. Support is essential to provide the necessary incentive, exposure and certainty to start the GHP market in the UK and address existing market distortion in the heat pump sector. RHI suppo
defaultrt would also allow GHPs to achieve the strategic potential foreseen in DECC’s Heat Strategy - one of the two scenarios of DECC’s Heat Strategy foresees that GHPs will be the dominant heating solution in the UK from 2025 onwards - and enable prompt decarbo
defaultnisation and renewable gains even in case gas utilisation persists.
