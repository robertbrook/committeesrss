[normal]Executive Summary[bold]BDR Thermea Group was 
[normal]delighted to
[normal] see publication of the Heat Strategy by DECC which sets out how heating in the UK could be decarbonised by 2050. We believe that the potential benefits to the low carbon economy and UK economic competitiveness from successful implementation are significan
[normal]t.
[normal]Through our well-known brands such as Baxi, Potterton and Heatrae, BDR Thermea empl

[normal] the decarbonisation of UK heating. However the way in which it is achieved must recognise and address the unique feat
[normal]ures of the UK market. A bespoke approach that plays to consumer preferences, our national infrastructure assets and the strengths of the existing heating sector is required. 
[normal]We are investing in the technologies that could enable such a transformation incl
[normal]uding, Heat Recovery, Micro-Combined Heat and Power, Gas Heat Pumps, Solar Heating and Electric Heat Pumps.
[normal]It is vital to ensure implementation of the Heat Strategy supports the
[normal] manufacturing 
[normal]sector and drives innovation an

[normal]ongside decarbonisation and bill reductions.
[normal]GHPs are an established technology in Europe but RHI

[normal]technologies
[normal] is essential to provide the necessary incentive, exposure and certainty to start the GHP market in the UK.

[normal]Most “hard to treat homes” will not meet the energy efficiency criteria to qualify for the 
[normal]RHI 
[normal]scheme and 
[normal]Building regulations 
[normal]only capture those properties undergoing renovation. An additional barrier is that consumers are reluctant to pay for advice such
[normal] as 
[normal]Green Deal assessments as energy efficiency is pe
[normal]rceived as allow priority expenditure.

[normal]Most owners do not qualify for assistance under 
[normal]ECO

[normal]Hybrids[bold] present are a suitable retrofit for a large number of homes
[normal] – see paragraph 11.
[normal]  
[normal]Gas heat pumps[bold] (GHP) 
[normal]can readily address the needs of the retrofit environment and achieve rapid efficiency and decarbonisation gains without infrastructure changes or loss

[normal]GHPs are a heating technology that can readily contribute to the attainment of binding renewable targets
[normal] but
[normal] RHI support on par with other renewable heating technologies, is essential to provide the 
[normal]necessary incentive, exposure and certainty to start the GHP market in the UK. RHI support would allow GHPs to achieve the strategic potential foreseen in DECC’s Heat Strategy and enable prompt decarbonisation and renewable gains even in case gas utilisati

[normal]GHPs are the only key renewable heating solution currently not supported under the RHI.  The European Commission decision on establishing guidelines on calculating renewable energy from heat pumps confirms that GHPs 
[normal]are a renewable solution, on par with electricity driven heat pumps. Support is essential to provide the necessary incentive, exposure and certainty to start the GHP market in the UK and address existing market distortion in the heat pump sector. RHI suppo
[normal]rt would also allow GHPs to achieve the strategic potential foreseen in DECC’s Heat Strategy - one of the two scenarios of DECC’s Heat Strategy foresees that GHPs will be the dominant heating solution in the UK from 2025 onwards - and enable prompt decarbo
[normal]nisation and renewable gains even in case gas utilisation persists.
