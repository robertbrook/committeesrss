[[[Summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We believe that all public sector reform should be guided by a set of principles&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[1. To what extent is the Government’s public service reform programme]]]

[[[succeeding in:]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Locality and NAVCA welcome the government’s commitment to Localism and to recognizing the fundamental role that citizens and local communities play in developing their own solutions. However, there are some contradictory actions across Government; the new Community Rights and ‘Our Place’ (previously known as Community Budgets) provide opportunities for local communities. Whereas aggregated contracts such as the Work Programme have further disempowered citizens and local communities with damaging consequences.&#xa0; Where public service reform has focused on local people and their communities, enabling community-led solutions to be developed, there has been clear evidence of improvement. The Our Place pilots have shown early evidence of gains. For example, two Locality members in East London are leading an initiative to recruit local people to become volunteer health trainers. Starting with a community door-knocking exercise, which contacted over 1,000 residents, Poplar Harca and the Bromley by Bow Centre have developed a programme which will save the NHS an estimated £4m over five years by promoting healthy lifestyles and improving treatment of those at risk of diabetes. &#xa0;Where reform has not taken a community approach and instead has moved to prime/sub models or larger contracts in general, it has reduced the involvement of citizens and people who use services in their design and delivery. In some programmes, the task of commissioning itself is being contracted out. This increases the gulf between citizens, users of services, local VCSE providers and commissioners. NAVCA and Locality welcome the potential of the Public Services (Social Value) Act to both empower citizens and improve public services. We believe it is essential that wider policy objectives are achieved through public service commissioning and procurement in order to achieve best value. Too often, best value is assessed for individual contracts and departments, without looking at the wider picture and where savings or costs are accrued in different departments or services. 

[[[c. Ensuring that public services are accountable to the people]]]

[[[who use them, and to elected officials? ]]]&#xa0;There has been a lack of transparency throughout some programmes. In the previous commissioning round of the Work Programme, providers outlined minimum service standards in their bids that they were expected to adhere to. However, we have heard that the comprehensiveness and quality of these standards differed widely. The setting of such standards should not be at the discretion of private business and should always include quality provision for the hardest-to-help groups. Following this, service users and elected officials should have access to reporting data to confirm its accuracy. Private sector providers should not be able to hide behind a veil of ‘corporate confidentiality’.There should be more defined channels for people who use services and for providers down the supply chain to feed information directly to commissioners, and ‘gagging’ clauses that inhibit, or perceive to inhibit, feedback should not be in place.The feedback and views of service users should be taken into account alongside formal targets, and can often bring to light unacceptable practice that is not obvious in results tables.&#xa0;

[[[2. What evidence is there that citizen-centred approaches to public]]]

[[[service design, delivery and choice of provider can deliver better]]]

[[[outcomes—ensuring not only better value for money, but also]]]

[[[greater social, economic and environmental value?]]]&#xa0;An example of where increased involvement at the planning stages and different models of provision can lead to better value is highlighted in the following partnership involving a NAVCA member:&#xa0;Warwickshire Community and Voluntary Action (W-CAVA) and the Heart of England Community Foundation created Warwickshire Community Recycling (WRC) as a joint charitable enterprise. In a subsequent joint venture with Warwickshire County Council, WRC took over the management of two recycling centres and has developed re-use shops.&#xa0;Through a small capital investment and small pump-prime loan by the County Council, the venture broke even within six months. The joint venture has succeeded in generating large council savings improved service provision and vastly improved recycling rates. Surplus is distributed to local community organisations.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[3. What are the risks and opportunities of opening up public services to]]]

[[[alternative forms of ownership, provision and accountability?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]It is essential that systems are put in place to ensure the most marginalized are listened to and involved. Structures should not be developed that allow new models of provision to be dominated by the best resourced most powerful and confident citizens and communities.&#xa0;

[[[a. How do we ensure open access to public services under]]]

[[[alternative forms of ownership, provision and control?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Work Programme has clearly demonstrated that contract design and management tools such as Payment by Results are ineffective in ensuring that people who need access to public services actually get the support they need and the state would want to be provided. The only way to really ensure open access is by enshrining a core set of principles at the heart of future reform as outline in our introduction. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[5. How successful have the Government’s reforms been in opening up]]]

[[[public services to grassroots community groups, rather than to large]]]

[[[private or third sector organisations?]]]&#xa0;NAVCA believe it is inappropriate for many grassroots community organisations to take on the risks associated with delivering contracts, due to their organisational structure and size. We believe a false rhetoric that grant funding cannot be accountable or achieve best value has spread, resulting in many contracting authorities moving from grant funding to the competitive tendering of services without taking into account the specifics of each situation. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]In many public service areas we are still seeing the increasing trend towards the aggregation of contracts, which is precluding more and more VCSEs from bidding. Over the summer Locality ran a survey on the VCS’ experience of Public Sector Contracting. Systemic barriers to contract delivery were:&#xa0;While we welcome efforts to cut red tape and bureaucracy, it is essential that this is accompanied by efforts to promote a cultural change in commissioning. An example is the recent proposal to introduce standard PQQs across public sector contracting. NAVCA has recently supported a member whose local authority outsourced financial assessment of PQQs. The credit agency conducting the appraisal uses a system that penalizes not for profits for the very fact that they are not for profit. A standard PQQ would not change this practice, proportionality and relevance is required.&#xa0;It is also important that any reforms are examined to assess if they will actually support micro businesses and local VCSE organisations, as we feel the category ‘SME’ is too large and the proposed changes would disproportionately benefit the largest organisations in this category. This is not simply a matter of ensuring that smaller organisations are able to compete – it’s a matter of ensuring that the public purse cannot be held to ransom by a dominant group of providers who are too large to fail. See Locality’s response to the Department for Work and Pension’s Commissioning Strategy 2013. &#xa0;Our members have provided us with a number of examples of local voluntary and community sector organisations failing to win subcontracts, and therefore having to operate on reduced income, but subsequently having clients for these programmes referred to them for ‘free’ services. It is unacceptable for private sector organisations to be receiving contracts and payments to work with clients who are then referred on to ‘free’ services.&#xa0;

[[[a. How can public service contracts be designed to enable service]]]

[[[users to choose from a wider range of providers, including]]]

[[[community-based providers, to achieve self-defined outcomes?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]From member research, Locality and NAVCA propose a number of key principles for public service commissioning as outlined in the introduction, namely:&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[b. What impact has the Community Right to Bid, Community Right]]]

[[[to Challenge, and Community Right to Build had on local]]]

[[[communities?]]]Locality and partners launched the My Community Rights service in May 2012. We provide guidance information and free one-to-one expert advice on all the Community Rights. The volume of enquires has been consistently high and it is clear there is a real appetite and interest in the Rights. Total enquiries received and dealt with since the beginning of the programme currently stands at 7,957 (September 2013). The Right to Build In Locality’s experience the relationship between the Right to Build and neighbourhood planning is an important one and should be utilized where possible, to ensure the maximum benefit for local communities by ensuring that site-specific Right to Build Orders are implemented for community benefit. See the site assessment plans for Arundel and Ferring for instances of affordable dwelling proposals using the Right.The Right to Bid has gained rapid momentum. We are aware of over 770 nominations and just over 550 assets of community value listings across England, and their breadth is testament to the range of asset-based community interest across the country. The My Community Rights website gives examples of a whole range of communities who have used the Right http://mycommunityrights.org.uk/case-studies/The Right to Challenge has been slower to develop, in part this is due to the the use of the Right as a negotiating tactic by Community and Voluntary Organisations. It should also be noted that as there are no central or public records kept of Challenges issued, there are real difficulties in finding out the number that have actually taking place. In a recent survey, Locality followed up recipients of Right to Challenge advice, to track their progress. We found:&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[7. What examples are there of innovative ways to deliver better public]]]

[[[services in local government, from other countries or from other]]]

[[[public service providers?]]]&#xa0;There have been some interested service redesign work by a number of Local Authorities, including Stoke On Trent City Council and Bromsgrove &amp; Redditch Councils, which incorporate the principles we feel should be fundamental to all service delivery i.e. is citizen- focused and is shaped by the underlying purpose of the service rather than a narrow set of prescribed outcomes, helps people to help themselves and is locally based. There work has shown the dramatic improvements in delivery and reductions in costs, with a significant drop in demand.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[8. How realistic is it that “choice” can be exercised in public service]]]

[[[provision or should we be looking instead at greater control by users]]]

[[[so they can ensure that public services become more responsive to]]]

[[[changing needs?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]While NAVCA and Locality believes there is a role for choice in public services and that there are significant potential benefits for citizens from increased choice in individual services, meaningful choice is not synonymous with competition and market-based approaches, yet the general direction of the Government’s public sector reform programme heavily focuses on competition and alternative providers. We have reservations about the importance placed upon competition above other considerations, such as effective, high quality services, collaboration, service integration and shared decision making.&#xa0;Experience indicates that opening up public services to greater competition can have unintended consequences for quality, accessibility, equality, accountability and integrated provision. We would caution against simply applying pure market principles to all public services, because as the Office of Fair Trading found:&#xa0;“Public service markets are different. They are typically subject to market failures, such as externalities or information asymmetries. Policy makers frequently have wider policy goals alongside pure efficiency, such as a desire for equitable outcomes. As a result, the usual market assumptions do not apply. Consumers do not generally pay directly for services they receive. And providers are not generally driven by a profit motive, but by wider public service interests”

[[[&#xa0;]]]NAVCA and Locality believes far too much emphasis is placed on competition at the procurement stage, with not enough emphasis on involvement of citizens and users in the design and delivery of services. &#xa0;

[[[a. How do we make sure that all citizens are able to influence]]]

[[[public services?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Government references to the voluntary sector in relation to public service delivery have centred on their role as providers of services. More emphasis needs to be given to the sector’s distinctive role; having purpose not profit as a mission and acting as advocates and representatives of those who use their services. Many voluntary sector organisations naturally embrace principles of co-production and seek to work with marginalised individuals and communities. It is therefore essential that they are not viewed just as ‘providers’, but that they are more involved in the planning and design of public services.&#xa0;“They did not hold any talks with us (as the sitting contractor) arguing that it would be improper to do so.  All we wanted to do was to tell them where they could make more savings and gain for clients - but we were prevented from doing so.”

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[9. What safeguards should be in place to deal with service providers]]]

[[[who fail to deliver services, or who deliver services of an insufficient]]]

[[[quality?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]A focus on the principles outlined in our introduction would act as a fundamental safeguard in the event of failure to performe.&#xa0;In addition during the tendering process, more emphasis should be placed on previous poor performance and poor quality. The current requirement, usually to provide 3 references, does not cover this sufficiently, as larger providers are likely to have delivered hundreds of contracts and can cherry pick the best references. References from previous grant funding should also be taken into account to support VCSE organisations move into delivering contracts.&#xa0;

[[[10.How do we ensure that best practice is shared so it can be replicated]]]

[[[in the context of greater diversity of provision?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Locality’s experience of capturing and sharing successful innovation is that the very best examples are developed by responding to local demand and local circumstances (our “local by default” principle). Simply replicating and parachuting in ready-made delivery models does not work. There is real scope for the sharing of ideas, encouraging peer support and learning in order to equip local providers to move forward with local solutions.&#xa0;While we welcome the training and sharing of best practice provided through the Commissioning Academy, thought should be given to how this is shared wider and to enable providers to challenge their local commissioners when practice falls short.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[11.How well has the system of Payment by Results worked in the]]]

[[[delivery of public services and how do we make it work better?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The balance of PbR in the Work Programme, as has been widely reported, was badly designed and has had a number of unintended consequences. It has served to reduce the number and diversity of suppliers of employability services in England.  Many potential (and formerly successful) providers have disbanded their employability operations. &#xa0;The lack of control that DWP currently has over the supply chain and in particular the terms offered to sub-contractors means that simply increasing higher payments for certain client groups will not automatically transfer down supply chains and ensure that the hardest to help receive the support they require. Any PbR system need to balance the payment terms to spread payment across the period clients are supported and use PbR to incentive providers.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0; http://sustainabilitywestmidlands.org.uk/resources/awards/?/Warwickshire+Community+Recycling+-+Community+Champion+of+the+Year+2012%2C+Chartered+Institution+of+Waste+Management+%28CIWM%29/2824&#xa0; http://redditch.whub.org.uk/cms/council-and-democracy/reshaping-publc-services.aspx &#xa0;&#xa0; Choice and Competition in Public services A guide for policy makers, 2010, Office of Fair Trading www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/business_leaflets/general/oft1214.pdf&#xa0;
