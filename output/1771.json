Buckinghamshire C\nounty \nC\nouncil has no long term plan for transport.\nAVTUG identify 4 categories of \ndemand for travel:\nMedical \nShopping\nFriends\nRelatives\nAVTUG recognises the social and economic benefits that access to tranport brings to both individuals and communities.\nTo what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?Insufficiently\n – for example\n:\nDial a ride at its worst can charge up to £30 \nfor a \nreturn \nfare to\n travel between an outlying\n village and the county town. The situation is particu\nlarly difficult in the northern\n, less populated, part of Aylesbury Vale.\nMarsh village lost its bus service and 5 car\n-\nless households \nwere left without any means of \ntravelling out from their small \ncommunity.\nA new secondary school, on a new estate on the edge of Aylesbury town, is due to open in September 2013. As of early August no transport arrangements had been announced for its new students.\nThere is a perception that profits come before service\n to the public.\nWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?The cost of providing them.\nThe lack of volunteers\n .This is not due to apath\ny, more volunteer fatigue. Buckinghamshire\n \nalready \nboasts twice the national average of volunteers in the community.\n&#xa0;How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?Larger communities, such as Wendover and Winslow already have community buses. This does not appear to be the solution for smaller more isolated communities given costs and volunteer \nissues referred to above.\nLocal Area \nFora already offer small cash incentives to local transport initiatives but these are necessarily limited.\nTo what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?Please see refe\nrence to Dial a Ride services above. They are demand led, but their costs can be prohibitive. In such situations they are no answer to social isolation.\nWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?A long-term plan for transport by the county council would be a useful start. At present planning for the future is apparently too often influenced by more immediate financial considerations.\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
