"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Submitted by: Professor Melanie Simms.\n \nProfessor of Work and Employment.\n \nUniversity of Leicester.\n Submission prepared as an individual researching this topic. \n&#xa0;\nI welcome the opportunity to submit evidence to this Committee. I have been researching youth (\nun)\nemployment in the UK and wider EU since before the financial crisis. My research agenda focuses on locating UK challenges and initiatives within the broader, comparative context of our closest competitors. \n&#xa0;\nOne of the most extensive pieces of research I have undertaken was \nan\n EU27 comparative study of initiatives by social partners (employers and unions) and governments to help young people in the aftermath of the crisis. This took the form of commissioning a narrative report from expert correspondents in each member state, and then compiling a comparative analysis. \n&#xa0;\nLinks to country reports: \nhttp://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/studies/tn1101019s/index.htm\n&#xa0;\nLink to comparative report: \nhttp://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/studies/tn1101019s/tn1101019s.htm\n&#xa0;\nThis research, and more recent work on employer behaviour, informs this submission. \n&#xa0;\nDo you think that the EU should be providing funding to Member States to tackle youth unemployment? Does EU action respect Member States’ powers in the area of social and employment affairs? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow do you think that the EU can best ‘add value’ to Member States’ efforts to tackle unemployment? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIs there sufficient disaggregation in EU measures to tackle youth unemployment between, for example, support for young people classified as being not in education, employment or training (‘NEETs’), support for newly qualified graduates looking for work, and general career guidance? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAre the EU’s accounting, monitoring and evaluation procedures sufficient to be able to determine whether EU funded projects to tackle youth unemployment have been successful or not? Are there ways in which they could be improved? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow do you think the funds allocated through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and the European Social Fund (ESF) could best be spent? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDo you feel that young people (aged 15-24), youth groups and their representatives are involved and consulted to a satisfactory degree in the decisions being made around EU funding for youth unemployment projects, and how they are administered? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow can the EU and Member States embrace new technologies and new methods of working to combat youth unemployment? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n15 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
