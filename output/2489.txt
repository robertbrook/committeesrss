[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from the British Transport Police (SLC 029)&#xa0;&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;A.              Level Crossings represent a substantial safety risk.&#xa0;B.              BTP works with other agencies to enforce the law around Level Crossings. In particular there is a close and growing partnership between Network Rail and BTP in this area.&#xa0;C.              The law on Level Crossings is in need of reform and consolidation, and needs to be clearer.&#xa0;D.              Each Level Crossing is different and the mitigation of risk requires a multi agency approach.&#xa0;E.                            BTP is committed to playing its part in promoting safety at crossings.&#xa0;&#xa0;General&#xa0;&#xa0;1.              Level Crossings are a nineteenth century solution to a nineteenth century problem.  Ideally they would have no place in a modern high speed railway.  The railway industry (particularly Network Rail) is left with the task of managing, what will always be, an unsatisfactory interface between road vehicles and the railway network.&#xa0;2.              British Transport Police (BTP) is the national police service for the railway, including the London Underground.  We have the responsibility for the enforcement of the criminal law and the investigation of offences committed on the railway networks.  The Force exists in its current form under the provisions of the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003.   Previously the Force operated under the British Transport Commission Act 1949.  Railway police officers have been dealing with incidents on Level Crossings since the mid nineteenth century.&#xa0;3.              Other agencies, including Her Majesty’s Inspectors in the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) have a role in investigating incidents at Level Crossings.  BTP seek to work in partnership with these agencies and with Network Rail to enforce the law and to promote safety.&#xa0;4.              Despite the best efforts of Network Rail Level Crossings remain a potential source of a significant railway accident.  History has shown that a collision on a Level Crossing can be catastrophic.  Numerous accidents have occurred at these locations.  In modern times we seek to draw lessons from events such as Hixon (1968), Lockington (1986),  Ufton Nevet (2004) and Little Conard (2010)  (1). However numerous smaller incidents occur every month on Level Crossings, some resulting in loss of life and or derailment (2).&#xa0;5.              There are many different types of Level Crossing.  These vary from crossings on ‘A’ roads through to ‘user worked’ easement crossings between fields.   Each type poses its own issues.  There are often different names for the same type of crossing.  The total number of Level Crossings is not clear but is given by Network Rail as being around 6,500.(3).  The ORR estimate that the total number (Network Rail plus others) is around 8,000 (4)  At times the identification of individual crossings is difficult and we have been working with Network Rail to ensure that we have a common understanding of the identity, location and access arrangements for each crossing.  Level Crossings bisect all types of railway line from the West Coast mainline through to freight only single track lines.&#xa0;6.              Safety at Level Crossings is a worldwide problem.  The recent incident in Canada (18th September 2013) which killed six people is a reminder of the international nature of this issue. There were nine accidental fatalities at Level Crossings on the Network Rail system in 2012/13 (5).&#xa0;7.              British Transport Police works closely with Network Rail, both to improve safety at crossings and to enforce legislation where possible.  Network Rail has, over the last two years, funded fifteen Mobile Safety Vehicles for BTP use.  These state of the art vehicles are deployed to pubic road crossing throughout Great Britain to detect offenders. (6). Their use is accompanied by local publicity designed to raise awareness of the dangers of misusing Level Crossings.  Wherever possible BTP participates in community safety events around the country to promote the safety message.  Offenders detected using the Mobile Safety Vehicles are, subject to certain conditions, offered the option of attending a training course on the dangers of Level Crossing misuse as an alternative to a penalty.  This is a relatively new project so the data set is small – however the available evidence suggests that there is a very low re-offending rate by drivers who attend one of these courses. &#xa0;8.              In recent months BTP and Network Rail have been seeking to improve the flow of information regarding patterns of crossing misuse to ensure that BTP assets can be deployed in the most effective way.   Engagement continues to take place with ORR.&#xa0;9.              BTP sits on various groups with Network Rail, including its strategy group on this subject.  At a Headquarters level BTP meets with Network Rail at least every six weeks to keep abreast of developments.  BTP is working with Network Rail around their plan to install fixed detection cameras at high risk locations.&#xa0;10.              BTP ran an operation to co-inside with the last International Level Crossing awareness day in May in 2013 (5).  This day is co-ordinated by the International Union of Railways (UIC) who estimate that 359 people were killed at Level Crossings throughout the European Union in 2010. (7).  &#xa0;11.              By far the majority of incidents at Level Crossings can be attributed to user misuse.  However each incident much be approached carefully to ensure that the collection of evidence takes place systematically and impartially.  BTP Crime Scene Examiners have particular skills in this process and where road vehicles are involved the expertise of local force Roads Policing specialists is also used to examine the vehicle etc.  In some cases it becomes clear that Network Rail and/or their staff may have caused the incident.  The tragic incident at Moreton-on-Lugg (2010) provides an example of this and resulted in the conviction of Network Rail and one of their employees for serious Health and Safety offences.  The investigation of Level Crossing incidents is complicated, time consuming and expensive.  It is essential that each investigation is led entirely by the evidence and not based on assumptions of cause.  In the event of fatalities BTP will always investigate in combination with other agencies and on behalf of HM Coroner (in England and Wales). &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Are Current Safety Measures at Level Crossings ]]]

[[[Adequate?  How Should They Be Improved?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]A1              Other organisations are much better placed than BTP to comment on the technical aspects of Level Crossing Safety.              What is clear however is that there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution to the question of improving Level Crossing safety.  Each crossing presents individual challenges.  Road layout, user profile, time of day and the nature of the railway being crossed all influence how crossings are used.  &#xa0;The way in which crossings are used can change.  An obvious example is the use of User Worked Crossings in rural areas during harvest time.  New developments of houses or shops can change the pattern of use dramatically.  This is not a new issue (8) but one that requires constant monitoring.  For this reason it is pleasing to see that Network Rail have appointed local Level Crossing Managers.  We look forward to working with these managers to ensure that policing activity is based on accurate and up to date assessments of misuse.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Is Network Rail Giving Sufficient Priority to Improving Safety At Level Crossings?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]A4              In recent years Network Rail’s commitment to this subject has been unquestionable.  The company has pursued the improvement of safety in this context with passion and dedication.  This comment is made from the point of view of a close partner with visibility only of central efforts around a few work streams.   There is nothing to suggest that this energy is not operating throughout the whole Level Crossings project.  Network Rail has appointed the parent of a victim of an accident at a Level Crossing as their Level Crossings ‘Champion’.  This was a brave move and a bold statement of commitment.  Nobody who has listened to her lecture on the subject of Level Crossing safety can be left in any doubt that there is still much to be done or that this work is of the greatest importance.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Is Government Policy and Regulatory Action By The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in Relation to Safety at Level Crossings Adequate?  What More Should The Government and ORR Do?]]]&#xa0;A5              BTP is not in a position to assist with this question.

[[[How Should Legislation Governing Level Crossings Be Updated?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]A6              BTP awaits the publication of the Law Commission’s

[[[ ]]]report on Level Crossings.  We submit that the Law Commission’s comments in Part One of their consultation paper on this subject (2010) provides a good summary of the current legal position, (9) viz:&#xa0;              “The legislation governing level crossings is complex and antiquated, much of it dating back to the nineteenth century when the main railways were constructed. The provisions relevant to level crossings are difficult to access. This arises partly because they are spread across legislation relating to a number of different subject areas – railways, highways/roads, health and safety, planning and criminal law. Furthermore, the provisions are contained in a combination of public general Acts, private Acts, bye-laws, and subordinate legislation in the form of Orders and Regulations, many of which have been amended heavily in recent years.3 Some of the Acts have been partially repealed and some of their provisions have become spent or obsolete, causing confusion as to which provisions still apply and which are redundant. Many of the Acts of the Victorian era contain terminology that is no longer in use such as “turnpike roads” and “statute labour roads”. Such terminology is unhelpful when trying to interpret the law in a modern context. There has been no attempt at consolidating the legislation in this area.” (P1 Para 1.2)&#xa0;One particular legislative anomaly is currently causing considerable difficulty in respect of enforcement of Road Traffic Act provisions at Level Crossings.  Recent work revealed that the Chief Constable of British Transport Police probably does not have powers under s172 Road Traffic Act 1988 to require the registered keeper of a motor vehicle to supply the details of the driver of the vehicle at the time of a suspected offence.  The problem is a technical one that arises from the construction of this section.  The Department for Transport (DfT) are aware of the problem and are working on a solution.  In the meantime the co-operation of geographic police forces is being employed via the good offices of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).  What is disheartening is that this lacuna was first identified over thirty years ago and was corrected by the British Railways Act 1986.  However the principal legislation at the time, the Road Traffic Act 1972, was replaced shortly afterwards by the Road Traffic Act 1988 and it appears that the changes brought about by the 1986 Act have been lost.&#xa0;              The legislation on railway trespass is also unclear.  The principal piece of legislation creating an offence of criminal trespass on railways is s55 British Transport Commission Act 1949.  This provision largely recreates the offences that previously existed in the Acts of Parliament that governed the individual railway companies.  What is uncertain is whether or not it is possible for the offence to be committed on a level crossing when it is ‘closed’ for the passage of a train.  This issue is acute at crossings without physical barriers.  Pedestrians passing in front of trains at crossings are a serious problem.  S55 requires that a  trespass warning notice is displayed at the nearest passenger station – not at Level Crossings.  The relevance of this requirement is hard to see and is itself an anachronism.   The Law Commission consultation discusses this offence at useful length (Part 13 2010).  It notes: that  “ A particular feature of the section 55 offence is its obscurity”  (10)  We therefore agree that this area of law should be subject to review with the intention of making the offence clear, both generally and specifically in relation to Level Crossings.&#xa0;              The railway industry and occasionally the Force are called to deal with gates that have been left open at User Worked Crossings.  The law covering this problem is to be found in the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 and in the Railway Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845.  These Acts create a penalty for failing to close a gate.  To enforce this the individual who fails to close the gate has to be identified.  We would suggest that consideration is given to the creation of a duty on the landowner to ensure that gates are shut. &#xa0;              A case could be made for Level Crossing offences to attract higher penalties than those for equivalent offences on other roads (failure to comply with a road traffic signal for example).   This would require a detailed assessment of the potential for a deterrent effect if such a change were not seen to be punitive.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[       How Should Public Awareness of Safety at Level Crossings Be Improved?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]A7              This is an area that would benefit from continued specialised research.  There could be possible opportunities to increase the amount time given to Level Crossings in initial driver training and testing, both for new drivers and for specialist driving qualifications (Good Vehicles etc).&#xa0;There is a fundamental problem that road vehicle drivers will take risks at Level        Crossings when they would hesitate to do so at other points of traffic control.  The ‘human factors’ aspects of this behaviour may benefit from further research.&#xa0;Notes&#xa0;(1)              Hixon Level Crossing Accident 6th January 1968.
