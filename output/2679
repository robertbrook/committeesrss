default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1. defaultIntroductiondefault1.1
default              
defaultThe Authority for Television 
defaultOn
default Demand (“ATVOD”) was designated by Ofcom in March 2010 to regulate 
defaultthe editorial content of UK 
defaultvideo on demand
default services
default. 
defaultIts duties and powers derive from the EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive (“AVMSD”) which was 
defaultimplemented
default in the UK via amendments to section 368 of the Communications Act 2003 (“the Act”). Under the Act, UK services
default which meet the statutory definition
default of an on demand programme service (“ODPS”
default) 
default must
default comply with a limited number of statutory requirements 
defaultwhich
default have been 
defaultincorporated
default by ATVOD in a set of Rules.
default To meet the definition of an ODPS a service must meet all five of the criteria set out in sect
defaultion 368A of the Act. Among these are the criteria that a 
defaultservice  must
default have the principal purpose of providing ‘tv-like’ programmes and that the provider of the service must be under UK jurisdiction.
default1
default.2
default              
defaultATVOD’s
default primary role in 
defaultrelation
default to protection of 
defaultmi
defaultnors
default is founded in Article 12 of the AVMSD
default,
default 
defaultwhich forms ATVOD’s 
defaultRule 11
default:
default“defaultRule 11:default              defaultHarmful Material: Protection of Under-18s defaultIf an on-demand programme service contains material which might seriously impair the physical, mental or moral development of 
defaultpersons under the age of eighteen, the material must be made available in a manner which secures that such persons will not normal
defaultly see or hear it.”
default1.3
default              
defaultATVOD’s interpretation of this Rule is that 
default“
defaultmaterial which might seriously impair the physical, menta
defaultl or moral development of minors” 
defaultwhen provided as part of an on-demand programme service may include content that has been classified ‘R18’ by the BBFC, or material equivalent to content classified in that category.
default R18 is the UK film and DVD classificati
defaulton for
default audiovisual works which (a) have the primary purpose of sexual stimulation and (b) include 
defaultexplicit
default images of real sexual activity or strong fetish activity. Such material is referred to as ‘hardcore porn’ in this submission. To comply with ATVOD Ru
defaultle 11, an ODPS offering hardcore porn must ensure that such images are kept out of reach of children by having in place a robust age verification mechanism and a means of 
defaultrestricting
default access to hardcore porn material to those 
defaultwhose age is known to be at lea
defaultst 18. ATVOD’s considers that the following will normally be considered suitable 
defaultmechanisms
default for verifying age:
defaultIf age verification does not take pla
defaultce each time the user returns to the service, the service 
defaultprovider
default must control further access to hardcore porn material by the use of mandatory security controls such as passwords or PIN numbers. ATVOD’s full guidance on Rule 11 (and on the other 
default12 rules
default it enforces) is published in its Rules and Guidance
default.
default1.4
default              
defaultI
defaultn addition to investigating complaints, in 2012-13 ATVOD carried out a number of targeted investigations and such investigations resulted in 
default18
default cases
default across 26 websites
default in which breaches of Rule
default 11
default were determined
default because the 
defaultservices
default were
default making available ‘hardcore’ pornographic material without having adequate safeguards in place to ensure that such material c
defaultould not
default normally be seen by under 18s
default.  
default1
default.5
default              
defaultIn 1
default5
default cases the breaches were brought t
defaulto an end 
defaultshortly 
defaultafter
default the 
defaultDetermination
default that a breach had 
defaultoccurred
default, though in two of these cases ATVOD had to use its power to issue an 
defaultEnforcement
default Notification in order to secure compliance. In the other three cases, the matter was referred to Ofcom for 
defaultconsideration
default of a sanction. 
defaultOfcom imposed the following financial penalties in relation to th
defaultose cases:
default1
default.6
default              
defaultThe
default Demand Adult and Playboy TV services are no longer being provided by Playboy TV UK / Benelux Ltd (a company registered in the 
defaultUK,
default and subject to ATVOD regulation) after a group re-
defaultorganisation
default by a pare
defaultnt company which operate
defaults
default across multiple 
defaultjurisdictions. The Strictly Broadband service was sold to a provider outside the UK following the ATVOD Determination.  ATVOD has no evidence that such changes were made in order to
default place the services outside UK ju
defaultrisdiction in order to avoid the need to put in place age verification and access control mechanisms which would ensure that explicit content is
default kept out of reach of 
defaultunder
default 18s, but that is the effect. 
default ATVOD has
default also
default seen a number of examples in which it i
defaults claimed that editorial responsibility for a service has been transferred from a UK provider to an entity outside the UK, for example through the sale of the website, while the UK entity continues to supply content to the service.  Although ATVOD requires
default evidence that any such transfer of editorial responsibility is genuine, it is clear that moving is an option for 
defaulta 
defaultservice which seek
defaults
default to avoid the obligations placed on UK providers.
default1
default.7
default              
defaultGiven the response of a minority of providers of adult services to 
defaultenforcement of Rule 11, ATVOD has 
defaultconsidered 
defaulthow children might better be protected from hardcore pornography online, and especially from such material on websites operated from 
defaultoutside UK jurisdiction
default, whether from other EU Member States or from outside t
defaulthe EU altogether
default. 
default1.8
default              
defaultATVOD is acutely aware that the hardcore porn services most commonly accessed from within the UK are operated from outside the UK. The most frequently accessed services
default use a variation on the You 
defaultTube  business
default model (and are conseq
defaultuently commonly referred to as “tube sites”). Such tube sites offer significant quantities of unrestricted free hardcore porn videos as a shop window in order to attract large number of viewers whose visits are monetised in a number of ways: by up-selling 
defaultto a premium version of the free service (offering a wider choice, longer videos, better picture quality, etc); by driving traffic to other paid (pornographic) services operated by the provider of the tube site; by charging on a ‘click through’ basis to af
defaultfiliates whose content is featured on a ‘try before you buy’ basis on the tube site; and by selling advertising space (eg for ‘contact’ services or penis enlargement treatments).
default1.9
default              
defaultEven those non-UK hardcore porn services which operate a more traditional
default business model, requiring payment before the user can access significant quantities of video material, typically offer free access to hardcore still images and ‘preview’ videos on an unrestricted basis.
default1.10
default              
defaultAs noted above, provided the services are opera
defaultted by entities outside UK jurisdiction they are not subject to regulation in the UK, even if the service appears to be specifically targeting UK users or otherwise has a strong association with the UK.
default Options for addressing this issue – such as blocking 
defaultpayments
default to 
defaultservi
defaultc
defaultes
default which allow minors to access hardcore porn – are discussed in section two.
default1.1
default1
default              
defaultA significant minority of such services operate from other EU Member States
default. Such
default services are subject to the same AVMS Directive requirements as UK based services, however not all EU Member States share ATVOD’s view that hardcore porn might seriously impair the development of under 18s. For example, in the Netherlands, the regulator t
defaultakes the view that hardcore porn does not seriously impair the development of 
defaultunder
default 18s and so hardcore porn services operating from the Netherlands are not required to ensure that under 18s cannot normally see or hear the hardcore porn material. The AVMS 
defaultDirective includes derogation procedures
default which might allow the UK to restrict services operating from another Member State on the grounds that such restriction was necessary to protect minors, however such measures would be subject to the examination of t
defaulthe Commission who would ask the UK to refrain if the measures were considered incompatible with European Union law. ATVOD notes that to date UK Govt has not used the derogation procedures in relation to on-demand media services regulated in other Member St
defaultates. 
default1.1
default2
default              
defaultEven if the problem was solved a
defaultt
default a European level, the majority of online hardcore porn services which allow UK children to see hardcore porn material, and which are most commonly accessed from the UK, operate from outside the EU (most commonl
defaulty from the USA). As well as the standard website version of the service, the content is 
defaultcommonly provided in a parallel web-version formatted specifically for access via a smartphone.  
default1.1
default3
default              
defaultAn indication of the scale of the problem can be gained from web 
defaultanalytic data which suggests that 5 of the top 50 websites most commonly accessed from the UK are tube sites offering unrestricted access to hardcore porn 
defaultvideos 
default. ATVOD has seen figures which suggest that t
defaulthose 5 hardcore porn tube sites were 
default(collective
defaultly) 
defaultvisited over 214 million times by UK internet users during January 2013
default.
default1.14
default              
defaultAlthough accurate figures for children accessing hardcore porn online are difficult to find, it is worth noting that, according to Ofcom research
default:
default1.15
default              
defaultAlthough the problem has existed for some years it has 
defaultrecently become much more visible and has acquired much greater potency over the past year. This is evident in the results of research
default conducted by ICM Research on behalf of ATVOD which found that:
default1.1
default6
default              
defaultThe transformation of the business of monetizing hardcore
default porn material online over the past 10 years, and the 
defaulttechnological
default changes that enable minors to have unsupervised access to the internet can only have increased the likelihood of minors accessing explicit adult material online, despite the effective inte
defaultrventions undertaken by ATVOD in relation to UK based porn on-demand websites. 
default&#xa0;
default2. Improving online safetydefault2.1
default              
defaultThis section sets out questions that the Committee may care to take into account when considering how best to protect children from the hardcore
default pornographic material which is available online. 
default&#xa0;defaultThe legal framework for the regulation defaultofdefault  UKdefault video on demand services default&#xa0;
defaultShould greater certainty be provided in relation to the statutory basis for requiring hardcore pornographic material on UK based defaultvideo on demand services to be kept out of reach of children?default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultUnder Part 4A of the Communications Act 2003 (“the Act”), ATVOD requires UK providers of pornographic on-demand services which meet the statutory definition of an on-demand programme servic
defaulte (“ODPS”)
default to ensure that any hardcore pornographic material on their service is normally kept out of reach of children. ATVOD’s policy derives from its view that hardcore porn, equivalent to that passed R18 by the BBFC, 
defaultmight
default seriously impair the moral d
defaultevelopment of minors and a precautionary approach is therefore appropriate. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultAt the request of DCMS, in 2010 Ofcom produced a report
default which indicated that there was uncertainty as to whether R18-equivalent material 
default‘might seriously impair’
default under 18’s.
default In its 2011 response
default, Government 
defaultstated that it intended to address this issue
default 
defaultcomprehensively in the 
defaultongoing
default Communications Review of the current regulatory framework. Government
default also supported the ATVOD position in stating 
defaultthat there 
defaultwas 
defaulta good case th
defaultat the existing Regulations require a precautionary approach
default.
default Ofcom and ATVOD 
defaultwere asked to 
defaulttake any steps necessary in the interim period to ensure that children remain adequately protected under the ATVOD Rules, in the knowledge that Government could 
defaultbring forward further Regulations in the short term if it proved necessary to support this position.
default Adopting the precautionary principle, ATVOD had already concluded that R18 equivalent material might seriously impair the development of under 18s, 
defaultand  AT
defaultVOD
default continues to interpret the legislation in that way (see paras 1.2 to 1.5 above).
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultThe DCMS strategy paper (‘Connectivity, Content and Consumers’) published in July 2013 sets out Government’s intention to legislate to
default make
default clear
default that R18-equivalent 
defaultmaterial on ODPS must be provided only in a manner which ensures that under 18s do not normally see or hear it. ATVOD considers that such legislation 
defaultwould
default  provide
default clarity for consumer
defaults
default and industry and better ensure deployment of effective safeguards. Su
defaultch legislation would also remove the possibility of ATVOD’s consumer protection measures being undermined by a legal challenge. 
defaultThe Committee may therefore care to consider whether to support the proposed legislation, and what form it might take.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIs it adefaultppropriate that content which is prohibited for sale to adults on a DVD, even in a licensed sex shop, can be made available to adults on a UK video on demand servicedefault?default&#xa0;default2.5
default              
defaultSome video on demand services contain hardcore pornographic material which goes bey
defaultond the limits of R18. This means that on a DVD it would not be classified by the BBFC for supply to adults in a licensed sex shop. Currently, the Act does not prohibit such content on an ODPS provided it is restricted to adults. Consequently, material whi
defaultch is considered to carry such a risk of harm that it cannot lawfully be supplied on a DVD to adults who visit a licensed shop is freely available to adults on video on demand services which operate and are regulated in the UK.
default Although ATVOD’s interpretat
defaultion of the statutory requireme
defaultn
defaultts mean that UK video on demand services must prevent minors accessing such content, its availability to adults nevertheless poses a potential risk to children. This is because material which goes beyond the limits of R18 may
default include pornography which 
defaultsimulates 
defaultnon-consensual 
defaultsex, under-age sex, incest or other material likely to encourage an interest in abusive sexual activity which, through its impact on adult viewers, may ultimately have a detrimental effect on minors. 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default6
default              
defaultThe
default Communications
default Act
default 2003
default only prohibits
default on 
defaultODPS
default material which is likely to incite hatred. 
defaultPornographic
default content would n
defaultot
default ordinarily fall into this prohibition. 
default&#xa0;
default2.7
default              
defaultThe DCMS strategy paper (‘Connectivity, Content and Consumers’) published in July 2013 
defaultsets out Government’s intention to legislate to prohibit on an ODPS material which is 
default‘beyond R18’. The Committee may therefore care to consider whether to support the
default 
defaultproposed legislation, and what form it might take.
default&#xa0;defaultIs it too easy for those who operate pornographic websites to conceal their identity?default&#xa0;default2.8
default              
defaultDetermining whether a service is an ODPS and who 
defaultis the provider
default is central to ATVOD’s regulatory remit.  ATVOD
default proactively investigates whether pornographic services which ap
defaultpear to be provided from the UK
default meet the relevant statutory criteria and therefore fall within 
defaultthe scope of the regulations it enforces
default. Often the decision turns on whether the provider of the
default service (i.e. the person who exercises general control over the selection and organisation of the programmes) is within UK jurisdiction. Providers of pornographic services frequently neglect to publish contact details or even the name of the provider. Wit
defaulthout this information it is impossible for ATVOD to determine that the service is an ODPS.
default&#xa0;
default2.9
default              
defaultTo enable such investigations, the Act confers upon the regulator a power to demand information from 
default“a person who appears to them to be or to have been a provi
defaultder of an on-demand programme service”
default. 
defaultWhile this power is useful where 
defaulta service can be linked to a person
default who appears to be
default 
defaultthe provider (e
default.
defaultg
default.
default because the website is registered in their name, or because they 
defaultare listed on the service as 
defaulthold
defaulting proof 
defaultof 
defaultage records for the performers), in many cases the only identifiable person is the third party payment processor. Current legislation does not appear to give the regulator power to demand information (such as the identity and contact details of the reci
defaultpient of the payments) from an entity such as a payment processor which is clearly not 
defaultitself
default the service provider.
default&#xa0;
default2.10
default              
defaultThe Committee may therefore care to consider whether it is
default currently too easy for UK providers of porn on demand to hide behind third party payment processors, proxy registration services
default and other third parties 
defaultwhich
default provide support services or content to the service. 
defaultOne way in which the current UK regulatory 
defaultarrangements might be made more effective without extending the scope of content regulation would therefore be to include provisions relating to those who provide financial, hosting or proxy registration services which facilitate the provision of an ODPS i
defaultn a manner which obscures the identity of the service provider. Such ancillary services could then be required to provide to the 
defaultappropriate  regulatory
default authority information necessary to identify the provider of an ODPS.
default&#xa0;defaultThe existing criminal lawdefault&#xa0;defaultIs the present law – notably the Obscene Publications Act 1959 &amp;1964 defaultbeing used to best effect? default&#xa0;default2.11
default              
defaultIn c
defaultarrying out its statutory regulatory duties
default, ATVOD has 
defaultdrawn attention to 
defaultthe current Crown Prosecution Service (“CPS”) guidance for prosecutors on 
defaultthe interpretation of the Obscene Publications Act (“OPA”)
default, which
default states that
default:
default&#xa0;
default“where children are likely to access material of a degree of sexual explicitness equivalent to what is available to those aged 18 and above in a licensed sex shop, that materi
defaultal may be considered to be obscene and subject to prosecution. This applies to material which is not behind a suitable payment barrier or other accepted means of age verification, for example, material on the front page of pornography websites and non-comm
defaultercial, user-generated material which is likely to be accessed by children and meets the threshold. 
defaultsee
default R v Perrin, [2002] EWCA Crim  747”      
default&#xa0;
defaultYet ATVOD can find no recent example of a prosecution being launched under that guidance. This seems all the m
defaultore remarkable in the light of research findings showing the extent of consumer/ parental concerns
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.12
default              
defaultThe Committee
default might therefore 
defaultquestion why prosecutions under the OP
defaultA in relation to online content
default in recent years appear to have been limited to websites offering material which is more extreme than would be available in a licensed sex shop. Furthermore,
default such 
defaultOPA convictions have declined dramatically in recent 
defaultyears, from 81 in 2000 to just seven
default in 
default2010. 
default&#xa0;
default2.13
default              
defaultGiven the
default disparity between the CPS guidance and actual enforcement activity under the OPA
default, might
default 
defaultthis be an area to explore 
defaultin order to strengthen the protections for children online
default?  Significant enhancement of consumer protection could be a
defaultchieved 
defaultthrough
default operational change
default by the police
default, without the need for further legislation or public policy revision.
default&#xa0;
default2.14
default              
defaultATVOD also notes that the provisions of the OPA allow a conspiracy charge to be brought against a person responsible for distributin
defaultg, retailing or producing the obscene material. Might this enable action to be taken against UK entities or persons who are involved in the provision of hardcore porn without suitable controls, but who do not meet the narrow definition of an ‘ODPS service 
defaultprovider’? 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultOther public policy measures, especially in relation to non-UK servicesdefault&#xa0;defaultCan media education be the whole solution?default&#xa0;default2.15
default              
defaultThere is widespread support for
default initiatives designed to inform and empower parents about the risks children face on line and the steps they can take to protect them. ATVOD also actively supports such initiatives, not least through its work with UKCCIS on age verification tools and ‘acti
defaultve choice’ initiatives for internet connected TVs, and through its support for Safer Internet Day. However, given its limitations, not least with regard to the most vulnerable children, can media education alone ever be sufficient if children are to enjoy 
defaultappropriate protection from exposure to hardcore pornography online?  
default&#xa0;
defaultCan the uptake and efficacy of parental control software be improved?default&#xa0;default2.16
default              
defaultATVOD supports initiatives to improve the take up of parental controls, not least because it is aware that t
defaulthe use of filtering software by parents is significantly lower than might be desired, and has not been rising. 
defaultIt is not clear why more than six 
defaultout of 10 households with child internet users do not use parental control software, but as such software is of
defaultten pre-installed or available free as part of a contract with an ISP, it is unlikely that cost is a significant factor
default. defaultR
defaultesearch
default has indicated that
default defaultparents who are regular an
defaultd confident internet users, 
defaultwho say they worry lot about their children seeing i
defaultnappropriate material online, and who have younger children, are more likely t
defaulto use parental control software.
default 
defaultYet 
defaultthere 
defaultremains 
defaulta lack of clarity about the reasons why so many parents do not. 
defaultThe impact of recently announced policy changes designed to bui
defaultld upon the active choice initiative will need to be carefully monitored.
default&#xa0;
default2.17
default              
defaultThe usefulness of parental control software depends not only on its uptake but also on its effectiveness. 
defaultThis is especially important lest
default parents who use parental control sof
defaulttware are lulled into a false sense of security about the extent to which their children 
defaulthave been protected when using the internet. 
defaultShould
default the public debate around 
defaultparental controls
default 
defaulttherefore 
defaultalso 
defaultconcentrate on improving understanding of 
defaultthe limitations
default of parental controls software
default, especially 
defaultin terms of efficacy in blocking inappropriate content on protected devices or networks
default?
default&#xa0;
default2.18
default              
defaultATVOD notes that f
defaultive
default years 
defaultafter 
defaultthe Byron Report recommended a BSI Kitemark for such software only one product
default carr
defaulties the relevant Kitemark. ATVOD further notes that EU Commission research
default suggests that the filters themselves when set to block ‘adult’ content suffer from relatively high rates of over-blocking (accide
defaultntally blocking non-adult sites
default) and under
default-
defaultblocking
default (failure to block adult sites). The under
default-
defaultblocking rate varies greatly, from 9% to 54% and those with lower under
default-
defaultblocking rates tend to have higher over
default-
defaultblocking rates. Some of the best know
defaultn
default filtering options had significant failure rates. For example:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOverall, the study concluded that 
default“
defaultIn general, [PC parental control] tools have a low effectiveness.
default”
default 
default.
default&#xa0;default2.19
default              
defaultAlthough the efficacy of parental controls may have 
defaultimproved
default since that research was conducted in 2011, it is clear
default that b
defaultoth ‘over
default-
defaultblocking’ and ‘under
default-
defaultblocking’ 
defaultstill occur. Both must be 
defaultof concern. Under
default-
defaultblocking because it allows children to access material which is supposed to be blocked, and over
default-
defaultblocking because by restricting access to legitimate content it undermines confidence in the software. ATVOD 
defaultalso 
defaultnotes that parents are much more likely to have anti-virus software enabled than to have parental controls enabled (67% compared with 39% acco
defaultrding to Ofcom research
default )
default.
default 
defaultS
defaultome of this differential may result from parents disabling a parental control system when it is found to over
default-
defaultblock. 
default&#xa0;
default2.20
default              
defaultThe Committee may therefore care to consider whether p
defaultublic policy initiatives to improve take up of pa
defaultrental controls in households with children
default 
defaultshould 
default be
default balanced by efforts to improve the efficacy of the systems available to parents
default.
default If so, it may be sensible to keep in mind the fact that if all responsibility is placed on parents, many children will r
defaultemain unprotected.
default&#xa0;
defaultCan a consensus be built among EU Member states?default&#xa0;default2.21
default              
defaultThe UK is joined by at least five other EU states
default in requiring services that provide access to hardcore pornographic material to ensure that such material is kept out of reach of children. However, many other EU states impose no
default such restrictions, and service providers
default operating from within The Netherlan
defaultds, for example, do target the UK consumers with hardcore pornographic video on demand websites which offer inadequate
default (or non-existent)
default protections against access by children. ATVOD has no power to insist on such protections being offered by these service
defaults.
default&#xa0;
default2.22
default              
defaultP
defaultroviders established in Member States
default which do not require such restrictions on VOD pornography services would argue against
default any 
defaultattempt at extra-territorial 
defaultcriminal 
defaultarrest and 
defaultprosecution by the UK
default (e.g. under the OPA by means of a European Arrest Warrant.) They would say such action would
default infringe their right to freely provide services in the EU 
defaultunder
default the country of origin 
defaultprinciple enshrined 
defaultin the
default AVMS
default Directive 
default(
defaultArt
defaulticle
default 3
default)
default. 
defaultTo take action,
default the U
defaultK would 
defaulttherefore 
defaulthave to dero
defaultgate on the grounds that the measures are necessary for reasons of public policy (e.g. the protection of minors) or for the protection of public health, and would be required to notify the Commission. Any such action would be 
defaultlikely to be challenged
default 
defaultrobustly.
default&#xa0;
default2.23
default              
defaultGiven the common stance of a significant number of EU Member States, including the UK
default,  the
default Committee may care to consider what options there
default are
default to build a consensus behind a proposal for an EU wide requirement for 
defaultaccess controls to prevent under-18’s being exposed to hardcore pornography
default.
default ATVOD has already made such a proposal in its response to the European 
defaultCommission
default Green Paper – ‘
defaultPreparing
default for a Fully Converged Audiovisual World: Growth, Creation and Values’.
default R
defaultather than setting a test such as ‘might seriously impair’, which is open to widely differing interpretations, such a measure might simply define hardcore pornography and require each Member State to ensure that media services within their jurisdiction sec
defaulture that under 18s cannot normally access such material.
default&#xa0;
defaultShould non-EU VOD services which are targeted at the UK be brought within the scope of regulations designed to protect UK consumers and children?default&#xa0;
default2.24
default              
defaultAs noted in paras 1.8 – 1.9, a majority of on
default demand services
default 
default/ websites offering hardcore pornography without effective access restriction operate from outside the EU, notably from the USA and Canada. They are therefore beyond the reach of any European regulator. The exclusion applies even if the 
defaultservice is specifically targeted and marketed at UK consumers.
default&#xa0;
default2.25
default              
defaultGiven the large number of such services, and the wide scale of their consumption in the UK, the Committee may care to consider whether consideration should be given to broadening the scop
defaulte of the relevant
default UK
default legislation to enable determinations to be made in relation to VOD services from outside the EU which: 
default&#xa0;

defaultAs  noted
default in para 2.11, 
defaultCrown Prosecution Service (“CPS”) guidance for prosecutors on the interpretation of the Obscene Publications Act (“OPA”)
default, 
default states that
default:
default&#xa0;
default“where children are likely to access material of a degree of sexual explicitness equivalent to what is available to those aged 18 and above in a licensed sex shop, that material may be considered to be obscene and subject to prosecution. This applies to ma
defaultterial which is not behind a suitable payment barrier or other accepted means of age verification, for example, material on the front page of pornography websites and non-commercial, user-generated material which is likely to be accessed by children and me
defaultets the threshold. 
defaultsee
default R v Perrin, [2002] EWCA Crim  747”      
default&#xa0;
default2.28
default              
defaultThe same guidance also advises that:
default&#xa0;default“
defaultThere are very difficult jurisdictional issues about whether material hosted overseas is within reach of the English criminal law. It will depend on a range of factors including who posted the material on the site, where it is hosted and what the person in
defaulttends the material to do. If a web site is hosted abroad and is downloaded in the UK, the case of R v Perrin [2002] 4 Archbold News 2 will apply. 
default&#xa0;
defaultR v Perrin is specifically concerned with 'publishing' electronic data under the Obscene Publications Act 19
default59 and states that the mere transmission of data constitutes publication. It is clear from the decision in R v Perrin and in the earlier case of R v Waddon (6 April 2000 unreported), that there is publication both when images are uploaded and when they are
default downloaded. In the case of R v Waddon the Court of Appeal held that the content of American websites could come under British jurisdiction when downloaded in the United Kingdom.

defaultCPS advice therefore suggests that a US website which offers sexually

defaultwhich is not behind a suitable payment barrier or other accepted means of age verification 
defaultis likely to be operating in breach of the OPA if the material is accessed in the UK.

default              
defaultThe Committee might therefore consider whether

default.
default In this regard, ATVOD notes that while the pornographic services 
defaultmost frequently accessed from within the UK are so-called ‘tu
defaultbe-sites’, which offer content free of charge, those tube-sites depend for income primarily on driving online traffic to their own or affiliated pay sites. The free content is merely a shop window for services which involve a financial transaction with the
default user
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.31
default              
defaultATVOD has 
defaulttherefore posed to the UK financial industry the question: is it appropriate to process 
defaultpayments
default to services which, according to CPS guidance, appear to be operating in breach of the OPA? This has been followed by a series of con
defaults

default a summit being held on 10 October 2013, chaired by ATVOD and including senior representatives from The UK Cards Association, the British Bankers’ Association,
