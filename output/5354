[normal]Memorandum by UKIP [bold]&#xa0;[bold]INTRODUCTION[bold]&#xa0;[bold]UKIP welcomes the opportunity to respond to the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications’ consultation into Broadcast General Election Debates in the United Kingdom (UK).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]UKIP was originally established as a political party in 1993, with the express intention of campaigning to take the UK out of the European Union. Today, the party campaigns on political issues right across the board and has seen strong and unprecedented success in recent UK parliamentary by-elections and local elections. A recent poll has shown that UKIP is the most trusted party on immigration, with
[normal] 22% of voters trusting UKIP on the issue, with 17% trusting Labour and 11% trusting the Conservatives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]UKIP is a national party and its membership currently stands at just over 33,000 members, an increase of some 10,500 since March 2013. Some indication of the growth of the party’s support may be taken from the size of its recent vote share: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When UKIP contested its first European Parliamentary elections in 1994, it received just over 150,000 votes and failed to win a single seat.  In the Euro elections held on 4 June 2009, UKIP won 13 seats, coming second to the Conservative Party, with 2,498,226 votes (16.6%). The party fielded 572 candidates in the 2010 General Election and attracted 919,471 votes. In the election for 35 councils in England and Wales held on 2 May 2013, UKIP fielded 1,700 candidates, gaining 147 seats and averaged 25% of the vote in the wards where it stood.  The concentration of the seats gained may be seen at Annex A. In late 2013, UKIP was regularly polling between 10-18% (Annexes B and C). According to The Times of 2 January 2014, UKIP’s councillors have the best attendance record of all the political parties (UKIP 92.4%; Conservative 88.6%; Labour 88.4%; Liberal Democrat 87.7% and Green 79.6%).
[normal]UKIP is currently aiming to field a candidate in each one of the 632 mainland parliamentary constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales in the 2015 General Election. On 30 December 2013, the Daily Mirror predicted UKIP would top the polls in the Euros also being held on 22 May 2014.  In December 2013, the pollster Survation predicted the outcome of the Euros as: Conservative 24%; Labour 32%; Liberal Democrats 8%; UKIP 25%; Green Party 6% and Other Parties 6%.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]SUMMARY [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]UKIP is recommending: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]►
[normal] That UKIP Party Leader Nigel Farage be permitted to participate in the televised leaders’ debates, in the run-up to any national election. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]►
[normal] That the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications may wish to consider the appointment of an independent committee, with a remit similar to that of the American Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) to handle the issues of format and of which leaders should be given the right to appear in the debates. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]►
[normal]  That like the US system, those parties demonstrating a level of support of at least 15% of the national electorate, as determined by five selected national public opinion polling organisations, should be permitted to take part in the leaders’ debates.    
[normal]              
[normal]►
[normal] That any such independent committee considers extending the existing broadcast remit beyond purely terrestrial television, to include online platforms, such as YouTube.

[normal]RESPONSES IN FULL [bold]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The first party leaders’ debate in 2010 attracted 9.4 million viewers and two-thirds of them said they learnt something new. Half of the 18-24 age group said they were more interested in the campaign as a result of watching the debates. Voter turn-out in 2010 rose on 2005, which in turn, was an increase on 2001, thus challenging well-worn claims about inexorable voter disengagement.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A key argument in favour of the broadcasts was that they reached a wider audience than is usual for politically-related content and that, after watching them, normally apolitical debate-watchers might be better informed about election issues; more likely to discuss policies with their friends and families; and more likely to vote, than those who were not exposed to the debates.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As Ric Bailey, the BBC’s Chief Political Adviser put it in his 2012 analysis of the 2010 General Election leaders’ debates 
[normal]Squeezing out the Oxygen – Or Reviving Democracy?
[normal] they ‘had a seismic impact on the election campaign’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In May 2010, Lord Pearson of Rannoch (UKIP’s then leader) was in correspondence with Sky TV, Sir Michael Lyons of the BBC Trust and Mark Thompson, the BBC’s then Director General on the subject of UKIP representation at the televised leaders’ debates in the run-up to the 2010 General Election. Mr Thompson wrote to Lord Pearson on 15 January 2010, conveying his decision not to include UKIP: ‘The basis on which judgements are made about relative levels of coverage rests on past and current electoral support. For the election to the House of Commons in 2010, the starting point is the last General Election, in 2005. Similarly, the starting point for coverage of the 2009 European election was the previous European election of 2004. This means that UKIP – on the basis of its strong performance in 2004 – was given the same level of coverage in the 2009 election as the Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties. In 2005, however, at the last General Election (notwithstanding its performance at the European election less than a year before), UKIP attracted just over 2% of the vote and won no representation at Westminster.’ ‘It is, therefore, appropriate and consistent for the BBC – and other broadcasters – to offer the opportunity to take part in the Prime Ministerial debates only to those parties which have substantial electoral support in the context of Westminster. There will be additional opportunities across the BBC for other parties to receive appropriate coverage responding to the Prime Ministerial debate.’ It should be noted that despite those reassurances, no such ‘additional opportunities’ subsequently materialised. As matters transpired, between them, the three main parties got coverage in the order of some five hours and UKIP got less than ten minutes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]During the course of his correspondence with the BBC, Lord Pearson drew attention to the terms of the BBC’s Charter and the following provisions in the BBC’s own election guidelines, which states: ‘Previous electoral support in equivalent elections is the starting-point for making judgments about the proportionate level of coverage between parties. However, other factors can be taken into account where appropriate, including evidence of variation in levels of support in more recent elections, changed political circumstances (e.g. new parties or party splits), as well as other evidence of current support. The number of candidates a party is standing may also be a factor.’ Those guidelines were endorsed by Jenny Watson, Chairman of the Electoral Commission, in a letter dated 11 January 2010 to Ric Bailey, 
[normal]the BBC’s Chief Political Adviser
[normal], in which, she also stated: ‘In addition, we are satisfied with the draft Election Guidelines, and the approach taken regarding the participation of candidates in constituency items during the election period’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Prime Minister David Cameron is on record as having stated that UKIP Party Leader Nigel Farage should 
[normal]not
[normal] take part in the leaders’ debates and that they should only involve people who ‘have a prospect of becoming prime minister.’
[normal] 
[normal]In a 2013 interview with Parliament’s 
[normal]The House
[normal] magazine, Mr Cameron made it clear that he believed Mr Farage should be excluded from any TV debates at the next general election. ‘Obviously we have to decide on this nearer the time, but the TV debates should be about, you know, the parties that are going to form the government, in my view.’
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, there is a diverse body of evidence in the public domain, which strongly suggests the opposite: On 9 January 2013, a ComRes poll for the 
[normal]Daily Express
[normal] spelled out that Britons 
[normal]did 
[normal]want the prime minister to debate with Mr Farage, before the next general election. 54 percent of those polled said they wanted to see Mr Farage in the line-up against the Conservative Prime Minister. Their answers made it clear that the majority of people thought Nigel Farage should be included in any debates which are certain to include Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband. Two-thirds of voters in the poll of 2,000 adults said Mr Cameron would ‘look like a coward’ if he failed to take part in a re-run of the live debates, which electrified the 2010 General Election. 
[normal]Mr Farage stated: ‘With UKIP’s growing popularity and the centrality of the issues on which we campaign, it is pretty obvious from these figures that I agree with the majority of the people of Britain.’ Only 20 percent said that 
[normal]Mr 
[normal]Farage should be excluded from the debates.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Andrew Hawkins, the c
[normal]hairman of 
[normal]ComRes offered the pollster’s point-of-view on the issue: ‘By agreeing to the debates in 2010 the main parties created an expectation among voters for future clashes, which could backfire badly if they try to wriggle out of them. This genie is well and truly out of the bottle.’ Other noteworthy trends from the ComRes poll included the fact that 14 percent more men than women wanted the UKIP leader in the debates and 12 percent fewer public sector workers felt the same way as their private sector counterparts on the topic. In the poll, 41 percent in the age group 25-34 want to see Mr Farage go toe-to-toe in the leaders’ debates, a figure which rose to 66 percent for those aged 65+ (i.e., those most likely to vote in a general election). 
[normal]The leaders’ debates will help being the election campaign to life, according to the poll. More than half (52%) said they ‘make the General Election campaign more interesting’, with 28% disagreeing, although 50% also believe that the debates ‘don't tell us anything about the party leaders and their policies that we don't already know.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A YouGov poll on the issue of UKIP’s inclusion in the leaders’ debates was conducted for 
[normal]The Times
[normal] newspaper in early October 2013.
[normal] It posed three options and the responses were as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Their Lordships may also wish to be aware of the e-petition, which appeared on HM Government Website (closed on 13 December 2013) which read: ‘We believe that if The UK Independence Party or 'UKIP' beat either of the coalition parties (Liberal Democrats or Conservative Party) at the European Elections 2014, then their leader should be allowed to participate and speak as part of any televised leaders’ debate ahead of the general election.’ The Cabinet Office response to the petition read: ‘This is not a matter for Government. The arrangement for party political broadcast and debates are for the parties themselves.’ (However, the Cabinet Office offered no explanation as to why the petition had been hosted on the government’s website for a year, if it was ‘not a matter for government’). The petition received 30,074 signatures in support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]On  7 January 2014, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told the 
[normal]Daily Telegraph
[normal] that he was ready to ‘sign up now’ with broadcasters, for the same format of debates that took place before the last election and he challenged David Cameron to do the same. Mr Clegg's pledge came after Labour asked to open formal negations with broadcasters, to set in motion plans for similar television debates between the three main party leaders that were broadcast in the run up to the 2010 election. Although he agreed with Labour that on balance, he favoured a ‘333’ formula - three debates between the three leaders of the main parties over three consecutive weeks, Liberal Democrat sources said that the Deputy Prime Minister did not want Mr Cameron to ‘wriggle out’ of the debates, using the excuse that Nigel Farage and UKIP could possibly be involved. Mr Clegg said: ‘So the only major party leader of the major party who is represented in the House of Commons who still needs to need, if you like, to still sign on the dotted line is David Cameron and the Conservatives.’ He added that he did not want ‘anxieties about UKIP and Nigel Farage’ to be used as an ‘excuse’ to not take part and that he would relish the prospect of debating the UKIP leader, if the opportunity presented itself. He added: ‘I think it would be a real step backward if we were, if any party leader were to sort of use an excuse to not do these leader debates again. The key thing is to get agreement from the three party leaders of three main parties represented in the House of Commons, then you can have a debate. I personally have no problem debating with Nigel Farage, I’d probably relish it actually, but the first thing you have to do is to get the Labour and a Liberal Democrat and Conservative leaders to agree to do this again, I’m prepared to do it, I hope that David Cameron will do it again.’ The previous week, Douglas Alexander, Labour’s election co-ordinator, told 
[normal]The Guardian
[normal] that Labour was about to commence talks on the issue with the TV companies.
[normal] He said: ‘The starting point for Labour in the talks is that the format should be the same as the election when TV debates were introduced and seen as important to stimulating public interest.’ He added: ‘Farage potentially taking part is not a deal-breaker for Labour, but it appears that it might be for David Cameron. The priority for us is to ensure that there is a debate between the two prospective prime ministers of the country – Ed Miliband and David Cameron. The other issues about format are a matter for negotiation.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In the House of Commons on 7 January 2014, Peter Bone, MP (Conservative, Wellingborough) asked Cabinet Office Minister Greg Clark: ‘Mr Speaker, s
[normal]urely the way to stop a decline in individual registration is to make politics interesting. Therefore is it not essential that we continue with the leader’s debates and that they should include the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Prime Minister
[normal], the 
[normal]Deputy Prime Minister
[normal], the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Leader of the Opposition
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and the leader of the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]UK Independence
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Party and does the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Minister
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]agree that afterwards, it will not be ‘I agree with Nick’ but ‘I agree with Nige’?’ Mr
[normal] Clark replied: ‘All I want to say is that my Honourable Friend is a personal example of someone who makes politics interesting and I think there’s a good case for him being included in those debates, for that reason.’ 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]UKIP’s claim to a place in the leaders’ debates is reinforced by the fact that the party is presently out-polling one of the two parties in the present Coalition Government (see 
[normal]Annex C) an
[normal]d has been tipped by a number of psephologists and political commentators as the front-runner to win most British seats in the May 2014 European Elections.
[normal] UKIP intends to stand a candidate in every mainland constituency in the British General Election in 2015. However, we believe that any decision as to whether UKIP should be included in the leaders’ debates should reflect not only its share of the vote in the European elections and current polling information, but also its track-record in council elections - as well as the party’s representation in Parliament. However, it should be noted that if Prime Minister Cameron had honoured the pledge made in the 2010 Coalition Agreement that: ‘
[normal]Lords appointments will be made with the objective of creating a second chamber that is reflective of the share of the vote secured by the political parties in the last general election’ – UKIP would now have 24 peers in the House of Lords.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]As suggested in the Committee’s ‘Call for Evidence’, an independent ‘debates commission’ may well be the way forward and it is worth examining the American experience of the issue: Their first televised debates were held in 1960 between Senator John F Kennedy and Vice-President Richard Nixon. Sixteen years then elapsed before agreement was reached to hold any further debates. Now they are a permanent fixture, and the decision about who should take part, is taken by an independent body, the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). It was founded in 1987 and applies a generally accepted set of rules. It includes candidates who, (in the words of the CPD’s rules):
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]are constitutionally eligible to hold the office of President of the United States;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b) have achieved ballot access in a sufficient number of states to win a theoretical Electoral College majority in the general election; and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](c) have demonstrated a level of support of at least 15% of the national electorate, as determined by five selected national public opinion polling organisations, using the average of those organisations' most recent publicly-reported results. The 15% rule meant that businessman and philanthropist Ross Perot, an independent candidate, took part in the debates in 1992; at all other recent elections, debates have been confined to Democrat and Republican candidates only.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The challenges of translating the above three options into the British democratic process should not be insuperable and it may well be the wisest choice to hand the decision to an independent organisation – for example, an all-party group convened by the Speaker of the House of Commons; or a freshly-appointed body, created by Parliament, or operating under the auspices of an existing all-party organisation, such as the Hansard Society. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]It is suggested that Their Lordships may wish to consider extending the existing broadcast remit to include online platforms, such as YouTube. The 2010 leaders’ debates saw unprecedented levels of interaction through social networking sites and on a weekly basis, there are thousands of Tweets regarding the content of BBC TV’s 
[normal]Question Time
[normal] programme. With digital and social media becoming increasingly important and large numbers of people online, we suggest that there should be online debates, or at least, debates with an interactive element, to cater for the growing appetite to interact with the political process. One
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]model
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]o
[normal]n which to base such an online or interactive debate
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]could
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]be the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2007 CNN and YouTube Presidential Debate,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a series of televised events, in
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]which, the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]United States presidential hopefuls fielded questions, submitted through
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the video-sharing site YouTube. Furthermore, such a debate would also help to encourage younger and first-time voters to think about politics and interact with the political process. Additionally, a 
[normal]Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism study revealed that the 2010 Election Debates successfully attracted first-time 
[normal]voters and got them talking about politics
[normal]. That
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]research, based on YouGov survey data, showed that among 18 - to 24-year-olds ‘a special relationship [was formed] with the TV debates compared with more jaded older people.’ More than half of those surveyed in the 18-24 age group said they had become more interested in the election, compared with a quarter of people aged 55 and over. UKIP’s own experience of social and digital media would attest to the importance of the medium, as well as reinforcing our claim that UKIP should have a presence at any the debates. UKIP is regularly a trending topic on Twitter in the UK, particularly after BBC TV 
[normal]Question Time 
[normal]programmes featuring a UKIP spokesperson and in 2013, UKIP was the most popular topic of political conversation on Twitter.
[normal] UKIP currently has over 50,000 ‘Likes’ on Facebook, 35,000 ‘Followers’ on Twitter and Nigel Farage has more than 100,000 ‘Followers’ on Twitter, in addition to the many more who interact with both UKIP and him online, each day, all of which, suggests that there is a growing increase of usage of social media and interest in UKIP and its leader.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]It would be helpful if the decision as to who appears in the leaders’ debates is not party political, given the unprecedented rise of UKIP, which has not yet gained any seats in the House of Commons. Leaving the decision to the main political parties and the broadcasters on the question of format and who should be included in the leaders’ debates, will probably produce an outcome that side-lines the public interest. We live in a society in which, democratic participation has been in decline for more than a generation and the current situation presents a powerful opportunity to revive it and should not be discarded lightly.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In order to assist the Select Committee’s deliberations, UKIP’s senior officers are willing to appear before the committee in person, to give oral evidence. Their names are: Mr Nigel Farage, MEP (Party Leader); Mr Steve Crowther (Party Chairman); Lord Pearson of Rannoch and Mr Patrick O’Flynn (Party Director of Communications).
