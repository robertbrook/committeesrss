defaultff, governors, our PTA, David Lammy MP, local councillors and many people in the wider community.  The school was told in the last week of term in December that the Governing Body needs to agree to become an academy by 20 January 2012 or the government wil
defaultl disband and replace the Governing Body and seek a sponsor with a view to it becoming an Academy.  This sponsor could be a private, profit-making company.

defaultPublic Accounts Committee Report – Whilst this research supports some aspects of the academy model, the evidence is very fragile.  It used data from the National Audit Office 2010 research, but chooses to ignore the NAO’s conclusion (see below).  It only
default considered the performance of two chains, ARK, which the NAO noted had mixed success across its academies, and ULT, which the previous government had not allowed to sponsor any more academies as several had been judged to be ‘inadequate’. The Committee al
defaultso warned of “potential financial and governance instability” in the expansion of the academy model.

defaultNational Audit Office – Concluded “many of the academies established so far are performing impressively in delivering the intended improvements. It cannot 
defaultbe assumed, however, that academies’ performance to date is an accurate predictor of how the model will perform when generalised more widely. Existing academies have been primarily about school improvement in deprived areas, while new academies will often 
defaultbe operating in very different educational and social settings.”

defaultPWC Final Evaluation Report 2008 - This concluded at page 19 that, “There is insufficient evidence to make a definitive judgement about the Academies as a model for school improvement.”

defaultUnfortunately your child has still not met their initial target of being able to recognise numerals 1-10. Therefore your child is not making rapid progress, which is hindering 
defaulttheir overall progress and attainment.
defaultPlease work hard with your child over the half term, helping them to achieve this target using the resources provided*.  If you need any more support in helping your child then please do not hesitate to see a member o
defaultf staff.
defaultTargets are regularly monitored so as soon as your child reaches their target we are able to set a new one and keep their progress developing at a steady pace.
