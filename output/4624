[normal]Annex[bold] 1[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Save Downhills Campaign - Who we are:[bold] [bold]              [bold]              [bold]              [bold]              [bold]              [bold](Agreed December 2011)[bold]We are all members of the Downhills Primary School community who are worried about the Department for Education’s plans to force the school to become an academy.  Our campaign is supported by parents and carers, all of the school sta
[normal]ff, governors, our PTA, David Lammy MP, local councillors and many people in the wider community.  The school was told in the last week of term in December that the Governing Body needs to agree to become an academy by 20 January 2012 or the government wil
[normal]l disband and replace the Governing Body and seek a sponsor with a view to it becoming an Academy.  This sponsor could be a private, profit-making company.

[normal]LSE Changing School Autonomy – Professor Machin
[normal] has since written “Our results 
[normal]showed a 
[normal]r
[normal]easonably positive impact of the policy – under the last government. So we have been somewhat surprised to see it used extensively by supporters of the coalition's pol
[normal]icy on academies…This seems rather hard to justify, given that the new academy programme is different in a number of ways.” (The Guardian 9 April).  He told BBC Radio 4’s The Report that it was not appropriate to extrapolate the research to primary schools
[normal].

[normal]Public Accounts Committee Report – Whilst this research supports some aspects of the academy model, the evidence is very fragile.  It used data from the National Audit Office 2010 research, but chooses to ignore the NAO’s conclusion (see below).  It only
[normal] considered the performance of two chains, ARK, which the NAO noted had mixed success across its academies, and ULT, which the previous government had not allowed to sponsor any more academies as several had been judged to be ‘inadequate’. The Committee al
[normal]so warned of “potential financial and governance instability” in the expansion of the academy model.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]National Audit Office – Concluded “many of the academies established so far are performing impressively in delivering the intended improvements. It cannot 
[normal]be assumed, however, that academies’ performance to date is an accurate predictor of how the model will perform when generalised more widely. Existing academies have been primarily about school improvement in deprived areas, while new academies will often 
[normal]be operating in very different educational and social settings.”

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]PWC Final Evaluation Report 2008 - This concluded at page 19 that, “There is insufficient evidence to make a definitive judgement about the Academies as a model for school improvement.”

[normal]their overall progress and attainment.
[normal]Please work hard with your child over the half term, helping them to achieve this target using the resources provided*.  If you need any more support in helping your child then please do not hesitate to see a member o
[normal]f staff.
[normal]Targets are regularly monitored so as soon as your child reaches their target we are able to set a new one and keep their progress developing at a steady pace.
