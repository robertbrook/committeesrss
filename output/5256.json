"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dr Thomas Lundberg, University of Glasgow (DWB 10)Summary:\nWith regard to the electoral arrangements for the National Assembly for Wales, I strongly support restoration of the right for candidates to stand for election both in constituencies and on regional lists simultaneously (‘dual candidacy’) because this \nwoul\nd promote more electoral competition at the constituency level, helping voters both at election time and between elections, with the greater likelihood of the \n‘\nshadowing\n’\n of constituency Assembly Members by their regional counterparts who hope to seek elec\ntion locally; it would also mean that parties would be more likely to get their strongest candidates elected, \nwhich would strengthen the democratic process; and it\n \nis the norm in mixed-member proportional (MMP\n – the term used internationally by most politi\ncal scientists to describe what the British government calls the additional member system\n) electoral systems\n elsewhere\n in the world. \nMaintaining\n the ban \ngoes against the logic of proportional representation \n(PR) \nand would perpetuate what appeared to be a p\nartisan rigging of the Assembly’s electoral system\n.\n1. \nThe \nLabour Party\n, in general,\n \nopposes dual candidacy\n in MMP elections (used for the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales, and London Assembly)\n, with claims that it is undemocratic for candi\ndates who were\n, in the \nterminology\n of some in the party\n,\n ‘rejected’ \nby voters \nin constituency races \nonly \nto \nenter\n an assembly or parliament through the ‘back door’ of the \nregional \nparty list. Former Welsh Secretary Peter Hain was so opposed to dual candida\ncy that he \nled the effort to have\n the practice banned for Assembly elections (from 2007), despite the fact that nearly all Labour constituency candidates in the previous (2003) elections were also party list candidates. At the most recent elections\n in 2011\n, dual candidacy remained\n banned in Wales, but not i\nn Scotland, where 19% of Labour’\ns nominees were dual candidates, compared to 78% for the Scottish National Party (SNP), 86% for the Conservatives, an\nd 52% for the Liberal Democrats.\n2. \nCritics \nof the ban \npointed out the partisan appearance of the \naction\n. The Electoral Commission noted this problem in its 2005 statement opposing the\n proposal\n, where it rejected Labour’s argument\n that the \npublic opposed dual candidacy because it had \nfound no evidence of such \nopposition. \nIn the 2006 debate over this issue, \nConservative M\nembers of the House of Commons also pointed out the appearance of \nLabour \npartisanship, noting that\n because of Labour’s advantage in Welsh constituencies,\n \no\nthe\nr\n parties\n would be more likely to nominate weaker candidates in strong Labour areas if dual candidacy were banned\n because the regional list route would probably be safer\n. While the result since the ban \nwas enacted \nis hard to test \nbecause many other factors are invo\nlved in \nelections\n (‘correlation is not causation’\n, as social scientists would say\n)\n, the ban c\nould \nhave mad\ne constituency contests less competitive and\n, therefore,\n \nmight\n have been \nbad for voters.\n \n3. My research into the constituency role of MMP-elected rep\nresentatives (and relations between them) shows that \nthere have been tensions between constituency- and list-elected members of the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament, and that the situation in the UK is worse than the situation in Ger\nmany, where the modern form of MMP originated. \nChapter 6 of my 2007 book \n(see below) \nrecounts the frustration many constituency representatives felt when encountering ‘shadowing’ by list-elected representatives who sought to raise their profile locally, re\nsponding to the electoral incentive provided by MMP and dual candidacy – representatives elected via their party’s regional list wo\nuld focus constituency service o\nn a geographical constituency in which they planned to seek \ntheir party’s nomination at the n\next election. \nIn the early years of devolution, most \nWelsh and Scottish constituency-elected representatives were from\n the Labour Party facing regional list-elected representatives from other parties\n, so there is a partisan dimension to the tensions. \nWhile\n this\n competitive situation\n may have been uncomfortable for representatives elected in constituencies, it focused more attention on constituents in some constituencies previously seen as safe, so could have been good for \nthose \nconstituents’ interests.\n4. \nF\nor parties, there \nare problems associated with banning dual candidacy – they \nmay\n fail to elect their strongest c\nandidates, resulting in a weakening of the democratic process. In Wales, the 2011 election saw the Conservative leader fail to win a regional li\nst seat due to the unexpectedly strong performance of his party’s constituency candidates in that region. \nIn Scotland, many high profile \nLabour candidates did not partake of dual candidacy and lost their constituency seats\n in 2011\n, so were not able to re-e\nnter the Scottish Parliament. Some have become assistants to novice candidates who did win (and were presumably not expected to do so). Scottish Labour went from 53 constituency and 3 list members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) in the first (1999) elect\nion to 15 constituen\ncy and 22 list in 2011. The loss\n of so many experienced Labour MSPs in the last election makes it more difficult for the opposition to the SNP majority government (the party won 69 of the 129 seats) to scrutinise \nit\n effectively.\n \n5. \nMMP\n is a form of \nPR\n, so the winner-take-all element derived from \nconstituency\n contests can, for many people, b\ne a confusing holdover from the\n ‘first-past-the-post’ system. It is understandable that people might find it difficult to accept the apparent resurrection of candidates who lose \nconstituency\n contests\n, and part of the Labour Party’s opposition to dual candidacy probably \ncomes\n from a\n high\nly\n majoritarian understanding of democracy\n. \nSuch a \nzero-sum \nview\n,\n however, is incompatible with the \npositive\n-\nsum \nlogic of \nPR\n.\n MMP is about a larger contest that takes place across \nthe \nelectoral regions \nof\n Wales\n in which \na party’s overall (constituency plus\n regional)\n \nseat allocation is determined\n, more or less,\n by\n \nits\n party vote\n because of the (roughly) compensatory linkage between the constituency and regional tiers of seats\n. The \nconstituency\n contests determine who is the ‘local’ \nAssembly Member (\nAM\n)\n, thoug\nh list \nAMs\n \ntypically\n undertake a constituency role, and this can be important for those voters who were unsuccessful in electing their choice of a \nconstituency \ncandidate as a means of linking them into the political system.\n \n6. \nBecause dual candidacy is\n a\n \ntypical \nfeature \nof MMP systems (as well as \nmost\n mixed-member majoritarian \n(MMM) systems, in which constituency and regional or national list seat tiers are not linked and PR\n overall \nis not achieved)\n, and because \nthe dual candidacy ban for \nWelsh Assembly el\nections was not in place at the outset, nor was it enacted for Scottish Parliamen\nt or London Assembly elections, I was shocked when the \nBritish\n government enacted the ban. \nWhile I have studied electoral systems for years, and am familiar with other countri\nes’ experiences \nof\n the manipulation of these systems for partisan advantage, I would never have expected a British government to carry out what appeared to be such a blatantly partisan attempt to rig an electoral system. Perhaps I \nwas\n naïve, having gr\nown u\np in the United States believing British democracy to be of a higher calibre than this. For those electoral systems experts looking at Britain from outside, noting that the few countries \nwith\n mixed-membe\nr systems \nthat ban\n dual candidacy include the less-th\nan-democratic Ukraine and\n \nThailand\n (among a few others)\n, the inclusion of Wal\nes in this group is disturbing.\n7. In Germany, longstanding user of MMP, dual candidacy is not controversial. \nWhile there was some controversy, \nNew Zealand has recently examined \ndual candidacy \nand has chosen to retain\n it\n. I hope the National Assembly for Wales will revert to \nits\n former situation of allowing dual candidacy. While it may be outside the remit of this committee\n’s enquiry\n, I \nwould also recommend increasing the size of \nthe Assembly to 80 by simply adding another 20 regional members\n (four more to each of the five existing electoral regions)\n. This would increase the \nproportionality of election results and make the Assembly more representative of the \nvoters\n of Wales.\n&#xa0;\n15 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n2\n&#xa0;\n"
