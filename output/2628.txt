[[[Written evidence submitted by Citizens Advice]]]&#xa0;1. Introduction&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Citizens Advice welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Committee’s inquiry into this important subject.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Citizens Advice service provides free, independent, confidential and impartial advice to everyone on their rights and responsibilities. It values diversity, promotes equality and challenges discrimination. The service aims:&#xa0;&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the year to April 2013, Citizens Advice Bureaux in England and Wales dealt with:&#xa0;&#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The housing costs component of Universal Credit (UC) will not constitute a “clean sheet”. The essential structure of HB (and support for mortgage interest) will carry through into UC, along with a number of associated problems, which we explore below.&#xa0;2. The main issues&#xa0;

[[[Affordable housing and shortfalls in housing-related benefits]]]&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Citizens Advice endorses the definition of “affordable housing” adopted by Lord Whitty’s independent inquiry into affordable homes: “comfortable, secure homes in sound condition that are available to rent or buy without leaving households unable to afford their other basic needs (eg food, clothing, heating, transport and social life)”. &#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As regards rents eligible for HB - and in due course the rental element of UC - we fully accept that HB/ UC cannot be expected to meet any rent, however high. But limits must take account of the consequences for poverty and social exclusion and our bureaux are picking up growing numbers of cases where HB cuts are causing hardship and debt. The role of such limits in leaving claimants with inadequate disposable incomes after paying the rent is therefore part of a wider problem – pointing to the need to develop a strategy for genuinely affordable housing in all sectors.&#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) have featured prominently in the current debate as a possible solution to HB cuts in individual cases and CAB advice on DHPs has almost trebled in the first quarter of 2013-14 compared with the same quarter the previous year. However, their potential role is exaggerated, given the scale of the problem. A perspective can be gained from the fact that in the current year (2013-14) the overall DHP budget is equivalent to about seven per cent of the HB cuts total. The consequent tight rationing means that payments, even when made, are frequently temporary, with no guarantee that the claimant will be able to find somewhere affordable by the time the DHP expires.&#xa0;

[[[Shared accommodation rate]]]

[[[ (SAR)]]]&#xa0;2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A specific example of problematic HB/ UC restriction is the SAR, a lower level of eligible rent based on the assumption that the claimant occupies shared accommodation, whether they do or not. Previously, it applied to single childless under-25s, but from January 2012 was extended to single childless under-35s. (It also applies to older people who actually do live in shared accommodation). The SAR causes major problems of affordability of adequate accommodation. Sharing is often not appropriate (see case illustration below) or accommodation within the SAR is simply unavailable.&#xa0;A CAB in the South West advised a 31-year-old man with mental health difficulties who was under the care of an NHS psychiatrist. Due to his mental health problems, it was not feasible for him to share accommodation. He was, therefore, the sole occupant of a one-bedroom apartment, the rent for which was substantially higher than the SAR. A DHP was temporarily helping with the shortfall of £70 per month, but he could not meet the rent in the long term.&#xa0;

[[[Benefit cap]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In our view, ensuring that work pays should be a matter of bolstering in-work incomes, not cutting out-of-work benefits.&#xa0;2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In any case, it is hard to understand the case for including benefits that are available on similar terms both in and out of work – notably HB/ the rental component of UC; Child Tax Credits/ the children’s elements of UC; and Child Benefit.&#xa0;2.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Claimants advised by our bureaux illustrate the challenges faced by people affected by the benefit cap. For many, solutions are very limited - in part because work is often not an option. The Government’s own impact assessment shows that only just over a third of households affected receive Jobseeker’s Allowance – the others being carers, parents of young children or receiving Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).&#xa0;A CAB in the South East advised a single mother with three children (the youngest aged three) receiving Income Support. Her house was the appropriate size for HB purposes, but the benefit cap will leave her a shortfall in rent of £38.23 per week. She worked full time through the childhood of her older two children but now stays at home to look after the three-year-old. She had applied for a DHP but received a preliminary indication that she was unlikely to be successful. She is now facing the prospect of trying to find the shortfall in rent out of her Income Support. This is causing her acute anxiety.&#xa0;

[[[Extension of HB size restrictions to ]]]

[[[the ]]]

[[[social rented sector]]]&#xa0;2.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Restriction of HB eligible rent for accommodation of various sizes has been a feature of the scheme in the private rented sector for many years. From April 2013, HB size restrictions have been extended to social housing. Although promoted as a means of addressing under-occupation, the shortage of opportunities&#xa0;for affected claimants to move means that&#xa0;the measure is widely perceived as a levy on benefits rather than a means of making better use of the housing stock. &#xa0;2.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CAB evidence shows a very high demand for advice on this change, across England and Wales. For many, there are no solutions. In some cases, tenants need the room - for example, for their child to visit, or because a disability makes it impractical for couples to share; others are prevented from moving because of the unavailability of appropriate stock; or are excluded from exchange or transfer schemes due to rent arrears. Regarding this last problem, the National Housing Federation has suggested to its members that flexibility might be appropriate where arrears have arisen in consequence of the HB size restrictions. We support that approach.&#xa0;2.10&#xa0;&#xa0; Evidence shows that claimants affected by the HB size restrictions are also likely to be caught by other benefit changes that together leave people facing considerable hardship and rent arrears.&#xa0;A CAB on the South Coast advised a client in her 50s who had been living on her own in a 3-bedroom council house since her children left home. She has long-term health problems related to a genetic blood disorder. She had recently lost her ESA after being found fit for work and had appealed against the decision. The size restrictions had reduced her HB by £100 per month and she was receiving a DHP that was due to end shortly. Although she had agreed to move to a smaller property, she had been told that she could spend up to three years on the waiting list. She was worried how she would manage to pay the rent until she could move and was distressed and concerned about what might happen when her DHP stopped.&#xa0;

[[[Help with mortgage costs]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.11&#xa0;&#xa0; A very limited Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI) scheme helps with mortgage interest for people receiving out-of-work means-tested benefits. It is restricted by waiting periods, time limits for certain groups and a standard assumed interest rate (recently reduced from 6.08 to 3.63 per cent). The introduction of UC will further restrict help with mortgage interest, as any earnings will disqualify the claimant from support (at present, limited part-time earnings are permitted).&#xa0;A CAB in the North West advised a client in her 40s who suffers from depression and anxiety. She had sustained a double benefit cut as a result of being found fit for work and of the reduction in the standard rate of interest used to calculate SMI. She was now unable to meet the shortfall in her mortgage payments. These growing financial pressures were threatening to worsen her mental health problems and she faced the possibility of losing her home.&#xa0;

[[[Non-dependant deductions]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.12&#xa0;&#xa0; Non-dependant deductions (NDDs) are reductions in housing costs eligible for HB and SMI, based on assumed (not actual) contributions from “non-dependants” such as grown-up children and elderly relatives. The non-dependant is under no obligation to make these payments or to disclose their own financial details. Logically, one would expect non-dependants themselves to be able to claim HB to help them pay the assumed contribution, but in fact they cannot.&#xa0;2.13&#xa0;&#xa0; NDDs cause various problems (of hardship, complexity, reduced housing options and work disincentives). The previous Government had frozen them for some years, with a view to phasing them out. The current Government has returned to a policy of increasing them, well above the rate of inflation.&#xa0;2.14&#xa0;&#xa0; NDDs are to be restructured (and re-named “housing cost contributions”) under UC, with an emphasis on reducing work disincentives for the non-dependant, but at the cost of extending their impact elsewhere, notably to many young unemployed people and their parents.&#xa0;A CAB in the East of England advised an unemployed couple with three dependent children and a 20-year-old daughter earning £210 per week gross. The daughter was not meeting the NDD. A suspended possession order was eventually made, the arrears partly resulting from the NDD. The daughter has since taken out a loan to make back payments. The total weekly rent is £90 and it seems unreasonable that over 40 per cent of this should be payable by the daughter (who shares a bedroom with a younger sister).&#xa0;

[[[Localised Council Tax Support]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.15&#xa0;&#xa0; The abolition of Council Tax Benefit and its replacement with cash-limited localised relief is expected to create a scenario in England in which people on very low incomes will be required to pay small amounts of council tax that they cannot afford, creating major problems of collection, enforcement and debt.&#xa0;2.16&#xa0;&#xa0; Local tapers (withdrawal rates) will also potentially overlap with the UC taper, causing high marginal deduction rates across the affected part of the income scale, a problem which UC was supposed to solve. The original intention was that CTB would become part of UC – a coherence that has now been lost.&#xa0;A CAB in London advised a single, disabled man with an artificial leg. He lived in 2-bedroom council accommodation, receiving Income Support and Disability Living Allowance (DLA). His HB had been reduced by 14 per cent under the size restrictions and he was now liable to pay 15 per cent of his council tax. This meant he now had to find £60 per month towards his rent and £10.60 towards his council tax. &#xa0;

[[[Cumulative impacts]]]&#xa0;2.17&#xa0;&#xa0; Cuts to a range of benefits will often affect the same individuals and families, having a multiple impact and causing considerable hardship. This is a neglected issue and is not adequately monitored. HB rides on top of other benefits and is received by the full range of claimant groups, so will feature strongly in multiple impacts – as will the rental element of UC. The case examples at paragraphs 2.10, 2.11 and 2.16 illustrate this.&#xa0;2.18&#xa0;&#xa0; Proposals for benefit legislation should therefore be accompanied by a poverty impact assessment sufficiently sophisticated to provide estimates of multiple impacts.&#xa0;

[[[Payment of HB/ UC to tenants]]]

[[[ rather than direct to landlords]]]&#xa0;2.19&#xa0;&#xa0; Already the default position for HB in the private rented sector, it is intended that this will be the case in all sectors as UC is introduced. &#xa0;2.20&#xa0;&#xa0; A number of “demonstration projects” are under way to test this approach. There will be exceptions, relating to vulnerability and/ or rent arrears. It is expected that arrears will be a significant problem. &#xa0;2.21&#xa0;&#xa0; Indeed, the demonstration projects have already shown this to be the case: the most recent report monitoring the six project areas commented that: “collection rates are lower in all project areas than before the (demonstration projects) went live. And more of the rent that is paid arrives in instalments through the month (i.e. late) rather than on time in one sum as it did when Housing Benefit was paid by the local authority direct to the landlord. Landlord income and cash flow has, therefore, reduced. A small percentage rise in arrears represents significant funds for landlords”. &#xa0;2.22&#xa0;&#xa0; When direct payments to tenants were introduced as the norm in the private rented sector, phased between 2007-2011, Citizens Advice saw a significant rise in the number of private tenants seeking help with problems concerning arrears – a 64 per cent increase over the three years. We believe that the payment change was a significant contributor to this.&#xa0;2.23&#xa0;&#xa0; The DWP research report on the demonstration projects also concluded that supporting tenants to minimise such consequences are “frequently linked to resource-intensive interventions”.&#xa0;2.24&#xa0;&#xa0; It is important to note also that a policy of normally mandatory direct payment to tenants militates against principles of choice.&#xa0;2.25&#xa0;&#xa0; Unless there is a reason for mandatory direct payment to the landlord (rent arrears above a specified level or vulnerability issues such as drug or alcohol abuse) the choice, in our view, should lie with the claimant as to who – claimant or landlord – should receive benefit payments for rent. This could be on an “opt in” basis (analogous to setting up a direct debit) to satisfy the Government’s concern with active claimant engagement. &#xa0;2.26&#xa0;&#xa0; At the very least, this option should be available for a transitional period of no less than a year, to enable any necessary money advice and financial capability support to be put in place.&#xa0;A CAB in Wales advised a 50-year-old single woman living in a housing association property. She received ESA, had fibromyalgia and was also very forgetful. Her HB was originally paid to her landlord but was changed to direct payment to her. Since then she had fallen into arrears and was now being taken to court for possession. The direct payment decision had been rescinded, but she was still being taken to court.&#xa0;2.27&#xa0;&#xa0; This issue reflects a wider problem. Although people on low incomes often – of necessity – have excellent financial survival skills, claimants face new challenges relating to benefit cuts and payment changes. As part of our Managing Migration project, we recently surveyed over 1,700 of our clients who will start to receive UC from October and explored whether they felt they would be able to cope with five possible problem areas – budgeting, monthly payments, banking, staying informed and internet access.&#xa0;92 per cent said they felt unprepared for the new system in at least one area, while 38 per cent will need support with all of the possible problem areas.&#xa0;This is the first stage of a pilot we are carrying out in three locations – Birmingham, Ynys Mon and North Dorset – to test out how we can support people with these changes.&#xa0;2.28&#xa0;&#xa0; In our view, both central and local government should therefore have in place an adequate support strategy for claimants in need of money advice (including benefits, debt and financial capability). This should include input from our bureaux, with appropriate funding. For our part, as well as providing support to individuals, we will be able to share our findings from our Managing Migration project to help develop innovative approaches to helping claimants with the transition to the new system.&#xa0;3. Conclusions&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The impact of these changes are being felt by our clients across every area of England and Wales. Over time, given the range of benefit changes and against the backdrop of higher costs of living in general, many people both in and out of work will face increasing challenges to pay their rent or mortgage.&#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While the drive to reduce rising housing costs within benefit spending totals is understandable, this will not be effectively achieved by simply cutting benefits. It’s now vital that we see the development of policies aimed at driving down housing costs themselves. Without this more strategic approach, blunt policies to cut entitlement will have a serious impact on family finances in the short and the longer term, with all the attendant consequences for poverty, social inclusion, health and wellbeing.&#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As regards the roll-out of UC, we have noted in the previous section that our research suggests a substantial need for support among people who would otherwise struggle with the new payment systems. It is also crucial to remember the additional challenges for budgeting that people will face, not just as a result of the changes to how support is paid, but because of the greater risks of income shortfalls, sudden or otherwise. It is one thing to adjust to a monthly budget, but when managing a rent shortfall over a long period or a sudden income cut due to, say, the loss of ESA and/ or of DLA, or perhaps incurring a benefit sanction, severe debt may suddenly no longer be avoidable.&#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are therefore calling on the Government to:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

Published DWP DHP figures combined with HB cuts estimate from Chartered Institute of Housing (correspondence, July 2013). Hence the informal but widespread term, “bedroom tax”. Ministers have countered with the phrase ”removal of the spare room subsidy”. As this is not strictly a tax, while the term “subsidy” could be used to describe any benefit for anything, we have used the more straightforward expression, “HB/ UC size restrictions”. In Scotland and Wales, the position is different in that the governments there are making up the central funding shortfall from their own resources. Some English councils have done likewise – at least for the current year. Direct payments demonstration projects: learning the lessons, six months in, P. Hickman &amp; K.
