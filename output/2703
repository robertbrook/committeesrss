[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Inclusion Scotland (IS) is a national network of disabled peoples' organisations
[normal] and individual disabled people funded by the Scottish Government. Inclusion Scotland’s main aim is to draw attention to the physical, social, economic, cultural and attitudinal barriers that affect disabled people’s everyday lives in Scotland.  
[normal]Inclusion 
[normal]Scotland’s membership 
[normal]collectively represents several thousand disabled people from throughout Scotland.  Welfare Reforms
[normal],
[normal] and in particular changes to Housing Support
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]currently 
[normal]co
[normal]nstitute the issue of greatest concern to our members.

[normal]Under-[bold]occupancy [bold]penalty[bold] - “Bedroom Tax”[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Scottish Government estimates that 95,000 Scottish households will be affected by the Bedroom Tax in the first year. In Scotland 79% of the households 
[normal]expected to be 
[normal]affected (76,000) contain a disabled person
[normal]. They will lose an average of £13 pw in housing benefit. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Although tenants are being penalised for under-occupying, there is a chronic shortage of 1-bedroom properties.  North Lanarkshire Council, the largest social landlord in Scotland, has 33,000 prope
[normal]rties but as of July only 26 of those 
[normal]properties 
[normal]currently available were single bedroom properties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]By
[normal] the end of May 2013
[normal] 
[normal]a Scottish Government survey of local authorities found that 
[normal]there were an estimated 82,500 households in Scotland incurring a red
[normal]uction in their housing benefit because they were assessed as under occupying their property.
[normal] 
[normal]Of these households:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A research study 
[normal]carried out by 
[normal]False Economy on behalf of the
[normal] TUC 
[normal]via Freedom of Information requests 
[normal]to local authorities 
[normal]found that Scottish tenants were disproportionately likely to have fallen into rent arrears because of the under-occupation penalty. 
[normal]The research showed that 
[normal]8 out of the 20 local authorities that had the worst arrears problems were in Scotland.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For example 
[normal]in Clackmannanshire two-thirds of the tenants affected had fallen into arrears, which was second only to Barrow in Cumbria, 
[normal]where
[normal] three-quarters
[normal] were in arrears
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A further 
[normal]6
[normal] Scottish local authorities reported that 
[normal]40-50%
[normal] of the tenants affecte
[normal]d in their area had fallen into arrears. Unfortunately Glasgow
[normal], which has the highest number of tenants affected in any Scottish local authority area and also the highest levels of urban deprivation,
[normal] 
[normal]failed to
[normal] respond to the 
[normal]FoI 
[normal]request
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Inclusion Scotla
[normal]nd are concerned by the arrears levels uncovered by the TUC research
[normal] as they represent the position only some 4 months since the Under-Occupation Penalty’s introduction
[normal] and 
[normal]extremely concerned that a large proportion of the tenants who are falling into arr
[normal]ears will be disabled people.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] It must be feared that the proportion of tenants 
[normal]&amp; disabled people falling
[normal] into arrears will only increase as time goes by and any financial resources that claimants initially had at the outset of the penalty being imposed 
[normal]become stretched or entirely exhausted.  Moreover some tenants will have been eligible for Discretionary Housing Payments 
[normal](DHPs) 
[normal]during the first four months but these are 
[normal]usually
[normal] restricted to a 
[normal]3 
[normal]month maximum and so they too 
[normal]are likely to
[normal] fall into arre
[normal]ars 
[normal]when their DHPs are withdrawn
[normal]. 
[normal]3[bold]              [bold]Disabled People &amp; the [bold]Threat of Eviction:[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Scottish Government’s Analytical Services Division have estimated
[normal] the likely consequences of the introduction of the Under-Occupation Penalty. 
[normal]They estimated that 
[normal]8,000 o
[normal]f the households affected would move to smaller properties and thus manage to avoid the penalty whilst 
[normal]half of th
[normal]e remainder (43,000)
[normal] would be able to maintain their rent payments
[normal] and around half would fall into arrears
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Of the half that fell into a
[normal]rrears they believed that a quarter (i.e. nearly 11,000 households) would eventually be evicted. Given that 79% of the households affected contain at least one disabled person that might mean 8,000+ disabled people being evicted and becoming homeless.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]Inclusion Scotland believe that these
[normal] 
[normal]now look to be
[normal] over-optimistic projection
[normal]s given the levels of arrears in some 
[normal]Scottish 
[normal]authorities 
[normal]is 
[normal]already at or above this level after only 4 months. 
[normal] 
[normal]However
[normal] the additional 
[normal]£20 million in 
[normal]funding being made avai
[normal]lable 
[normal]by Scottish Government 
[normal]to Local Authorities to bolster DHP Budgets 
[normal]should
[normal] have an impact in reducing 
[normal]the rate at which tenants are falling into arrears and thus being evicted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Nevertheless Inclusion Scotland believes that disabled people will be
[normal] amongst those least able to continue to meet their rent payments.  This is because the Under-Occupation Penalty has not been introduced in a vacuum but in a context where other benefits paid to sick and disabled people are being cut. Thus the cumulative i
[normal]mpact of other welfare reforms will have an impact on their financial resilience and therefore their ability to meet increased rent payments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]According to the Sheffield Hallam University research
[normal] approximately 100,000 
[normal]Scots 
[normal]disabled people will be moved off Employment Support Allowance (ESA) 
[normal]by 2015 
[normal]either because they exhaust their entitlement to contributory ESA or because they are re-classified as fully fit for work after a Work Capability Assessment (WCA). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]Given th
[normal]e planned 20% budget reduction which the DWP is planning to achieve there will also be significant numbers (thousands at least) of disabled people on the Mobility Components and Care elements of DLA who will have to lose entitlement to the PIP to make the 
[normal]necessary savings.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]Using the DWP’s own projections, by 2018, IS estimates that over 
[normal]80,000[bold] working age disabled people in Scotland will lose either some or all of the
[normal] 
[normal]mobility allowance that they would otherwise have been entitled to
[normal] if DLA entitlement criteria had continued to be used
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8[bold]              [bold]Care component:  [bold]In addition because of the introduction of PIP –
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9
[normal] 
[normal]      
[normal]However overall nearly 
[normal]90,000[bold] fewer disabled peop
[normal]le in Scotland
[normal] will qualify for 
[normal]assistance with their care needs/daily living costs that they would otherwise have been entitled to under DLA eligibility criteria. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.10
[normal]              
[normal]Thus far, the DWP has 
[normal]refused to conduct
[normal] 
[normal]a Cumulative Impact  A
[normal]ssessment due to what it argue
[normal]s are
[normal] the difficulties in model
[normal]ing ‘behaviour effects’. However, using the DWP’s own figures in relation to the benefits disabled people received, 
[normal]Inclusion Scotland
[normal] have been able to calculate that working age disabled people who are 40+ will be 
[normal]disproportiona
[normal]tely affected by reforms to Employment &amp; Support Allowance, the replacement of Disability Living Allowance by the Personal Independence Payment and the Under-Occupation Penalty
[normal]. Thus - 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is also 
[normal]very likely that there will be a significant overlap between these groups of disabled claimants (e.g. ESA and DLA Lower Rate Care recipients) as both groups have large cohorts of people with learning difficulties and/or mental health issues/cognitive impai
[normal]rments (e.g. autism spectrum disorder). 
[normal]Thus 40% of c
[normal]laimants who have already 
[normal]lost entitlement to Employment and Support Allowance have learning difficulties
[normal] 
[normal]/mental health issues whilst over 30% of those currently on DLA Lower Rate Care also have these i
[normal]mpairments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.12
[normal]              
[normal]Research carried out by Demos on behalf of Scope
[normal] confirms that a substantial proportion of disabled people will experience multiple cuts in their entitlement to benefits. The research suggests that across the UK 120,000 disabled people 
[normal]will experience at least a triple loss of benefits by 2018 with 99,000 experiencing a quadruple cut. 
[normal]The personal benefit 
[normal]losses will range from 
[normal]a minimum of 
[normal]£6,300 
[normal]to 
[normal]£23,461 
[normal]per person by 2017.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.13
[normal]              
[normal]Research by the Scottish Public Health Observatory
[normal] shows that 72,660 people were in receipt of three key benefits (Income Support/Pension Credit, Incapacity Benefit/Employment and Support Allowance/Severe Disablement Allowance, and Disability Living Allowance)
[normal] affected by cuts
[normal], and 226,520 were in receipt
[normal] of at least two of the key benefits.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.14
[normal]      
[normal]Thus we think it safe to conclude that many of those losing ESA and/or other disability benefits (e.g. via the introduction of PIP
[normal] and changes to ESA entitlement
[normal]) will 
[normal]also be penalis
[normal]ed
[normal] under the Under-Occupation regulations.  This means that they will already or in the future suffer substantial losses to their household incomes making it more likely that they will be unable to maintain 
[normal]their 
[normal]rent payments and thus also more likely to ev
[normal]entually be evicted.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Exemptions[bold] to the Under Occupation Rule[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Inclusion Scotland believes that current exemptions to the Under Occupation rule are inconsistent with established case law, wider equality law and disabled people’s human rights. They are
[normal] also being inconsistently applied by local authorities and Registered Social Landlords.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Since the Court of Appeal judgment in 
[normal]Gorry V Department of Work and Pensions
[normal] local authorities 
[normal]have received guidance from the DWP to allow an extra bedroom for 
[normal]children who are unable to share because of their severe disabilities.
[normal]  
[normal]However no such exemption has been put in place for adult partners unable, or unwilling, to share a bed because of one
[normal],
[normal] or both
[normal]’
[normal]s
[normal],
[normal] severe impairments.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]We believe that this failure to exempt couple’s unable to share a bed is inconsistent with established case law, with equalities law which states that disabled people should not be treated less favourably than non-disabled people  (as it could result in di
[normal]sabled people’s health and safety being jeopardised) and with disabled people’s right, under the Human Rights Act and Article 8 of the European Convention, to a ‘home and family life’.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4     Inclusion Scotland
[normal] believe that it is a totally unwarranted
[normal] intrusion into the private lives of disabled people, and their partners, for the state to insist that they sleep in the same bed on pain of suffering a reduction to their housing benefit and that an exemption should be granted on these grounds forthwith.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Inclusion Scotland also believes that an exemption should exist for sick and disabled people who use one of their rooms to store equipment or other items associated with supporting them to live with their condition or impairment. For example a room u
[normal]sed to store a kidney dialysis machine is patently not being used as a bedroom and should not therefore be treated as one. 
[normal] 
[normal]A case (Lall v Westminster Council) on this very same  legal point was decided in favour of the claimant by a Lower Tier Tribunal ju
[normal]dge. See here for details – 
[normal]http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/26/bedroom-tax-westminster-council-defeat
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6
[normal]              
[normal]W
[normal]e view the failure to provide such an exemption as jeopardising sick and disabled people’s health and ability to live independently. As only disabled people have an essential need for additional rooms
[normal] (that
[normal] is not shared by non-disabled people
[normal])
[normal] we believe
[normal] 
[normal]that the Under-occupation penalty is
[normal] 
[normal]a breach of equality law which prohibits being treated differently on the grounds of disability
[normal] and of Article 14 of the ECHR
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This was also the view of a Lower Tier Tribunal judge in Glasgow in an as yet unreported 
[normal]dec
[normal]ision -
[normal] see here for the judge’
[normal]s comments: 
[normal]http://govanlc.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/european-convention-of-human-rights.html
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]There have also been a number of
[normal] rulings in a Fife Lower Tier Tribunal on whether rooms can be treated as “bedrooms” for Under-occupation penalty purposes.  The judge in these cases ruled that rooms under 70 sq. feet in area could not be treated as bedrooms
[normal] for use by adults and
[normal] that exempt accommodation
[normal],
[normal] where care and support was being provided by a Housing Association
[normal], whether or not contracted to do so by a local authority, 
[normal]coul
[normal]d not be subjected to a penalty. See here for details –

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold]              [bold]Discretionary Housing Payments[bold] [bold]&amp; DLA/PIP Entitlement[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]Th
[normal]e DWP made significant additional amounts of funding available to local authorities 
[normal]to make Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) available to those affected by the Under Occupation penalty and other changes to Housing Benefit/Local Housing Allowance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]The Guidance
[normal] issued by the DWP specifically recognized that disabled people were likely to be disproportionately affected by the penalty and that local authorities should therefore consider making DHPs where, for example, “additional” bedrooms were being used by partn
[normal]ers who could not share a bed with a disabled spouse.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]However it appears that disabled people have been placed in a “Catch 22” situation in regards to being granted a DHP by local authorities. On the one hand they have to prove that they are a disable
[normal]d person, in which case the local authority may ask for proof of entitlement to DLA or PIP.  But on the other when they prove said entitlement they are then told that they are not eligible for a DHP because they have additional funding that they can draw o
[normal]n to pay the Under Occupation penalty, namely the very same DLA or PIP benefits payments!
[normal]5.4
[normal]              
[normal]It should be pointed out that DLA is paid to disabled people to assist in meeting the additional costs associated with their disability. If it is already being us
[normal]ed for that purpose then it should surely not be counted by local authorities as disposable income available to the disabled person to meet the Under Occupation penalty. Yet that is exactly what has been happening.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]              
[normal]There does not seem to be a consis
[normal]tent approach across local authorities to a claimant having entitlement to DLA/PIP and their subsequent application for a DHP. The result is that severely impaired people having difficulty in paying their rent
[normal]              
[normal]are being denied support from the very funds s
[normal]et aside for that purpose.  This will inevitably result in severe financial pressure on households containing a disabled person who 
[normal]are 
[normal]affected by the ‘Bedroom Tax’, the very likely accumulation of rent arrears and the potential for, and reality, of evict
[normal]ions at some stage.   Needless to say the emotional stress that will be suffered by individuals and families will also be severe and has already led to incidents of suicide and self-harm.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6 
[normal]              
[normal]Inclusion Scotland believe that in taking DLA into account as 
[normal]disposable income for DHP purposes that local authorities are discriminating against disabled people as non-disabled people do not have access to DLA/PIP and are thus more likely to qualify for DHPs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.7
[normal]              
[normal]This same legal argument was advanced by a disable
[normal]d claimant in Glasgow and we note that the local authority then reviewed their DHP decision
[normal] (see here for details - 
[normal]http://disabilityrightsuk.org/news/2013
[normal]/june/discretionary-housing-payment-includes-dla
[normal])
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.8
[normal]              
[normal]However it is massively unfair that other disabled people within the same local authority area (and 
[normal]also in other authorities
[normal]) may still be being denied DHPs on the grounds that they are receiving 
[normal]DLA/PIP as no case law precedent was established that DLA should not be taken into account. This should be addressed by making DWP Guidance much more specific in calling for DLA/PIP payments to be disregarded by local authorities when considering whether t
[normal]o award DHPs.
