defaultInclusion Scotland (IS) is a national network of disabled peoples' organisations
default and individual disabled people funded by the Scottish Government. Inclusion Scotland’s main aim is to draw attention to the physical, social, economic, cultural and attitudinal barriers that affect disabled people’s everyday lives in Scotland.  
defaultInclusion 
defaultScotland’s membership 
defaultcollectively represents several thousand disabled people from throughout Scotland.  Welfare Reforms
default,
default and in particular changes to Housing Support
default,
default 
defaultcurrently 
defaultco
defaultnstitute the issue of greatest concern to our members.

defaultUnder-defaultoccupancy defaultpenaltydefault - “Bedroom Tax”default&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultScottish Government estimates that 95,000 Scottish households will be affected by the Bedroom Tax in the first year. In Scotland 79% of the households 
defaultexpected to be 
defaultaffected (76,000) contain a disabled person
default. They will lose an average of £13 pw in housing benefit. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough tenants are being penalised for under-occupying, there is a chronic shortage of 1-bedroom properties.  North Lanarkshire Council, the largest social landlord in Scotland, has 33,000 prope
defaultrties but as of July only 26 of those 
defaultproperties 
defaultcurrently available were single bedroom properties.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBy
default the end of May 2013
default 
defaulta Scottish Government survey of local authorities found that 
defaultthere were an estimated 82,500 households in Scotland incurring a red
defaultuction in their housing benefit because they were assessed as under occupying their property.
default 
defaultOf these households:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA research study 
defaultcarried out by 
defaultFalse Economy on behalf of the
default TUC 
defaultvia Freedom of Information requests 
defaultto local authorities 
defaultfound that Scottish tenants were disproportionately likely to have fallen into rent arrears because of the under-occupation penalty. 
defaultThe research showed that 
default8 out of the 20 local authorities that had the worst arrears problems were in Scotland.
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor example 
defaultin Clackmannanshire two-thirds of the tenants affected had fallen into arrears, which was second only to Barrow in Cumbria, 
defaultwhere
default three-quarters
default were in arrears
default.
default 
defaultA further 
default6
default Scottish local authorities reported that 
default40-50%
default of the tenants affecte
defaultd in their area had fallen into arrears. Unfortunately Glasgow
default, which has the highest number of tenants affected in any Scottish local authority area and also the highest levels of urban deprivation,
default 
defaultfailed to
default respond to the 
defaultFoI 
defaultrequest
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInclusion Scotla
defaultnd are concerned by the arrears levels uncovered by the TUC research
default as they represent the position only some 4 months since the Under-Occupation Penalty’s introduction
default and 
defaultextremely concerned that a large proportion of the tenants who are falling into arr
defaultears will be disabled people.
default&#xa0;
default2.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default It must be feared that the proportion of tenants 
default&amp; disabled people falling
default into arrears will only increase as time goes by and any financial resources that claimants initially had at the outset of the penalty being imposed 
defaultbecome stretched or entirely exhausted.  Moreover some tenants will have been eligible for Discretionary Housing Payments 
default(DHPs) 
defaultduring the first four months but these are 
defaultusually
default restricted to a 
default3 
defaultmonth maximum and so they too 
defaultare likely to
default fall into arre
defaultars 
defaultwhen their DHPs are withdrawn
default. 
default3default              defaultDisabled People &amp; the defaultThreat of Eviction:default&#xa0;default3.1
default              
defaultScottish Government’s Analytical Services Division have estimated
default the likely consequences of the introduction of the Under-Occupation Penalty. 
defaultThey estimated that 
default8,000 o
defaultf the households affected would move to smaller properties and thus manage to avoid the penalty whilst 
defaulthalf of th
defaulte remainder (43,000)
default would be able to maintain their rent payments
default and around half would fall into arrears
default.  
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultOf the half that fell into a
defaultrrears they believed that a quarter (i.e. nearly 11,000 households) would eventually be evicted. Given that 79% of the households affected contain at least one disabled person that might mean 8,000+ disabled people being evicted and becoming homeless.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultInclusion Scotland believe that these
default 
defaultnow look to be
default over-optimistic projection
defaults given the levels of arrears in some 
defaultScottish 
defaultauthorities 
defaultis 
defaultalready at or above this level after only 4 months. 
default 
defaultHowever
default the additional 
default£20 million in 
defaultfunding being made avai
defaultlable 
defaultby Scottish Government 
defaultto Local Authorities to bolster DHP Budgets 
defaultshould
default have an impact in reducing 
defaultthe rate at which tenants are falling into arrears and thus being evicted.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultNevertheless Inclusion Scotland believes that disabled people will be
default amongst those least able to continue to meet their rent payments.  This is because the Under-Occupation Penalty has not been introduced in a vacuum but in a context where other benefits paid to sick and disabled people are being cut. Thus the cumulative i
defaultmpact of other welfare reforms will have an impact on their financial resilience and therefore their ability to meet increased rent payments.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultAccording to the Sheffield Hallam University research
default approximately 100,000 
defaultScots 
defaultdisabled people will be moved off Employment Support Allowance (ESA) 
defaultby 2015 
defaulteither because they exhaust their entitlement to contributory ESA or because they are re-classified as fully fit for work after a Work Capability Assessment (WCA). 
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultGiven th
defaulte planned 20% budget reduction which the DWP is planning to achieve there will also be significant numbers (thousands at least) of disabled people on the Mobility Components and Care elements of DLA who will have to lose entitlement to the PIP to make the 
defaultnecessary savings.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultUsing the DWP’s own projections, by 2018, IS estimates that over 
default80,000default working age disabled people in Scotland will lose either some or all of the
default 
defaultmobility allowance that they would otherwise have been entitled to
default if DLA entitlement criteria had continued to be used
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.8default              defaultCare component:  defaultIn addition because of the introduction of PIP –
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default 
default      
defaultHowever overall nearly 
default90,000default fewer disabled peop
defaultle in Scotland
default will qualify for 
defaultassistance with their care needs/daily living costs that they would otherwise have been entitled to under DLA eligibility criteria. 
default&#xa0;
default3.10
default              
defaultThus far, the DWP has 
defaultrefused to conduct
default 
defaulta Cumulative Impact  A
defaultssessment due to what it argue
defaults are
default the difficulties in model
defaulting ‘behaviour effects’. However, using the DWP’s own figures in relation to the benefits disabled people received, 
defaultInclusion Scotland
default have been able to calculate that working age disabled people who are 40+ will be 
defaultdisproportiona
defaulttely affected by reforms to Employment &amp; Support Allowance, the replacement of Disability Living Allowance by the Personal Independence Payment and the Under-Occupation Penalty
default. Thus - 
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is also 
defaultvery likely that there will be a significant overlap between these groups of disabled claimants (e.g. ESA and DLA Lower Rate Care recipients) as both groups have large cohorts of people with learning difficulties and/or mental health issues/cognitive impai
defaultrments (e.g. autism spectrum disorder). 
defaultThus 40% of c
defaultlaimants who have already 
defaultlost entitlement to Employment and Support Allowance have learning difficulties
default 
default/mental health issues whilst over 30% of those currently on DLA Lower Rate Care also have these i
defaultmpairments.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.12
default              
defaultResearch carried out by Demos on behalf of Scope
default confirms that a substantial proportion of disabled people will experience multiple cuts in their entitlement to benefits. The research suggests that across the UK 120,000 disabled people 
defaultwill experience at least a triple loss of benefits by 2018 with 99,000 experiencing a quadruple cut. 
defaultThe personal benefit 
defaultlosses will range from 
defaulta minimum of 
default£6,300 
defaultto 
default£23,461 
defaultper person by 2017.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.13
default              
defaultResearch by the Scottish Public Health Observatory
default shows that 72,660 people were in receipt of three key benefits (Income Support/Pension Credit, Incapacity Benefit/Employment and Support Allowance/Severe Disablement Allowance, and Disability Living Allowance)
default affected by cuts
default, and 226,520 were in receipt
default of at least two of the key benefits.
default&#xa0;
default3.14
default      
defaultThus we think it safe to conclude that many of those losing ESA and/or other disability benefits (e.g. via the introduction of PIP
default and changes to ESA entitlement
default) will 
defaultalso be penalis
defaulted
default under the Under-Occupation regulations.  This means that they will already or in the future suffer substantial losses to their household incomes making it more likely that they will be unable to maintain 
defaulttheir 
defaultrent payments and thus also more likely to ev
defaultentually be evicted.

defaultExemptionsdefault to the Under Occupation Ruledefault&#xa0;default4.1
default              
defaultInclusion Scotland believes that current exemptions to the Under Occupation rule are inconsistent with established case law, wider equality law and disabled people’s human rights. They are
default also being inconsistently applied by local authorities and Registered Social Landlords.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultSince the Court of Appeal judgment in 
defaultGorry V Department of Work and Pensions
default local authorities 
defaulthave received guidance from the DWP to allow an extra bedroom for 
defaultchildren who are unable to share because of their severe disabilities.
default  
defaultHowever no such exemption has been put in place for adult partners unable, or unwilling, to share a bed because of one
default,
default or both
default’
defaults
default,
default severe impairments.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.
default3
default              
defaultWe believe that this failure to exempt couple’s unable to share a bed is inconsistent with established case law, with equalities law which states that disabled people should not be treated less favourably than non-disabled people  (as it could result in di
defaultsabled people’s health and safety being jeopardised) and with disabled people’s right, under the Human Rights Act and Article 8 of the European Convention, to a ‘home and family life’.   
default&#xa0;
default4.4     Inclusion Scotland
default believe that it is a totally unwarranted
default intrusion into the private lives of disabled people, and their partners, for the state to insist that they sleep in the same bed on pain of suffering a reduction to their housing benefit and that an exemption should be granted on these grounds forthwith.
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default 
default              
defaultInclusion Scotland also believes that an exemption should exist for sick and disabled people who use one of their rooms to store equipment or other items associated with supporting them to live with their condition or impairment. For example a room u
defaultsed to store a kidney dialysis machine is patently not being used as a bedroom and should not therefore be treated as one. 
default 
defaultA case (Lall v Westminster Council) on this very same  legal point was decided in favour of the claimant by a Lower Tier Tribunal ju
defaultdge. See here for details –

default 
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default              
defaultW
defaulte view the failure to provide such an exemption as jeopardising sick and disabled people’s health and ability to live independently. As only disabled people have an essential need for additional rooms
default (that
default is not shared by non-disabled people
default)
default we believe
default 
defaultthat the Under-occupation penalty is
default 
defaulta breach of equality law which prohibits being treated differently on the grounds of disability
default and of Article 14 of the ECHR
default.
default 
defaultThis was also the view of a Lower Tier Tribunal judge in Glasgow in an as yet unreported

default4.7
default 
default              
defaultThere have also been a number of
default rulings in a Fife Lower Tier Tribunal on whether rooms can be treated as “bedrooms” for Under-occupation penalty purposes.  The judge in these cases ruled that rooms under 70 sq. feet in area could not be treated as bedrooms
default for use by adults and
default that exempt accommodation

default where care and support was being provided by a Housing Association

default5default              defaultDiscretionary Housing Paymentsdefault default&amp; DLA/PIP Entitlementdefault&#xa0;default5.1
default              
defaultTh
defaulte DWP made significant additional amounts of funding available to local authorities 
defaultto make Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) available to those affected by the Under Occupation penalty and other changes to Housing Benefit/Local Housing Allowance. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultThe Guidance
default issued by the DWP specifically recognized that disabled people were likely to be disproportionately affected by the penalty and that local authorities should therefore consider making DHPs where, for example, “additional” bedrooms were being used by partn
defaulters who could not share a bed with a disabled spouse.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultHowever it appears that disabled people have been placed in a “Catch 22” situation in regards to being granted a DHP by local authorities. On the one hand they have to prove that they are a disable
defaultd person, in which case the local authority may ask for proof of entitlement to DLA or PIP.  But on the other when they prove said entitlement they are then told that they are not eligible for a DHP because they have additional funding that they can draw o
defaultn to pay the Under Occupation penalty, namely the very same DLA or PIP benefits payments!
default5.4
default              
defaultIt should be pointed out that DLA is paid to disabled people to assist in meeting the additional costs associated with their disability. If it is already being us
defaulted for that purpose then it should surely not be counted by local authorities as disposable income available to the disabled person to meet the Under Occupation penalty. Yet that is exactly what has been happening.  
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default              
defaultThere does not seem to be a consis
defaulttent approach across local authorities to a claimant having entitlement to DLA/PIP and their subsequent application for a DHP. The result is that severely impaired people having difficulty in paying their rent
default              
defaultare being denied support from the very funds s
defaultet aside for that purpose.  This will inevitably result in severe financial pressure on households containing a disabled person who 
defaultare 
defaultaffected by the ‘Bedroom Tax’, the very likely accumulation of rent arrears and the potential for, and reality, of evict
defaultions at some stage.   Needless to say the emotional stress that will be suffered by individuals and families will also be severe and has already led to incidents of suicide and self-harm.
default&#xa0;
default5.6 
default              
defaultInclusion Scotland believe that in taking DLA into account as 
defaultdisposable income for DHP purposes that local authorities are discriminating against disabled people as non-disabled people do not have access to DLA/PIP and are thus more likely to qualify for DHPs. 
default&#xa0;
default5.7
default              
defaultThis same legal argument was advanced by a disable
defaultd claimant in Glasgow and we note that the local authority then reviewed their DHP decision
default (see here for details - 
defaulthttp://disabilityrightsuk.org/news/2013
default/june/discretionary-housing-payment-includes-dla
default)
default&#xa0;
default5.8
default              
defaultHowever it is massively unfair that other disabled people within the same local authority area (and 
defaultalso in other authorities
default) may still be being denied DHPs on the grounds that they are receiving 
defaultDLA/PIP as no case law precedent was established that DLA should not be taken into account. This should be addressed by making DWP Guidance much more specific in calling for DLA/PIP payments to be disregarded by local authorities when considering whether t
defaulto award DHPs.
