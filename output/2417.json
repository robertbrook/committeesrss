"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dudley Friend Clayson [OLS0028]&#xa0;\nI write as an independent &amp; individual contributor of evidence to this Inquiry.\nI am t\nhe retired Chief Executive of \na\n company\n supplying UK industry with\n \npackaging\n \nmachinery &amp; consumables.\n  My wife is a retired doctor.\n  Our evidence will cover the following issues:\n1. How\n did \nwe\n cope? \n \nMy wife &amp; I raised our family of four children without a computer in our \nhome\n.  As practising Christians we could \nnot\n, with a \ngood conscience, \nexpose\n our children to the possibility of coming in contact with the poison of adult pornographic material, which is\n morally destructive in its consequences\n \nand “utterly\n \nwithout redeeming social value” (1966 Supreme Court \nruling in the obs\ncenity case re. \nFanny Hill,\n defining pornographic material).\n \n2. Our\n children are now married, and have\n their own families.  Both they and we\n all\n now have computers in our homes \nwhich are effectively \nfiltered\n \nto\n eliminate any possibility of inadverte\nnt contact with \nadult material \nby anyone in the household.\n3. Implicit\n in\n this Inquiry is the Government’s acknowledgement that the exposure of minors to adult material is harmful.\n  Such exposure entails \ngrave\n consequences for the child, the family and for\n society at large.  We are now seeing the social norms &amp; stabilising values which have underpinned our\n customary\n way of life in this country being threatened by the emergence of a juvenile generation whose attitudes in respect of sexual \ngratification\n, sexu\nal crime, violence, promiscuity and marri\nage are being distorted\n &amp; perverted by exposure to online pornography.   Sadly we have had\n some\n first\n-\n hand experience \nof damage to just a very few of \nthe\n young people in our church who have temporarily\n had contact \nwith\n this depraved material.  It has required ongoing pastoral care &amp; counselling to help them\n to get\n through the moral distress and mental disturbance resulting from this\n exposure.  Pornography leaves a scarring in the\n mind\n.  We trust that the effects wil\nl be short-term; but for some it could be a lifelong trauma. \n4. It\n is heartening to see that Government is working with internet providers\n to put in place measures which will effectively protect minors from easy &amp; instant access to adult material.  The Pr\nime Minister himself has given an undertaking that pornography will be \nautomatically\n blocked on \nnew\n broadband\n internet accounts, leaving viewers with the option to remove the filter if they so \ndecide\n.  Mr Cameron has also made a commitme\nnt in respect of ex\nisting user\ns: the principal internet providers will have an o\nbligation to contact customers \nwith an “unav\noidable decision about whether \nor not to install family friendly \ncontent\n filters”.  He has \nindicated\n this will happen by end-2014.\n  OFCOM will be responsible for implementation of these measures.  The Prime Minister has promised to take further action if, following these \nsteps\n, there is evidence that children are still not being effectively protected.  We welcome his robust stance on\n this issue, which will mean that the many \nparents\n who \nwould like\n to be prompted or reminded  will get that reminder and will be shown \nvery\n clearly how to put on family friendly filters\n. \nThis is a positive move and a valuable commitment at the highest lev\nel in Government.\n5. \nOFCOM\n \nshould prioritise regulat\nion of social media, such as Facebook, and chatrooms, where the content is not \ninfrequently\n pornographic. \nOFCOM \nmust\n ensure that the regulation &amp; m\nonitoring of these sites are significantly\n upgraded, \nwit\nh mandatory training \n&amp; compliance regimes put in place. \nSocial\n media should be placed under specific obligation to delete offensive \nmaterial\n swiftly \nwhenever\n a \nviewer\n complaint is \nreceived\n. This is in essence a Health &amp; Safety legislation issue and every o\nther industry in which I \nhave\n been active has been subject to\n the\n strict\nest\n compliance with HSE.  The internet should be \nno\n exception.\n6. OFCOM should recognise that social media are exploited by paedophiles, prostitutes and sex traffickers\n and should \ncrea\nte\n an \nappropriately\n strong regulatory framework to block these criminal and anti-\nsocial\n abuses of \nthe\n internet. \nOFCOM should also require social networking sites to implement effective &amp; inescapable age verification checks to \nprevent\n minors accessing inap\npropriate material.\n7. The \ninternet\n industry should\n devote resources to\n develop technology to \nprevent\n the covert and currently uncontrollable \ncirculation of adult \nmaterial \nwithin minors\n’ peer groups\n (such as school friend communities).\nIn \nconclusion, we \nare grateful for\n this Inquiry\n.  The current situation is dire, with a reported 81% of 14-16 year \nolds\n having already accessed \npornographic material on\nline.  W\ne\n believe that &lt; 50% of UK families currently \nhave\n family friendly content filters in their home c\nomputers. The \nGovernment’s\n commitments in response to this\n situation are\n encouraging.  We and a wide circle of our friends in th\nis country will be scrutinising progress and\n developments \nclosely.  \nWe are ver\ny deeply concerned that the situation is\n rapidly\n \nbrought under effective, ongoing control\n—\nfor the sake of \ne\nvery young person and child in this country.\n \nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
