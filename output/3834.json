"&#xa0;\nSupplementary evidence from the Ministry of Justice&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEvidence session follow-up&#xa0;\nFollowing the oral evidence session on 5 November I \nam \npleased to provide additional information on the following topics\n \nas requested\n by the Committee. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI have spoken to colleagues in \nGuernsey\n and the Department for Transport \n(DfT) \nand \nit is \napparent\n that consultation on this issue\n is ongoing\n. \nIn recent years the \nOverseas\n \nTerritories\n and \nCrown Dependencies\n have become increasingly interested\n in the establishment of aircraft registers, or expanding existing aircraft registers, to target the offshore market.\n&#xa0;\n While \nthe DfT had\n previously advi\nsed\n the Overseas Territories and \nCrown Dependencies\n \non \nwhat is required if they run offshore registers, in light of increas\ning\n interest \nthey decided that they\n should make a definitive statement of \nthe UK’s\n policy in this area.\n&#xa0;\n \nThe \nOverseas\n \nTerritories\n and \nCrown Dependencies\n were fully consulted \nd\nuring the development of this policy\n. Th\ne\n \nconsultation with the \nCrown Dependencies\n was \nconducted\n through their Directors of Civil Aviation.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nEarlier this year \nGuernsey\n obtained quotes for insurance to meet the cost\ns\n of investigating accidents involving aircraft on their register in circumstances where the obligation to \ninvestigate\n would fall\n to\n the state of registry of the aircraft.\n&#xa0;\n Such costs arise \nmainly \nfrom the need to recover wreckage from the high seas.\n&#xa0;\n \nGuernsey\n also sought quotes for insurance against the cost\ns of\n investigating accidents occurring in \nGuernsey\n and its territorial waters.\n&#xa0;\n The insurance quotes they received in respect of accidents involving aircraft on the Guernsey register were reasonable\n,\n but those for accidents occurring within \nGuernsey\n were prohibitively expensive.\n&#xa0;\nGuernsey then queried whether \nthe \nUK\n was\n expecting them to pay for the cost\ns of investigating\n accidents in \nGuernsey\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nDfT\n advised them that the new \nGovernment \npolicy only covered accidents involving aircraft on the \nregisters of the \nOverseas\n \nTerritories\n and \nCrown Dependencies\n.\n&#xa0;\n However, \nDfT\n also s\ntated\n that it seemed reasonable \nfor\n such costs \nto\n be met by Guernsey rather than the \nUK\n taxpayer\n. \nT\nhe UK Air Accident’s Investigation Branch is legally responsible for carry out the investigations under \nUK\n legislation extended to Guernsey, there does not appear to be any agreement on who should meet wreckage recovery or other costs arising from an accident in \nGuernsey\n.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, f\nollowing further consideration \nand consultation with the \nCrown Dependencies\n,\n DfT\n now \nconsider\n that it would be unreasonable to expect an \nOverseas Territor\ny\n or\n Crown Dependenc\ny\n \nto pick up the (potentially very high) costs of \ninvestigating an \naccident\n \nin their waters. \nG\niven the very low likelihood of such an event\n and the high premiums, DfT’s view is that \nit \nwould be\n unreasonable for the\n \nIslands\n to purchase\n insurance. \nDfT\n are therefore \nexploring \nthe \noption of \naccepting responsibility for these costs in the unlikely event of an accident occurring within the territorial waters \nof \nan \nOverseas\n \nTerritor\ny\n \nor \nCrown Dependenc\ny\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe would expect Government Departments and the \nCrown Dependencies\n to work together to resolve any disagreements as to issues between themselves. Where an internal resolution is not possible, M\no\nJ officials are able to act as a point of reference on constitutional issues\n. \nWe do recognise that there are times where external support is necessary to resolve the issue and we deal with these on a case by case basis to ensure that the most appropriate part of the UK Government is able to offer assistance. \n&#xa0;\nThe Cabinet Office has never been the only po\nr\nt of call for dealing with constitutional issues.  However, we have in the past\n sought the views of \nthe Cabinet Office European lawyers\n on issues regarding the interpretation of EU Law\n. There may be times when other legal input is more appropriate.\n&#xa0;\nThe issue referred to the Committee by officials in Guernsey concerns whether Customs and Excise legislation has preserved certain historic functions in relation to the \nChannel Islands\n, and if so whether this would provide a basis for a current data-sharing “gateway”.  In this specific instance referred to by \nGuernsey\n we \nhave considered, with Cabinet Office and other officials, \nthe best way of obtaining clarification on the legal position and – more importantly – how to resolve the issue\n. \nAs\n th\nis particular \nmatter concerns the interpretation of a piece of HMRC legislation\n,\n we consider that \nthe best \na\npproach \nto resolving the issue is for \nMoJ officials \nto\n continue to engage with HMRC and Guernsey and facilitate discussions between the\nm\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe \nMoJ’s \nCrown Dependencies team consists of four policy officials. The team is supplemented by three lawyers who work on the Crown Dependencies and other policy areas. \n&#xa0;\nIf there are any other area\ns\n on which you would like further information, please do get in touch. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;18 November 2013\n&#xa0;"
