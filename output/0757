[normal]Delivering better services for people with [bold]long term conditions ([bold]LTC[bold])[bold] – getting on with it![bold]&#xa0;[bold]The aim of the current initiative is to bring together all the expertise across the ‘LTC Landscape’ (a coalition of the willing) around [bold]a Delivery S[bold]ystem as a starting point for comprehensive change; led by the people involved (service users, policy makers, academics, practitioners, Colleges, trainers, service providers etc)[bold] and [bold]offering those ‘on high’ a chance to help to make it happen more easily. [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Back ground[bold]Chronic diseases are now the commonest cause of death and disability in England and people who live with 
[normal]long term conditions (LTCs)
[normal] are the biggest uses of services and g
[normal]reatest generator of costs. It is now recognised
[normal] that the care and support needed to live with a LTC is fundamentally different to that for acute episodic conditions, and 
[normal]that this will 
[normal]require services
[normal] for people with long-
[normal]term
[normal] 
[normal]conditions
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]be 
[normal]radically
[normal] redesigned
[normal]. However, despite 
[normal]exhortation from people who live with LTCs, 
[normal]consistent health policy, a robust evidence base and a compelling economic case, progress 
[normal]on the ground has been painfully slow with little improvement over the last 10 years.

[normal]any of the 
[normal]elements
[normal] 
[normal]needed
[normal] to 
[normal]support change
[normal] in England have been developed, drawing on international best 
[normal]practice
[normal], but they 
[normal]remain
[normal] fragmented. Top down 
[normal]exhortation
[normal] and targets have failed to influence change and clinical behaviour at the grassroots. The missing 
[normal]component

[normal] robust

[normal] 
[normal]reproducible
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]transferable
[normal] 
[normal]delivery system
[normal] developed by practitioners
[normal] and service 
[normal]users in
[normal] England 
[normal]is now available

[normal]Key issues [bold]The Delivery S
[normal]ystem is described below. 
[normal]Some of the k
[normal]ey issues 
[normal]it addresses 
[normal]include:
[normal]The [bold]coordinated [bold]delivery [bold]system[bold] for Long terms conditions[bold]The delivery system provides a 
[normal]robust
[normal], 
[normal]systematic and reproducible approach, transferable to any setting and for people with any single or multiple LTCs, 
[normal]including multi morbidity 
[normal]which ensures that each person receives a uniquely personalised service bringing together support for self management with high quality clinical and social care, delivered in a systematic, coordinated and high quality manner. 
[normal]The 
[normal]two part delivery 
[normal]system includes a 
[normal]guide to the components[bold] and a 
[normal]quality assured approach to implementation[bold]The 
[normal]components 
[normal]Care planning [bold]Implementation[bold]The delivery system invites local services to work through the ‘house’ for the particular health / social care setting relevant
[normal] to their particular population, ensuring that attitudes, skills and infrastructure are all addressed together
[normal] 
[normal]by using a 
[normal]quality assured approach[bold] leading to culture and system change. 
[normal]Importantly, the care planning consultation is in the centre of the house; local services need to
[normal] ensure that all of the element
[normal]s of the house are reliably in place for every care planning consultation.
[normal]This will involve: 
[normal]Alf Collins, Simon Eaton, Jim Phillips, Sue Roberts: with t
[normal]hanks to 
[normal]all
[normal] those who have contributed

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Social prescribing is an ‘unfortunate’ 
[normal]term in
[normal] common use for referral to non traditional community services to support self management such as exercise ‘on prescription’.
