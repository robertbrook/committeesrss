defaultDelivering better services for people with defaultlong term conditions (defaultLTCdefault)default – getting on with it!default&#xa0;defaultThe aim of the current initiative is to bring together all the expertise across the ‘LTC Landscape’ (a coalition of the willing) around defaulta Delivery Sdefaultystem as a starting point for comprehensive change; led by the people involved (service users, policy makers, academics, practitioners, Colleges, trainers, service providers etc)default and defaultoffering those ‘on high’ a chance to help to make it happen more easily. default&#xa0;
defaultBack grounddefaultChronic diseases are now the commonest cause of death and disability in England and people who live with 
defaultlong term conditions (LTCs)
default are the biggest uses of services and g
defaultreatest generator of costs. It is now recognised
default that the care and support needed to live with a LTC is fundamentally different to that for acute episodic conditions, and 
defaultthat this will

defaultexhortation from people who live with LTCs, 
defaultconsistent health policy, a robust evidence base and a compelling economic case, progress 
defaulton the ground has been painfully slow with little improvement over the last 10 years.

defaultinclude:
defaultThe defaultcoordinated defaultdelivery defaultsystemdefault for Long terms conditionsdefaultThe delivery system provides a 
defaultrobust
default, 
defaultsystematic and reproducible approach, transferable to any setting and for people with any single or multiple LTCs, 
defaultincluding multi morbidity 
defaultwhich ensures that each person receives a uniquely personalised service bringing together support for self management with high quality clinical and social care, delivered in a systematic, coordinated and high quality manner. 
defaultThe

defaultCare planning defaultImplementationdefaultThe delivery system invites local services to work through the ‘house’ for the particular health / social care setting relevant
default to their particular population, ensuring that attitudes, skills and infrastructure are all addressed together
default 
defaultby using a 
defaultquality assured approachdefault leading to culture and system change. 
defaultImportantly, the care planning consultation is in the centre of the house; local services need to
default ensure that all of the element
defaults of the house are reliably in place for every care planning consultation.
