You are extremely welcome. \nI \ndo not \nthink Mr Rouse has been before—you are very welcome—\nbut others have\n,\n so they probably do not need an introduction. \nI \nwould like, if \nI \nmay, to open \nthe \nquestioning by referring to some evidence John Appleby from \nthe \nKing\n’\ns Fund gave us when he came to talk about public ex\npenditure in health. He said: “…\nthe \nreal \nissue is not about saving money…\nbut what you spend that money on.\n”\n That is where \nI \nwant to open \nthe \ndiscussion\n,\n because\n,\n whenever we talk about rising trend\ns of demand for health and care and \nthe \nr\nesource constraints that exist, \nthere is a sort of orthodoxy these days that demand grows by 4% per annum\n—t\nhat is a total\n—and \nthat somehow we have \nto meet that growth of demand.\nThe \nproposition \nI \nwant to open with is t\nhat it is not just about totals; it\n is al\nso about who is in that demand and \nwhat \nis \nthe \nchanging nature of \nthe \ndemand that is going to be placed upon \nthe \nsystem in \nthe \nprojected period to 2020 that NHS England \nare\n now \ntalking about.\n \nI \nwould be grateful if you could tell \nthe \nCommittee what work is being done either within \nthe \nDepartment of Health or within NHS England to understand \nthe \nchanging shape of demand and\n,\n therefore\n,\n by implication of course\n,\n \nthe \nchanging nature of \nthe \nservices that \nthe \nsystem is going to have to provide.\nMr Hunt: \nThis is \nthe \ncentral debate and \nthe \ndiscussion that we need to have if we are going to secure a long\n&#x2011;\nterm sustainable future for \nthe \nNHS\n,\n which is \nwhat everyone wants. \nI \nhave been doing \nthe \njob for just over a year\n, and my own view \nis that\n,\n because of Mid Staffordshire and Francis, inevitably \nthe \nnational spotlight has been on hospital care and how we deliver hospital services, but \nI \nthink \na much more fundamental issue that we have to wrestle with is out\n&#x2011;\nof\n&#x2011;\nhospital\n care. That 4% figure is not fixed. If we spend our money more wisely, \nand \nin particular move to prevention rather than simply thinking about cure, we have a chance to reduce that demand growth, but of course that is not a novel thing to say. People have been s\naying that for a very long time\n and so we have been doing a lot of thinking about what needs to happen\n.\n NHS England are developing a primary care strategy and \nI \nwork very closely with them on \nthe \nnew GP contract\n,\n which is \nthe \nfirst step\n—\nbut only \nthe \nfirst step\n—\nin that process. \nThere are still significant efficiency savings that can be found throughout \nthe \nsystem\n—and we can talk about those—\nbut in \nthe \nend we need to think about \nthe \nnature of services we provide\n.\n \nThe \nvery big and challenging question, which we have not really had a public debate on in \nthe \nway that we should, is how we maintain and improve \nthe \nlevels of service offered by hospitals at \nthe \nsame time as transferring more resources into out\n&#x2011;\nof\n&#x2011;\nhospital\n care.\nQ240 &#xa0; \nChair: \nBut is there not a \ntrap\n always in thinking about what this means for hospitals\n,\n GPs or pharmacists\n,\n rather than, as we were saying in \nthe \ndebate yesterday on \nthe \nCare Bill, starting with \nthe \npatient and identifying what morbidities \nthe \npatients of \nthe \nfuture will suffer from\n,\n \nand \nhow \nthe \nsystem meets the\nir\n&#xa0;\nneed\ns\n and reflects \nthe \nchanging nature of demand, so that it is not national, global numbers, \nbut within a locality? H\now many people in this area are going to suffer from diabetes\n or from dementia? \nWhat are w\ne going to do to risk-\nstratify in this community\n,\n to meet \nthe \ndemands placed on \nthe \nservices in this community? Can \nI \npush you on \nthe \nextent to which there is real research being done\n,\n rather than assumptions being made\n,\n to inform \nthe \npolicy\n&#x2011;\nmaking\n process, otherwise we shall be here in two or three years\n’\n time saying, \n“\nWe ran out of money\n”\n? \nMr Hunt: \nYes, it is \nthe \nright thing to push me on. \nI \nam sure we can do more, but we are doing a lot already, and particularly through Public Health \nEngland\n,\n \nwith \nwh\nich \nI \nhad a meeting \nthis morning. \nWe need to address one of \nthe \ncentral challenges \nwith out\n&#x2011;\nof\n&#x2011;\nhospital care\n,\n which is where \nthe \naccountability line lies. When you have frail elderly people or disabled children with complex long\n&#x2011;\nterm conditions, it is not always clear where \nthe \nbuck stops in \nthe \nNHS\n.\n \nT\nhat is something that we need to address if we are going to make sure that they get \nthe \nwrap\n-\naround care they need\n,\n which\n,\n in turn\n,\n will minimise their hospital bills and mean that they get \nthe \nbest care they possibly can. \nBut there is another responsibility as well\n,\n which is \nthe \nresponsibility for people who are healthy\n,\n who\nm\n we want to stay healthy\n,\n who\nm\n we do not want to get di\nabetes or \ndevelop other long\n&#x2011;\nterm conditions until \nthe \nlast possible moment. \nO\nne of \nthe \nthings \nwe are looking at is population-\nlevel health statistics \nheld by GP practices—\nfor example, whether it is possible to track by GP practice \nthe \nnumber of cancers that are diagnosed at a late stage rather than an early stage and what\n more can be done. You, Chair\n, talk a lot about integration. \nI \nam not sure that we are integrated enough between \nthe \nactivities of Public Health \nEngland\n, who are responsible, for example, for health checks\n,\n and GP surgeries, who have a responsibility for early diagnosis as well.\nQ241 &#xa0; \nChair: \nI \nwill \nhave\n one final shot and then \nI \nshall go to Sarah. If people are going to understand in their local community \nthe \nneed for services to change, surely step one of that process is to show that\n,\n in a loc\nality, not just \nthe \nGP services\n but \nthe \nwhole\n health and wellbeing structure\n are asking themselves questions about what demand is going to look like two, three or five years out and create a narrative around what these individuals living in that community are going to need to enjoy a fuller life in five or 10 years\n’ time, and \ne\nxplain it at a personal level. \nUntil that exists, they will not accept \nthe \nneed to change \nthe \nservices that they have inherited and trust.\nMr Hunt: \nYes\n, and\n perhaps \nI \nwill ask Sir David to come in on that point as well because he has done a lot o\nf thinking about service change;\n but \nI \nagree with that. There is one encouraging example where that did happen\n,\n and that is \nthe \nreconfiguration for north\n&#x2011;\nwest London, which \nI \nthink, in \nthe \nend, turned out to be a lot less controversial than people thought it would \nbe \nprecisely because it was locally led\n,\n and local commissioners\n—\nlocal GPs\n,\n in particular\n—\nwere able to make that very case to their local populations and were able to pres\nent \nthe \nup\nside of \nthe \nchanges very clearly to go alongside any of \nthe \nchanges that people \nmight have been concerned about,\n \nbut i\nn particular \nthe \nfact that part of that package is seven\n&#x2011;\nday\n GP surgery opening, which \nI \nthink people could immediately relate to as something they would benefit from.\nSir David Nicholson: Underpinning this—and \nwithout boring you to death with pr\nocess, which \nI \nknow can happen—\nis that it is at \nthe \nheart of that planning process that we kicked off today, as far as NHS England is concerned, in \nthe \nsense that, for \nthe \nfirst time, we are saying to every CCG that they need to come up with what their services \nwill\n look like in five years\n’\n time. That sounds relatively trivial at one level, but it is quite a significant issue when you think about how you have to build that understanding on both what \nthe \npopulation \nis\n saying but also on a joint strategic needs assessment over a significant period. Out of that will come a whole set of issues around local demand that we do not really understand at \nthe \nmoment\n but we will get out of that\n. \nI \nthink \nwe have \nthe \nbeginnings of a process to enable us to do that in \nthe \nplanning that we did today.\nQ242 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: \nI \nstate for \nthe \nrecord that \nI \nam married to \na \nforensic psychiatrist\n,\n who works full time in \nthe \nNHS. \nMy question is about \nthe \nshift that everyone recognises needs to go into community services\n,\n and particularly into areas like parity of esteem for mental health. Could \nthe \npanel comment on how we are going to establish parity of esteem for mental health\n,\n when in fact \nthe \nfunding is going in \nthe \nother direction in that \nthe \nhospital acute sector is still \nhoovering\n up \nthe \nvast majority and increasing its share of total spend in \nthe \nNHS?\nMr Hunt: \nI \nwill make a brief comment and then hand over to Jon Rouse to add to it, if \nI \nmay. This is a problem that, at its heart, is caused by \nthe \nfact that we have an 18\n&#x2011;\nweek waiting time target for physical health but no equivalent target for access to mental health. Unintentionally\n, because \nI \nam sure this was never intended\n, \nthat has tended to suck money into \nthe \narea where people are being measured and highly accountable in a public way and away from mental health\n.\n \nW\ne have seen \nthe \nconsequences of that in additional winter pressures over \nthe \nabsence of easily accessible psychiatric liaison services, for example. \nI\nn \nthe \nnew mandate we \nhave \ncommitted ourselves to working towards fully costing out a mental health waiting times target in \nthe \nnext few months. Jon, do you want to add to that?\nJon Rouse: \nYes\n. You have to tackle this in a multi\nfaceted\n way\n. Some of \nthe \nthings we ha\nve to focus on are as follows. The first is\n information. We have a lot of information on mental health that is not properly analysed, understood and disseminated to commissioners in a usable form so that they can drive service improvement. Secondly, it is about commissioning itself\n,\n and NHS England and Sir David may want to say more about this as they are do\ning a lot of work through \nthe \nCommissioning A\nssembly and \nthe \nacademic networks to be able to improve \nthe \nquality of local commissioning for mental health services. Thirdly, it is about standards themselves\n,\n and we now have a proper outcomes framework for challenging localities for progress on mental health. Finally\n, \nand \nI \nsuppose it is a bit more philosophical\n, \nprobably \nthe \nmodel of provision for mental health over ma\nny years has become over\n&#x2011;\nclinici\nsed\n and we have to get a better balanc\ne between social and clinical. \nThere is a big role for social work within that.\nQ243 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: \nCan \nI \ncome back on one very serious issue\n,\n \nwhich is \nsection 136 and detentions\n?\n In \nthe \nDevon and \nCornwall\n police area\n,\n 25 children so far this year have been detained in cells instead of in an appropriate place of safety. Some of those children were as young as 12 and 13. That is an example of a gross situation where there is no parity of esteem. It would be unthinkable for a child with a broken leg to be waiting in a police cell for an assessment\n.\n \nCan\n \nthe \npanel reassure us that that will not be happening next year?\nJon Rouse: It is certainly unacceptable; t\nhat is \nthe \nfirst thing to say. The\n&#xa0;\ngood news is that there has been a reduction overall in \nthe \nnumbers of people who are having to be detai\nned in police cells, and clearly\n we want to have as many people as possible in clinical settings when they are being assessed. One of \nthe \nthings we have been working on over \nthe \na\nutumn is \nthe \ndevelopment of a \ncrisis care concordat\n,\n which has brought together a whole range of organisations, including NHS England, \nthe \npolice, \nthe \nambulance service and \nthe \ncourts service\n,\n to review from first principles how crisis care should work from pre\n&#x2011;\ncrisis\n—\nbecause often with people who have long\n&#x2011;\nstanding mental health conditions you can plan for crisis\n—\nright through to recovery from crisis. We are probably about a month away from being in a position to publish that document\n,\n and that will hold \nthe \nwhole system mutu\nally to account for progress. \nFinally, \nand again Sir David m\nay want to say more about this, \nBruce Keogh\n’\ns review of urgent care is crucial here to make sure that \nthe \npathways that are defined work for people with mental health condit\nions as well as physical health conditions—\nand, of course, where they have both physical and mental health issues.\nQ244 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nCan \nI \nask how you \nthink\n \nthe \n“\nany qualified provider\n” \nsystem is going to help you achieve efficiency gains? CCGs have inherited \nthe \ndecisions of their predecessor PCTs\n,\n who were forced, or required, to commit themselves to a number of contracts under AQP\n. A\ncross \nthe \ncountry, not just in my own area, t\nhis has resulted in, for example, a high\n&#x2011;\nstreet\n optician—\na well\n&#x2011;\nknown name\n—\nproviding hearing aids, \nand\n \nI \nam sure you know of that particular system. \nI\nt has left \nthe \nCCG with \nan impossible-to-\nmanage budget\n,\n which has \nno upper limit, so long as p\natients can be driven in through \nthe \nfront door of this particula\nr high\n&#x2011;\nstreet\n provider and \nthe \nprovider\n will follow human nature or \nthe \ncommercial rationale of doing everything they can to attract them in, in \nthe \nproper manner and within \nthe \nrules, of course. \nHow does that system help \nthe \nGovernment achieve their efficiency gain\n, \nwhat monitoring are you undertaking\n,\n and, if you are monitoring it, what decisions are you making with regard to h\now \nyou are going to roll it out\n or\n,\n indeed\n,\n not roll it out any further because it is not providing you with a means by which you can achieve \nthe \nefficiency gains you need?\nMr Hunt: \nShall \nI \nstart on that? It is clear that \nthe \nintention of \nthe \nHealth and Social Care Act is that CCGs should be able to commission \nthe \nservices that they believe are in \nthe \ninterests of patients locally, so \nI \nwould be concerned if any CCG felt that they were not able, in \nthe \ncase that you mentioned, \nto \ncommission services that were in \nthe \ninterests of patients. The\n&#xa0;\n“\ninterests of patients\n” also includes\n having a budget that they are abl\ne to control at sensible levels, because, i\nf they cannot do that\n,\n that impacts on services available to them.\nQ245 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: They cannot under AQP. They tell me—t\nhey confirmed wit\nh me—that they have no control; they inherit this. I\nt is not just in NHS \nKernow\n but\n across \nthe \ncountry. Where they have inherited \nthe \nAQP arrangement, my understanding is that they cannot control \nthe \nupper limit of what patients demand from those services.\nMr Hunt: \nThey may have inherited a contract from \nthe \nprevious PCT and \nthe \ncontract will not be \nfor ever\n, but in many NHS contracts there are measures in place to control demand. \nI \ndo not know \nthe \nindividual details of that case.\nQ246 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nNo, but \nI \nam sure that Sir David must be aware of these arrangements.\nSir David Nicholson: \nThe\n&#xa0;\nmost obvious place where we use \n“\nany qualified provider\n”\n is in elective care in \nthe \nsense that people can choose to go to any provider that they wish to\n, to have elective care,\n and we do not put a ceiling on all that. We think that is a p\nerfectly reasonable thing to do,\n driven by patients and their choices. But as to \nthe \nparticular example that you give on hearing aids, if \nthe \nCCG feel that it is inappropriate\n,\n given \nthe \ncontractual framework that they operate in, they can withdraw from it.\nQ247 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: They can at any time?\nSir David Nicholson: \nYes, they can.\nAndrew George: \nThank you.\nQ248 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nSecretary \nof\n State, \nI \nwant to ask about available money and pay. Your Department has argued in a submission to \nthe \nNHS pay review bodies that there should be no general 1% salary increase in 2014, contrary to what had been previously indicated, and that progr\nession pay should also be ended\n as part of a move to pay \n“\nwith stronger links to \nperformance, quality and productivity.”\n Do you believe that there needs to be continued pay restraint in order to make \nthe \nNHS funding settlement viable?\nMr Hunt: \nYes, \nI \ndo. \nI \nhope \nthe \nCommittee will forgive me if \nI \ndo not elaborate too much on this answer because we are in \nthe \nmiddle of negotiations now over this. \nI \nwill \nmake two points. First, \nI \ndearly want to give NHS employees \nthe \n1% rise that we want to give across \nthe \npublic sector. If money was no object, \nI \nwould like to give them more because \nI \nthink they are working extremely hard under very challenging circumstances, but budgetary constraints exist. \nThe\n&#xa0;\ncommitment that \nthe \nGovernment made was not 1% regardless of any other increments that you may be getting in your pay package; it was that everyone in \nthe \npublic sector should get at least a 1% rise\n,\n and we want to honour that, but we do need to negotiate on \nthe \nincrements that are a part of many NHS contracts, which mean\ns\n that pay in certain contracts can go up by as much as 6% or 7% automatically. My concern is \nthat, \nif we do not do that and we agreed to \nthe \n1%, essentially an unaffordable 1% increase in \nthe \npay bill equates to about 10,000 front\n&#x2011;\nline posts\n. T\nhe\n&#xa0;\nthing that makes \nthe \nNHS different from other parts of \nthe \npublic sector is that we are expanding in terms of \nthe \nnumber of people we employ at \nthe \nfront line\n,\n and we want to employ more people, particularly in \nthe \nwake of \nthe \nFrancis report. Hospitals want to employ another 4,000 nurses compared \nwith\n a year ago\n,\n and \nI \nwant them to employ those extra nurses. \nI\nt is something we need to do to meet our commitments under Francis. \nI \nwant to make sure that trusts end up with a financial position that enables them to do that.\nQ249 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nDo you think it is a fair accusation to say that there is \nan \nover\n-\nreliance on pay restraint to enable \nthe \nNHS to meet its efficiency target\ns\n?\nMr Hunt: \nWe recognise that \nthe \npay freeze that we started this Parliament with is not sustainable and that is why we have moved to 1%. We also recognise\n—\nand Sir David, \nI \nam sure, would want to comment on this\n—\nthat that means we have to be even more imaginative in finding other ways to make efficiency savings because we cannot constantly rely on \nthe \nkind of pay restraint that we have had to date.\nQ250 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nSo you are not\n \nconsidering\n maintaining p\nay restra\nint beyond 2014?\nMr Hunt: \nNo, we are; that is precisely what we are negotiating at \nthe \nmoment. We do believe there needs to be pay restraint and it is very important that we are successful in that ambition.\nQ251 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nSo there will be pay \nrestraint\n over \nthe \nwhole of \nthe \nnext spe\nnding review period. We can take that as read?\nMr Hunt: \nThe\n&#xa0;\nspending review period we have agreed is until \nthe \nend of March 2016, so \nI \ncannot comment on anything beyond that, but certainly until that period, yes, indeed\n,\n there needs to be pay restraint.\nDavid Tredinnick: \nThank you.\nQ252 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nThis follows up, Sir \nDavid\n, \nthe \npoints \nthat \nwe put to you at our last meeting. The\n&#xa0;\nbroad question\n \nI \nwant to ask—\nI \nhave some other points to make as well\n—\nis \nwhether\n you think you have enough information available about \nthe \nway \nthe \nNHS operates, including on issues such as staffing and redundancy\n,\n so that you can identify and address issues of concern\n.\n \nYou may remember at our last meeting that my colleague Valerie \nVaz\n asked you about \nthe \nfigure for people being made redundant and then rehired\n,\n and we went through a question and answer where in fact you said you did not have that information. But we have been sent \nthe \ninformation in a table since and we have that here. The\n&#xa0;\nfigures are quite interesting in \nthe \ntable that \nthe \nDepartment sent us\n.\n \nThey state \nthat 19,126 \nmembers of \nstaff wer\ne made redundant, 3,261 of whom \nhave been rehired to \nthe \nNHS after redundancy, including 2,534 within one year\n,\n and, fascinatingly, 403 within 28 days of being made redundant. \nAt \nthe \nsame meeting you were asked a question about Ruth \nCarnall\n,\n and you \ninitially \ntold us that she was not doing paid work for \nthe \nNHS after she had taken what turns out to be retirement\n,\n but not redundancy\n,\n and a pension, but we learned duri\nng \nthe \nmeeting via social media—and in \nfact you told us too—\nthat that was not \nthe \ncase and she was being paid for \nthe \nwork she is doing at \nthe \nNHS in Manchester. \nNow, \nI \nunderstand \nthe \npolicy. You told us that there was a policy that people who were made redundant would not then move into paid employment\n—you said—\nfor a period of six months, but \nI \nunderstand there is also a policy around re\n&#x2011;\nemployment\n of people who have taken early r\netirement and pensions that “O\nffers of re\n&#x2011;\nemployment\n,\n or payments for consultancy work\n,\n are not expected to \nbe made\n \nto former S\ncheme members who have taken early retirement\n from \nthe \nNHS at public expense…” \nSo here we have a policy around r\nehiring people after redundancy and\n rehiring people \nwho have taken early retirement\n that just does not seem to work. We seem to have a practice of getting rid of posts for people via redundancy or early retirement, with sometimes very costly pay\n&#x2011;\noffs\n, and then rehiring them. In some cases you are straightforwardly rehiring them as staff again, and that is shown in \nthe \ntable you have sent us, or they have been taken on in other parts of \nthe \nNHS as consultants and you are effectively paying them twice. \nT\nhis is really of concern. We thought it was a concern at \nthe \nlast meeting but we did not have much information from you. Can you explain how you have a policy \nthat\n you are just not upholding?\nSir David Nicholson: \nI \nam sure Una will want to talk about \nthe \nbroader issue, but \nI \ncan deal with it from \nthe \nperspective of NHS England and what we have done. \nYes, it is an absolutely legitimate thing to raise this whole issue about rehiring. We went through \nthe \nprocess of \nthe \ntransition\n,\n and we tried to reduce \nthe \namount of redundancy to \nthe \nabsolute limits of what we could do\n.\n \nA\ns you know, we originally \nthought we would spend about\n £1.5 billion on redundancy\n,\n and in fact \nwe \nonly spent £600 million or £700 million on\n it. So we managed to do that, a\nlthough \nI \nhave to say \nI \nhave also been criticised for transferring too many people from \nthe \nold system into \nthe \nnew one as well. But, nevertheless, we have reduced \nthe \nredundancy bill significantly based on what we thought beforehand. Of course, we have delivered\n—\nwe will have done by \nthe \nend of \nthe \nParliament\n—\n£5.5 billion\n&#x2011;\nworth\n of savings\n that we can reinvest in front-\nline services, which \nI \nthink is not to be ignored at all\n; it is very important. \nIn terms of \nthe \npeople, you are absolutely right that we have a position where, legally, if someone is made redundant they can be re\n-\nemployed within \n2\n8 days. \nI \nwrote to all \nthe \nsenior people in \nthe \nSHAs as part of \nthe \ntransition arrangement saying that \nI \nunderstood that was \nthe \ncase\n,\n but \nI \nwanted them voluntarily to agree \neither \nnot to be rehired or work as a consultant for at least six months.\nQ253 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nThat is \nnot\n happening.\nSir David Nicholson: \nI \nhave no legal basis on which to do that. \nI \nhave no power to make it happen. \nI \njust asked them not to do that. \nI \ncan confirm, in terms of \nthe \nvery senior managers, that NHS England has not either funded or employed any of those people over \nthe \nperiod. That is NHS England.\nQ254 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nOver which \nperiod\n, sorry?\nSir David Nicholson: \nOver \nthe \nsix months since \nthe \nbeginning of NHS England\n’\ns existence.\nQ255 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nDo you mean as employees or consultants?\nSir David Nicholson: \nEither.\nQ256 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nSo \nwhat\n about Ruth \nCarnall\n?\nSir David Nicholson: \nNHS \nEngland \nhave not employed Ruth \nCarnall\n in any capacity. \nQ257 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nShe \nworked\n in \nManchester\nSir David Nicholson: \nThe point \nI \nam trying to make i\ns for NHS England. The\n&#xa0;\nissue, of course, as you know, is\n that \nthe \nNHS is not a single organisation. It is made up of almost 500 different employers, all of which have their own arrangements and it is\n—\nQ258 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nLet me stop \nyou\n at that point. You have a policy that is impossible for you to enforce because now it is so fragmented that you do not have control over those parts of it. You can write and ask them not to do this\n,\n and they can just ignore it. That is what has happened, is it not? Ruth \nCarnall\n i\ns one example\n, \nand heaven knows how many others there are\n.\n \nI \nam not in any way doubting that s\nhe is a talented staff member, \nthat she has skills and something to offer, but this is \nthe \nuse of public money. This is \nthe \nuse of public money\n—\npay\n&#x2011;\noffs\n and redundancies and people taking pensions from \nthe \npublic purse and then being re\n-\nemployed in another capacity and being paid \nfor \nconsultancy. Effectively, what we are seeing is people being paid twice from \nthe \nsame purse.\nSir David Nicholson: \nI \ncompletely understand that and \nI \nthink you are absolutely right. That was why \nI \nwrote \nthe \nletter out saying that \nI \nwanted people voluntarily to do it. Bu\nt you are absolutely right—\nI \ndo not have \nthe \npower at \nthe \nmoment to enforce that\n—\nQ259 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: And \nno\n one does.\nSir David Nicholson:\n \n—\nin CCGs\n,\n foundation trusts or NHS trusts overall, so that power does not exist in \nthe \nsystem as we operate at \nthe \nmoment.\nQ260 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: T\nhat policy that \nI \nquoted parts of is effectively meaningless\n,\n because you cannot stop people being rehired and you certainly cannot stop people coming back and being paid as consultants at all.\nSir David Nicholson: \nI \ncannot, no, in \nthe \njob that \nI \ndo.\nQ261 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nSo \nthe \npolicy that\n \nI \nquoted\n from is meaningless. \nThey are being paid twice. \nI \ndo not know if \nthe \nSecretary \nof S\ntate wants to say how we come to have a policy that we cannot enforce. \nMr Sharma: \nIs there anyone who can control that?\nMr Hunt: \nThe\n&#xa0;\nfirst point \nI \nwould make is that \nthe \nNHS is 1.7 million people strong\n,\n and successive Governments, not just this Government, have concluded that it does not work to try and run it as a single structure with everyone reporting up directly to \nthe \nSecretary of State at \nthe \ntop of \nthe \npyramid\n.\n \nSo \nsuccessive Governments\n—\nfor example, \nthe \nlast Government\n—\nintroduced \nthe \npolicy on foundation trusts\n that\n operate as independent bodies. \nW\ne do not have \nthe \npower\n—\nSir David is absolutely right\n—\nto stop \nsome\none leaving one foundation trust and rejoining another, even though you are absolutely right to say that, ultimately, both salaries or consultancy figures are paid for by \nthe \ntaxpayer. \nW\ne took that decision because we recognised that we needed to have a system that is\n—\n \nQ262 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nI \ndo not think it is a \nquestion\n of people moving, Secretary of State. \nI \nthink it is a question of \nthe \nreorganisation \nthat\n your Bill forced through and people being made redundant\n—\nin some cases, their structures going\n.\n \nI \nthink that \nis \nthe \ncase with Ruth \nCarnall\n. H\ner s\ntructure disappeared, so there wa\ns a redundan\ncy pay\n&#x2011;\noff\n; there is \nan early retirement\n. T\nhese are very substantially highly paid people\n,\n who are getting that amount of money and then just coming back\n in through \nthe \nrevolving door as\n consultants\n,\n just popping up somewhere else in \nthe \ncountry. It is not people moving. The\n&#xa0;\nreal issue is people being paid twice.\nMr Hunt: \nOkay. So if we come to reorganisations, which happened a number of times under \nthe \nlast Government as well as under this Government\n— \nBarbara Keeley: \nNot as expensively as this one, \nI \nhave to say.\nMr Hunt: \nThis one is also saving a lot more money. \nQ263 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nPoint \nto\n one that has cost £3 billion.\nMr Hunt: \nIt is saving £5.5 billion, but that is a different discussion. As a result of what we have learned from this reorganisation\n—\nand indeed practised under previous reorganisations\n—\nwe have now changed \nthe \nrules\n.\n \nWhen n\national arm\n’\ns length bodies are re\n-\nemploying someone who has been working for another arm\n’\ns length b\nody or in a previous structure, if they are re-employed within a year, that person pays b\nack their redundancy on a pro\n&#x2011;\nrata\n basis. That is a change in \nthe \nrules to deal with that issue.\nQ264 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nDoes that apply to any of these people \nwho have been re\nhired?\nMr Hunt: \nWe cannot apply it retrospectively because people are entitled to their own contractual entitlements, but it is a rule that we have introduced. \nI \ndo not know whether \nthe \nPermanent Secretary wants to answer that.\nQ265 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nYou have \nrehired\n 17% of \nthe \npeople \nwho\n were made redundant in \nthe \nlast three years, according to \nthe \nfigures \nthe \nDepartment sent us, and that is a very substantial proportion; 17% have been taken back on again, a number of them within 28 days, ridiculously enough, and most\n of them within one year. That smacks of appallingly bad planning—\nthat they were not able to be redeployed from \nthe \nrole you were moving them out of\n into another one\n. It smacks of carelessness with public money. \nI \nam sure that people outside \nhere will not be impressed that you have policies that you cannot enforce\n,\n and\n,\n now that you have thought of a way of enforcing them\n,\n you cannot do anything about \nthe \ncosts that have already been incurred. \nMr Hunt: \nLet me ask \nthe \nPermanent Secretary to come in \nand \nI \nwill come back \non that.\nUna O’Brien: \nThe first thing to say is that very significant\n efforts were made to restrain \nthe \ntotal amount of money spent on redundancy. That was a significant effort\n,\n and it meant that a significant number of people who were entitled to redundancy payments under \nthe \nrules set in 2006 did not get those payments but got jobs in \nthe \nnew system. \nT\nhe\n&#xa0;\nfacts bear out what David \nhas said—\nthat a significant proportion of people employed in \nthe \nnew system are in different jobs\n, many of them,\n and some of them have much bigger jobs\n. B\nut \nthe \ntruth is that we did not spend a lot of money on redundancy that we would otherwise have spent. That was our focus and we were very\n, very\n determined to keep that redundancy bill as low as possible. \nIf \nI \ncould come on to \nthe \nnext point\n—\n \nQ266 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nI \nthink 19,000 staff have been made redundant\n.\n \nW\nith a good proportion of those coming back\n,\n it does not follow through with what you are saying.\nUna O’Brien: \nCurrently\n,\n \nthe \n2006 rule is that\n,\n if someone is re\n-\nemployed within 28 days, they have to pay back their redundancy. \nI \nthink that rule is too lax and we now need to change \nit\n. We need to change it so that, as \nthe \nSecretary\n \nState\n has said, if you are re\n-\nemployed within a year in another NHS organisation and you are in receipt of redundancy payment\n,\n you pay it back pro rata. \nI \nwould point out that it is absolutely true that you have identified for people who have very long service and who are on high salaries that their redundancy payments are significant, but it is most usually \nthe \ncase that people\n’\ns redundancy payments are relatively modest\n.\n \nS\no there can be a junior administrator made redundant on £15,000 or £20,000\n,\n who, six months later, finds a job in another organisation, a job that was not available or vacant at \nthe \npoint at which they were made redundant. This is an industry and \nI \ndo think that \npoint \nneeds to be\n made.\nQ267 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nI \nhave given \nan \nexample\n of one of your most\n high\nly\n paid staff\n,\n who has now been effectively paid twice.\nUna O’Brien: \nI \nwa\nnt to come on to that, if may. \nThe th\nird point is that \nit is well known, fo\nr example, in \nthe \ncivil service that we have \nthe \nAdvisory Committee on Business Appointments\n where there are arrangements\n,\n if you are made redundant or you leave\n for other reasons\n, particularly \nin \na senior position, that you are restrained in \nthe \nwork that you do, particularly that you should obtain no commercial advantage from your experience. \nI \nnow want all \nthe \narm\n’\ns length bodies of \nthe \nDepartment to follow \nthe \nexample \nthat\n David has \nset\n in NHS England by beginning as he means to go on\n,\n which is to set business rules equivalent \nto \nthe \ncivil s\nervice rules for NHS England. \nI \nnow expect all \nthe \narm\n’\ns length bod\nies\n for \nthe \nDepartment of Health to do that so that \npeople’s \nexpectations \nare \nthe \nsame as those\n \nfor\n civil servants when they leave office, particularly people who have been in a job where they gain knowledge or contacts\n. Before they move on to their next role or a\nt \nthe \npoint at whi\nch they take up their next role,\n they \nwill \nhave to get an agreement \nabout \nwhether they have to have a waiting period or step back for an appropriate amount of time so that we do not get \nthe \nsort of situation that you have described. \nBarbara Keeley: \nIt sounds as if you needed to have done that before\n,\n because\n,\n clearly\n,\n with \nthe \nreorganisation\n,\n a very large number of \nmanagers—\nyou have n\not supplied us with \nthe \nfigures, \nbut we have had other \nfigures in \nthe \nHouse of Commons—who \nhave been made redundant and rehired as well\n,\n and there are examples of people \nwho\n are very highly paid\n,\n \nwho\n have taken packages and are n\now coming back as consultants. \nYou have given us \nthe \nresponse, but \nI \nthink that there will be a view outside her\ne that this is not satisfactory;\n \nt\nhis should have been dealt with earlier\n;\n if you have policies now that you cannot make retrospective, you have used money from \nthe \npublic purse that you should not have done\n; and \nthis is not a satisfactory situation. \nChair: \nThere are several members of \nthe \nCommittee who want to come in\n on this\n, but if we are going to spend all afternoon on \nit\n we are not going to get\n—\nQ268 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nWhile \nwe\n are on pay, \nI \nwant to ask a question about whe\nre \nthe \nGovernment currently lie\n in respect of \nthe \nrisk, as \nI \nsee it\n—\nand perhaps\n,\n Secretary State\n, you\n \nmay\n take a different view\n—\nabout \nthe \npossibility that foundation trusts, NHS trust\ns, may \nintroduce regional pay. \nYou are aware that your predecessor took \nthe \nview that\n,\n while he was not going to direct \nthe \nsouth\n&#x2011;\nwest consortium of 20 or so trusts to discontinue their activity of exploring \nthe \nposs\nibility, at \nthe \ntime that \nthe \nAgenda for Change national negotiations concluded\n,\n each of \nthe \ntrusts wrote to me and confirmed that they would abide by \nthe \nnational pay, terms and conditions\n,\n providing they remained, as they put it, fit for purpose, which of course gave them \nthe \nlet\n&#x2011;\nout of reintroducing this concept at a later stage. \nI \nwant \nto be clear about whether, if NHS organisations suggested they might introduce \nthe \nconcept of lower\n pay—\nthat is critical\n—\nin certain areas, \nthat \nis something which, as a Department, you would take action against, \nthat you would discourage.\n What is \nthe \nview of your Department on that issue?\nMr Hunt: \nAs a Department\n,\n we subscribe to \nthe \nprinciples behind autonomy and independence for foundation trusts. That is \nthe \nGovernment policy and we want all hospitals over time to become foundation trusts. \nW\ne really think it is a matter for them, but, as \nI \nunderstand it, most FTs, if not all, prefer to have national pay scales\n. They fi\nnd it easier to negotiate with their staff on \nthe \nbasis of them\n, \nproviding those national pay scales are competitive and fair, both in terms of \nthe \nemployees and what \nthe \nFTs want to deliver to their patients. The\n&#xa0;\nexample you cite was an example where \nthe \nsouth\n&#x2011;\nwest consortium \nfelt\n that \nthe \nnational terms and conditions were not fair. Negotiations then proceeded. There was some flexibility on \nthe \nunion side and they were able to live with \nthe \nresult. \nI \nthink everyone has ended up happy and \nI \nthink \nthe \nGovernment \nare\n happy as well.\nChair: \nCharlotte Leslie wants to talk about \nthe \nintegration fund\n,\n but before that she wants \nto ask \na very quick question on this subject and then we \nwill move\n on.\nQ269 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nVery quickly to round \noff\n \nthe \ndiscussion that Barbara led, it seems that a very large and expensive loophole was left in \nthe \nimplementation of \nthe \nreforms whereby people were able to get redundancy payment\ns\n and pensions from \nthe \nhealth service and then go off into consultancy. It is commendable to write advice asking that these people do not take up any positions within \nthe \nNHS for six months after they have left\n,\n but it is kind of after \nthe \nhorse has bolted. Secretary of State, are you happy with \nthe \nway \nthe \nreforms were implemented in leaving that large loophole open?\nMr Hunt: Always, w\nhen you do something on that scale, \nof course you \nlearn lessons afterwards. \nI \ndo not think it is possible in a huge system like \nthe \nhealth service to prevent people \nfrom \nleaving \nthe \nhealth service \nand the\nn becoming consultants\n. I\nndeed\n,\n it may be in \nthe \ninterests of \nthe \nhealth service and patients that we are able to tap into \nthe \nexpertise of people on a time\n&#x2011;\nlimited\n basis through a consultancy contract. But what we do not want is abuse of that system and we do not want \nthe \npublic to be paying twice. We have tried to learn \nthe \nlessons from this reorganisation and other reorganisations by making some changes, as \nthe \nPermanent Secretary outlined. \nB\nut \nthe \noverall point \nI \nwould make about these changes\n—\nand \nI \ndo think it is important to take \nthe \noverall context\n—\nis that\n,\n by removing 23,000 administrative posts, including 8,000 managers, we are able to employ 6,500 more doctors. The\n&#xa0;\nNHS is able to do 800,000 more operations every year on broadly \nthe \nsame budget\n,\n and that is because we have moved a lot of money from back\n&#x2011;\noffice\n functions to \nthe \nfront line. \nI \nthink that \nthat, \noverall\n,\n represents a massive increase in value for money for every taxpayer\n’\ns pound that goes into \nthe \nNHS.\nQ270 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: I\nn terms of \nthe\n \nperformance being good overall, this is an expensive loophole that, with hindsight, it would have been very good to close before we had this problem arise rather than have to write letters after \nthe \nevent asking people not to take up lucrative posts.\nMr Hunt: \nI \ndon’t think it would have been right not to do—\nSome of these things are quite complex and it is not as easy as just wishing \nthe \nproblem would go away or making a simple change\n,\n because people have rights under employment law. \nW\nhere there are loopholes that are easy \nto deal with, we have done that.\n \nO\nne of those is \nthe \nnew 12\n&#x2011;\nmonth rule that we are implementing acr\noss \nthe \nsystem. I\nt is not possible to implement those kinds of rules on a \nvery \nlocalised level, but\n,\n \nobviously \nwhere we can, we do everything \npossible \nto make sure we get best value for money.\nChair: Let us turn to i\nntegration transformation. \nQ271 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: Absolutely; t\nhat is what \nI \nam \nburning\n to ask about. What will \nthe \nimpact of \nthe \nintegration transformation fund of £3.8 billion \nbe \nand can you clarify whether this is new money or not?\nMr Hunt: \nIt is not new money in that it comes from \nthe \nNHS budget\n,\n and it is now called, inc\nidentally, a much improved name—\nthe \n“better care fund”—\nwhich \nI \nhope will make it much less of a mouthful for \nthe \nCommittee and indeed all of us. It represents an additional £2 billion going from \nthe \nannual NHS budget into integrated support through \nthe \nhealth and social care system. The\n&#xa0;\nintention is to improve out\n&#x2011;\nof\n&#x2011;\nhospital\n services for some of \nthe \nmost frail and vulnerable older people who use \nthe \nsocial care system by giving them a joined\n&#x2011;\nup\n service and by being a catalyst. \nI\nn order to access that money\n,\n CCGs and local authorities will have to jointly commission services. There is a list of things \nthat have been on \nthe \nc\nhairman\n’\ns list of requirements for any integrated care package for many years now \nthat\n will have to be done in order to access this money. It is deliberately designed to be a sufficiently large sum of money \nso \nthat no one will feel that they cannot be bothered with accessing it. They will feel they have to access it\n. T\nhings like recor\nd sharing will be part of it,\n \nand \nhaving a named accountable clinician responsible for each and every one of those vulnerable older people will also be a part of it. But it comes from \nthe \nNHS budget. \nThe\n&#xa0;\nother point about it is that we expect there will be significant savings both to \nthe \nNHS and \nthe \nsocial care sector in terms of, particularly, omission avoidance by proactively looking after people better in \nthe \ncommunity.\nCharlotte Leslie: \nThank you.\nQ272 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nThere are real \nconcerns\n about whether \nthe \nplanning for \nthe \nintegration fund is going well. In fact, we have had concerns that it is not going well at all. \nA\n witness \nfrom \nthe \nNuffield Trust said: “M\ny anxiety is that planning is happening too late for this and it is happening too late to co\n&#x2011;\nordinate with \nthe \nacute sector.”\n \nI\nn \nthe \nnext panel \nthat \nday we had witnesses from \nthe \nLGA\n,\n who did not talk about planning for \nthe \nintegration fund but talked about talking and developing relationships. So it seemed that \nthe \nLGA representative evidence bore out what we had heard from \nthe \nNuffield Trust. \nI\nt seems that planning for integration is not robust enough\n.\n \nI \nthink there are two things related to that. \nFirst, there\n is a fear that \nthe \nmoney will not be spent as effectively\n, and, s\necondly, \nthat \nyou will not make \nthe \nsavings that you just talked about. \nT\nhe\n&#xa0;\nreal fear is that there could be problems in 2015\n&#x2011;\n16 and that we will not see effective integrated working established. What we \nwill see is just money going in\n \nto soak up press\nures, of which there are plenty—obviously pressures in A and E and\n very substantial pressures around social care. That is what we have heard and we are concerned. Are you concerned and what can be done?\nMr Hunt: \nIt is absolutely right to express that concern because it is very important that this is a real transformation\n,\n not just either a cosmetic transformation or a continuation of what we had before, which was much more limited in its ambition. But we have tried to mitigate \nthe \nrisk of that happening through a very aggressive timetable. The\n&#xa0;\nfund is for \nthe \nfinancial year 2015\n&#x2011;\n16, so it starts in April 2015, and we have said that we require all CCGs and local authorities to have put together their plans by April \n2014, a\n whole year in advance. That gives us time to go through those plans in detail to check they are robust\n,\n but also, importantly, for \nthe \nplans that are good\n,\n we believe that many local authorities and CCGs will not want to wait. Even though they are not going to get access to \nthe \nfund till 2015, they will probably want to start a lot of \nthe \nintegration well before April 2015 and indeed make it part of their 2014\n&#x2011;\n15 cycle because of \nthe \nprospect of significant savings being made. But \nI \nthink you are absolutely right to say that\n,\n with a plan of this scale, it is all about \nthe \nimplementation and we need to monitor that very carefully.\nQ273 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nWe did not \nhear\n anything that gave us a lot of confidence that it was happening\n \nbecause \nthe \nLGA representative talked about relationship building and that is \nthe \nstage they were at. \nI\nf you are expecting to see plans in four or five months, \nthe \npeople we have heard from do not suggest that is happening. One of \nthe \nthings\n—\nand \nI \ndo not want to rehearse everything that happened in \nthe \ndebate yesterday\n—\nis that my own local authority, which is suffering from cuts, has had very substantial management resource \ncuts. It has lost a chief executive—that post has been cut—and \nthe \nprevious chief executive\n’s\n job is now shared between three former deputies. There j\nust is not \nthe \nresource there. \nYou cannot take 20%, for instance, out of social care and not lose managers and people \nwho\n will do that planning. From what \nI \nsee locally in my area, there are not \nthe \npeople on \nthe \nground in local government to do that planning. They have just spent all their time and had \nthe \nauditor in\n,\n and been talking about how they are going to make £75 million more cuts. They have to get that budget right because, if not, your colleague in DCLG will come in and do it for them. Where is \nthe \nresource that is going to \ndo\n this planning\n?\n \nW\nhat we have heard over \nthe \nlast number of weeks is that it is not happening yet\n.\nMr Hunt: \nWe have said that we require those plans by April, so that is a pretty important deadline for all local authorities and CCGs because those are \nthe \nrules of \nthe \nfund. \nW\ne will be following up very closely. But we recognise \nthe \nkind of challenges that you are talking about. It is very tough, particularly for local authorities\n,\n but actually tough for CCGs as well because they have huge pressures on their budgets. \nT\nhis is something that is overwhelmingly in everybody\n’s interests. \nI \nthink \nthe \nnorth-\nwest has made some of \nthe \nbest progress towards integrated care of anywhere in \nthe \ncountry actually.\nQ274 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nYou \nhave\n not mentioned \nTorbay\n.\nMr Hunt: \nAnd indeed Torbay\n—\nTorbay\n and \nthe \nnorth-\nwest.\nDr Wollaston: \nStand by. \nJon Rouse: \nCan \nI \nadd \none point?\n \nIt is \na counter\n&#x2011;\nbalance\n in terms o\nf what could give us confidence.\n In \nthe \nsummer\n,\n we asked for applications to be pioneers for integration\n,\n and \nI \nremember at \nthe \ntime \nthat \nwe had a bit of a sweepstake in \nthe \noffice in terms of how many bids we would get\n.\n \nI \nchose \nthe \nhighest number\n \nand said 35. We actually got 99 and some of those had more than one local authority in them, so we had well over 100 of \nthe \n152 upper tier authorities bidding to be integration pioneers and putting all \nthe \nwork with their CCGs and their providers into those applications. \nI \nthink there is a real momentum out there. \nI \ntravel pretty extensively around \nthe \ncountry visiting localities. Most places are planning pretty transformational integration models \nand \nI \nhave high hopes that that will be reflected in \nthe \nplans.\nBarbara Keeley: \nIt might be that people were more optimistic in \nthe \nsummer than they are when they are facing winter pressures, but \nI \nhave reflected to you what we have heard over \nthe \nlast few weeks from \nthe \nNuffield Trust and from \nthe \nLGA\n.\n \nW\ne can only tell you what we hear.\nQ275 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: Now o\nn to \nTorbay\n,\n and \nI \nam very glad that they are an integration pioneer. Can \nI \ntouch on \nthe \nimpact of \nthe \nCare Bill\n,\n because \nthe \nCare Bill is going to impose many new statutory responsibilities on councils? If \nI \nlook, say, at an area like Torbay, they are going to have a crunch year in 2015 when their projected funding will fall to below 90% of their projected expenditure\n, \nand that is not including all \nthe \nnew commitments they will have\n. U\nnfortunately\n,\n \nthe \nimpact of that\n, it\n seems to me\n,\n \nis \nthat there is a risk that\n,\n because everything will have to go on t\nheir statutory responsibilities,\n there will be nothing left to fund \nthe \nkind of projects around \nthe \nvoluntary sector that provide all \nthe \nwellbeing that was \nthe \nstated aim of \nthe \nBill. \nH\now concerned \nare \nyou, Secretary of State, that we may not be able to put in place a lot of \nthe \ngood intention around wellbeing in \nthe \nCare Bill because of that funding pressure\n?\n In \nTorbay\n’\ns case, just in \nthe \nnext two years\n,\n they \nwill\n hav\ne \nto take out between £22 million and £27 million\n;\n \nthe \nelastic can only stretch so far\n.\n \nA\ns you will know, there is no fat on \nthe \nbone left. They have already done \nthe \nbul\nk of \nthe \nintegration that other\n areas have not even started.\nMr Hunt: \nI \nwould not want to underestimate \nthe \nfinancial challenges facing local authorities. \nI \nthink it is very tough and it is very tough in \nthe \nNHS, as you know\n,\n as well\n, b\nut that is why we are seeing such imagination and energy going into thinking about new ways of working\n.\n \nS\nometimes it is at those times of financial pressure that people are at their most imaginative\n,\n and \nI \nthink that is one of \nthe \nreasons why Jon Rouse found such enthusiasm for \nthe \nintegration pioneers and one of \nthe \nreasons why people will really take seriously \nthe \nplans \nthat we put forward for \nthe \nbetter care fund. \nI \nknow Torbay has also been one of \nthe \npioneers when it comes to integration, but \nI \nthink there are a lot of things \nwhere,\n even in \nTorbay\n, we can do a lot better than we are currently doing\n. F\nor example, \nas to \nthe \nuse of technology, \nthe \nnew GP contract includes agreement from GPs that has not existed before surrounding \nthe \nuse of \nthe \nGP record\n,\n which, with patients\n’\n consent, will now be able to be used throughout \nthe \nsystem electronically. So some very exciting things can happen, but \nthe \ntruth is\n—\nand \nI \nthink this relates to \nthe \nvery earliest discussion\n—\nwe absolutely need them to happen at pace because we need to make \nthe \nproductivity improvements deliver within \nthe \nbudgets.\nQ276 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: \nCan \nI \ncome \nback\n to that\n,\n because within \nTorbay\n, as you know, they have already done a huge amount of \nthe \nwork that ot\nher areas have not even started?\n They have \nalready \ncut their acute beds\n and\n have \nthe \nlowest, if you like, h\nospital admissions in \nthe \nsouth-\nwest; they are doing incredibly well nationally on scales for early discharge; they already have in \np\nlace all those mechanisms for \nrapid equipment \nand a single care co\n&#x2011;\nordinator—\nall these kinds of things. \nI \nwonder whether they are going to be able, even with \nthe \nmeasures you have outlined, to make sufficient savings and where it is all going to come from. Do you feel \nthat \nwe are going to have to see an increase in overall fund\ning for \nthe \nNHS in social care—\nnew money coming into \nthe \nsyst\nem—\nfor it to work?\nMr Hunt: \nI \nthink everyone is going to hav\ne to live within their budgets—\nbudgets that were agreed in \nthe \n2015\n&#x2011;\n16 spending settlement. \nIndeed, \nI \nknow that \nthe \nLabour\n party have said if they win \nthe \nnext election they will stick to those spending limits in \nthe \nfirst year of a new Parliament as well. \nW\ne are in a very invidious position nationally of having to deal with \nthe \ndeficit and that means we are going to have to live within those spending limits. \nI \nwould say that \nthe \nkind of vision that you have had in Torbay bodes extremely well because you have shown imagination\n,\n and \nthe \nability of different parts of Government to work together has been tried and tested there\n,\n which should mean that you are more than up to meeting that challenge\n,\n \nb\nut \nI \ndo not want to pretend it is going to be easy. \nQ277 &#xa0; \nChair: \nI \nthink\n part of \nthe \nscepticism of \nthe \nCommittee about \nthe \npace and scale of necessary change going on in \nthe \nsystem might derive from \nthe \nrelative absence of major proposals for service change affecting disinvestment from traditional models of care. Given \nthe \npoint you were just making about \nthe \nresource constraints being here for \nthe \nmedium term, \nthe \nproposition that there is somethi\nng beyond imaginative thinking—i.e.\n imaginative action\n—would be more credible, would it not, \nif we were seeing significant resource transfers out of \nthe \nacute sector into \nthe \ncommunity service, whereas what we are \nactually \nseeing is resources increasingly drifting into \nthe \nacute sector and out of community and primary care?\nMr Hunt: T\nhat is a fair point to make\n,\n but \nI \nwould say that \nI \nthink \nthe \nbetter care fund is a very good example of \nthe \nreverse happening because that is money that, by and large, is not going to be spent in \nthe \nacute sector at all. \nI \nthink that is \nthe \nfirst \nreally \nsignificant step\n.\n \nA\ns a result of \nthe \nbetter care fund\n,\n \nthe \nQIPP \n—\n \nQ278 &#xa0; \nChair: \nDo we not have to establish in \nthe \npolicy community\n’\ns mind \nthe \nprinciple that \nthe \nbetter care fund, if it is to be real, means more community\n&#x2011;\nbased\n \nservices, which means, in a cash-\nlimited budget, disinvestment from acute services\n,\n which, \nthe \nNAO says, are meeting need that never ought to have arisen?\nMr Hunt: \nI \nwould say \n“\nless money\n”\n rather than \n“\ndisinvestment\n”.\n \nL\ness money means more efficient use of resources, but \nit \ndoes mean \nless money in \nthe \nacute sector. A\ns a result \nof \nthe \nbetter care fund, which is going to be real, we have to increase \nthe \nQIPP savings that we will be requiring from around £4.5 billion a year currently to around £5.5 billion in 2015\n&#x2011;\n16\n, and w\ne will have to find that extra money\n.\n \nI \nam very happy to talk to you about how we can do that\n,\n but, yes, we will have to make savings because it will mean less cash spent in \nthe \nacute sector.\nQ279 &#xa0; \nChair: \nI \ndo not want to hog it, but \nI \nguess\n \nI \nwould be more comfortable that it was more than \n“\nearly stage discussions\n”\n if we were seeing some dust being thrown up by these proposals for \n“less money”,\n to use your phrase\n,\n rather than disinvestment. I, like you, prefer that formulation; it is easier to understand.\nMr Hunt: Perhaps \nI \ncan re\nassure you by saying that we do intend, before \nthe \nend of March, to publish how we will get to \nthe \nnecessary QIPP savings for 2015\n&#x2011;\n16\n,\n and \nthat will show \nhow we think we can deliver that for that period of time. But there is a lot of work happening right \nnow in order to firm up \nthe \nrealistic possibilities for saving money. We can go into those now if you like, but that is\n—\n  \nChair: \nWe do not have time to do that because \nI \nknow Andrew wants to go into \nthe \nimplications of this competition\n policy—\nsome of \nthe \npoints that Sir David was making when he was last here.\nQ280 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: In fact \nI \nwill start with a quote from \nyou, \nSir David\n,\n on 5 November when you were before \nthe \nCommittee where you described that we have a problem \nthat\n may need legisla\ntive change. If \nI \nmay quote: “...c\nompetition was a tool to improve quality\n,\n to be used when commissioners felt it was \nthe \nright thing to do, not something that\n would be brought in externally…\nFor whatever reason, legislatively and in practice, that is not what is happening. \nWhat is happening at \nthe \nmoment…we are in my view\n getting bogged down in a morass of competition law\n,\n which is causing significant cost \nin\n \nthe \nsystem.\n” \nMy question to you, Secretary of State, is\n,\n do you agree with Sir David? Do you think that competition law is resulting in this morass and indeed is costing more than it is saving?\nMr Hunt: \nI \nbelieve that what is happening on \nthe \nground is not what \nthe \nAct intended as much as we want. \nW\ne intended with \nthe \nAct that local commissioners—GPs—\nwould have \nthe \npower to commission services in \nthe \nway that they believed was right for patients. They are operating under \nthe \nsame procurement rules as \nthe \nPCTs did\n,\n but they are new teams of people and they are finding that quite onerous. My own view is that we need to look at why that is and\n,\n in particular\n,\n whether there is advice and support we can give them so that they do not feel they are getting bogged down in that competition law. \nI \ndo not think that it is a case of \nthe \ncompetition law that, as \nI \nsay, \nthe \nPCTs themselves were operating under necessarily being wrong, but we need to make sure that CCGs feel they have \nthe \nautonomy and \nthe \nability to commission in \nthe \nway that is in \nthe \ninterests of patients.\nQ281 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: I\nt \nis \nthe\n \nCCGs that need tutoring and support, as it were, through this process\n?\n You would not agree with Sir David that there is a prospect for legislative change to achieve \nthe \nclarity that is needed in order to get \nthe \nefficiencies \nthat \nare clearly not being delivered\n.\nMr Hunt: \nI \nthink \nthe \nefficiencies are being delivered by a lot of CCGs\n—\nby \nthe \nway\n,\n \nI \ndo not think \nthis\n is a problem that affects all CCGs\n—\nand, you know, all \nthe \nlegislation that we pass as a Government we keep under review to make sure that \nthe \npractical way it is being implemented on \nthe \nground is in accordance with our intentions when we passed \nthe \nlegislation\n;\n and that is what we\n&#xa0;\nwill continue to do.\nAndrew George: \nUnless anyone else wants to come in on that, \nI \nwant to ask a question\n—\n  \nQ282 &#xa0; \nChair: \nCan \nI \nask a brie\nf question? If NHS England comes\n to you with a proposal to change \nthe \nlegislation to ensure that \nthe \ncompetition law is not an inhibition to necessary change, that is something that in principle you are pre\npared to promote?\nMr Hunt: \nOf course \nI \nwould listen to them very carefully because \nI \nwant \nthe \ncommissioning process to work and it is really important that it should work\n. S\no \nI \nwant to make sure that \nthe \nintentions of \nthe \nAct are reflected in what happens on \nthe \nground. \nI \ndo not think we are at that stage yet. \nA\ns \nI \nsay, CCGs are new organisations\n and\n \nthey \nare operating under \nthe \nsame procurement framework as their\n&#xa0;\nPCT predecessors, but, of course, PCTs were long \nestablished\n and\n had lots of people who were used to dealing with procurement. EU procurement rules are a nightmare at \nthe \nbest of times. Having run my own private company, \nI \nexperienced them on a number of occasions\n,\n so \nI \ncan well understand \nthe \nfrustrations, but it is very much my job to listen to what NHS England say\n,\n to make sure that CCGs are able to do what \nthe \nAct intended.\nQ283 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nI \nwill then move\n on to a \nrelated\n issue, \nwhich is \nthe \nrelationship between tariff funding and \nthe \nrisk or \nthe \npotential perverse consequences of cherry\n&#x2011;\npicking\n that might happen in \nthe \nsystem, whic\nh \nI \nhave raised before with you and we have corresponded on it, \nand indeed with Sir David and Richard Douglas a year ago wh\nen we first raised this issue. \nWe were told \nat that stage—a year ago, that is—\nthat there was a concern about \nthe \npotential risk of perverse consequences\n;\n that certain providers would, in effect, cream off \nthe \neasier work and therefore profit from \nthe \ntariff arrangements and not undertake \nthe \nmore complex work because \nthe \ntariff system enabled them to do that\n;\n and that you\n,\n \nor at least\n \nthe \nNHS commissioning b\noard\n,\n were undertaking a review. \nY\no\nu were very specific last year—\nand inde\ned, Mr Douglas, you were clear—\nthat it was \nthe \ncommissioning b\noard\n’\ns responsibility to \nundertake\n a review and to redesign \nthe \ntariff system to ensure that such unintended consequences did not occur. We sought clarity on that particular point and wanted to be absolutely clear that it was not Monitor\n’\ns role\n.\n \nY\nou were clear that it was not Monitor\n’s role;\n they were there purely to inject \nthe \nprices into \nthe \nsystem, but \nthe \ndesign itself was \nfor \nthe \ncommissioning b\noard. Is that right\n,\n and what progress have you made in \nthe \nlast year \ntowards\n achieving this outcome?\nRichard Douglas: \nIn terms of \nthe \nbasic approach, you are absolutely right. In broad terms, \nthe \ncommissioning board sets \nthe \nstructure of what \nthe \ntariff should deliver and Monitor attaches a price to that\n.\n \nT\nhere are some elements around \nthe \nedges, but that is \nthe \nbroad structure. The\n&#xa0;\nposition for next year for \nthe \ntariff is, broadly speaking, that it is steady state. There has not been and will not be a fundamental change to \nthe \ntariff for next year. It is now a matter again for NHS England and Monitor to work through what \nthe \nnext stage is\n,\n but there has been a deliberate decision for next year that we will keep \nit\n broadly as it is. \nI \ndo not know whether Davi\nd wants to add anything on that.\nSir David Nicholson: \nNo, only to say that \nthe \ntariff is being published \nI \nthink today or tomorrow by Monitor. We have had our input into all that. We think that\n,\n with \nthe \ntariff\n,\n we have taken \nthe \nright balance between changes and continuity to enable trusts to have as much certainty as they can about \nthe \nfuture. But in terms of \nthe \nparticular point that you make, if an individual commissioner or trust believes that a provider is acting in \nthe \nway that you describe\n—i.e. for other reasons, \nselecting their\n patients on \nthe \nbasis of that—that is a matter for Monitor. \nThat would be a complaint that could be made to Monitor and Monitor would investigate and take \nthe \naction that was required.\nQ284 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nOn \nwhat\n basis? \nSir David Nicholson: Monitor has a responsibility—\nthe \ntariff has a responsibility—\nboth to improve services to patients and also to enhance integration\n.\n \nI\nf in those circumstances they find a provider \nis acting against that interest—i.e.\n against \nthe \ninterests of p\natients in those circumstances—\nit can take action\n.\n  \nQ285 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nBut you \nknow\n that this is going on all \nthe \ntime. You know this is going on all \nthe \ntime because you know that a lot of providers are not taking \nthe \nmore complex \npatients\n,\n and they have been set up to provide a system, particularly in \nthe \narea of elective care, where they cannot. So that is going on anyway.\nSir David Nicholson: \nI \nam sorry—\nyou were suggesting \nthat \npeople were doing it\n.\n \nY\nou are absolutely right that there are hip and knee providers\n and\n people who provide heart surgery, but that is part of \nthe \nsegmentation of \nthe \nway in which \nthe \nservice is delivered, is it not?\nQ286 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nIt is\n,\n and\n,\n therefore\n,\n \nfor \nany\n patient \nwho\n comes to them with a set of co\n&#x2011;\nmorbidities\n,\n or \nwho \nrepresents an anaesthetic risk \nthat\n they are not prepared to take on, clearly they have designed a service that is cherry\n&#x2011;\npicking\n \nthe \neasier patients\n,\n for which they are then being paid a decent tariff to provide a service only to those patients and not to others.\nSir David Nicholson: T\nhere are two separate issues here. You are absolutely right that in some circumstances, \nin some stand\n&#x2011;\nalone elective units, it is not safe for them to treat people with a lot of co\n&#x2011;\nmorbidities\n,\n but that seems to me \nthe \nright thing. You would expect them not \nto \ndo it.\nQ287 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nNo, you are twisting \nthe \ntables on me—\n \nSir David Nicholson: Sorry.\nAndrew George: —which is a fair point.\n \nThe\n&#xa0;\nissue is that\n,\n in those circumstances\n,\n \nthe \nproviders that are providing those elective services in limited circumstances are being paid at a rate that does not properly reflect \nthe \nrelatively low risk of patients that they take on\n. T\nhat is not reflected in other settings where they take on significantly more complex patients\n, and\n \nthe \ntariff does not properly reflect that for them.\nSir David Nicholson: If you could give me examples\n that would be great, and \nI \nwill investigate the\nm\n. \nQ288 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: Y\nou do not accept that this is a theme \nthat has been raised with you?\nSir David Nicholson: \nNo, it has absolutely be\nen\n raised with me\n,\n but on almost every occasion \nwhere \nwe have dealt with it in detail\n,\n we have found it either to be not \nthe \ncase or people \nhave put in \naction to change it straight away.\nQ289 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nLast time \nwe\n discussed this,\n \nyou said that you would be road-\ntesting your proposed redesigned tarif\nf system.  Where did you road-\ntest\n it and what were \nthe \noutcomes? \nCan we read \nthe \nreport on your road-\ntesting, please? \nSir David Nicholson: \nI \ncan do you a note\n on all that.\nQ290 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nI \nwant to go back \nto\n some of \nthe \nanswers you gave my two colleagues, Barbara \nKeeley\n and Charlotte Leslie. The\n&#xa0;\npoint they were trying to make\n,\n \nto \nwhich we did not quite get an answer\n,\n is that it is as a result of \nthe \nreorganisation that took place that this issue arose about \nthe \nrehiring\n. God bless Norman St\n John\n&#x2011;\nStevas\n for having a Select Committee structure, otherwise you would not have come back to us with information and perhaps you would not have discovered this loophole. Is that correct?\nMr Hunt: “\nG\nod bless Norman St John\n&#x2011;\nStevas\n”\n was not a phrase \nI \nwas expecting \nto \nhear this afternoon. \nListen, \nI \nrecognise that when you do any reorganisation you learn lessons\n,\n and \nthe \nNHS has probably had more than its fair share of reorganisations over recent decades\n.\n \nT\nhat is \nwhy we have decided to make this very profound and significant change after this one, which was to say that\n,\n if people rejoined \nthe \nNHS within 12 months of leaving \nthe \nNHS as part of \na \nreorganisation\n,\n they should repay any redundancy\n money they were given on a pro-\nrata\n basis. So we have learned that. \nA\nll \nI \nwould say is that in terms of value for money\n—\nand \nI \nam sorry to repeat myself\n—\nthe \nonly reason that we are able now to be doing 600,000 more el\nective operations, and\n seeing 1.2 million more people every year in A and E\n,\n is because we have more people at \nthe \nfront line\n,\n and that was made possible by this\n&#xa0;\nreorganisation. \nO\nverall\n,\n \nI \nthink it was a very big improvement in value for money because it did allow more resources to be \ninvested \nin \nthe \nfront line, which is what we needed to do.\nQ291 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nI \ncongratulate\n you on your selective memory, but there was a transition and then a pause\n,\n and a number of people raised issues\n—\nprofessionals and we as a Select Committee\n did—\nabout \nthe \nHealth and Social Care Act and what was going to happen. \nI\nt is clear from \nthe\n letter that you sent \nme—\nand\n,\n obviously\n,\n \nI \nam a bit upset\n really—that\n in \none of \nthe \nsentences you say, “T\nhe Department holds information \nrelating to\n NHS managers who have been made redundant\n,\n but does not hold information on numbers re\n-\nhired as management consultants.\n” \nAre you saying that money is being paid out of \nthe \nDepartment of Health and you have no idea who it is being paid to?\nMr Hunt: \nWe make very significant multi\n&#x2011;\nmillion\n and multi\n&#x2011;\nbillion\n&#x2011;\npound\n grants to other organisations. We have \nthe \nsecond biggest bu\ndget in Government. Then we as\nsure how \nthe \nmoney is spent with all those organisations, which is a very important part of \nthe \nrole.\nQ292 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: Do you know that answer? D\noes someone know \nthe \nanswer?\nMr Hunt: \nWe do not know exactly how much money is spent by consultants in every single NHS organisation\n,\n and \nthe \nquestion we have to ask when we are asked questio\nns like that by m\nembers of \nthe \nSelect Committee is about \nthe \nvalue for money\n,\n because there are a lot of organisations throughout \nthe \nNHS and it is an expensive business to do that. \nI \ndo not know if you want to add anything, Richard.\nRichard Douglas: \nWe do not collect \nthe \ndata from every NHS organisation on precise\nly who they trade with day on\n day. \nQ293 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nBut setting \nthat\n aside\n, we are just talking about \nthe \nDepartment of Health because you do not seem to know\n—\n \nRichard Douglas: \nFor \nthe \nDepartment of Health itself\n—\n \nValerie Vaz: \nYou do know \nthe \nanswer?\nRichard Douglas: —\nas opposed to NHS organisations, we will have \nthe \ninformation on every single individual organisation that we have paid out of our budget. \nI\nf \nthe \nquestion is\n,\n \n“C\nould we say for \nthe \nDepartment of Health \nif there \nis any?\n”, y\nes, we could. \nI \ncould go back and do that.\nQ294 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nGood. So let us go back to where \nthis\n letter arose from. \nI \nsuppose we are a public exp\nenditure hearing or inquiry at \nthe \nminute, are we not? B\nut there is no\n mention of any money anywhere—\nno figures\n.\n Could we have another letter with some figures in?\nMr Hunt: \nI \nam not quite sure which of \nthe \nfigures you are saying are missing.\nValerie Vaz: \nOn \nthe \nanswers t\nhat you have given me; y\nou very carefully set it out.\nMr Hunt: Okay; \nI \nwill look over that letter\n.\n \nI\nf you could let me know \nthe \nexact bits where you would like\n—\n  \nQ295 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nFor all \nthe \nanswers\n to my questions here, you have numbers of people, but \nI \nthink it is quite helpful\n—\n \nChair: \nIt is \nthe \nletter you wrote to me.\nValerie Vaz: \nIt is dated 9 Dece\nmber\n or stamped 9 December.\nMr Hunt: \nWe will take that letter and have a look, and where we have numbers available\n—\nQ296 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: Great; w\ne need figures. Obviously\n,\n you have 84,838 temporary staff\n,\n and so we would like to know, roughly, what sort of money is going out of \nthe \naccounts. You say it is in \nthe \naccounts, but \nI think \nit would have been helpful to have \nthe \nfig\nures here for us. \nJust on \nthe \nother point, to clarify, because obviously Sir David was there and there were lots of \n“\nI \ndon’\nt know\n”\n answers, this letter has been written by you\n. S\no\n,\n ultimately\n,\n are you \nthe \nperson responsible for all this information? \nI\nf we want information, do we ask you? You are not going \nto \nsay, \n“\nPlease ask Sir David.\n”\nMr Hunt: \nI \nwill either provide you \nwith \nthe \ninformation myself or direct you to somewhere where you can get \nthe \ninformation. \nQ297 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nSo you do not feel that \nyou\n have a responsibility to \nthe \npublic that you should be answering for NHS England or anyone else. Is that as a result of what has happened under \nthe \nHealth and Social Care Act?\nMr Hunt: \nI \nam absolutely responsible for every penny of taxpayers\n’\n money that goes into \nthe \nNHS, but \nI \nbelieve\n—\nand\n,\n in fact\n,\n \nI \nthink this is a cross\n&#x2011;\nparty\n view\n—\nthat giving NHS organisations some autonomy in a huge ecosystem like \nthe \nNHS is a better way to get value for money than managing it as a sort of centralised monolith. \nT\nhere are occasions when you ask me for information where \nI \nwould go to an arm\n’\ns length body and ask them to provide that information or direct you to \nthe \narm\n’\ns length body.\nQ298 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nI \nam glad \nyou\n gave me that answer because it comes on to \nthe \nnext part\n,\n which is \nthe \nrole of \nthe \nCCGs\n, and they are statutory bodies\n, but now \nI \nunderstand they are going to be asked for a quarterly assessment of their effectiveness. Is that right?\nMr Hunt: \nI \nwill ask Sir David to respond to that.\nSir David Nicholson: \nYes. We have set up an assurance system, so quarterly\n—\n \nQ299 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nWhy \nis\n that? \nSir David Nicholson: \nWe think it is \nthe \nbest way of assuring ourselves that they are delivering what they said they would deliver.\nQ300 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nWhy are you \ndoing\n that now?\nSir David Nicholson: \nBecause we think it is part of our responsibilities to do that.\nQ301 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nYou did not think about it \nbefore\n?\n You did not think it was part of your responsibilities to find out what \nthe \nCCGs were doing before?\nSir David Nicholson: \nThis is on a relatively limited set of numbers around outcomes that we are agreeing with them as part of their planning.\nQ302 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: Tell us what they are. \nTell us what you are \ngoing\n to ask for.\nSir David Nicholson: \nThere are \nthe \nfive elements of \nthe \noutcomes framework, so stuff around mortality, \nthe \nquality of services for people with long\n&#x2011;\nterm conditions, their delivery against a\n whole series of safety issues and \ntheir patient experience issues. Let me get \nthe \nthree. There is \nthe \nstuff around \nthe \nway they govern themselves and organise themselves\n,\n because, as you know, they all went through an authorisation process and we have been working through with them. Some CCGs have had conditions attached to them, and we have been working with them to take them on. \nThen there is \nthe \nquality of \nthe \nleadership of their organisation. \nT\nhey are \nthe \nsorts of things you would expect us to do.\nQ303 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nSo they are not \nindependent\n. You would be a kind of “\nMonitor\n”\n of CCGs?\nSir David Nicholson: \nI \nwould not describe us as a “\nMonitor\n”\n of CCG\ns\n, but we are assuring ourselves that they are delivering on what they said they would deliver.\nQ304 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nDo you feel you have enough tools for that or do you think you might need some more?\nSir David Nicholson: \nThe\n&#xa0;\ntools are those that are set out in \nthe \nAct\n,\n and, like other organisations now, \nwe \nhave \nto have \na very clear protocol as to \nthe \nway we deal with organisations that do not deliver. \nW\ne think we have \nthe \ntools available to us to ensure that CCGs are either delivering great outcomes \nfor\n their patients or are taking \nthe \naction that they need to put themselves in place to do so.\nQ305 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nWhat is \nthe \nsanction if they do not?\nSir David Nicholson: \nWe have a whole variety of sanctions, if you like, \nsuch as \nliterally withholding resource from them. We can withhold their quality premium. As you know, there is \n£0.25 billion available to CCGs—an incentive fund—\nto deliver against those sorts of things\n;\n so we can either give them that or \nwithhold it\n. \nI \nhave \nthe \npower\n—\nhow can \nI \nput it in \nthe \nright way\n?—or \none of \nthe \nthings that \nI \ndo is\n \napprove \nthe \naccountable officer of \nthe \norganisation, so \nI \ncan withdraw \nthe \npowers of \nthe \naccountable officer. We can put people into \nthe \norganisation, so we can insist that they have people to intervene to make things happen. \nW\ne have a variety of things that we can do if we can sustain and justify \nthe \npoint that we are not just taking action as a matter of our will but it is based on some real measurable alterations to \nthe \nservices that they \nare \ncommission\ning\n. \nQ306 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nSo they are set up as local \norganisations\n making local decisions\n,\n but NHS England is going to be \nthe \nspider in \nthe \nmiddle\n,\n presumably\n,\n with \nthe \nten\ntacles that control all of them?\nSir David Nicholson: \nMonitor as a spider with tentacles. \nI \nthink\n—\n \nValerie Vaz: Well, y\nou think of something else then.\nSir David Nicholson: \nI \ncannot think of a better one than you have. We are certainly there on behalf of patients and \nthe \ntaxpayer to ensure that they are doing \nthe \nbest that they can for their local populations.\nQ307 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: W\nill \nyou be \ntaking\n a strategic view? A\n local CCG \nmay make\n a decision, say, about reconfiguration and they take a strat\negic view that both of you like, but w\nhat happens in \nthe \nsituation where you do not like it? Do you take a strategic view? Who is going to take \nthe \nstrategic view?\nSir David Nicholson: \nWe have said in \nthe \nplanning guidance that we published today that CCGs have to come up with their own plans for their own localities for \nthe \nnext five years\n—\ntwo years operational, five years strategic. But for some services they have to come together in larger groups\n,\n because, obviously, \nthe \npopulation size on which some of \nthe \nservices are planned \nis\n greater than an individual CCG. \nT\nhe \nprocess we would take is a process of assurance. They would set out their plans\n,\n organise their locality to make them happen\n,\n and we would assure ourselves that they were using \nthe \nfou\nr tests, for example, and make\n sure that they are properly consulting their public around them to enable us to make a judgment about whether they should go ahead.\nQ308 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nI \nthink \nI \nget what you are saying\n,\n but \nI \nam trying to work out why, then, if they are local and you have \nthe \nstrategic view, you need\n clause 118, Secretary of State.\nMr Hunt: C\nlause 118 is for \nthe \nvery particular situation where you have a trust that is in extreme difficulty and we need to find a solution because, for example, patient safety may be at risk\n.\n \nI\nt is incredibly important in \nthe \nwake of Francis that we have a structure in place that is able to sort out those problems quickly and decisively\n. A\ns part of \nthe \ntrust special administrator\n’\ns remit, when a trust goes into administration, they are required to consult CCGs and \nthe \nfour tests do apply, but \nthe \nfour tests were never meant to give any individual CCG in a situation \nthat\n involved multiple CCGs an absolute veto on change. \nW\ne did not believe we needed clause 118 until \nthe \nHigh Court ruled that \nI \nwas not able to do what \nI \ndid over Lewisham hospital\n.\n \nW\ne realised that\n,\n in fact\n,\n \nthe \nintention of \nthe \nAct was not reflected in how \nthe \ncourts interpreted it;\n so that is why we need to make \nthe \nchange in clause 118.\nQ309 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nRig\nht. S\no it goes \nwider\n than just failing trusts, does it not? You have a very wide power there. Have you taken advice on that?\nMr Hunt: \nIt applies to situations where trusts are in administration\n.\n \nT\nhat is why it is really important.\nQ310 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nIs \nthat \nright\n, Secretary of State—\njust trusts in administration?\nMr Hunt: \nI \nbelieve so.\nQ311 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nAll right, okay. Does \nanybody\n else want to comment? \nI \nunderstood it was much wider than that. Is it not?\nMr Hunt: \nAs \nI \nunderstand it, it is to deal with \nthe \nsituation that \nI \nhave to\n—\n \nQ312 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nSo if you lose in \nthe \ncourts, you have a power?\nMr Hunt: \nNo, it is not if \nI \nlose in \nthe \ncourts. It is because we believed that \nI \nwas entitled to do that in \nthe \ncase of Lewisham\n; \nthe \nHigh Court disagreed\n,\n \nso\n we have to respect \nthe \ncourt\n judgment.\nValerie Vaz: Yes, you do.\n \nMr Hunt: B\nut we want to change \nthe \nlaw now to make it clear that\n—\n \nValerie Vaz: \nNot to respect \nthe \ncourt judgment.\nMr Hunt: \nNo. The\n&#xa0;\ncourt was interpreting \nthe \nlaw as it \nstands\n before, but Parliament is always entitled to change \nthe \nlaw, as you well know.\nQ313 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nBut you changed \nthe \nlaw afterwards because you did not like \nthe \njudgment. You wanted to give yourself wider powers.\nMr Hunt: \nNo, we changed \nthe \nlaw afterwards because we believed that we were entitled to do something under \nthe \nprevious law that \nthe \ncourt disagreed with and we think it is incredibly important for patient safety reasons. \nI \nam happy to write to you with chapter and verse as to how we intend clause 118 to be applied. \nQ314 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nThat would be great\n,\n \nbecause\n \nI \nthink \nthe \nunderstanding is that it is not just failing trusts\n,\n but \nthat \nyou can take over anything\n t\nhat you want to\n. Clarification would be really helpful. \nCan \nI \ngo \nback\n to a question \nthat \nI \nasked you in \nthe \nChamber—\nand \nthe \nChair has been very kind and i\ns allowing me to ask this again?\n \nI \ndid not quite get an answer from \nyou, apart from a political one.\nChair: \nI \nam kind—\nor just recognising reality.\nValerie Vaz: \nKind, \nI \nhope\n, Chair. \nThe question is on \nthe \nunderspend\n. There is some \nunderspend\n from \nthe \nprevious year, £2 billion\n,\n and \nthe \nyear before that\n,\n and £600 million this year. You know that \nthe \nCollege\n of \nEmergency Medicine\n—\n \nMr Hunt: £600 million this year?\nValerie Vaz: \nYes. If you dispute \nthe \nfigures, please write to us; that would be great.\nRichard Douglas: We do not h\nave \nthe \nunder\nspend\n for this year until we reach \nthe \nend\n of the\n year.\nQ315 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: Up until \nthe \nend, but \nit is \n£600 million so far. If you dispute any of these figures, please write to us and let us know what \nthe \nunderspend\n is\n. Why did it go back to \nthe \nTreasury? Why \ndid it \nnot \ngo \nto front\n&#x2011;\nline \nservices\n? T\nhe \nCollege\n of \nEmergency Medicine\n are desperate for doctors\n. \nMr Hunt: \nThere are two reasons. It is \nthe \npractice of all Governmen\nts, including \nthe \nlast Labour G\novernment, that they return \nunderspends\n to \nthe \nTreasury\n.\n \nT\nhe\n&#xa0;\nunderspend\n that we have been returning to \nthe \nTreasury in \nthe \nNHS is broadly similar to \nthe \nlevels of \nunderspend\n that were returned to \nthe \nTreasury under \nthe \nprevious Government. So this is Government accounting practice. The\n&#xa0;\npoint \nI \nwould make\n—\nand \nI \nthink it is really important to understand\n—\nis that under Government accounting rules \nthe \nunderspend\n, if it is going to be used for something else, has to be spent within \nthe \nsame financial year\n.\n \nS\no it is not always \nthe \npanacea that it seems\n,\n because if you have a multi\n&#x2011;\nbillion\n pound \nunderspend\n you would only be able to give it to somewhere that could actually use that money in that very year, \nin\n a matter of a couple of months. \nT\nhat is why, in practice, it is much more difficult to use \nthe \nunderspend\n in \nthe \nway that you are suggesting.\nQ316 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nHowever, you have had Francis saying we need \nmore nurses, and \nthe \nCollege\n of \nEmergency Medicine\n saying for \nthe \nlast \nthree\n years there was a 50% non\n&#x2011;\nfill\n of emergency doctors and consultants\n.\n \nY\nou said to me in a previous session that it was Stalinist to plan\n,\n and \nI \nam saying to you \nthat \nyou had this information t\nwo years ago, you had \nthe \nmoney and\n you could even use it for a pay rise, which you are desperate to give to \nthe \nstaff of \nthe \nNHS. Why do you not use that money for that purpose?\nMr Hunt: \nFor \nthe \nreason that \nthe \nfinance director just explained. This is money that has been committed to NHS budgets in many \ndifferent \nparts of \nthe \nNHS \nand\n we did not know \nthat \nwe were going to \nunderspend\n until it came to \nthe \nend of \nthe \nyear. S\no it is not possible to plan in advance to spend an \nunderspend\n,\n except with very small margins.\n \nW\ne have done that, for example, this year with \n£\n150 million of \nthe \n£400 million that is going to help support hospitals deal with winter A and E pressures and we used some \nunderspend\n money for that last year. \nI\nt is possible to do that where you are very certain that you are going to \nunderspend\n by a certain amount, but it is not possible to plan at \nthe \nstart of \nthe \nyear to fund things like pay rises from \nunderspend\n because you do not know. This money does not sit in \nthe \nDepartment of Health. It gets distributed out to CCGs and they distribute it out to trusts\n,\n and so it is sitting in many different parts of \nthe \nsystem.\nQ317 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nNow you will know because you are going to be monitoring what \nthe \nCCGs do. Secretary of State, you went to \nChina\n. Did you go on a personal basis or on behalf of \nthe \nDepartment of Health? \nMr Hunt: \nI \nwent as a Government representative. \nQ318 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nI \nhave a quick question rel\nated to what we were discussing and it is\n about patient choice. It has often been said that patient choice is at \nthe \nheart of \nthe \nhealth service now—\na complete change in thinking. Going back to clinical commissioning groups and what Sir David was saying just now, do you have a mechanism for how clinical commissioning groups are taking note of \nthe \nchanges in patient requests—\nhow patient choice is actually working on \nthe \ng\nround? We had your\n&#xa0;\nMinister of S\ntate recently in front of \nthe \nCommittee and \nI \nasked him whether patient choice had priority over doctor choice\n.\n \nI \nthink \nthe \nanswer was that patient choice came first. \nI\nf this \nis actually happening, are we \nrecording them\n now? I\nn this new paradigm\n \nare we trying to draw any information, i\nf there is any new information—and maybe there is not—\nfrom \nthe \nclinical \ncommissioning \ngroups on how patients are exercising patient choice? If they have patient choice, presumably they are doing something with it.\nMr Hunt: \nPatient choice is a right under \nthe \nNHS constitution, so nothing should change with respect to \nthe \nnew powers being given to clinical commissioning groups\n.\n \nI\nn terms of choice of provider\n,\n \nthe \nchoices that patients had before still exist\n,\n and indeed we want to extend them where we can. The\n&#xa0;\nchallenge is to make a reality of that ability to choose. \nS\nometimes people want to change their GP, for example, but they find \nthe \nGP they want to get to is not accepting new patients and so their effective choice is not as great as it might be. \nS\nometimes\n,\n people do not know about their ability to choose\n as well\n. \nT\nhere is much work to do\n,\n but it is one of \nthe \nmechanisms we have for promoting a patient\n&#x2011;\ncentred\n NHS.\nQ319 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nI \nhave one follow\n&#x2011;\nup on this. With personal budgets, \nI \nunderstand that there has been a great success in that patients and carers are finding it easier to manage their lives and their budgets\n,\n and \nthe \ntreatments \nthe \npatients choose are \nvery successful.\n \nI \nsee Mr Rouse nodding his head, which is a very encouraging start. Surely\n,\n if this is \nthe \nparadigm with \nthe \nsmall budget for personal budgets, then this is something we need to roll out a little further. Perhaps we can let Mr Rouse, through you, Chair, respond and then \nI \nwill say no more.\n \nJon Rouse: \nWe have made some good progress on personal budgets\n,\n and of course this is something that cuts across both social care and health, and social care were \nthe \nforerunners\n.\n \nAs of this year,\n we are now up at 55% of people with social care packages with personal budgets. We have a target of 70%\n,\n and \nthe \nCare Bill will take that to 100% because it will become an entitlement for those who want it\n. Then, of course, with \nextens\nion into continuing health care, \nyou begin to be able to put personal care and personal health budgets together if you have a long\n&#x2011;\nterm condition so \nthat \nyou have a lot more control of your life and can make your own choices. \nO\nbviously\n,\n we \nmust \nnot do it in a way that undermines \nthe \nproper operating of \nthe \nhealth system, but\n,\n where there is \nthe \nability to do so, personal health budgets are definitely an expression of control and choice.\nQ320 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: \nI \nhave a quick question for Mr \nDouglas about \nthe \nunderspend\n—\nwhether there is any mechanism at all towards \nthe \nend of \nthe \nyear\n,\n or once it becomes clear what level of \nunderspend\n there is, \nwhereby\n some of that could be used to repay PF\nI \ndebt\n.\n \nI \nask because it\n seems \nthat PF\nI \npayments are just an ongoing drag on \nthe \nwhole system\n.\nRichard Douglas: \nThere are two things there. One is\n—\nand \nI \nthink \nthe \nSecretary of State said\n—that \nthe \nunderspend\n is \nthe \nsum of 473 organisations, so trying to pick \nthat \nup organisation by organi\nsation and then potentially moving\n it around \nwould be difficult. Then, f\nor any trust or foundation trust we allow them to keep \nthe \ncash, so \nI \ncannot just go back and take \nthe \ncash from them. They can keep \nthe \ncash and spend it in future years. It is not\n—\n \nQ321 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: \nSo th\ney can spend it in future years?\nRichard Douglas: \nThey can spend \nthe \ncash. \nI\nt is clear with foundation trus\nts that \nthe \ncash goes into their bank accounts as part of their surplus\n. It is there and \nit does not get taken back from them. The\n&#xa0;\nissue \nI \nthink we discussed last year is that\n,\n at \nthe \npoint at which they spend it\n, it\n scores against \nthe \nspending limit of \nthe \nDepartment, but it is there for them to spend. \nI \nhave looked at what we could do around PF\nI \ndebt and whether there would be opportunities to use some capital \nunderspends\n for that purpose. The\n&#xa0;\ndifficulty is that every time we have looked at this\n—\nthe \nvalue for money of tryin\ng to re\n&#x2011;\nopen\n one of those deals—\nit does not stack up financially. So \nit\n is not a simple thing\n,\n \nsuch \nas we pay down a bit of debt. \nThey are\n quite complicated financial arrangements \nthat \nwe ha\nve in most of th\ne\n deals\n. \nI \nhave not yet found a way t\nhat we can use money in a value-for-\nmoney sense that could buy out some of \nthe \nPFIs. It is something that we will keep looking at because\n,\n if there is an \nunderspend\n on \nthe \ncapital side\n,\n it is something potentially we could do.\nChair: Mr\n Douglas has given us enough evidence to offer an opinion again about \nthe \nabsurdity of end\n&#x2011;\nyear\n inflexibility \nas it exists for NHS trusts. \nQ322 &#xa0; \nGrahame M. Morris: \nSecretary of State, you are aware that we have invited you here as part of our inquiry into public expenditure in \nthe \nNHS. In \nthe \ns\necond of our terms of reference\n that we are looking at is \nthe \neffectiveness of \nthe \nmechanisms by which resources are distributed geographically in \nthe \nNHS. \nI \nam sure you \ncan\n recall from our debate yesterday that some concerns were expressed about NHS England\n’\ns current remit to review \nthe \nformula by which resources are allocated to clinical commissioning groups. To begin with, Secretary of State, how satisfied are you that \nthe \nmechanisms for deciding on geographical allocations of funding\n—\nto CCGs for primary care and specialised services\n—\nare both effective and fair in providing sufficient resources on \nthe \nbasis of need?\nMr Hunt: \nThe\n&#xa0;\nfirst point to make is that this is such an important issue\n—\nGrahame M. Morris: \nIt is very important.\nMr Hunt:\n \n—\nthat \nit is really important that it is\n put beyond party politics. That is why my predecessor decided that that should be a decision that was made at arm\n’\ns length from serving Secretaries of State\n,\n and that is what we have done. \nIn terms of how good \nthe \nmechanisms are\n—\nand \nI \nwill ask Sir David to comment because it is \nthe \nresponsibility of NHS England\n—\nas they have been explained to me, \nI \nam very happy with \nthe \nprinciples that are used. \nT\nhe\n&#xa0;\nchallenge that we have is that\n,\n where overall \nthe \nNHS budget is not increasing by any significant margin, where you have people who are a long way off what their target allocation would be under any funding formula, it is incredibly difficult to move more closely to that target funding without other people having to lose out\n.\n \nT\nhat is \nthe \nreal challenge that we have. \nI \ndo not know if Sir David wants to add anything about \nthe \nprinciples.\nSir David Nicholson: \nYes. This morning NHS England have considered an extensive paper on allocation. It is all in \nthe \npublic domain. We did it openly and transparently for everyone to see and that document is available for everybody. You can, if you want, go home tonight and watch \nthe \nlive stream\n—\nnot live obviously\n but \nthe \nwhole of \nthe \ndebate we had at NHS England.\n \nThis is \nthe \nfirst time in my experience that allocations have been done in such a transparent and open way \nwith\n \nthe \nworkings of how you got there also being set out to \nthe \npublic in a way they have never been done before. Inevitably, in \nthe \ncircumstances, there is a kind of technocratic argument, a technical argument, around it all\n,\n but there is one of principle as well. \nI \ndo not know whether you want me to go on to \nthe \nprinciple bit yet or\n—\nQ323 &#xa0; \nGrahame M. Morris: \nI \nhave a number of questions. \nI \nhave stayed very quiet because \nI \nthink this is really very important\n,\n bo\nth to me and a number of other Committee m\nembers\n,\n and it has been a focus of a number of debates, but \nI \nwonder if \nI \ncan pick up a couple of points that both you and \nthe \nSecretary of State have made\n.\n \nW\ne are aware on \nthe \nCommittee that there has been a written statement produced today\n,\n which is very brief. \nI \nmust say \nthat \nI \nam rather disappointed that it does \nsay—\nalthough you hav\ne said it is already available—\nthat \nthe \nfinal documents will be published by NHS England on \nthe \nwebsite by Friday 20 December\n,\n which is \nthe \nday we go into recess\n;\n so we will not have any opportunity to hold \nthe \nMinisters to account. Is that not right?\nSir David Nicholson: It says that. You have probably picked up that \nthe \nmeeting \nitself took place this morning. T\nhere were a number of options available to NHS England about which one it chose\n,\n and my guess is \nthat\n turning that document into something p\nristine will take a bit of time. B\nut to short\n&#x2011;\ncircuit that\n,\n we can circulate that document and it was option 4 that we agreed.\nQ324 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nCould\n we have that before Friday?\nSir David Nicholson: Yes;\n you can have it straight away.\nChair: \nIt is on \nthe \nwebsite, as \nI \nunderstand it.\nQ325 &#xa0; \nGrahame M. Morris: \nNot in \nits\n final form. \nI \nthink \nthe \nkind of online consultation\n—\nI \nhave forgotten what it is called\n—\nis there, but \nI \ndo not think \nthe \nfinal version is there\n,\n and, according to \nthe \nwritten statement, it is not available \nuntil\n Friday. But \nI \nwant to ask you a couple of questions just on this subject. \nI \nhave been lobbied heavily, as have other Members of Parliament, by our clinical commissioning groups, \nthe \nBMA, local government and \nthe \ndirectors of public health\n,\n who are all very concerned about \nthe \npossible consequences for particularly more deprived and poorer areas of any change in \nthe \nfunding formula where there is a greater emphasis placed on areas that have more ag\ne\ning populations\n,\n which presumably, by definition, must have better health outcomes because people live longer. \nI \nwant \nto seek \nsome clarification on where we go and on what evidence NHS England have come to their conclusions\n,\n because \nI \nam rather concerned, having had discussions with people who know about these things, in terms of populations, \nas to \nwhether there has been any assessment of \nthe \nnumbers of disabled people in populations\n.\n \nT\nhat is relevant\n, for example, in my area because \nit was a coal\n&#x2011;\nmining\n area\n,\n with shipbuilding and steel on \nthe \ndoorstep\n.\n \nT\nhe \nphysical manifestation of that in later life is that many people su\nffer from pneumoconiosis, COPD and \nforms of \nmesothelioma\n, and that must have an impact \non \nthe \ncall on health resources, although,\n \np\nerversely\n,\n if it is going to be on age\n,\n those people die prematurely so that would not be reflected in \nthe \nallocation. \nT\nhat is a huge concern and \nI \nhope, when NHS England are considering \nthe \nformula, there is a proper equalities impact study, or whatever it is called, to weight that\n.\n \nW\nhat \nare \nthe \nimplications \nof using \nthe \nONS population \ndata rather than GP list sizes? \nI \nwant\n to ask \nthe \nSe\ncretary of State\n because you very niftily said, \n“\nSir David Nicholson, this is one of \nthe \nareas of responsibility that is devolved to you.\n”\n Whatever it says in \nthe \nActs, \nI \ncan \nas\nsure you that people in my area hold me to account for resource allocations and \nI \nintend to hold you to account for them as well. \nD\no you share my concern that it is your responsibility to ensure that CCGs have \nthe \nnecessary resources to be able to provide funding to provide \nthe \ntreatment that people require?\nMr Hunt: \nI \ncompletely agree with that and \nI \nwant to stress that \nI \nam completely accountable for \nthe \ndecisions that NHS England ma\nke. \nI \nhave subcontracted that decision, \nor \nthe \nAct\n—\nI \nshould say more accurately—subcontracts that \ndecision to them because we think it is better if it is decided at arm\n’\ns length from Ministers\n,\n but \nI \nam completely accountable for \nthe \ndecision to \nmake\n that decision at arm\n’\ns length and\n,\n indeed\n,\n for whatever it is that they actually decide. As \nI \nunderstand it\n—\nSir David will correct me if \nI \nam wrong\n—\nthe \ndecision that NHS England took this morning, option 4, does include a weighting for social deprivation so that it does take account of some of \nthe \nfactors that you have talked about. \nQ326 &#xa0; \nGrahame M. Morris: \nThere was already weighting there for social deprivation. Is there any change in it?\nMr Hunt: \nAs \nI \nunderstand it, no, but \nI \nwill allow Sir David to come in\n. \nI \ncould just add that \nI \nthink it is also a matter of social justice\n. \nI \nagree with you \nthat in \nthe \nend \nit is \nabout need\n,\n and that means that we do need to respect \nthe \nneeds of older people because they have greater health needs than younger people and it is important that we have a formula that adequately reflects their needs\n.\n \nI\nt is also important that it is a formula that reflects \nthe \nneeds of people who live in pockets of deprivation and not just people who live in areas where deprivation is more widespread\n,\n because people who live in pockets of deprivation also have \nthe \nkind of needs that you talked about.\nQ327 &#xa0; \nGrahame M. Morris: \nI \nhave \none more supplementary. Just before \nthe \nmeeting started, my colleague Andrew George and \nI \nwere having an argument about CCGs\n—\nor a discussion\n—\nabout allocations about \nthe \nareas \nthat\n were furthest away from target\n,\n and \nI \ncan remember being part of \nthe \nlobbying effort. This is when we had relatively small PCTs and we h\nad one for Easington lobbying \nJohn Reid\n,\n who was \nthe \nHealth Minister at \nthe \ntime\n,\n because Easington was \nthe \nfurthest away in \nthe \ncountry. \nI \nd\no not know whether that is lost or has\n b\neen subsumed into a larger PCT and\n then \na \nCCG, but\n,\n \nas to \nthe \nability to target pockets of deprivation, \nI \ndo not know whether you have thought about how that might be achieved. \nI \nknow in local government we use super output areas to tackle particular pockets, but it might be something that needs some further work.\nMr Hunt: \nI \nthink we have put that in.\nSir David Nicholson: \nI \nam not quite sure at what level to deal with this\n,\n but \nas to \nthe \nissues that we are faced with\n,\n \nlet us\n think about 12 months ago, when we originally looked at this as NHS England for \nthe \nallocations for this financial year and we were faced with \nthe \nwork that ACRA had been asked to do by \nthe \nGovernment, which essentially said that older people w\nere \nthe \nbig driver in \nthe \nway that you should allocate resources\n. T\nhe\n&#xa0;\nissue for us, when we looked at that as an issue to change \nthe \nformula, was that we did not think it necessarily dealt with \nthe \nissue that you describe, which is unmet need, because very often most of \nthe \nallocation form in \nthe \npast was dr\niven by utilisation of resource.\n \nI\nf you use a lot of resource you tend to get \nit, \nbut how do you deal with unmet need? \nT\nhis whole issue about deprivation and unmet need was an important thing\n,\n and we have\n been working with \nACRA over \nthe \nlast 12 months to get that in \nthe \nright kind of place. \nA\ns far as \nthe \nallocation to CCGs is concerned\n,\n we have put a 10% weighting on deprivation for CCGs and a 15% weighting for primary care\n,\n because we think that primary care is a much more targeted way of delivering more equal services for patients. \nThe\n&#xa0;\nsecond area was how you measure that deprivation\n,\n and we are using \nthe \nstandard\nised mortality ratio for under-\n75s\n.\n The\n&#xa0;\nexperts tell us that that is \nthe \nbest way because it captures \nthe \n“early die-\ners\n”\n, if you like, that you have described there and does give you a better case for it. It also has \nthe \nbenefit of being able to pinpoint relatively small populations\n.\n \nThe example in \nthe \npaper for o\nne of \nthe \nissues we were tackling is \nIpswich\n. Ipswich in \nSuffolk\n, if \nyou look at \nthe \ntotality of \nthe \npopulation, does relatively well in terms of \nthe \nhealth of its population and \nhas \na relatively low growth rate in terms of its allocation. But there are particular points in \nIpswich\n, particular localities\n,\n which are among \nthe \nmost deprived in \nthe \ncountry. By using \nthe \nSMR &lt;\n75\n,\n you can pinpoint very small localities in your allocation process and so identify them and give \nthe \nbenefit to \nthe \nC\nCGs for that. So that is one thing. \nThe\n&#xa0;\nsecond thing was population\n. T\nhere has been significant population shift over \nthe \nlast few years that we thought had to be taken account of in what we did\n,\n and that is what we have done in \nthe \nallocation process.\nQ328 &#xa0; \nGrahame M. Morris: \nThey are very full answers, but \nI \nthink they generate \nsome more thoughts and questions. C\nan you \ntell\n us where we are going in terms of option 4? What does that mean for \nthe \nnext few years?\nSir David Nicholson: With \nthe \nallocation arrangements that we have put into place, first\n,\n \nthe \nmost deprived populations get \nthe \nmost money. That is \nthe \nfirst and most obvious thing. \nI\nf you are \nthinking about somewhere like \nKnow\ns\nley\n at \nthe \none end\n,\n \nit \nwill get, \nI \nthink, £1,500 per head\n,\n and Oxford CCG at \nthe \nother end \nwill get\n £850. \nThe\n&#xa0;\nmoney goes, on a per-\nhead basis, to \nthe \nmost deprived population. That is \nthe \nfirst thing. \nS\necond\nly, \nthere is \na \nshift around \nthe \ncountry in terms of population\n.\n \nY\nou can see that in \nthe \nway \nthe \npopulation has moved\n,\n and that is recognised in \nthe \nway we have allocated \nthe \nresource. \nT\nhird\nly,\n \nwe wanted to ensure—\nit was one of \nthe \nthings that was put in \nthe \nmandate from \nthe \nDepartment—that we kept\n as much stability as we could in \nthe \nNHS\n,\n so \nthat \neveryone is getting flat real terms no matter where they are in \nthe \nsystem. \nE\nverybody gets that basic thing. But we have been able to invest about £250 million\n in bringing some of \nthe \npeople\n furthest away from target closer to target\n,\n and what we are saying to people in terms of \nthe \nfive\n&#x2011;\nyear strategy is that they should assume that over \nthe \nnext five years we are going to work to bring people closer to target.\nQ329 &#xa0; \nGrahame M. Morris: \nAndrew\n says \nCornwall\n is \nthe \nfurthe\ns\nt\n away. What is \nthe \nbiggest percentage increase from areas that are furthest away from target?\nAndrew George: \nBelow target\n I did say\n.\nGrahame M. Morris: \nIs he right?\nSir David Nicholson: \nI \nwould not want to comment. \nI think y\nou should look at \nthe \nwhole thing. One of \nthe \nthings we tried to do all along is not to go through this process \nand identify\n where everyone is, \nbut \nto focus really hard on \nthe \narrangements so \nthat \nwe are absolutely fair and transparent in what we do.\nQ330 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nIt \nwould\n be very easy for \nthe \nwhole Select Committee to get into special pleading to manipulate \nthe \nformula to suit our own areas\n,\n and certainly \nwith \nmy area\n—\nit would not be easy because \nthe \nChair would stop us\n—\nI \nwould endorse \nthe \nview \nthat\n deprivation, age, and\n,\n \nI \nthink Sarah and \nI \nwould add\n,\n \nrurality\n and \nso on\n need to be there. \nOne element is \nthe \nmarket forces factor. \nI \nwould be interested to hear where that sits\n,\n because that is cause for significant concern in\n those areas where wage levels, \nindeed\n, outside \nthe \nNHS \nare rather lower and\n,\n therefore\n,\n those areas get lower investment in spite of \nthe \nfact that employees are on national pay scales. \nI \nwould be interested in that and you may wish\n to comment on it, but \nI \nwant \nreally to come back to \nthe \npoint where you arrived at, Sir David, that this \nis \nnot actually resource allocation\n but\n target allocation\n.\n \nThere is\n&#xa0;\nfrustration \nthat \nthe \npace of change, as \nI \nunderstand it, over \nthe \nlast d\necade, has been incredibly slow. Y\nou can set \nthe \ntargets, but it is almost a pointless exercise\n,\n because those areas that are significantly below target\n remain\n, \nand \nparticula\nrly those that are below target\n seem not to move very rapidly towards their target over a period of a decade, let us say\n. O\nne of \nthe \nreasons for that is because \nthe \nprevious and \nthe \npresent \nGovernment\n take \nthe \nview that those who are above their target should not experience \nthe \nshock wave of being moved closer to t\narget by reducing their budget. \nP\nroviding you\n continue to take that approach—\nwhile you say you think that people will be closer to target within a five\n&#x2011;\nyear period, \nI \nam not sure on \nthe \nbasis of \nthe \nevidence \nI \nhave seen that\n you are going to achieve that—\nhow realistic \nis \nit that you believe that you are going to achieve these target allocations within a five\n&#x2011;\nyear period\n?\nSir David Nicholson: \nI \nabsolutely understand what you are saying and \nI \nhave seen all those things in operation myself\n.\n \nI\nn a sense\n,\n this was \nthe \ndilemma for us because it is said, of course, that \nat \na time when you have very little growth \nit \nis \nthe \nlast time you should actually start thinking about moving this around. But\n,\n in a sense\n,\n that is why we have taken 12 months over getting this, we think, into \nthe \nright kind of place\n.\n \nP\nart of our statutory responsibilities as an organisation is to tackle inequalities. \nI\nt is not a statutory respons\nibility that we can put aside. \nWe have to do something about it\n,\n and over \nthe \nnext two years\n,\n because of \nthe \nspending review\n,\n we can\n give everyone flat real terms—\nwe \ncan \ngive everyone \nthe \nuplift\n—b\nut we can invest on making people close\nr\n to \nthe \ntarget. How quickly we can do that for \nthe \nthree years \nafter\n that will clearly depend on \nthe \nspending review afterwards. One of \nthe \noptions we looked at was, in a sense, not giving organisations \nthat\n were above target any increase at all, but we judge that that would be too destabilising for \nthe \nservice as a whole, particularly in those areas. \nI \nshould say, on \nthe \nother side, which is quite interesting, \nthat, \nof \nthe \n37 CCGs that we are worried about who are showing \nthe \nmost pressure financially at \nthe \nmoment, 31 are gainers from these arrangements. \nQ331 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nIn those areas that have been \nconsistently well above target—\nand most of them \nhave been in \nthe \nsouth-\neast, \nthe \nleafy suburbs and \nthe \nmetropolitan boroughs of London\n—\nit seems to me that some of them have b\ne\nen 10%, 12% or \nan \neven larger \nper cent \nabove target. Are you saying that they will be brought closer to \ntarget over \nthe \nnext five years? I\nn reality, unless \nthe \ntarget changes, that \nclearly \nis not going to happen because you are not going to be reducing \ntheir\n budgets.\nSir David Nicholson: T\nhe\n&#xa0;\ntargets have changed because we have changed \nthe \nallocation formula. \nY\nou have to look at \nthe \ntotality of all of that.\nQ332 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: W\ne \nhave\n to \nlook\n at it afresh. But\n,\n even so, let us say it is a new set of CCGs and health economies that are getting a target that is significantly below where their actual settlement is and no doubt\n will continue to be therefore. A\nre they going to be brought closer to target over a period of time?\nSir David Nicholson: \nYes, they are. It is part of our statutory responsibility to make that happen. The\n&#xa0;\nfact that we can make it happen at \nthe \nmoment by giving flat real terms to everybody is a benefit, but\n,\n if in \nthe \nfuture we are unable to do that\n,\n we will still have to look at \nthe \nway in which we are going to deal with those as health inequalities.\nQ333 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nBut you said that you would not be giving flat real terms settlements to\n—\n \nSir David Nicholson: No.\n \nI \nsaid we would give it so that everyone has flat real terms, yes.\nQ334 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: \nI \nhave to say \nI \nam \nrather\n appalled that there are going to be flat real terms and \nI \nwas not clear whether there was going to be any extra weighting for age, but that matters in an area like mine where they \nare \n31 years ahead of \nthe \ncurve in terms of \nthe \nchanges in age structure\n.\n \nB\ny \nthe \nend of 2021 they are going to have 4.9% of their population over 85 as opposed to 2.9% nationally. In addition to that, they have pockets of very serious deprivation\n,\n and in other parts of \nthe \nCCG they have \nreal \nissues about \nrurality\n and \nsparsity\n and \nthe \nextra costs that go with that. \nW\nhat comfort is there for CCGs like that\n,\n which, if you like, have all of those very challenging issues?\nSir David Nicholson: \nThe\n&#xa0;\nformula takes account of all of that and you will see that\n,\n in \nthe \ntarget allocations\n,\n that is taken \ninto \naccount\n. But c\nan \nI \nsay that \nI \ndid not mean that everybody got flat rea\nl terms and nobody got any more? We have about £250 million now, \nand \nthe \nallocation paper sets out\n how—\nI \nwill get it absolutely right—\neither 70 or 71 CCGs can make more rapid progress and get more than fl\nat real terms for \nthe \ntwo years 2014\n&#x2011;\n15 and 2015\n&#x2011;\n16. W\nhen you look at \nthe \nallocation you will see that in it.\nQ335 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: C\nan \nI \nask about \nthe \nage issue\n? B\necause \nof\n \nthe \nlink between being over 85 and real challenges in terms of extra need\n, i\ns there going to be a change in \nthe \nweighting for age or \nsparsity\n?\nSir David Nicholson: Certainly age\n \nbut \nnot for \nsparsity\n.\nQ336 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: \nIs \nthat\n something you would consider for \nthe \nfuture?\nSir David Nicholson: \nYes. When \nI \nlast came to \nthe \nCommittee \nyou raised \nthe \nissue with \nPaul \nBaumann,\n and we said we would t\nake it back to \nACRA for them to have another look. They have looked at it before and concluded about three years ago that there was not sufficient evidence to support a weighting for that\n.\n \nG\niven that things have moved on\n,\n there is more information about what happens and we can \nnow \ndo this very much more identified small population work, we are going to ask them to look again at \nsparsity\n. \nChair: \nBarbara \nis \nnext and then we are going to move on\n.\n Leicestershire is going to take a self\n&#x2011;\ndenying ord\ni\nnance from \nthe \nChair and Mr \nTredinnick\n, but w\ne are not going to have pleadings from every authority.\nQ337 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nThis is a kind of a pleading\n,\n but, as we were talking about age, it is a plea on behalf of carers. When we were talking \nearlier\n about \nthe \nintegration fund\n,\n you said you would be getting in and examining \nthe \nplans. A real concern \nI \nhave is that \nthe \ncarers\n’\n break\ns\n funding\n,\n which is in this pooled large amount of money\n,\n might just get swallowed up. \nT\nhis is a plea not to do that\n,\n because \nI \nthink some of \nthe \nchanges that have been made in \nthe \nway that we fund care\n,\n and \nit \ncould be in integration\n,\n mean that carers lose out. \nI \nhad a case \nthat\n \nI \ntalked \nabout yesterday of an elderly couple \nwho\n were getting eight weeks\n’\n respite care when it was organised by \nthe \nlocal authority and it gets lost within a personal budget so that\n,\n effectively\n,\n all they have now is three weeks and it is not enough. They are older people looking after an adult son\n,\n and that is quite a hard task that they have taken on\n.\n \nWith t\nhis undermining of respite care\n, it\n is a real worry\n, w\nhen you start pooling funding\n,\n \nthat \nsomething like that just gets lost. It got \nlost a bit in local authorities—\nand \nI \nknow that this Government \nare not very keen on ring\n&#x2011;\nfencing\n—\nbut\n,\n if you do not do something to tie it to some outcomes or to something\n,\n it will \njust \nvanish\n,\n and that would be a real concern.\nMr Hunt: \nI \nthink that is a very fair concern and we will certainly take that away. Jon, \nI \ndo not know if you want to add anything to that in terms of \nthe \nprocess.\nJon Rouse: \nThere are two things. One, you have to put this in \nthe \noverall context of \nthe \nCare Bill as well and new rights for carers that will come in at \nthe \nsame time in April 2015. \nQ338 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nBut it does not have funding attached to the\n rights.\n \nJon Rouse: \nNo, but there is that right to assessment and to access to certain services. Then\n,\n in terms of \nthe \nfund itself, we have put a number of things into \nit:\n \nthe \ncarers\n’\n money, \nreablement\n money\n,\n \nthe \nDFG\n—\n \nBarbara Keeley: \nAdaptations.\nJon Rouse: \nThat was done for a clear purpose\n,\n which was to send a strong signal\n: if we a\nre going to have an integrated approach to care, then it has to embrace \nthe \nneeds of carers. If we are wrapping care around \nthe \nindividual, their \ncarer\n and family, then it has to take those carers\n’\n needs into acc\nount; also, in terms of \nthe \nDFG\n,\n you have to look at \nthe \nbroader environmental factors\n,\n and particularly \nthe \nrole of accommodation and housing providers and what happens in that accommodation as well. \nW\nhen \nthe \nplans come in\n,\n we are going to be looking for all of those things and how \nthey tie\n in\n \nto \nthe \ncondition we have set around co\n-\nordinated care. \nO\nf course, Ministers have \nthe \nfinal ability to sign off those plans once N\nHS England and local authority\n colleagues have had a chance to review them.\nBarbara Keeley: \nHence \nthe \nplea not to forget \nthe \ncarer role.\nChair: \nI \nam afraid there a\nre some questions that m\nembers of \nthe \nCommittee wish to pursue, so could we vote and come back in 10 minutes? Thank you.\n \nSitting suspended for a Division in the House.\nOn resuming—\n \nChair: \nThe Committee is \nquorate\n. \nI \nunderstand that both \nthe \nSecretary of State and Sir David have meetings elsewhere\n.\n \nI \nwrote to you, Secretary of\n State, on \nthe \nquestion of NHS Property S\nervices\n,\n and \nCharlotte\n wants to follow \nup your reply on that.\nQ339 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nThank you. First, thank you very much, everyone concerned, for your replies. My questions are pertinent to public expenditure obviously because o\nf \nthe \namount of money that NHS Property S\nervices represents in \nthe \nportfolio\n, and they are pertinent to Property S\nervices because it regards key individ\nuals and \nthe \nset\n&#x2011;\nup around\n&#xa0;\nProperty S\nervices\n.\n \nF\nrom \nthe \nanswers you have given me\n,\n it seems like it w\nas quite a tall order that\n&#xa0;\nNHS Property S\nervices had to perform\n,\n and, on a layman\n’\ns view, it looks like there were some significant teething difficulties \nthat\n people have worked hard to overcome\n. I\nt is that set\n&#x2011;\nup \nI \nwould like to probe a bit further\n,\n if that is all right. \nI \nwould like to \nthank \nthe \nSecretary of State for \nthe \ncorrespondence that \nI \nrequested, which \nI \nha\nve also requested through FOI. \nI \nwas quite \ndisappointed that \nI \nhad put in Freedom of I\nnformation requests for this correspondence and was told it was only available at disproportionate cost\n,\n which \nI \nwas surprised at\n,\n because it was two named pieces of correspondence with named authorship and sender\n. B\nut \nI \nwas able to get it quite easily\n,\n thanks to \nthe \nSecretary of State\n,\n who was very helpful in providing \nit. This is a request—in \nthat \nI \nwas slightly confused as to why \nthe \nFO\nI \nshould be so difficult to answer\n,\n but \nthen \nI \nwas able to get \nthe \ncorrespondence through other means\n. P\nerhaps you \nwill be\n able to take back to officials that it is not a very intuitive way of answering FOIs in that case\n.\n \nU\nnfortunately\n,\n \nthe \nCommittee was not given copies of \nthe \ncorrespondence \nI \nhave, so apologies to \nthe \nChair and \nthe \nCommittee that \nI \nam referring to material \nthat\n they have not been given. \nI \nam directing my questions to Richard Douglas, as \nI \nthink you are \nthe \nofficial to w\nhom \nthe \nindividual concerned, \nPeter Coates\n,\n reported. In \nthe \npiece of correspondence that \nthe \nDepartment very kindly provided for me regarding some\n correspondence between Peter \nCoates and Deloitte at \nthe \nbeginning of 2010\n,\n \nthe \nc\norrespondence refers to Peter \nCoates\n’s\n note of 19 January 2010 attaching further commentary. \nThere are \ntwo things. \nAs the Department\n kindly provided this correspondence, \nwould it be able to \nprovide \nthe \nnote \nof 19 January 2010 from Peter Coates to \nMike Turley of Deloitte so that we can see what that further commentary and \nthe \ncontents of it are? \nS\nince you were \nthe \nchief officer at that time, would you be able to enlighten\n us as to what this event was? They referred to “\nnormalising relationships\n”\n between Deloitte and \nthe \nDepartment\n,\n \n“\nthe \nmatter which we have been dealing with here\n”,\n and \n“\nfurther evidence\n”\n that they require. Could you let us know what that further evidence might be, what \nthe \nrelationships were that were required to be normalised, how they have been disruptive and \nthe \nbackground to \nthe \nletter?\nRichard Douglas: \nCould \nI \nsay first of all that none of that is linked to NHS Property Services Limited at\n all? This discussion with \nDeloit\nte was pre \nthe \ngeneral election and\n pre any idea \nthat \nw\ne would set up something like Property Services Limited.\n \nT\nhose two things are not connected. \nQ340 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: E\nxcept for \nthe \nconnection that \nI \ndrew between \nwhether\n there were concerns over an individual, which is what \nI \nsuppose we are questioning here, \nand \nthe \nappropriateness of th\nat individual then setting up NHS Property S\nervices with this question hanging over them, which \nI \nnote was not resolved until 28 May, whic\nh is after \nthe \ngeneral election.\n \nT\nhat is why \nI \nsuppose \nI \nam asking these questions\n.\n \nI\nt relates to \nthe \nappropriateness of \nthe \nindividual concerned\n.\n \nThen, if—and \nI \nam not saying it is—\nit was found \nthe \nindividual concerned was not appropriate because events were going on surrounding them in some way\n, of course\n that impacts \nthe \nset-\nup and \nthe \nwisdom of those to whom they reported a\nnd those who authorised his set-\nup as a director in terms of him being \nthe \nperson to set up a property company of £5 billion. \nA\nlthough it i\ns not directly to do with Property S\nervice\ns—\nI \ndo understand that—\nit is very pertinent to it and that is what \nI \nam trying to gain from you.\nRichard Douglas: Okay;\n we will go straight \nto\n \nthe \npoint that there was no\nthing in any discussions with Deloitte\n or anything that \nI \nhave ever seen that would have me question in any \nway \nthe \npersonal integrity of \nPeter Coates.\nQ341 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nCould you \ngive\n an illustration of\n—\nRichard Douglas: \nThe\n&#xa0;\nissue with Deloitte at \nthe \ntime was concern expressed to us about whether Deloitte were getting work at \nthe \nsame time as other consultancy firms were getting work.\nQ342 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: In what \nsense\n—\nthat they were getting more or less work?\nRichard Douglas: No; \na view about whether they were getting sufficient work r\nelative to other organisations. \nThat was something that was fully investigated and there were no issues about that at all.\nQ343 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: Why w\nas there any reason to suppose they would not be getting as much work? Was there any suggestion or events that led up to Deloitte raising these concerns? Who raised \nthe \nconcern that they were not \ngetting \nenough work?\nRichard Douglas: \nConcerns were raised separately in an anonymous letter to us \nand \nthat was fully investigated.\nQ344 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nThe\n anonymou\ns letter was sent to you saying,\n \n“\nWe do not think we are getting enough work.\n”\nRichard Douglas: \nIt was sent to \nthe \nPermanent Secretary of \nthe \nDepartment at \nthe \ntime.\nQ345 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nWho was that?\nRichard Douglas: It was \nSir Hugh Taylor at \nthe \ntime and that was fully investigated\n at the time\n.\nQ346 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: A\nn\n anonymous \nletter\n was sent to \nSir Hugh Taylor ra\nising concerns that Deloitte were\n not receiving enough work.\nRichard Douglas: \nYes.\nQ347 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nWould we be able \nto\n access that anonymous letter?\nRichard Douglas: \nI \nwould have to check back on that because that was subject then to \nan\n \ninvestigation \nby the \ndepartment. It was concerning individuals\n,\n and \nI \nwould have to check\n,\n from a legal and HR perspective\n,\n whether it would be appropriate for to us do that.\nQ348 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nOf course. \nWas\n it concerning individuals within \nthe \nDepartment or individuals within Deloitte?\nRichard Douglas: \nThat letter was concerning individuals within \nthe \nDepartment, yes.\nQ349 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: So n\no indi\nviduals in Deloitte were named. \nI \nam \njust \nstruggling to understand. You have \nnot really answered my question—\nRichard Douglas: \nIn their letter, no.\nCharlotte Leslie: —w\nhy Peter would want \n“\nfurther commentary\n”\n and \nto\n look into \nthe \npoints that \nwere\n raised in \nthe \nnote.\n \nWhat were those points that Peter raised in \nthe \nnote?\nRichard Douglas: \nPeter had had concerns about \nthe \nwork with Deloitte in relation to a couple of members of Deloitte staff at \nthe \ntime.\nQ350 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nWere those concerns ever substantiated?\nRichard Douglas: \nThey were not issues that were needed to be taken forward because we were having a normal business relationship with Deloitte.\nQ351 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nI \nam\n trying to get a narrative here so that \nI \ndo not have to keep on asking you boring questions and \nsubmit \nFOIs\n,\n which \nI \nam sure your officials are very tired of by now. Peter Coates raised concerns ab\nout two officials in Deloitte; \nso it is people in Deloitte.\nRichard Douglas: \nThere were issues about working with some individuals in Deloitte at \nthe \ntime. \nQ352 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nWere those \nissues\n ever substantiated? Was there any evidence of that? What was going on?\nRichard Douglas: \nI \ncannot remember \nthe \nprecise details that far back on that discussion with Deloitte. \nQ353 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: W\nas \nthe \nanonymous note with regard to Deloitte not getting enough work in any way related to Peter Coates \nraising\n concerns about two individuals at Deloitte? Is that an odd coincidence\n?\n \nP\neople might be afraid that, say, work was being diverted from Deloitte because an officer had concerns\n,\n which obviously turned out not to\n be substantiated?\nRichard Douglas: \nAs part of this\n,\n we looked at \nthe \ncontracts that had been let for consultancy services, \nthe \nbasis on which they had been let and whether Deloitte appear\ned\n to have been treated any differently \nfrom\n any other organisation. There was no evidence of that.\nQ354 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nSo Peter Coates\n’s\n concerns were what again?\nRichard Douglas: \nI \ncannot remember \nthe \nprecise nature of it going back to 2010.\nQ355 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nWould they be in \nthe \nnote attaching further commentary, would you imagine, that \nI \nam sure \nthe \nDepartment will be able to provide for me?\nRichard Douglas: \nI \nam not sure whether they are in that note or not.\nQ356 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nOkay. You can \nunderstand\n why this is of some concern because \nI \nam afraid your Department provides quite a lot of information informally from people who have been concerned about \nthe \nway things have been conducted. S\no \nI \nfeel it is my job as a Select Committee member to \nask\n these questions and \nI \nwould be most grateful if we were able to get that note of 19 January\n.\n \nA\nls\no, it refers to meetings as well. Could \nI \nget\n some assistance with FOIs regarding meetings that went on between key indi\nviduals? \nI \nhave to say \nI \nthink, and \nI \nthink \nthe \npublic find, that \nit \nis \nslightly upsetting and difficult to understand when simple requests \nfor\n meeting dates between individuals and minutes of those meetings come back as only ava\nilable at disproportionate cost. S\no\n,\n in \nthe \ninterests of my never having to raise issues like this again, \nI would ask \nthat those requests that \nI \nwill be putting in are treate\nd as effectively as possible. \nMy second question is regarding \nthe \nre\nplacement of \nthe \nchair of NHS Property S\nervices. An account was given in correspondence about that chair\n’\ns departure. What process is in place for appointing a new chairman?\nRichard Douglas: \nWe have advertised for a new chairman. There will be an appoint\nment panel that I,\n&#xa0;\nthe \nPermanent Secretary and one of our non\n&#x2011;\nexecutives\n from another arm\n’\ns length body will sit on. We will then make recommendations to Ministers on that appointment.\nQ357 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nHave you any ideas \nabout\n who this might be?\nRichard Douglas: \nThere are people that we would encourage to apply for it\n,\n and we will look and see what \nthe \nmarket produces as well.\nQ358 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: The\n&#xa0;\nreason \nI \nhave to ask is this. W\nhat cor\nrespondence have you had with Mark Boyle from \nthe \nShareholder E\nxecutive\n?\n \nI \nhave been led to understand that he has already received e\n&#x2011;\nmail correspondence about taking on this position. Could you perhaps enlighten us as to what that correspondence contains?\nRichard Douglas: \nWe have encouraged Mark to apply for this.\nQ359 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: I\nt is still a \ntransparent\n process, but you \nhave \nalready approached someone for \nthe \njob.\nRichard Douglas: \nThe\n&#xa0;\nnormal process is to make sure we have credible candidates for positions that we advertise.\nQ360 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: The\n&#xa0;\nreason \nI \nhave to ask this is \nthat \nagain someone from within \nthe \nDepartment is raising concerns about \nthe \nway \nthe \nprocess \nhas been\n managed\n,\n and there is an allegation being made that because of questions \nI \nhave asked\n—\nI \nwill be very candid with you\n—\nthe \nappointment had already been made and there was a plan to appoint this person slightly more quickly, shall we say, than otherwise. Would you be able to perhaps put our minds at rest and provide us with \nthe \ncorrespondence t\nhat has been going on between \nMark Boyle and \nthe \nDepartment just to prove that these allegations\n—\nUna O’Brien: \nCan we \njust \nknock \nthat\n on \nthe \nhead? We have placed an advertisement. It is absolutely normal practice to encourage people to apply. Do you know how difficult it is to persuade capable people to come forward to take chairmanships of major organisations? It is extremely difficult to get capable people to step forward. It is absolutely right and legitimate that we should contact people and say, \n“\nWe are interested in and encourage you to apply.\n”\n \nI \nam chairing \nthe \npanel\n,\n and \nI \ncan assure you that \nI \nwill make sure, as will Ri\nchard—\nand we will app\noint an external non\n&#x2011;\nexecutive\n—\nthat this process \nwill be\n conducted as we have said it will be.\nQ361 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nI \napologise for \nalways\n seeming like \nthe \nawkward squad at these Committees\n,\n but \nI \nhope you can understand from my perspective a\ns an MP—\nand it is this Committee\n’s role as a scrutiny body—that, \nif \nI \nreceive communications from concerned members of your Department\n,\n \nI \nfeel it would be remiss of me not to raise these in front of \nthe \nCommittee. \nI \nappreciate \nI \nam probably not \nthe \nmost popular person\n at all\n, but \nI \ndo hope you appreciate that it would be remiss of me not to raise these concerns with you and not to give you \nthe \nopportunity to put our minds at rest\n.\n \nA\nfter all, \nthe \npeople we are all of us serving are \nthe \npublic and, essentially, \nthe \npatients\n.\n \nT\nhe\n&#xa0;\nreason that \nI \nsuppose scrutiny like this should be a welcome thing is so that things like this can be aired in a collaborative and open way. \nI \nwould like a\nny correspondence an\nd help you can give me with my i\nnquiries so that these issu\nes can be cleared up—\nobviously people are concerned\n,\n otherwise \nI \nwould not be g\netting communications about it—and\n laid to rest\n.\n \nI\nn that way everyone is able to get on with their jobs\n,\n \nat\n which \nI \nam sure everyone is working very hard.\nRichard Douglas: \nLet me be clear. \nI \ninterviewed Mark for another role. Mark was considered to be someone who was above \nthe \nline for that role. He had a very good track record. He was not in \nthe \nend appointed to \nthe \nrole. \nI \nrecommended Mark then for repl\nacement to Property S\nervices chair when \nI \nk\nnew \nthe \nchair was going. In \nlight of \nthe \ncon\ncerns around \nthe \ngovernance of Property S\nervices, \nI \nthen decided \nthat \nwe \nreally \nneed\ned\n to talk with \nthe \nMinister about having a full competition\n,\n \nfor\n which Mark could apply\n.\n \nB\nut he was someone who had been through an interview process that \nI \nsaw and \nI \nthought fitted \nthe \nbill at that time.\nQ362 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: About when\n would \nyou\n have recommended him? Can you recall?\nRichard Douglas: \nI \ncannot remember \nthe \nprecise dates\n and \nI \nam trying to think when \nthe \ni\nnterview was for \nthe \nother job, but it would have been towards \nthe \nbeginning of autumn, \nI \nwould think\n,\n on this.\nQ363 &#xa0; \nCharlotte Leslie: \nYou will be able to reassure us and any concerned people\n—and I am sure you can—\nthat \nthe \nprocess in \nappointing\n \nthe \nnext chairman will be \ncompletely transparent and open.\nRichard Douglas: \nYes.\nChair: \nI \nthink that is \njust \nwhat \nthe \nPermanent Secretary said. \nCharlotte Leslie: \nThank you very much. \nChair: \nValerie wants to move on to trust finances\n,\n and we will try to get you away on \nthe \nstr\noke of\n five o\n’\nclock.\nQ364 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nT\nhis is a very \nimportant\n issue. As to t\nrusts and foundation trusts, \nI \nthink \nthe \nNational Audit Office have said some of them are in difficulty\n,\n and with \nthe \nwinter crisi\ns and A and E crisis going on y\nou have allocated some funds to them\n—\n£250 million.\nMr Hunt: \nIt is £400 million to help with winter pressures.\nQ365 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: No;\n \n£\n250 \nmillion\n for \nthe \nfoundation trusts and £150 million to \nthe \nCCGs. Is that not right? \nMr Hunt: \nIt is \n£\n400 million to help \nthe \nwhole NHS with winter pressures.\n \nT\nhe \nmechanism through which \nthe \nmoney is distributed is\n slightly different with \nthe \ntwo funds\n,\n but it was about £300 million last y\near and we have increased it to £400 \nmillion this year.\nQ366 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nI \nsuppose that will help us to get to \nthe \nbottom of it\n.\n \nI \nwas in \nthe \nChamber when you made both those announcements, so £250 million was to \nthe \nfoundation trusts. Can we get that correct or not? Just give us \nthe \nfigure then.\nMr Hunt: \nI \nam trying to do that. £250 million was decided in August and it was to 53 areas, some of which were foundation trusts and some of which were NHS trusts and not foundation trusts.\nValerie Vaz: \nYes.\nMr Hunt: S\nome \nof it \nw\nent to help ambulance services and \nsome to help NHS 111 centres. Basically\n,\n we decided to allocate that money where we thought \nthe \npressures were going to be greatest for winter and we made that decision in August.\nQ367 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nCould you tell me what you took \ninto\n account when you made those decisions? Did \nthe \ntrusts or foundation trusts c\no\nme to you and say they needed \nthe \nextra money? Were they \nthe \nfailing trusts?\nMr Hunt: \nNo.\n \nI \nasked NHS England, \nthe \nNHS T\nrust Development Authority and Monitor to collectively decide where they thought \nthe \nneed was greatest in terms of winter funding pressures\n.\n \nT\nhey selected 53 health economies where they thought there were particular needs\n,\n and then they negotiated with those health economies as to how \nthe \nfund\ns\n should be spent.\nQ368 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nBut \nI \nsuppose those were \nareas\n in trouble. What \nI \nam gettin\ng is that people in \nthe \nNHS were saying that you we\nre kind of rewarding failure, which is why your second tranche came out.\nMr Hunt: \nIt was a very difficult call\n,\n because what happened with \nthe \n£300 million last year was that essentially it was distributed evenly, including to a lot of areas that were performing extremely well\n,\n and of course you have to make a call\n.\n \nI decided that it\n would be a better use of taxpayers\n’ money and would\n have more impact for \nthe \nwinter if that money was distributed to \nthe \nareas where we thought \nthe \nbiggest problems existed\n.\n \nO\nf course, by definition, those are \nthe \nareas that are less successful. But because we were then able to identify another £150 million of \nunderspend\n, as it happens\n—\nValerie Vaz: \nI \nwas going to ask you where \nthe \nmoney came from.\nMr Hunt: —\nwe were in fact able to give all areas broadly \nthe \nsame as they recei\nved. When you tot it up to \nthe \n£400 million, b\nasically all areas got broadly what they got last year\n,\n but areas with particular problems got more.\nQ369 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nCorrect me if \nI \nam wrong, but \nI \nunderstand that this £150 million was going to 57 CCGs as opposed to \nthe \ntrusts and \nthe \nfoundation trusts, or is that not correct? \nMr Hunt: \nI \ndo not know if it was 57 CCGs\n,\n but it was essentially designed to go out to \nthe \npeople who had not received \nthe \n£250 million but had got some support last year.\nQ370 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nWhen you say \n“\npeople\n”\n, what do you mean?\nMr Hunt: \nOrganisations.\nQ371 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nWhich \nparticular\n ones? \nMr Hunt: All organisations that\n have A and E departments receive some help from \nthe \n£400 million.\nQ372 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nCan \nanybody\n help? We had understood that it was going in two di\nfferent directions and w\ne just wanted to find out why.\nSir David Nicholson: \nAt \nthe \nend of \nthe \nday\n,\n £400 million \nhas gone out.\n £300 million of that has essentially gone out on \nthe \nbasis of fair shares in \nthe \nsame way that it would have done and £100 million has been targeted at those areas. That is \nthe \nnet result of what we have done. \nQ373 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: Is \nall that money \nunderspend\n money or has it come from different areas?\nMr Hunt: \nNo. The\n&#xa0;\n£150 million of it is.\nQ374 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: That is \nunderspend\n, a\nnd \nthe \nother lot?\nMr Hunt: \nThat is additional.\nValerie Vaz: \nOkay.\nChair: \nI \nthink, on that note, three minutes ahead of schedule, we will say a quick thank you\n— \nMr Hunt: \nThank you very much.\nChair: —\nand good wishes, on my part, to \nthe \nPrime Minister.\n&#xa0;\n              \nOral evidence: Public expenditure on health and social care\n, HC\n 793\n              \n              \n39\n"
