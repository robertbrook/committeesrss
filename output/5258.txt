[[[SUMMARY]]]The Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE) provides ambulance services with an organisation that influences, supports, co-ordinates and implements nationally agreed policy.  It also provides the general public and other stakeholders with a central source of information about NHS ambulance services.  AACE’s primary focus is the ongoing development of the English ambulance service and the improvement of patient care.The Health Select Committee’s inquiry into emergency services and emergency care is welcomed by the AACE we are  pleased to provide further information for consideration.

[[[Background]]]Ambulance Trusts in England have managed well through the winter to date, as we would expect them to, implementing plans drawn together following debriefing and learning from the previous year’s activities.  Winter has however still posed issues for ambulance services, particularly with regards to delayed hospital handovers, and increased 999 call demands. The handover delays have been slightly less than last year, but we have been fortunate to have a mild winter to date which has not realised some of the activity we may have expected at this point in the season. Although some Ambulance Trust are not achieving all response time targets – Ambulance Services are generally coping, and providing safe services for patients.&#xa0;Several Ambulances Trusts have reported discourse in their areas regarding the allocation of the additional £250m funding and subsequent £150m to A&amp;E Departments this winter as there appears to be a perception this is simply rewarding failing organisations and does not address the root issues in capacity and capability. Some Ambulance Trust are reporting they haven’t seen any tangible impact of this extra funding, aside from a slight decrease in hospital handover delays, (circa 70% of the delays being experienced over the same period last year) however it is more likely the improved performance is due to other factors and initiatives which were implemented earlier in 2013 more locally. &#xa0;Ambulances Trusts are keen to understand how the impact of this funding will be measured by NHS England, and how this will then inform the allocation of the £250m next winter.&#xa0;In 2013 Handover Delay fines were introduced for both Acute Trusts and Ambulance Trusts across England. There is an understanding that these fines did in the first instance focus minds to deal with the issue of turning ambulances around within the agreed timeframe. However there is evidence to suggest that the fines are not actually being applied in a consistent manner across the areas, which in turn causes concern that the focus will drop away from turnarounds, as the consequences would not be realised and we will return to a position similar to that of previous years. It had been hoped that fines levied against acute trusts who were delaying ambulance turnarounds would result in that money being routed back to the ambulance trusts to allow them to put on extra ambulance capacity to compensate for those delays. There is very little evidence that this has happened which is disappointing.&#xa0;&#xa0;The allocation of the additional £14M winter funding has had a very positive impact in supporting Ambulance Services this winter. This funding was allocated during December 2013 which was very welcome. Predominantly the monies are being used to increase staffing on the front line to place more Emergency Ambulances on the road to respond to patients and maintain a safe, efficient and effective service. &#xa0;Hospital Ambulance Liaison Officers have also been increased to manage effective and smooth handovers at Emergency departments; however this is the Ambulance Services investing in these initiatives rather than the Acute Trusts.&#xa0;The reasoning behind the division and allocation of the £14m across the Ambulance Trusts was not clear, and some trusts received more funding than others, despite having already agreed additional winter monies with their local Commissioners. Evidence of how these extra funds have been used may also help to influence the allocation of extra funding for next winter as previously mentioned.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]NHS 111 may have also had a greater benefit on the wider health economy, had it been implemented fully in all areas to the original timescale, and been embedded fully before winter arrived, with the appropriate advertising undertaken. There has been a further realisation of the synergy between the 999 and NHS111 call centres with those ambulance services who run the NHS 111 service being able to influence and develop in a more meaningful way the wider Emergency and Urgent Care system, due to a greater understanding of some of the problems being faced. Efficiency savings could be realised further from combining further 999 and NHS111 call centres in the future.&#xa0;Winter is always a very difficult time for the NHS, but it comes as no surprise to us each year. There is considerable learning to be taken from the whole NHS system, to enable organisations to work more closely in developing plans for winter 2014/15. There needs to be an early decision next year on whether any additional funding will be made available to both Acute Trusts and Ambulance Trusts and recognition that the initial plan not to allocate monies specifically to ambulance trusts was flawed. It is clear that simply relying on local health economies to consider ambulance trusts in their allocation decisions did not work despite ambulance trusts playing a full and active part in trying to influence those decisions. By ensuring that ambulance trusts receive direct allocations early, plans can be drawn together in a more evidence based, cohesive manner. This will further ensure the safety of patients, and optimum efficiency of the services we provide. Ambulance Services are always very keen to play an increasing part in the delivery of Urgent and Emergency Care and very much see ourselves as part of the solution going forward. We will continue to work closely with the review team led by Sir Bruce Keogh and NHS England to ensure we play a full and active part in achieving a sustainable Emergency and urgency Care system in England.January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
