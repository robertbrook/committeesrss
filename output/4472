[normal]Written Evidence Submitted by The Children’s Book Project for Tanzania (CBP)[bold]Executive Summery[bold]High quality education for all children including disabled in their first years of schooling builds a foundation for future learning and for healthy and productive family and civic life. 
[normal]Literacy skills equip a person to both gain knowledge and understandi
[normal]ng of their immediate environment as well as to make sense of the wider world. Research shows that a child who is able to read and write is better able to contribute to his or her personal and community well being. 
[normal]Primary Education Development Plan (PEDP
[normal] III), Big Results Now (BRN) and 
[normal]LANES
[normal] proposal firmly recognizes the importance of education to support literacy development, to ensure better lives for the Tanzanians including people with disabilities. But the cha
[normal]llenges are many including semi-
[normal]trained 
[normal]teachers for literacy, lack of Braille reading materials to read, besides having few textbooks transcribed into Braille.
[normal]The CBP
[normal]’s
[normal] experience
[normal] in Braille Book provision
[normal] is in line with the DFID
[normal]’s

[normal]O
[normal]rganization whose main goals are to cultivate a strong reading culture 
[normal]among children in Tanzania through the provision of books t
[normal]o children for 
[normal]the purpose
[normal] of increasing and widen
[normal]ing their knowledge and develop
[normal]ing their reading skills; for the teaching of literacy and support for reading 
[normal]in the formal education system throug

[normal]Description of CBP Activities[bold]CBP programme has three main components which include:
[normal]CBP implements a professional development for 
[normal]Trainers. This
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]led
[normal] by CBP’s experienced staff. Trainers are trained for 15 days divided into three 5 – day workshop sessions spread out
[normal] over 8 months. 
[normal]In addition to training of teachers, CBP provides reading materials to help children learn to read and develop life – long habits of reading. Schools are supplied with reading materials and 
[normal]teachers are
[normal] given training in library management and in reading p
[normal]romotion
[normal].
[normal]CBP provides book sector training to publishers, writers, illustrators and editors, with the aim of development professional skills to them hence improving the quality of the books produced.
[normal]3.0 [bold]Provision[bold] 
[normal]of Braille Books for[bold] Visually Impaired Children[bold].[bold]Rationale for the Project
[normal]In 1994 CBP organized a Children’s Book Day at the National Library. Among the invited children where visually impaired children from Uhuru Mchanganyiko, in
[normal] Ilala District
[normal], Dar es Salaam region. The children 
[normal]performed
[normal] a poem which raised their voice that they were being neglected in CBP’s book project 
[normal]activities, while normal ch
[normal]ildren were provided with books
[normal].
[normal]The children raised their concern that, they had very few textbo
[normal]oks in Braille and there were no reading books. 
[normal]Following the request, CBP embarked on a programme of producing Braille books for visually impaired children. Those were the first readers ever produced for visually impaired children in the countr
[normal]y
[normal].
[normal] To-date
[normal] 
[normal]CBP has transcribed
[normal] 37 story books for visually impaired 
[normal]children. The
[normal] books have been distributed to 25 schools which cater for the disabled children.
[normal]Currently there are more than 2,000 visually impaired children in primary schools in Tanzania. Among th
[normal]em are two specials namely Bwigili in Dodoma region and 
[normal]Furaha in 
[normal]Tab
[normal]ora region. There are also integrated schools which are Uhuru Mchanganyiko in Dar es Salaam,Mazinyungu in Morogoro region and another one in Lushoto, the rest are inclusive schools.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.0 [bold]Recommended[bold] Activities[bold]CBP will carry out needs assessment to 
[normal]determine the actual number of visually impaired children who are in primary schools in Tanzania. The number of visually impaired children will determine the print run of the Braille books to be produced and distributed to schools. Apart from getting this 
[normal]crucial information, the project will be informed on the list of schools with such children and number of tutors and teachers available for these children. The information will support project planning.

[normal] [bold]Training of Trainers
[normal] S
[normal]elected
[normal] a
[normal] number of tuto
[normal]rs 
[normal]from the colleges which train 
[normal]teachers for
[normal] visually impaired children and train them on how to teach effective literacy skills .and prepare them to become trainers and mentors.

[normal] T
[normal]rain teachers through in- service teacher training through 
[normal]Train the tra
[normal]iner model.
[normal]. The initiative i
[normal]s focusing on 
[normal]enabling 
[normal]teachers
[normal] to acquire book management
[normal] 
[normal]skills
[normal] of Braille books, and provide them with basic librarian skills, a
[normal]nd also on how to incorporate reading materials into instructional strategies of th
[normal]eir school culture through library development and instructional prac
[normal]tice.
[normal].
[normal]The Braille book provision i
[normal]nitiative strongly supports PED
[normal]P
[normal] III which states the necessity for school libraries and supplementary materials 
[normal]to support 
[normal]learning and teaching.
[normal]Provision of Braille Books to 
[normal]integrated
[normal] schools which cater for visually
[normal] impaired
[normal] children 
[normal]and 
[normal]inclusive
[normal] schools 
[normal]will 
[normal]support instruction strategies, literacy development and learning outcomes. These materials will support the quali
[normal]ty of education, the country’s literacy development and nurture children’s lifelong habits of reading during a formative period of learning.
[normal]CBP has participated in the preparation of the government (Ministry of Education and Vocational Training) proposal 
[normal]on Literacy and Numeracy (LANES) to the Global Partners Education (GPE) which has been approved. The proposal to GPE did not
[normal] neither
[normal] accommodate an activity for provision of reading 
[normal]books 
[normal]to both normal and visually impaired children nor establishment of s
[normal]chool libraries
[normal].
[normal]Furthermore, the new presidential Initiative Big Results Now (BRN) and the PEDP III activities did not also accommodate the same. In this respect CBP is appealing to DFID to take the 
[normal]responsibility to provide Braille Books to improve the c
[normal]hildren’s outcome and eventually contribute to improving the quality education.
