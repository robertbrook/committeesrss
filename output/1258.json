"Written evidence submitted by Lucy Makenzie&#xa0;\n432\n:\n50\n&#xa0;\nWhat an inspiring and impressive document!  \n&#xa0;\nI have nothing to add, except that to emphasize, as the fortunate owner of my home and acre of land, surrounded by a large estate which is in turn bordered by other large estates, the position in \nwhich tenant farmers and tenants in general find themselves.\n&#xa0;\nAll are fearful of making any sort of representation to such a committee or indeed making any sort of complaint about their situation, for fear of repercussions.  Many have no contract whatsoeve\nr and can be evicted with a couple of weeks’ notice from home or business premises, almost all live in properties which through lack of maintenance are often almost uninhabitable:  is it any wonder that the bulk of submissions to this inquiry have come fro\nm estate owners?  There is also the state of resignation prevailing among many of the older generation, as typified by my neighbour: ‘that’s the way it has always been and that’s the way it will always be’.  Folk have lost faith in th\ne government doing som\nething to help them. \n&#xa0;\nEstate owners in general (there are two notable exceptions on this island) spend nothing on maintenance or upkeep of tenanted properties, and do nothing to provide land for affordable accommodation:  but are only too willing to sell \nplots at £100,000+ for holiday homes – the blight of rural communities.\nHow much sense I have read in the submissions to this document, summed up by the submission by David Cameron of the Community Land Fund.  Will anything come of it?  - one can but dream\n!  \n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n"
