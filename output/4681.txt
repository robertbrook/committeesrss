[[[South East Strategic Leaders Response]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; South East Strategic Leaders (SESL) does not have a shared view on the Government’s programme of academisation; individual South East authorities have their own policies on academies and free schools. This submission is, therefore, intended to be considered alongside more detailed local authority evidence. &#xa0;1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Regardless of stance towards academies, it is a fact that under the current Government, the number of academies in the South East has increased. Between 2011/12 and 2012/13 no SESL authority saw a drop in the percentage of pupils educated in secondary academies, although growth has varied across the region. The introduction of academies and free schools has changed the education landscape and raised questions about the role and responsibilities of local authorities in education and, in particular, in respect to academies and free schools.&#xa0;1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; SESL has determined to submit a collective response as whilst South East Councils hold different positions on the concept of academies, we hold firmly that local authorities retain a role in promoting learning across all schools. We recognise the need for the local authority as a strong ‘Middle Tier’ between all schools and the Secretary of State. We agree that:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Local authorities have an on-going role in ]]]

[[[promoting learning]]]

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; The duties placed on English local authorities under Section 13 of the Education Act 1996, relating to promoting high standards of education, ensuring fair access to opportunity and promoting the fulfilment of learning potential, apply to all children and young people across all schools and alternative education providers, which includes academies. Whilst there is some debate as to the extent to which a local authority is ‘capable’ of exercising these functions with respect to non-maintained schools, academies are not independent from these local authority duties.&#xa0;2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; As long as these duties remain, local authorities have a role to engage constructively with, and seek to influence, all schools to ensure their responsibilities towards children are being met. South East Councils continue to relate to all schools in carrying out responsibilities for admissions, SEN exclusions and commissioning new school places. In respect to championing vulnerable pupils and ensuring equality of opportunity, for example, there are cases of South East Councils taking a very active role. In Kent, the County Council and local schools are focusing intensively on narrowing the attainment gap for vulnerable groups. In the same way as local authority maintained schools, Kent County Council expects academies to focus on ensuring that vulnerable groups are identified, strategies personalised and pupil premium monies effectively targeted. &#xa0;

[[[To fulfil their role successfully, councils need to build strong relation]]]

[[[ships with all schools]]]&#xa0;2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Establishing strong relationships is a prerequisite to constructive engagement with any school. Where a local authority does have direct powers of intervention, these are often only effective where that local authority has the capacity to invest in building constructive relationships with its schools and the history of doing so. Nurturing strong, positive, trusting relationships with academies is important as the quality of relationships is likely to determine the level of information shared by academies with their local councils. &#xa0;2.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; Across SESL there are many examples of where local authorities have invested in building positive relationships with schools in a variety of ways. To give one example, through collaboration with Robert Bloomfield Academy, Central Bedfordshire Council has established The Central Bedfordshire Teaching School Partnership and Council Commissioning Officers sit on the Partnership’s Strategic Board. &#xa0;2.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; The partnership has published an online workforce development tool and is helping to broker school-to-school support using National and Local Leaders of Education and Governance, Advanced Skills Teachers and Specialist Leaders. Central Bedfordshire already has four National Leaders in Governance. The Council would like to approach other Chairs but has been prevented from doing so due to tight, nationally imposed qualifying criteria regarding length of service prior to applying. The Committee may wish to see if this is an issue for other areas and subsequently to explore loosening the criteria on qualifying Governors. &#xa0;

[[[Where relationships are not good, ]]]

[[[Government should support councils to exercise their democratic mandate.]]]&#xa0;2.6.&#xa0;&#xa0; There exist a number of means by which local authorities can seek to influence academies; for example, through meeting with the Chairs of overarching Trusts and regular meetings with regional HMI. There are many examples of positive endeavour on this front. In Kent, for example, the local authority has been inviting academies to work in partnership with other schools to create a sustainable, self-improvement school system, which is working well. Despite many examples of positive engagement, difficulties can and do arise where, for whatever reason, an academy refuses to engage constructively with the local authority.&#xa0;2.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;  Persistent un-cooperation and disengagement can lead to a situation where it becomes difficult for a local authority to be a) assured of the health of a school and thus to fulfil its statutory duties towards pupils and b) to drive improvement within that school. In the current system, where relationships break down and attempts to influence through exerting soft powers fail, it is the DfE’s responsibility to intervene and drive necessary improvements at pace. It would therefore be prudent for the Committee to explore further whether the DfE has the local knowledge of underperforming academies and the capacity and capability to intervene quickly and support sustained improvement. The decision to recruit Schools Commissioners in eight regions across the country and to charge them with responsibility for monitoring performance and driving improvement in underperforming academies implies that there is a gap not currently being met by the Department. &#xa0;2.8.&#xa0;&#xa0; In keeping with localism, it is essential that local politicians, alongside their schools, are able to be held to account by their communities for the education that their children and young people receive. Local politicians are far better placed than Whitehall or any regional representative to keep abreast of and address local issues. Indeed, when difficulties arise, residents rarely turn first to the Secretary of State but rather to their locally elected politicians. Local Councillors need to be supported to influence schools and to hold providers to account for the delivery of the local system through their democratic mandate. &#xa0;2.9.&#xa0;&#xa0; To this end, Regional Schools Commissioners should be required to cooperate with local authorities, sharing information about underperforming academies with which they are working and involving local authorities in both discussions about the most appropriate remedial action and securing school improvement services. Local authorities, have a wealth of local knowledge, practical expertise and experience in this area that Regional Commissioners ought to draw upon. In light of Councils’ broad systems oversight and democratic mandate, Commissioners ought also to involve them in decisions to approve an academy conversion application. &#xa0;2.10.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Local Councillors could be further supported to exercise their democratic mandate by structuring the Funding Agreement between the DfE and academies in a way that reinforces to academies that whilst they are funded centrally, they have a responsibility towards locally elected Members.  &#xa0;

[[[Convertor academies – a potential line for future enquiry]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.11.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The principle that no school is beyond falling into difficulties is an important one and raises questions around convertor academies. Whilst we celebrate in the successes of such schools, we have concerns regarding the longevity of that success and the potential vulnerability of convertor academies in particular. We suggest there is value in the Committee exploring the basis of convertor academy success, whether their success is likely to be sustained and what securities are needed/exist that will help convertor academies to guard against potential deterioration or failure in the future.

[[[real time]]]

[[[ information and data ]]]

[[[sharing]]]2.12.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Local authorities have a role, alongside an array of other partners, to support schools throughout their improvement journey. This involves identifying and acting upon early warning signs that might, for example, suggest that educational standards are slipping. Councils’ ability to track individual pupil data in real time, over a period of time, is important to spotting warning signs. Local authorities ought not to be in a position where they must wait for the Department to publish Key Stage data, for example, several months after it is received by local schools; rather, they need access to robust, real time information before it is placed in the public domain. Access to more sensitive information also plays an important part in supporting councils to fulfil their safeguarding responsibilities.&#xa0;2.13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As referenced above, building strong relationships with schools overtime will underpin their willingness to share information.               Across the South East there are examples of locally negotiated information sharing protocols between Councils and academies which are proving effective. For locally-led initiatives, such as the Troubled Families Programme, there may be need for further data sharing within locally agreed timescales. &#xa0;

[[[Academy sponsors should be strongly encouraged to cooperate with councils and encourage their schools to do likewise.]]]&#xa0;2.14.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is sometimes the case that academies, which enjoy a good relationship with their local authority and are open to sharing information in principle, come under pressure from their Sponsor not to share data with their local authority. This causes unnecessary obstacles locally which could be easily overcome if nationally academy sponsors were encouraged by the DfE, and in the future Regional Schools Commissioners, to willingly and constructively engage with local authorities directly. Moreover, Sponsors should actively encourage academies within their sphere to communicate with their local authority. &#xa0;

[[[The capacity of local authorities to exercise due diligence towards all schools, regardless of status, is diminishing]]]&#xa0;2.15.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is increasingly difficult for local authorities to know all of their schools well due to limited capacity and SESL questions whether existing funding is sufficient to sustain the capacity of local authorities to exercise due diligence with their schools, regardless of status.
