"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the BBC&#xa0;This note summarises the BBC\n’s principal comments\n \nin respect of \nthe \nwritten evidence submitted by \nMr \nJohn \nLinwood\n \nt\no the Public Accounts Committee, dated\n \n23\nrd\n January 2014.\n&#xa0;\nThe paragraph numbers refer to the paragraphs in John Linwood’s submission.  \n&#xa0;\nIt is incorrect to state that all major technology issues with DMI had been addressed by October 2012.  Equally, it is incorrect to state that DMI technology could have worked with limited further testing (paragraphs 5b and 11). &#xa0;\nAt the\n 4\nth\n October 2012 DMI Steering Group meeting\n, \nthe BBC \nPMO \n(project management office) \nDMI Status Update\n \nwas presented\n.  \nThis\n cite\nd\n a number of key functions of \nDMI \nProduction Tools \n(PT) \nwhich we\nre still in testing or development, including:\n&#xa0;\nIn addition,\n this update also reported\n:\n \n“\nArchive and re-use content – not started; \ndependent upon the Digital Archive.\n&#xa0;\n Although components had been built, the work to deliver the Digital Archive was planned to start in October 2012\n.\n”\n&#xa0;\nIn October 2012, \nProduction T\nools were\n \nalso \nstill reported as being in testing\n.\n  \nT\nhe System Integration Testing status for \nProduction Tools\n was reported to the DMI management team as:\n&#xa0;\nOn\n \n8\nth\n \nOctober 2012, \nt\nhe\n report submitted to the BBC’s PMO by the \nDMI \nproject team \ncontained some very clear warnings that not all was well with the technical solution.  Specifically the following risks were noted:\n&#xa0;\nT\nhere are numerous extra\ncts from the Accenture Report\n \n(March 2013) \nwhich\n demonstrate that extensive further testing was required to determine if core parts of the \nDMI technology w\nould work.  \nThese include\n:\n&#xa0;\nIt is incorrect to state that Accenture did not make any comment about the validity of Production Tools or the Digital Archive during their review (paragraph 43).  &#xa0;\nIt is true that Production Tools\n were not included directly in scope of the \nAccenture \nreview.  However, Accenture did \nmake\n a number of comments in their report about the quality and comprehensiveness of testing of Productions Tools – specifically: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is incorrect to state that the primary reason for delays to the project was a significantly large number of changes requested by the business (paragraph 10).&#xa0;\nThe DMI Change Log indicates that\n,\n of the 160 changes \naccepted by the Change Board\n \nfrom November 2009 \nto October 2012\n,\n the majority (68%) were related to technical or\n schedule changes – all \nitems\n that fell within Mr Linwood’s remit on the project. \n&#xa0;\nAny change in business direction\n and conclusion th\nat the original DMI vision was \nno longer valid can be attributed to the lateness of delivery. This resulted in the commodity production tool market overtaking what DMI was delivering\n.\n&#xa0;\nIt is incorrect to state that Accenture recommended “that there is enough potential value in DMI to move ahead with plans to build on it” (paragraph 39). \n \n&#xa0;\nAccenture did not make this statement in their report.\n&#xa0;It is incorrect to state that Accenture said it would cost £25 million to start to rebuild the technology from scratch to get to the same position. &#xa0;\nWe\n have spoken to Accenture since Mr Linwood’s written evidence was published and they confirm that during their review for the BBC they did not make any assessment of the cost of rebuilding technology\n equivalent to DMI\n.  T\nhey \nconfirmed that they did not say “\nit would cost £25 million to start to rebuild the technology from scratch to get to the same position\n” \n(paragraph 39)\n.\n&#xa0;\nAccenture did \nundertake a\n costing for replacing the Archive Database with an off-the-shelf equivalent.\n&#xa0;\n They estimated this cost to be between $6.8-10.4 million (£4.3-6.5 million), which was used to inform the residual value we attributed to this part of the system in the final assessment of the project.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n31 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
