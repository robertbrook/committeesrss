"&#xa0;\nSubmission by Leeds City Council (FDC25)Introduction\nLeeds City Council welcomes the Select Committee’s inquiry into fiscal devolution \nin England, and is pleased to offer this submission for consideration. In our evidence we demonstrate why and how fiscal devolution to cities is essential for the unlocking of local and national growth, thus incr\neasing national competitiveness. \nUnderpinnin\ng\n the \ndetails of this submission\n is a clear message\n:\n that cities are \nbest placed\n to take on additional fiscal powers\n,\n and \nwe are ready and willing \nto\n work with Government to deliver the best possible outcomes for devolution\n.  T\nhe following proposals \nare ou\ntlined \nfor the Committee to consider:\nThe opportunities\n offered by fiscal devolution\nWhile the Coalition Government has demonstrated a welcome appetite for devol\nution\n, \nin too many instances the real powers cities need to drive economic growth have been held back. In order to achieve the growth potential offered by Core Cities such as Leeds, there needs to be a substantial and meaningful shift in current tax distri\nbution arrangements, which currently see local authorities only controlling 5% of the taxes raise\nd in their areas\n. \nBy meaningful we mean more than simply a distribution of earmarked funds to local authorities. In comparison to cities in Germany, Canada, S\nweden, the USA and even Scotland and Wales, English cities continue to be well behind in terms of having the fiscal powers necessary to drive growth. This has a direct and damaging impact on the economic potential and performance of the country as a whole.\nBy devolving fiscal powers to Combined Authorities\n,\n \nand giving them \nprecepting powers\n,\n the Government can unlock the growth potential of England’s major cities, driving national economic competitiveness higher, while increasing democratic accountability a\nnd oversight of important fiscal functions.\nLeeds City Council is the local authority for \n751,500\n individuals, making it the second largest metropolitan area outside of London. It sits at the heart of a successful City Region \nwith\n an economy worth £\n53bn.  \nThe Council\n work\ns\n closely with \nthe Leeds City Region\n Local Enterprise \nP\nartnership, private\n,\n and third sector organisations to promote\n economic\n growth\n that is sustainable, inclusive and shared by all of our citizens.\nThe ongoing financial climate is placing\n unprecedented pressures on local government to deliver high quality public services while making substantial reductions in expenditure. \nDespite the impact of the recession\n and the pressure on services,\n Leeds has continued to invest in projects\n and \nhas \nwor\nk\ned\n closely with the private sector\n to attract businesses and visitors to the city. In 2013 the completion of the Trinity Shopping Centre and the Leeds Arena \ndelivered\n a significant \nuplift for the local economy, and the Council’s leadership role in these p\nrojects has been welcomed by organisations such as the CBI.\nLeeds recognises the need for local gover\nnment to become smaller in size\n while growing in influence, and the importance of working more collaboratively with partners in the private and third secto\nrs to create sustainable and inclusive economic growth and opportunities for all. \nBut at the same time, the Government must\n recognise that cities have a much greater role to play in driving economic growth\n and contributing to increased national competitive\nness, and that it is a role \nthat cities can only play \ngiven greater fiscal powers and freedoms.\nThe Core Cities urban areas\n have the potential to\n put 1.16 million more jobs and £222 billion into the economy\n,\n which is equivalent to the entire economy of Den\nmark. It’s equal to almost £14,000 for every person living in a Core City urban area – £52,500 for an average family.\n However to do this \nthere needs to be a\n change \nto \nour approach towards cities, giving them the power and finances to invest in projects cri\ntical to their residents and businesses. Currently local authorities control only 5% of the taxes they raise and 60% of spending in a city is controlled centrally. The OECD average\n \nfor the level of taxes controlled at the local level is\n \nover \nfive\n times gre\nater \nthan our UK cities\n enjoy\n.\nThis system\n and this philosophy\n has failed to produce cities that perform above the national average\n, with only London consistently doing so. \nAs a member of the Core Cities Group\n,\n Leeds is committed to \na\n \njoint \nproposal to \nout\nperform the national economy and to become financially self-sustaining by 2030.\n To achieve this aim we cannot continue along the current centralised course.\nOur proposals\nWith the\nse\n above potential \nopportunities and outcomes\n in mind, Leeds City Council would make the following \nproposals\n to the Committee:\nOn the concept\n of devolution, particularly o\nn the devolved area and its government\nOver the three years of the Coalition \ng\novernment there have been large scale changes regarding devolved areas beneath the national level. With the dissolving of \nregional development agencies, \nthe \ncreation\n of Local Enterprise Partnerships and\n \nCombined Authorities\n,\n there has been a fundamental sh\nift\n in governance\n \nand leadership at the sub-regional level\n.\n The effects of these changes are still being played out, and w\nith this in mind\n,\n while\n it is possible to \nconsider\n \npotential governance\n arrangements \nfor further devolution, we would stress the need \nfor any model of further devolution to be given t\nhe time to become effective. \nIn our view, \nCombined Authorities, with precepting powers\n as w\nell as devolved mandates, are the most appropriate model\n for fiscal devolution. With \ndemocratic representation from\n all parts of an area of governance, \nthey \noffer\n the \nessential\n democratic legitimacy\n and local knowledge\n to control\n fiscal powers for local needs. \nFiscal devolution increases local choice and would encourage greater interest in local democracy, instilling m\neaningful accountability for how taxes raised in a place are spent in that place. \nAdditionally, i\nt would be for each combined authority to establish a productive and collaborative relationship with their Local Enterprise Partnerships, whose role would incl\nude articulating the case for investment at the local level and taking responsibility for some aspects of local funding, particularly around infrastructure and business growth.\nA second \ngovernance solution which could be \nconsidered\n would be to change the relationship between \nDepartmental Permanent S\necretaries and lead Chief Executives for a Combined Authority area. \nDelegating\n Accounting Officer responsibilities to a devolved level would allow Whitehall to retain oversight of devolve\nd funding\n,\n but \nempower\n Combined Authorities to\n exercise their judgment on how best to\n \nallocate\n \nsupport to\n local priorities.\n These A\nccounting Officers c\nould be provided with place based settlements for revenue funds, which could include Health and Social Ca\nre Integration and Skills and Labour Market Agreements. \n&#xa0;\nHow public services, including employment, skills and welfare, should be organised to complement devolution\nThe current arrangements for public services are dominated by individual \nGovernment\n depart\nments offering blanket solutions to \ncomplex\n problems. \nIn our view there is much to gain from taking a more holistic and place based approach, allowing issues\n such as health and social care and\n welfare and unemployment to be dealt with in a more joined up w\nay in local communities. \nD\nevolved revenue could\n and should \nbe channelled into meeting local needs that may not be \nbest addressed through\n national programmes.\nAs \nan example\n of this \nmore locally designed approach \nwe support the Core Cities model of a single \nframework for skills and employment systems, organised through a 5-year ‘Skills and \nLabour Market Agreement’ with each Core City. This would help the supply of skills within a local labour market to better reflect the demands of that market and its employe\nrs\n, \nand reduce the current \n17% of job vacancies\n that\n remain unfilled due to skills-gaps\n. \n&#xa0;\nOn the evidence supporting devolution and what new powers could mean\nThe\nre is a strong and increasingly conclusive\n evidence \nbase, nationally and internationally, dem\nonstrating that\n \nfiscal \ndevolution\n to cities\n lead\ns\n to \nimproved economic growth\n at the local and national level\n. Professor \nMichael Parkinson’s research into second tier cities has shown that \ncountries that have \nspatial deconcentration of investment and decen\ntralised powers and resources\n, like Germany, \nproduce\n \ncities \nthat\n \nout\nperform the national average. \nIn the UK only London consistently outperforms the average\n, and\n \nevidence demonstrates that\n this gap between cities and the capital limit\ns\n national economic performance\n.\nHere in the UK, City Deals have shown just some of the possible ways in which devolution can support growth through investment in infrastructure and local services. The Earnback mechanism in Manchester has shown how new fisc\nal powers can help to build pots for investment in infrastructure projects, for example. And Leeds City Council, through taking control of the Youth Programme and working with local authority partners in Bradford and Wakefield, has been able to support 2,5\n00 young people into education, employment or training; far outperforming the figures for \nnational\n programmes. \nThese examples demonstrate the potential that cities can offer when they are given new powers and control of finances\n as well as greater influenc\ne over the design of interventions\n.\n  \nThis potential\n is not only of benefit to the c\nities concerned but also to the country as \na \nwhole, having a positive net effect on the national public balance sheet by reducing the demand on welfare and other services\n \nwh\nile\n increasing contributions of income tax, National Insurance and corporation tax. \n           \nThe case for the potential economic impact of the further devolution of powers is, in our view, \nunarguable. The key decision to be made is how devolution can be\n implemented while retaining sufficient oversight and accountability for the reassurance of Government.\n&#xa0;\nOn the details\n of devolution, including w\nhat taxes may be devolved and proposals for new taxes\nWith current arrangements seeing cities retaining \nonly \n5\n% of \nthe \ntaxes they raise, there is a wealth of potential for devolution of taxes. This is desirable because it will allow areas with different problems and priorities to address their local needs \nwith greater flexibility and efficiency than a nationally c\nonsistent and centrally mandated approach can offer\n. It also means that there will be a more reward driven culture for \ncities, where their efforts to reduce \nunemployment or to \nencourage\n business expansion will result in greater retention of incoming taxes \nwhich can be used to meet service needs\n and capture\n future dividends from infrastructure investment\n.\n The following taxes are proposed for devolution \nin their entirety or to contain a financial element to be retained locally.\nCouncil Tax\nWe call for the imm\nediate removal of Council Tax referendum limits. Local authorities know the needs of their areas and should be free \nto \ndetermine their own Council Tax levels having regard to their existing democratic mandates. T\nhe \nnew \ncontrol\ns \nover levies \nthat are limiting the capacity of Combined Authorities to raise funding for infrastructure developments should also be removed and in the longer term successful Combined Authorities should be given precepting powers.\nCouncil Tax itself is in need of urgent\n reform. The \ncurrent property bandings are more than twenty years out of date and a\nrrangements need to be put in place \nnow \nfor \ngeneral\n revaluation\n. The structure and number of C\nouncil \nT\nax bands should be reviewed at the same time.\n \nOur ambition is that Coun\ncil Tax be developed as a fully localised tax and that the setting and adjustment of bandings should be done by Combined Authorities. We acknowledge that there will be complications in the first instance in this regard, but we would be willing to work with\n Government to make this change. The offer in return for th\nis devolution is that retained Council T\nax will be used to drive growth and increase prosperity and wellbeing in local areas, better \nmeeting\n the needs of local citizens\n and setting bands that more \naccurately reflect local \neconomic conditions\n.\nBusiness Rates\nLeeds has\n welcomed the retention of \n50% of \nbusiness rates\n beyond an agreed baseline\n, but \nbelieves\n that \nlocal authorities should be able to retain\n 100%\n of rates collected\n. This would further incen\ntivise authorities to support businesses in their\n \narea and would \nrecompense\n authorities \nfor the substantial investment they make in encouraging business growth\n and business start-ups. Under the current arrangements there was little by way of \na \ntax incentiv\ne for Leeds to \npush for \nthe acclaimed Trinity Shopping Centre, \nwhich opened\n in 2013. \nIf authorities were to keep 100% of business rates this would\n incentivise\n other areas to invest and support in such projects and enterprises.\nIt would also be \nappropriate \nfor\n cities to set their own business rates, as \nwas the case\n prior to 1990. Even within city regions there are diverse and complex economies which would be better managed by combined or local authorities controlling the business rates. This would eliminate \nthe problems arising in relation to a nationally set multiplier and encourage cities to come up with \ninnovative\n approaches to attract and support businesses.\nAn additional option could be to impose a retail levy on business units, similar to that introduce\nd in\n Northern Ireland on large retail stores. \nThe Northern Ireland Assembly passed \na new 8.5% local rate on retail outle\nts with a rateable value\n above £500,000\n, with the money being reinvested to help local SMEs and other growth targets. This same approach\n could be used in our Core Cities, drawing the benefits from investments into new shopping centres such as the Trinity Centre development in Leeds, and using them to help reinvigorate our local high streets and support local SMEs. \nEmployment Tax\nCities are being asked to work hard to support jobs and skills in order to boost the economy and reduce benefit bills. And yet despite this, and the costs incurred by local authorities in attempting to improve this situation, authorities are offered no par\nt of the benefits that come from their success in making improvements. A small percentage of devolved finance from either National Insurance or Income Tax would provide local authorities with greater expendable finance to improve employment conditions and \nmeet the needs of their communities that result from greater numbers of jobs i.e. in terms of infrastructure.   \n&#xa0;\nOn c\nhanges to borrowing and new funding\nIn terms of borrowing there is not a great deal that \nwe\n would desire that is not available already. \nThe bigger issue remains that cities lack the revenue streams to repay borrowing, something that fiscal devolution can help to address. \nOne adjustment which would be welcomed would be to change the interest rates for P\nublic \nW\norks \nL\noan \nB\noard loans\n, allowing\n authorities to borrow more to fund infrastructure projects. If borrowing rates for Combined Authorities were equalised with those available to LEPs then there would be less demand placed on those LEPs for them to borrow on their behalf, freeing LEPs to co\nncentrate on other priorities.\nThere is less of a need for new funding,\n with \nyields on \nbonds\n low and crowd sourcing carrying risks as yet unevaluated\n,\n and more of a need to reorganise current arrangements. Capital funds would be much better organised into \na single pot for each authority, utilising a new acc\nounting officer function at the Combined Authority level\n (see above)\n to ensure accountability. The current system of funds, which includes 36 streams for housing alone, is cumbersome and \ninefficient.\nTher\ne could also be more done to relieve the need for borrowing by relaxing the rules around commercial returns on fees and charges. For example the current arrangements \nto ringfence\n car parking charges\n, thereby limiting the capacity of authorities to reinvest\n this revenue to tackle other problems,\n inhibit\ns\n local councils from removing pressures to essential services. If \nthere is a genuine partnership between Whitehall and local authorities over funding then both parties will benefit and so will the general pub\nlic. \nIn addition there is further work to be done\n \nregarding the \nHousing Revenue Account\n borrowing cap\n,\n despite the adjustments made in the Autumn Statement. If authorities are able to\n demonstrate affordability and reliability of revenue\n they should not be\n limited by an arbitrary figure and need to apply through LEPs for additional borrowing. There is a desperate need to build new affordable homes across the country, not just in the South East, and lifting the cap on HRA borrowing would give \nus a much\n great\ner ability to meet that need.  Leeds has committed to build 70,000 new homes \nby 2028, \nand would welcome the \ngranting\n of greater borrowing capabilities to match the city’s ambition.\nOne concern is \nthe redistributive effect\n of recent government finance settl\nements\n which some authorities \nperceive\n to be unfair\n,\n particularly as the system no longer directly reflects need\n. This could be addressed by ministers retaining powers to set the \nquantum\n of funding, but appointing an independent commission to distribute that funding between local authorities. \n&#xa0;\nConcluding comments\nAs we have already noted, the case for the potential economic impact of the further devolution of powers is, in our view, unar\nguable. The key decision to be made is how devolution can be implemented while retaining sufficient oversight and accountability for the reassurance of Government, and we reiterate our welcome for the Select Committee’s interest in understanding how this c\nan be developed.\nAs the main drivers of the nation’s economy\n and home to a significant percentage of the population, \ncities like Leeds\n have\n the\n potential to far exceed their current performance in terms of growth, employment and wellbeing. \nU\nnder \nthe curren\nt centralised system we\n are stifled from innovation and from addressing local needs \neffectively. Setting England’s core c\nities free \nthrough fiscal devolution \nwill build upon the successes already made under \nCity D\neals and on individual projects\n, and addres\ns the imbalance that currently exists between benefits and costs for local authorities. \nLeeds City Council \nwould be pleased to offer\n further evidence or assistanc\ne as necessary to the Committee. \nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
