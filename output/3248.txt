&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Letter from Derek Provan Director of Airside Operations, Heathrow, dated 29 October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Dear Ms Ellman,&#xa0;I was very disappointed to have been unable to attend the Winter Resilience Inquiry oral evidence session on October 28th. I look forward to answering questions from your committee at a future date.I wanted to take this opportunity to give you a short summary of the impact of the storm on Heathrow's operations on October 28th.&#xa0;As noted in our written evidence, Heathrow is the world's busiest two runway airport and is effectively full. This means that flights affected by severe weather disruption can't be moved to later in the day because there is no slack in the system. Therefore, when we have a sufficient level of certainty in the weather forecast, our preference is to work with airlines to cancel flights in advance and introduce space into the schedule.&#xa0;On Sunday 27th October, following consultation between the Met Office, air traffic control and airlines, all parties agreed to reduce the number of flights operating on the next day (Monday 28th October) to ensure the safety of passengers and employees.&#xa0;Airlines reduced their schedule by the following:20% between 06.00-11.0010% between 11.00-16.005% for the rest of the day&#xa0;This plan led to the cancellation in advance of 131 flights with less than 10 cancelled on the day itself. We believe this advance planning leads to the best outcome for passengers as airlines can rebook passengers onto un-allocated seats on other flights. This significantly reduces disruption and enables airlines to give passengers clear information, in advance, about the status of their flightÂ   Pro-actively managing disruption in this way was one of the key recommendations of the 2011 Heathrow Winter Resilience Enquiry. To assist passengers, Heathrow also deployed over 50 reservists and volunteers to support those who needed help rebooking or advice for onward travel.&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
