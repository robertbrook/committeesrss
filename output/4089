defaultQ115default 
defaultChair:default This session is on the Government’s foreign policy towards the 
defaultUnited States
default. It is our third and final evidence session in this inquiry. I am pleased to welcome the witnesses: a warm welcome to you both. Minister, did the coalition, when it came into office in 2010, set out to change its approach to the 
defaultUnited States
default in any way?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default In any way, yes. Since I have been reading the file, I have been thinking about this quite a lot—how on earth you categorise the strength of the relationship at different periods. It is, of course, quite a difficult question to answer, because it works on so many different levels. You can have different parts of it working better or less well at different times, if you look back over the last 50 or 60 years, but absolutely there have been changes recently. I am not sure they are particularly political; I think they evolve naturally over time. The creation of the National Security Council and the appointment of a National Security Adviser are two obvious ones. I think for all of us involved in it at the various different levels—I have certainly seen this in the six weeks I have been in the Foreign Office—it is a relationship that is very strong.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultUS
default ambassador was in to see me in my first fortnight in the post. By the end of my first 10 days, I had met the 
defaultUS
default Secretary of State. We have Senator Rubio in tomorrow, and we had the Governor of Texas in last week, and so on.
default              
defaultIt is a relationship that, at our level, works well. The Foreign Secretary is in constant contact with the Secretary of State, the Deputy Prime Minister with the Vice-President and, 
defaultclearly, the Prime Minister with the President. It is a strong relationship which is constantly evolving. If you asked me for one thing, it is probably the National Security Council.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ116default 
defaultChair:default We will come back to that. The Foreign Secretary said that the relationship should always be “solid but not slavish”. Can you give any examples of being frank, not slavish? 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default Yes: the death penalty would be a good one. When I saw Governor Perry at the end of what was my second or third week, I was able to lobby him in some depth about one particular issue. We clearly quite simply have a difference of opinion on this. That was something we rehearsed again with the 
defaultUS
default ambassador, so that would be one very obvious example. There are other consular cases and extradition cases that fall into the same category. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ117default 
defaultChair:default Sometimes I think colleagues or diplomats get embarrassed by using the expression “special relationship”, so much so that people seem to go out of their way not to use it now, although interestingly enough we noticed when we were over in Washington that it was being used more there by the other side, as it were, than by our side. Do we have a policy on this? 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default No—indeed, the very first thing written at the top of my briefing note is “Special Relationship”. I absolutely promise you that there is no embarrassment here about using that phrase, nor should there be. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ118default 
defaultMr Baron:default Do you think that we are a bit too sensitive about the term “special relationship”? If it does not exist, somehow we feel as though our place in the world has slipped and all that sort of stuff, whereas in reality the relationship is firmly based on shared values and common interests, and we should be less sensitive about it. In fact, it is a good relationship, but we are a bit hypersensitive about the terminology. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default I think there is probably some truth in that. Getting hypersensitive over things is normally a sign of weakness, isn’t it? If you are confident about something, you do not worry about it. I have never detected any worry or insecurity about this from the American side. From my observations, with six weeks in the job, there is absolutely no reason for us to be sensitive about it in any way. We should probably get on with doing it rather more, and worry about it rather less, which is a way of paraphrasing exactly what you just said. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ119default 
defaultMr Baron:default Following on from that, may I talk about some of the decisions that have recently been made by the British Government, and concerns about how they affect the relationship? You will remember, Minister, that after the Syria vote, there were more than a few who suggested that that was somehow going to affect the relationship. One had then to remind them that although we did not participate in 
defaultVietnam
default, there was a very healthy relationship very shortly afterwards between the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, and Ronald Reagan. Would you agree that this relationship is based on fundamental shared values and common interests, and that, coming back to the Chairman’s original question, we should not worry about disagreeing with the US when we think we are right—we have done so in the past and the 
defaultrelationship has, perhaps, even benefited from that—as long as there is an honest exchange of views? 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default You can answer that question in two ways, and again I think you are absolutely right. My eyes are drawn to the quote from the US ambassador—it is rather good, this—who said: “
defaultThe idea that 13 votes
default…
defaulton a Thursday night at the end of the summer could disrupt seven decades of cooperation, World War Two and the Cold War and all the stuff we are engaged on now, just is incredible.”
default 
default              
defaultYou wanted a more practical example. Looking back on my military career, I served in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default, and a certain amount of money raised by the IRA came from 
defaultNoraid
default, across the water. When I was a soldier in the first Gulf war, we served directly alongside and next to an American division with whom we swapped industrial quantities of kit, expertise and friendship. 
default              
defaultAt the end of my 10 years in the Army, I worked for the Foreign Office in 
defaultBosnia
default, where the Americans were arming the Bosnian Muslims. The 
defaultmujaheddin
default brigade outside 
defaultMostar
default went from a rather badly equipped, second-rate operation to a group of people wearing American combat kit, with the newest weaponry, very little of which, I suspect, saw its time out in Bosnia. If you look back at the UK-US relationship, it has of course had bumpier moments, but you are absolutely right that that in no way undermines the fundamental relationship.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ120default 
defaultMr Baron:default Indeed, I remember escorting around the place in Northern Ireland American Senators who were not necessarily friendly to our cause.
default              
defaultIn conclusion, do you think we should be doing more as a country—both sides, perhaps—to play down the terminology and talk up more what the relationship is based on? We perhaps do not hear enough about that, apart from in 
defaultarenas
default such as this.
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default In a sense, I would return to your first question to me. I do not think that we should be too sensitive about it. It is a relationship that works extraordinarily. It feels natural when you come into a job such as mine. It just feels right. Coming back to the Chairman’s first question, it does not stop us having differences and raising points of difference, but it just feels right. Returning to my first answer to you, there is much to be said for getting on and doing it rather more, which I think we do anyway, and agonising about it rather less, because the fundamentals are so strong.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ121default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default I was interested in your personal experience and was going to ask you about that, but you have, in a sense, answered my questions.
default              
defaultOne way to put it would be that the Americans and the British see each other as the first ally, although, of course, we are not able to join in that in every circumstance; 
defaultVietnam
default is a clear indication of that. As a matter of choice, we would rather go to war with each other—on the same side. That is one element. Second is the right that the British Government have to access the Trident missile system, which no other country possesses. The third, which is perhaps more controversial at the moment, is the whole question of int
defaultelligence. There are the Five Eye
defaults, which we all know, but the relationship between the 
defaultUnited States
default and the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default is closer than any other relationship that the 
defaultUnited States
default has with anything else and vice versa. In all of that, it would appear that there is a military background. Is that enough? Do you see other 
defaultareas? Do the Government see other areas of co-operation that would raise the relationship beyond what would appear sometimes to be purely military?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default It is a good question. There are essentially three areas on which we concentrate, which are defence, in terms of conventional forces, intelligence and economic co-operation. Underpinning all that, however, is a sense of shared value, heritage and the like, which brings us close to the Americans. It clearly works in terms of the economy and defence. If people ask me for practical examples of where this works well, I would say the economy, defence and intelligence sharing, which are exactly the areas that you highlight. There is a whole piece of cultural values that lies around that that makes the relationship so strong. On top is an interwoven series of personal relationships—Prime Minister to President, Deputy Prime Minister to Vice-President, Foreign Secretary to Secretary of State and so on—that oil the wheels on a regular basis.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ122default 
defaultRory Stewart:default How much of your time do you spend on the bilateral relationship with the 
defaultUnited States
default?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default In six weeks, which is probably not a fair or representative sample, given that during that time we have had the Syria issue and the Iran issue, and I have been in the Middle East, which would be the Department’s third priority, and then to Libya, which is very important to us for other reasons, it has not had a huge amount of my time. In part, however, that is the case anyway, as there are so many other people working on it on so many different levels. At my level, you often follow the trouble a little more—if I can put it that way—and it clearly has not proven to be necessary.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ123default 
defaultRory Stewart:default Ballpark figure going forward? 10%? 20%?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default I am not sure. You are going to hate me for saying this, but I am not sure that I would want to be tied down, because one of the joys of the job that I do—Middle East and North Africa—is that you never quite know what lies around the corner at any one time. If I were to commit myself to something, you would undoubtedly have me back in six months’ time and say that some new crisis has arisen somewhere that you have spent a lot of time on.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ124default 
defaultRory Stewart:default There might be an argument—perhaps this is a bit perfectionist—that either you should have a Minister focused full time on the United States, in which case you might be able think about who your natural interlocutor would be to differentiate you from the National Security Adviser, or the Deputy Prime Minister or Foreign Secretary, or, vice versa, you should not really bother at all and just leave it to the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, because there are so many relations at that level anyway.
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default I profoundly disagree with that, because the strength of the relationship is that it works at so many different levels. We have talked about the three key relationships at the top of the tree—Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary—but there is then a whole range of other relationships that work incredibly well underneath that. I have checked the figures for this. We have 886 people across Government 
defaultworking across all Departments on the 
defaultUS
default network. There are then a further 573 MOD personnel, so you have a range of defence relationships working there. At official level, there is a further series of relationships—you have exchanges and all the rest. There are then parliamentary relationships. Part of the reason why I am able not to spend 25% or so of my time on this particular relationship is because it is well managed at so many different levels.
default              
defaultThere is a minor structural issue, in that my equivalent does not really exist in the 
defaultUnited States
default in quite the same way. On the other hand, there is a constant flow of 
defaultUS
default visitors coming through 
defaultLondon
default. The United States very often uses London as a first stopping-off point—noticeably, the Secretary of State, post-Geneva, came back to London to regroup before going back out to the Middle East—so you have a constant flow of visitors coming through at any time. That enables us to manage the relationship very effectively.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ125default 
defaultRory Stewart:default Following on from your observation about the staff, and indeed the increase in the number of staff you have in 
defaultWashington
default, there seems to be a challenge in how the embassy connects into the British system. The American system is a very different beast and American foreign policy is very different. It is very theoretical—some of our other witnesses have talked about the way in which military academies produce policy—and very contested.  It is very public and can go through rapid lurches. Over 
defaultAfghanistan
default, 
defaultLibya
default or 
defaultSyria
default, we can suddenly find ourselves left—or over 
defaultIran
default, more recently—as the 
defaultUnited States
default can suddenly swing position and we are left looking at the last position. Have we learned the lessons of the past 10 years? What reforms have we introduced into the embassy in 
defaultWashington
default to make sure that we are better able to sense the possible lurches, rather than connecting ourselves to whatever happens to be the Administration’s establishment wisdom at the time?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default I will say a few words on this and then bring in Kate afterwards. In a sense, what that analysis underplays is the strength of the personal relationship that exists between the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State. I suspect, although I have not checked this with him, that very few weeks pass when they do not speak, and they have spent quite a lot of time in each other’s company just recently. 
default              
defaultAs I said, at the end of the 
defaultIran
default talks, the Secretary of State came back to 
defaultLondon
default and spent the afternoon with the Foreign Secretary talking about a series of issues, and then they saw the Libyan Prime Minister together. Constantly at that level you have the relationship being managed. The Prime Minister speaks to the President on a regular basis and just before we came in here, we were talking about the Deputy Prime Minister’s 
defaultpossible 
defaultvisit in the new year, which will take in parts of 
defaultAmerica
default. I think that, at those levels, we speak to them so often that we are in an extraordinarily good position to see any changes of policy as they occur.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ126default 
defaultRory Stewart:default Minister, just to challenge that, you could almost turn that round and say that that is exactly why we keep getting it wrong. We tend to assume that the American system is like ours and that if you talk to the American Secretary of State, you know where things are going. That is why we find, for example, that policy will reverse on 
defaultAfghanistan
default, but we won’t really have seen it coming because we were not close enough, in that case, to people opposing David 
defaultPetraeus
default within the Department of Defence, and not close enough to a new shift in the Chief of Staff in the White House. We do not understand the way in which new donors or new pressures coming out of think-tanks are beginning to shift policy.
default              
defaultIt is very tempting, because we have a centralised system, to think that what the President or Secretary of State seems to be saying to you at one time is the direction in which things are going to go. Then, in three weeks, we suddenly find that what we have convinced ourselves is their policy on Iran is no longer be their policy on Iran, because it is a much more open, fragile and rapidly changing system.
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default All I can tell you is that on the basis of my experience thus far, I have been surprised and impressed by the closeness of the relationship, the way it works on many different levels and the fact that there seem to be so few surprises. To give you a practical example of how this works, when I was in the 
defaultMiddle East
default a couple of weeks ago, I was crisscrossing the path of the United States Secretary of State, who was also out there. We had a meeting with one of the key interlocutors before he did. We had a slightly surprising outcome, so the very first thing we did on leaving the meeting was to get hold of his private office and give it a download on exactly what had happened so that he could help us to move the thing along. I cannot think of many other people with whom we have that sort of relationship. I recognise the intellectual logic of what you are saying, but on the basis of my own experience thus far, that is not occurring here. I don’t know if Kate wants to add anything on the embassy side of things?
default              
defaultKate Smith:default Mr 
defaultStewart 
defaultwas absolutely right to describe the 
defaultUS
default policy-making landscape as he did. It is very complex and very multifaceted. There are a lot of agencies involved, and there are also influences outside the Government agencies, and of course Congress as well. That underlines how important it is to have a large and well-resourced embassy in 
defaultWashington
default, which we do, with 617 FCO-employed staff across the network. Their purpose is to stay across all those different tendencies, agencies and actors on the political scene so that we do not suffer some of the slips that Mr Stewart is describing, as 99% of the time we don’t—we cover it very well. Back in London, of course we have a much more centralised system, but we now have the National Security Council, which is intended exactly to bring around the table a number of the UK players who have their own relationships in Washington when we are looking at any specific issue that is being discussed, be it Afghanistan or whatever.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ127default 
defaultRory Stewart:default I am talking too much, so this will be my fi
defaultnal question, but let me just
default pin you with a very concrete example. If you look at how we failed to anticipate the shift in 
defaultUS
default policy on 
defaultAfghanistan
default, it was because you were trying to track your attention between 
defaultVice-President Biden
default, Secretary Clinton, Ambassador 
defaultHolbrooke
default and 
defaultGeneral 
defaultPetraeus
default. All of them had radically different views on counter-insurgency, negotiation with the Taliban, whether we were likely to succeed and whether the mission was failing. Those were very senior people, and the debate took place in a very private context. We tended always to be two or three months behind the curve, because we tended to reflect the conventional wisdom coming out of the White House. We failed to distinguish just how much tension there was, and we failed to realise that, in the end, the 
defaultPetraeus
default position was not going to win though. How do you learn lessons from that? How you do you change your profile in 
defaultWashington
default to get round that problem?
default              
defaultKate Smith:default I think I wasn’t around in the particular period you are describing, Mr Stewart, but I reiterate that I think the embassy goes about its political work in 
defaultWashington
default with exactly that intent in mind. It aims to cover all the bases and make sure that we stay up to speed with what is happening in 
defaultWashington
default. As I say, my impression is that the embassy does that extremely well. We don’t just see reports back from one or two particular actors. They cover a 
defaultvery wide range of players, and that is synthesised through the person of the ambassador and other people who report to us from the embassy back into the system here.
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default If I can reassure you, on the three big foreign policy issues of the moment—
defaultIran
default, 
defaultSyria
default and the 
defaultMiddle East
default peace process—I do not think that we would anticipate that happening.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ128default 
defaultSandra Osborne:default As a follow-up to that, we have heard evidence that the Government—and the FCO in particular—do not examine their approach to the US, and the UK’s relationship with the US, in the strategic fashion that you do with other countries, for which specific analysts are looking at internal politics and changes.  In the 
defaultUS
default, we have the pivot to 
defaultAsia
default. What is your view about that evidence?  Is the process due to these things depending so much on personal relationships, or a sort of misplaced sense of familiarity due to the special relationship?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default It is reassuring that we talked about this when we did some preparation for this session, and I was thinking about it in some depth over the weekend. It is terribly easy to think of this as a procedural, structural thing, and that you need to have a long-term strategic outlook. I am trying to think of anything that would have been done differently or what this would add to the process. The relationship is so well established—it works well on so many different levels—and the relationships are so well embedded in all the ways we have talked about thus far that I struggle to see quite what it would add that is not, in any event, happening there already.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ129default 
defaultSandra Osborne:default But things in the 
defaultUS
default have changed a great deal politically. There is this pivot to Asia, which I think other Members will ask about in more detail, so does not that say that we should view the situation differently and analyse the internal politics of the 
defaultUS
default in the same way as for every other country, rather than just take it for granted?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default As Kate said, our embassy—I presume it is our biggest embassy anywhere in the world—which is very well resourced, is engaged in that process day in, day out and week in, week out. You then have this series of other interlocking relationships that I already described, which makes us very well positioned to read this sort of thing. Things will change from time to time—they do here, after all—but I am not convinced that there is an absence of an overarching, strategic look at this. Even if you accept that there is—and I do not—I am not sure what that would add to the picture. 
default              
defaultKate Smith:default I would not want the Committee to get the impression that our embassy does not cover those issues. We get a constant stream of really top-quality analysis about internal political developments in the 
defaultUnited States
default. Shifts like the pivot or rebalance to 
defaultAsia
default, demographic trends and their impact on politics are just a few. Constantly—every week—we will get some piece of analysis like that from 
defaultWashington
default. The question is perhaps more about what is then done with that sort of analysis and how it feeds into policy making here in Whitehall, which is a slightly different one, but certainly we get a great deal of very good, in-depth analysis from the embassy.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ130default 
defaultSandra Osborne:default Would you be aware, for example, of whether the National Security Council has ever discussed trends in US politics as a strategic issue?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default I would have thought that there are very few meetings of the National Security Council at which the position of the 
defaultUnited States
default is not considered in considerable detail. Clearly, we need to be a little bit careful about what we say about this in public, but, certainly at the NSC meetings that I have been to, the 
defaultUS
default position has been very well analysed and covered.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ131default 
defaultMr Roy:default Minister, we have heard criticism of the underperformance of the UK-US Joint Strategy Board. You said earlier on that 
defaultyou 
defaultwould not like to be pinned down on an answer, but I would absolutely like to pin you down on some of the answers you have given me. The creation of the Joint Strategy Board was announced during President Obama’s much heralded state visit to the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default in May 2011. The board was to report to the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default and US National Security Advisers and was to meet “quarterly” in alternate 
defaultUK
default and US locations. The original No. 10 announcement about the Joint Strategy Board said that the two National Security Advisers would review its status and whether to renew its mandate after year 1. However, Minister, in an answer to me on 22 October to a question I asked about a review, you said, “
defaultThe Government has no pla
defaultns to review the work of the UK-
defaultUS Joint Strategy Board which is only in its second year.
default” Why the change from 2011 to 2013?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default The Joint Strategy Board, as you correctly said, was a recent initiative, set up during the state visit, that was designed to try to influence longer-term thinking and deep dives into particular policy areas. The board has met on a number of occasions and had discussions on a variety of issues that complement the various other policy conversations that happen on a daily basis at almost every level of government. The detail—this is where we get into slightly difficult territory—of those discussions is not routinely disclosed. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ132default 
defaultMr Roy:default That was not I asked you, Minister. In your answer, you told me that there would be no review, but the Prime Minister said that there would be a review. Who should the Committee believe?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default You should believe the answer that you received from me.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ133default 
defaultMr Roy:default Not the Prime Minister.
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default Well, the Prime Minister’s quote is presumably from a long time back—
default              
defaultMr Roy:default 2011.
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default Yes, exactly. So the answer you have now—
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ134default 
defaultMr Roy:default The Prime Minister said that there would be a review after one year. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultYes. Well, he probably said that when the thing was being set up.
default              defaultMr Roy: defaultHe did say that. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultAnd the answer you have had now is with the benefit of having seen the board operate. 
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ135default 
defaultMr Roy: defaultSo it was not reviewed.
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultIt is a Government policy that was perfectly sensibly adjusted in the light of experience— 
default              defaultMr Roy: defaultI want to be absolutely specific. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultThe answer you have received from me is the correct one. 
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ136default 
defaultMr Roy: defaultSo what was said in 2011 by No. 10 was wrong.
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultWell, it was their intention to do that. On the basis of our experience and what we have learned over the past couple of years, we have adjusted what we do in line with the answer we have given you. 
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ137default 
defaultMr Roy: defaultSo you have not had a review and you do not plan to have a review.
default              
defaultYou just said that the board met on a number of occasions. However, you did say that it would meet “quarterly” in alternate 
defaultUK
default and 
defaultUS
default locations. Minister, how many times has the Joint Strategy Board met since its creation in 2011? I am asking exactly the same thing that I asked you in my written question: how many times has the board met since its inception? I do not want to know what was said or the content of the meeting. How many times has it met? 
default              
defaultKate Smith:default May I take that question, Mr Roy? I do not think I can give you an exact answer. When the JSB was set up, it was a new and quite experimental form. The intention to have regular, quarterly meetings and a formal review was right at the time, but as it developed and as we have got used to working with it, that has changed. I would say that it is in a state of constant review to see whether it is still useful and doing what it was intended to do. We are still at that sort of stage with it.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ138default 
defaultMr Roy: defaultWe have moved on from the review, with respect. The question is: how many times have you met? The answer you gave me was: “The Government has had a number of discussions with US partners on a range of matters of mutual interest”, which did not answer the question. The question to you was: how many times has it met? You said that it was going to meet quarterly. If I work out the quarters, I would say that it has met roughly 10 times. I am not asking you for an average. It is easy to look up how many times it has met. What is the problem with just letting people know how many times it has met? 
default              
defaultKate Smith:default We can certainly do that. It is fair to say that it will not be as many as you just described, Mr Roy, because we have changed its modus operandi. 
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ139default 
defaultMr Roy: defaultOkay, I accept that. You just said that you can certainly do that. I am sorry that you could not do that for the written questions I asked, because that was not what you said. If it is easy to do it now, it should have been easy enough to give me those figures in a written reply on 22 October.  I am really sorry that the FCO decided— 
defaultChair:default Will you agree to write to the Committee about this?
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultYes. 
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ140default 
defaultMr Roy: defaultMinister, is your UK-US Joint Strategy Board, which was created in May 2011, performing a useful function, and if it is, what is it? 
default              
default              
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultIt performs the function that I outlined at the start of my answer to you. It provides a framework for longer-term thinking and it deep-dives into particular policy areas when we and the 
defaultUnited States
default agree that a more co-ordinated focus would help to strengthen our understanding of any particular issue. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ141default 
defaultMr Roy: defaultIs that medium to long-term thinking as well, Minister? 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultYes, but the crucial thing is that if the content of the discussions is made public, it does rather inhibit the nature of the frank discussions. 
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ142default 
defaultMr Roy: defaultAre the Government planning to consult or involve the 
defaultUS
default in the preparation of the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default’s next national security strategy and strategic defence and security review? If so, how? 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultIt is inconceivable, after having set up the NSC and having a National Security Adviser, given the strength of the relationship on intelligence matters, that any form of review will take place without considerable input from the 
defaultUnited States
default, so the answer to your question is yes. 
default              default              default              defaultQ143default 
defaultMr Roy: defaultThank you. Can I just ask that when you get a parliamentary question, you answer with the specific numbers? It really would have been helpful to get that information. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultIf we have caused offence in any way, I apologise, but the substance of the answer was correct. 
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ144default 
defaultMr Roy: defaultIt just looks as though you are trying to hide something; I am not offended by it. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultI do not think we should get too hung up on the fact that after a policy or process is announced, you see how it works and you adjust it in the light of your experience.
default              
defaultChair:default Minister, I think Mr Roy has made his point and I think you have got it. We look forward to getting your letter. Thank you. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ145default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default I am interested in the reference to long-term thinking. We now have a policy of having a Strategic Defence Review at prescribed intervals, whereas in the past they came up as and when they were thought necessary. We know that there is one scheduled in 2015. We discussed a little earlier what I described as the fact of both countries preferring each other to be, as it were, the first ally. How far would the Foreign Office seek to influence the outcome of that 2015 Strategic Defence Review to ensure that the preference for each other remains and, in particular, that the United Kingdom would be able to fulfil its obligations? 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default The strength of our defence relationship with the United States is such that it is inconceivable, given the importance of the interoperability of our forces, that we would embark on a defence review without considerable input from the United States, although clearly it is a national defence review and it will be done in that way. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ146default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default There is, of course, the question of resources. I think only four members of NATO now reach the suggested figure of 2% of GDP. Would you expect some concern from the point of view of the 
defaultUnited States
default were we to reduce the capacity for interoperability, as you have described, under the influence of budgetary considerations? 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default I would be very surprised, if that were to happen, if we did not receive representations from the United States because of the strength of the defence relationship, the importance of interoperability, and, of course, the importance to the United States of having their key ally alongside them in military operations. Absolutely, they will want to know that that will continue post any Strategic Defence Review. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ147default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default In particular, would the question of resilience be important? As a former serving soldier, you know that it is not enough to go and do six months and come back; sometimes you have to go for extended periods and have the capacity for what they used to call 
defaultroulement
default—the rotation of forces—in order to maintain a position. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default Yes, it is important. Clearly, the size of force you need to conduct a particular 
defaultroulement
default or rotation depends on what you have got committed to the operation. I am confident that our armed forces are of a size where they can continue to conduct operations, as they say in the Ministry of Defence, at a high tempo. Absolutely, that would be part of any future review of strategy.  
default              
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default May I turn to another issue, geographically as much anything else? 
default[
defaultInterruption.
default]
default              
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default A call from a 
defaultUnited States
default interlocutor. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ148default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default Perhaps the CIA are listening in. I would be disappointed if they were not. When we were in the 
defaultUnited States
default recently, half the people we met talked about a pivot, and the other half talked about rebalancing. Everyone seemed to go out of their way to suggest that the idea that Europe, and therefore the United Kingdom as part of Europe, was going to be abandoned in response to a perceived requirement to spend more time and resources in Asia—there seems to have been a modifying of the original impression and perception that was given by that. From the point of view of foreign policy, what do Her Majesty’s Government believe is the significance of the 
defaultUnited States
default talking in terms of what we might call rebalancing? Does that have implications for the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default? Does it have implications for 
defaultEurope
default in general? 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default That is a very good question, and it lies at the centre of much of the UK-US relationship. My own observation is that we may have over-interpreted this. Remember that we are having this discussion today, while the Prime Minister is in 
defaultChina
default with the largest-ever trade mission. We have made a virtue of trying to reach out to the BRICs and other economies like that, so you could equally allege that we are in a process of rebalancing. If you look at where the United States Secretary of State has been spending his time just recently, it is on 
defaultSyria
default, 
defaultIran
default, the Middle East peace process and 
defaultLibya
default. I suspect that if you pinched Mr Stewart’s analysis and asked him how much time he had spent on the rebalanced countries and how much he had spent on his traditional priorities, he would very firmly—it’s probably 90% on the traditional priorities and a tiny amount on the rebalanced ones.
default              
defaultAs a move of tactical significance, it may have been a bit overblown. I suspect that what people told you in 
defaultWashington
default is entirely reflective of what we have experienced.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ149default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default Should it bring about any change, either in substance or in emphasis, in the policy of Her Majesty’s Government towards the 
defaultUnited States
default?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default Clearly, we need to know what they are doing, understand why they are doing it and examine the reasons behind the various changes of policy, but as I say, it’s a process that in a sense we are undertaking in parallel. You can look at the way British foreign policy has started to take greater account of the emerging economic powerhouses around the world. That is something we discuss with the Americans regularly. I have discussed it myself with the 
defaultUS
default ambassador. He rather downplayed the significance of this Asian rebalancing or Pacific Rim rebalancing and said the relationship between the 
defaultUK
default and the 
defaultUS
default remains at the core of American foreign policy.
default              
defaultI think you can slightly over-analyse it. It is something we are aware of, but it is very easy to deal with, because in a sense it mirrors the majority of our own thinking.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ150default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default I shall ask one last question on this issue, then. Would you expect the policy of the 
defaultUnited States
default and the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default therefore to be one of co-operation in relation to the opportunities and the responsibilities that undoubtedly will arise in the event of a much more active attitude, either collectively—well, it will be mainly individually—in 
defaultAsia
default?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default Where our national interests are aligned, the answer to that is yes.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ151default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default Can you give any illustration of that? I won’t ask you a parliamentary question, but can you give any illustration of that?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default Yes. If you look at some of the causes of instability in the region, they are issues that we discuss regularly. Actually, I’ll tell you the best example. Funnily enough, it’s not in a straight area of foreign policy; it’s probably over the 
defaultPhilippines
default recently, when our experience of operating with the 
defaultUnited States
default allowed us to tie in our aid efforts very closely with them and co-operate and operate alongside them, to the benefit of all concerned.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ152default 
defaultChair:default Minister, if you were resident in 
defaultJapan
default at the moment, you would probably be rather pleased if there was a pivot to 
defaultAsia
default, looking at the tensions, so would you agree that, in effect, policy is dictated by events rather than it being a case of “This is where we’re going”?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default Generations of many much more distinguished diplomats than me have pointed out that the policy is the process. It is not a strictly 
defaultUS
default example, but I was very struck when I was in 
defaultVancouver
default a couple of years ago, just before the election. I remembered being there 20 years previously, when I was serving in the armed forces. I had not been there between those two visits, and as a city it had changed out of all recognition because of the influence of the 
defaultPacific Rim
default. The character of the city had just changed completely in those 20 years. It is a reflection of the new reality and the economic powerhouse that you see in the 
defaultPacific Rim
default. They look across the 
defaultPacific Ocean
default. They buy property there. They have relatives who work there. They have family connections and all the rest of it. It’s sort of a statement of the new reality.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ153default 
defaultChair:default If you contrast 
defaultFlorida
default with 
defaultVancouver
default, you realise that the country itself is—
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default Correct; yes.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ154default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default Minister, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, taken in conjunction with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, is seen by some as a failure of the multilateral trade rounds that have happened in the past to go much further. Neither TTIP nor the TPP includes 
defaultChina
default. It almost seems as though the 
defaultUnited States
default has gone out of its way not to include 
defaultChina
default. Do you feel that working with the 
defaultUS
default on TTIP jeopardises 
defaultUK
default interests in 
defaultChina
default?
default              
defaultKate Smith:default On TTIP?
default              
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default Yes.
default 
default              
defaultKate Smith:default Certainly not. TTIP, obviously, is essentially a bilateral trade agreement between the EU and the 
defaultUS
default. It is very ambitious and will be rather a different kind of trade agreement from some of the ones you are more familiar with, being really focused on regulatory coherence. You alluded to TPP and perhaps how that will interact with TTIP. We actually see opportunities there, to pick up the earlier discussion, and I think the door is still open in the 
defaultfuture for 
defaultChina
default to come into TPP. They are not part of the original group, but I do not think they have been excluded—eventually. On TTIP, clearly an ambition is very much, in certain areas, to set global standards in that practice of regulatory coherence. That may be something that participants in the global economy outside will want to look at and consider whether they would see an advantage in conforming to some of those standards. I think that is something that will obviously have an impact on 
defaultChina
default and on many other countries as well. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ155default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default To pick up on one or two points, it is very interesting that the Prime Minister is in China at the moment, talking about a UK-China trade relationship, when he knows full well that the EU does trade negotiations for members of the European Union, and not the individual nations themselves. Whether he is forecasting the outcome of a possible referendum in the next Government, if they are Conservative, I do not know, because obviously the 
defaultUK
default would then negotiate its own trading arrangements, as it would not be a member of the EU. However, I would guess that that is not the Prime Minister’s meaning, but it concerns me that 
defaultChina
default might not react kindly to the sort of pincer arrangement of the TPP and TTIP taking place, with it, although it might not be excluded eventually, not being invited, as the second-biggest economy in the world, to take part in the beginning.
default              
defaultKate Smith:default We are not part of TPP, so it would not be for us to comment on who—
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ156default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default I am asking about TTIP as well.
default              
defaultKate Smith:default Well, TTIP, as I said, is very ambitious as a transatlantic trade agreement. I think we will have our work cut out to conclude that. It will be a very complex deal to negotiate. The question of whether 
defaultChina
default eventually will come into any of these 
defaultplurilateral
default trade agreements is probably very much for the future. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ157default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default Do you feel that the Government are perhaps over-optimistic about the prospects for TTIP, particularly in terms of the time frame? If you look at the European Union, 28 different countries worked for decades to try and create a coherent single market, with diverse directives, technical standards, consumer protection and regulations—28 countries really working hard to get compromises that map into EU law and then national legislation—how do you think this is going to play out when, on a single market and these trading issues, we come, as a European Union, to try to do this with the United States? Will some individual countries in the European Union be a bit miffed that perhaps some of the directives are being watered down or relaxed in the case of the 
defaultUnited States
default? It is going to be a very much more difficult problem to crack than the timetable might suggest. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default In a sense, you may be right. You are absolutely right to point out that this is not a simple negotiation in any way, shape or form, but both sides have spent a very considerable amount of time looking at it and working out what needed to be done, and both sides remain absolutely committed to it. I hope very much, certainly from my point of view, that this will be a good thing. We need to work through whatever problems there are and attempt to get this signed as quickly as possible. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ158default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default What about the time frame? I am trying to get a feel for where you are on the time frame.
default              
defaultKate Smith:default There is a famous quote from just before negotiations started about the desire to get this done “on a single tank of gas”, but I am not sure how that converts into a time frame for a trade negotiation. There is an ambition to get this done reasonably quickly, but as you said, Mr 
defaultHendrick
default, it is very complex. However, progress has been remarkably good so far. 
default              
defaultWhile clearly there will be particular issues for specific member states—they will have interests that they want to preserve—and that will take time to overcome, there is such good will on both sides to get this done that the sort of time frame we have been thinking about is probably over one to two years from the start of negotiations. No one can predict that it will remain within that time frame, but that is the sort of level of ambition that negotiators are looking at.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ159default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default Looking at the FCO’s advocacy for TTIP with the Administration and in Congress, is the FCO just stressing the potential economic benefits of the agreement, or is it getting involved in any potential strategic ones as well?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default Funnily enough, when I saw our ambassador to 
defaultWashington
default in my first week, he actually made a point of saying to me that the primary benefits were economic, but that there were strategic benefits as well.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ160default 
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default Such as?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default We have talked quite a lot this afternoon about how the relationship with the United States works well on a number of different levels—economic, intelligence, defence—and if we conclude a trade agreement on top of this, that is another area of co-operation, which will therefore strengthen the relationship.
default              
defaultKate Smith:default I think I mentioned before, Mr 
defaultHendrick
default, the outcome of this, which will be to influence and set global rules and standards. It gives an opportunity to Europe and the 
defaultUS
default to influence the wider world just through what they create in this agreement. That is the strategic import of it.
default              
defaultMark defaultHendrickdefault:default I think that will be the main one.
default              
defaultKate Smith:default Yes. Also, the boost to economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic—which we hope will be the result of this—will demonstrate worldwide that it is not only in the emerging powers that economic growth can come from the recovery. That will be an important strategic message globally as well.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ161default 
defaultMike Gapes:default Minister, may I take you to the very important NATO summit that we are going to be hosting in 
defaultCardiff
default, I think in September next year? What do the Government want to get out of this in terms of the signals and the message sent to the 
defaultUnited States
default about the importance of NATO? In that context, concern has been expressed—including in evidence 
defaultthat we have received—that the 
defaultUS
default is giving less emphasis to NATO nowadays and is seeing TTIP and other things as more important for its transatlantic focus.
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default That is a good question. The Foreign Secretary is meeting NATO Foreign Ministers this afternoon, as we sit here.
default              
defaultIt is a pretty open secret that 
defaultUS
default concern about NATO is less about the 
defaultUS
default desire to see NATO remain strong than about the commitment of some of the partners in NATO to fulfil their commitments. For us here in the United Kingdom, a key part of our policy towards NATO is to encourage other member nations—our partners in Europe—to work hard to ensure that they fulfil their commitments and to prove to the United States that this is an alliance that will prove as successful going forward as it has proved thus far.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ162default 
defaultMike Gapes:default When we were in the States recently, we had some interesting discussions, including with people who said to us that even without the possible fiscal cliff, the US will be cutting $500 billion over a 10-year period—$50 billion a year—from its defence budget. As you know, the 
defaultUS
default now spends 75% of the total NATO defence spend, whereas it used to be 50%. Clearly, that has enormous implications for 
defaultEurope
default. What are we doing to encourage other NATO allies to spend more than they currently spend and perhaps spend the percentage of GDP that we spend? Does it help or hinder us if we are seen to be arguing almost at the behest of the 
defaultUS
default?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default I think that people at the top level of NATO are sophisticated enough to understand where we are coming from on this. They know that the 
defaultUnited States
default is a key ally and they recognise the pivotal importance of the 
defaultUnited States
default to NATO. We have opportunities in December at the European Council on defence to encourage other European countries to live up to their commitments. As you correctly said, we are hosting a NATO summit next year. 
default              
defaultEveryone is undergoing some form of retrenchment with defence budgets. If you look at the 
defaultUS
default figures, they can look fairly alarming if you present them in a fairly alarming way. Sometimes, you tend to forget the sheer scale of the 
defaultUnited States
default armed forces and just how much of this kit they have. You have presumably seen those photographs of endless tank regiments stretched out in the desert. Even if they do go through a period of retrenchment of the sort that you are talking about, they will still have considerable armed forces.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ163default 
defaultMike Gapes:default You have ministerial responsibility for the UK-US relationship, but the Minister for 
defaultEurope
default is responsible for the NATO relationship
default 
defaultin the Foreign Office team. Why is that, and how does that division of labour work?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default Reasonably easily is the answer. As you will probably know
default 
defaultalmost better than me, given your long history of involvement in this area—I am responsible for the US, but I also do the Middle East, North Africa and counter-terrorism—we all have to do a number of things and it depends on how it is divided up. It has not proved to be an obstacle thus far, let me put it that way.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ164default 
defaultMike Gapes:default Okay. We can probably pursue this at a later point, but not now. 
default              
defaultCan I take you to the implications of the vote by the House of Commons on 
defaultSyria
default? We have been in the States and talked to people there about what happened. I am interested in the FCO’s perception. Did the vote
default 
defaultat the end of August, which was clearly unexpected and unplanned, give the FCO’s 
defaultUS
default desk difficulties in explaining and dealing with that issue, at least until President Obama changed his approach?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default We have not detected any detrimental impact on the relationship in the Foreign Office. I quoted the 
defaultUS
default ambassador on that earlier in the session. As you correctly said, subsequent to that vote, events moved pretty quickly in all sorts of ways. The situation in 
defaultSyria
default is rather different from what it was at the end of August, but, no, I do not think that we have noticed that the vote has presented any substantive difficulties at all.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ165default 
defaultMike Gapes:default Will there be any lasting impact on the 
defaultUS
default perception of the 
defaultUK
default from that vote?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default Not that we have detected thus far. If you look at the areas of UK-US military co-operation in 
defaultAfghanistan
default and in 
defaultLibya
default on a much smaller scale, where we are involved in the process of training Libyan troops, there is absolutely no sign that that is the case at all.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ166default 
defaultMike Gapes:default There is not a perception that we are less likely to be engaged in military action or that the public mood in this country has moved more in that direction.
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default No.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ167default 
defaultMike Gapes:default Even though it has also seemed to have moved that way in the 
defaultUS
default as well.
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default It does, but there are many reasons that you could ascribe in explaining why the vote went the way it did. I think we would all agree that the bar for military involvement might have been raised somewhat, but I do not think that anyone thinks that that means never again in the future will we undertake military action.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ168default 
defaultMike Gapes:default In the Government document they published before the vote here, there was legal advice that there could be a legal basis for possible military action without a specific resolution authorising it from the Security Council. The French Government produced advice to the 
defaultAssemblée
default 
defaultN
defaultationale
default along similar lines—that, legally, they felt that they could take military action without a Security Council resolution. Is it your understanding that the 
defaultUS
default had the same position as regards the legal position on action?
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default To be honest, I don’t know. Because the 
defaultUS
default legal system is clearly different from ours, I don’t directly know. 
default              
defaultKate Smith:default I don’t know either. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ169default 
defaultMike Gapes:default We had some discussions in which it was suggested to us that the perception in the 
defaultUS
default was that it might have been “illegal but legitimate”. That certainly is a view that some people put to us. I am interested in the FCO’s view. Perhaps you can write to us.  
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultW
defaulte can certainly undertake to see whether we made any assessment of that at the time and what the position is. We will most certainly write to the Committee on that, but I am not a legal expert here, let alone in the States. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ170default 
defaultChair:default Can I continue to press you on the doctrine of responsibility to protect? If, as you say, you are not an expert, do write to us. 
default              
defaultThe position of the British Government was that we had a responsibility to protect innocent citizens in 
defaultSyria
default; that was the justification. Given that the responsibility to protect is a UN concept, is allowing an attack under the doctrine of responsibility to protect without a UN Security Council resolution not wandering off track a bit, given that a large body of opinion thinks that you do need a UN 
defaultSecurity Council resolution?
default When we were in the UN, we were told informally that the majority of UN members believed that there should be a Security Council resolution. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultBased on my experience, I think that if you can achieve a UN resolution, that is always the best way to proceed, 
defaultviz.
default 
defaultGulf
default war one, which was done under a clear UN resolution and that held the alliance together. 
default              
defaultWe have the advice here that gives you the three conditions that need to be met, if you are to do this. There are legal means by which you can do it without a UN resolution, but I think most people would probably agree that if you can get that UN resolution, that is the better way to proceed. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ171default 
defaultChair:default Without the UN resolution, however, it is whatever the country drawing up the legal opinion thinks it is. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultIt is their interpretation of UN law, correct. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ172default 
defaultChair:default So where does that leave the UN? 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultIf it disagrees? 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ173default 
defaultChair:default It is a UN concept, where the UN is not consulted. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultAs I am not a QC, the best thing might be if we got you the legal advice. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ174default 
defaultChair:default We would love to see the legal advice. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultThe question you are seeking to answer, if I have got this right, is, in the absence of a UN resolution, what would be the basis for intervention? Is that correct? 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ175default 
defaultMike Gapes:default Didn’t we have the legal advice in the note to the House of Commons, which was less detailed than the French advice? 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultI do not think that was quite the question that was asked, was it? As I understood it, your question was that in the absence of a UN resolution, what would the implications be for the UN if we were to take action?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ176default 
defaultChair:default I am dancing around the issue of the fact that responsibility to protect is a UN concept and when it was drawn up it was always envisaged that it would have the backing of the Security Council. That was at the world summit that gave birth to the concept. 
default              
defaultWe have taken the view that you do not need a Security Council resolution, so my question is—and by all means, reflect on this and write to us—where do you think that leaves the UN? I have to confess that it is a question I posed to the Foreign Secretary, who gave a circuitous answer as well. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson: defaultThe relief that washed over me when you said that was palpable; I was having one of those “This is above my pay grade” moments. We will absolutely get you the detailed advice.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ177default 
defaultChair:default When you do write, I would be grateful if you set out whether you believe that the 
defaultUS
default has the same view as us. Whether we are right or wrong, we do not know. What we would really like to know is whether we are on the same hymn sheet as the 
defaultUnited States
default. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default I absolutely see the rationale of the question. Do you want to write to us with the key legal questions you want answered? We will ensure that you receive a timely answer.
default              
defaultChair:default I’d like to think that those sitting behind you may have just taken note of this conversation. 
default              
defaultHugh Robertson:default If it is just that question, we will go ahead and do it. 
default              
defaultChair:default It is.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ178default 
defaultSir Menzies Campbell:default When you do so, will you ask those responsible for preparing the answer to take account of the intervention in Kosovo? 
default              
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan I add to my learned friend’s point here? The intervention in Kosovo—this
