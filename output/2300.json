"EIS 23\nWritten evidence submitted by Christian Aid&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1 Introduction &#xa0;\n1.1 Christian Aid is a Christian organisation that insists the world can and must be swiftly changed to one where everyone can live a full life, free from poverty. We work globally in 45 countries for profound change that erad\nicates the causes of poverty, striving to achieve equality, dignity and freedom for all, regardless of faith or nationality. We are part of a wider movement for social justice. We provide urgent, practical and effective assistance where need is great, tack\nling the effects of poverty as well as its root causes.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nThis submission sets out Christian Aid’s priority recommendations for the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee to consider in its inquiry into the extractives industry \nsector.  \nWhile the terms of reference of this inquiry focus on the impact of the UK extractives industry on the UK economy, we believe that as UK extractive industry companies operate in many countries, including many developing countries, their impact outside the \nUK should be addressed. There is also a clear moral obligation on the UK as the authority responsible for many of the ultimate parent companies to ensure that companies based in the UK are well regulated and transparent in every country where they operate.\n  Given that the UK is increasingly seeking multinational companies to headquarter in the UK there is a greater force behind this obligation\n and\n we have a duty to other countries to ensure the best possible regulation of these companies.\n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nIn this submi\nssion the term ‘UK extractives industry’ refers to extractives companies that are listed on the London Stock Exchange, are headquartered in UK or have significant operations within the UK. \n&#xa0;\n1.4 Christian Aid welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to this inquiry and would be happy to provide follow up written and verbal evidence by request through our Senior UK Political Advisor, Barry Johnston\n.\n&#xa0;\n2. The contribution of the UK extractives sector to the UK economy and economies in developing countries. &#xa0;2.1 \nThe UK’s extractive industr\ny \nsector as percentage of GDP is among the largest of all developed\n countries, and among the most significant in the EU\n.\n In a European context the UK is the E\nuropean \nU\nnion\n’s largest oil producer and the second largest producer of natural gas\n.\n \nIn \n2012, \nthere \nwere\n an estimated\n 329 extractive companies listed on the London Stock \nExchange\n, with a total value \nof\n £915bn, almost two thirds of Britain’s GDP.\n \n&#xa0;2.2 \nThe significance of extractive industries in resource rich developing countries is \nalso \nclear, and indeed increasing. \nThe IMF classifies about twenty\n A\nfrican countries as resource rich, as well as being export \nor fiscally dependant \non resource extraction\n.\n These countries comprise 56% of Africa’s population and 79.6% of its GDP.\n \nResource taxes accounted for an average of\n 40% of total tax collected 2008-11 compared with 35% 2000-2004\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.3 \nThe challenges of ensuring revenues from these industries are collected, and then well spent, is similarly clear, and detailed extensively in the 2013 Africa Progress Panel \nreport. \nThe\n report demonstrates that there \nis no automatic relationship between the extraction of \nnatural resources \nand \nequitable growth.\n \nN\nine \nout \nof the twelve African countries ranking lowest on the Human Development Index are mineral rich\n. \nThe Prime Minister has\n made it \nclear that tackling these problems ‘\nneeds political will from the developed world too.  We have the tools in our hands to tackle these problems’\n. Given the number of extractives companies listed on the London Stock \nExchange\n, and therefore subject\n to UK regulation, the UK has a substantial degree of influence \nin\n regulating the extractives industry worldwide\n and ensuring the population of developing countries benefit from their mineral wealth. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. The case for financial transparency and accountability - the UK as a centre of excellence for best practice in corporate Governance.&#xa0;3.1. At the G8 Leaders Summit in June the Prime Minister recognised the need for increased transparency and accountably for extractives companies stating that \n“\n… oil, gas \nand mining companies should report what they pay to governments, and that governments should publish what they receive, so that natural resources are a blessing and not a curse.”\n \nThere are several tools that the UK, both unilaterally, and as part of inter\nnational coalitions, should seek to use to ensure that UK extractive industries are part of the solution to creating thriving, sustainable societies wherever they operate, and not part of the problem.\n \nThe key areas where UK regulation can support developin\ng countries are through transparency and accountability.  \n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nThe UK, through support for the EU Accounting and Transparency Directives, has played a key role in new laws that will increase the transparency of payments made by extractive industries to go\nvernments in every country.  This will help citizens in many countries hold their governments to account and begin to tackle some of the problems of corruption in and around extractives projects and developments.  \n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nThis does not go far enough however.\n  Without further information beyond details of payments, it is impossible to place the information on payments in context and go beyond the simple question of what governments are doing with the money they receive, to being able to hold both governments a\nnd companies accountable for the terms under which \nsuch \nrevenues are received, to ensure they are both correct and a good deal for citizens. \nIt is increasingly accepted that \none sided\n contracts\n,\n invariably favouring extractives companies, sharp practices s\nuch as transfer mispricing and the use of tax havens, notably Switzerland in commodity trading, are causing developing countries to lose out on the benefits of the resource boom of the last 20 years\n.\n \n&#xa0;Country by Country Reporting \n&#xa0;\n3.4 \nThat greater \ntransparency is part of the solution is also increasingly accepted.  The International Development Committee and the European Parliament have both endorsed \nthe need for full, public, country by country reporting by multinational companies\n.\n  The G8 in Loug\nh Erne also committed to developing a form \nof country by country reporting,\n however the G8 did not recommend this information be placed in the public domain\n.\n There is a clear need for this information to be made public\n. C\nountry by country reporting will e\nnable citizens to be able to see the full picture of what extractive industries are contributing (or not) to their societies and be able to demand accountability either from governments for poor contract negotiation, or companies for sharp practice.  \n&#xa0;\n3.5 \nWhile the G8 has accepted that governments around the world will benefit from country by country reporting, without making such reporting public there does not appear to be any mechanism to ensure that all governments would be able to access such informat\nion, without either every country making a legislative change to require such information, or through a substantial revision to existing bilateral and multilateral information exchange agreements.  In light of the fact that the G8 has committed to requirin\ng companies to providing country by country reporting, the additional costs of making such reporting public will be minimal. This could result in a win-win for both business and society, and companies could point to this practice to enhance their reputatio\nn. \n&#xa0;\nBeneficial Ownership Transparency \n&#xa0;\n3.6 Alongside country-\nby\n-\ncountry reporting there is also a need for increased transparency of those who really own extractive industry companies.  As highlighted by both the G8 and the Africa Progress Panel the lack of public transparency over who owns extractive industry companie\ns is a serious problem.  In the Democratic Republic of Congo \n(DRC) \nfive mining contracts were awarded to anonymous companies in the British Virgin Islands \n(BVI) \nat a vastly under market rate and then sold on at market rate to major extractives companies, i\nncluding some listed on UK exchanges; the estimated cost to the DRC was $1.35bn or twice the health and education budget.  The \nidentities\n of those who owned, and benefitted from the BVI based company remain unknown\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.8 \nPublic registries of the real, beneficial owners would address this problem and not only provide a way to identify those profiting and hold them to account, but also to deter such practices form ever happening.  The UK made improving \ninformation about \ncomp\nany ownership a key part of the G8, with the Prime Minister making it clear he publicly supports public registries\n,\n which\n the Department of Business Innovation and Skills \nis now consulting on.  At the Open for Growth summit in London before the G8 some ex\ntractive industries also supported public registries\n, this has since been followed by\n t\nhe Institute of Directors, the \nhead of the \nBritish Banking Association\n, the \nhead of tax for the \nConfederation of British Industry\n and the World Economic Forum\n Council on Organized Crime, all of whom\n \nhave come on in support of pu\nblic registries\n, as well as Rio Tinto and the International Council on Mining and Meta\nls\n.\n \nPublic registries could confer clear benefits on the extractives industry, \nparticularly in the c\nase of joint ventures where it is becoming increasingly easy for companies to identify who is behind prospective partners.\n&#xa0;\n3.9 \nPublic opinion \nalso \nfavours actio\nn to make MNCs more transparent. \nA recent Christian Aid poll shows that almost nine out of ten \npeople, 87 per cent - up from 84 per cent in a previous poll believe that multinationals’ accounts should be more transparent and publicly available.\n \n&#xa0;\n4 Greater Transparency and Accountability: UK a global leader &#xa0;\n4.1 The \ngovernment has an obligation to\n set standards and\n enact\n legislation for extractive companies operating in its’ jurisdiction, it must ensure their corporate practices abide by applicable laws and human rights standards and address the capacity of this sector to ‘do harm’. This obligation has been recognised by \nthe Prime Minster who has spoken about the \n‘duty’\n we have to \nensure\n that resource wealth does not fuel conflict\n, \ncorruption and crime but \nis \ninstead a \n‘blessing’\n to developing countries\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.2 The UK must preserve its reputation on upholding high standards\n and must continue to seek to introduce legislation which complements \nexisting\n support for global processes\n, \nincluding the United Nations Guiding Principle on Business and Human Rights\n (UNGPs)\n.   \nWith \nleadership already shown in the extension of the Briber\ny Act 2010, policymakers now need to \nensure\n government procurement, investment support and export credit guarantees to UK extractive companies \nare\n based on high standard\ns\n in business practice and\n a respect for\n human rights \nstandards \noverseas.  \nFurthermore\n,\n \nkey \nnew\n legislation nee\nds to provide access to the UK j\nustice system for poor and affected communities wh\nen high standards are not met. \n4.3 Ethical reporting on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) needs to be improved. There is a heavy weighting of extractiv\ne companies on the LSE, however achievements to address their ability to ‘do harm’ has been slow.  It is important therefore to ensure that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is able to hol\nd\n companies to account for their behaviour. Other \ns\ntock exchange\ns, like the Hong Kong Exchange\n,\n already have higher reporting requirements for the environment and human rights. The adoption of similar reporting requirement to that of the Hong Kong Exchange would certainly improve the capacity of the FCA to implement du\ne diligence.\n&#xa0;4.4 The recently launched government action plan, \nGood Business Implementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Right\n states that the government will continue to help develop, and monitor implementation of OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict Affected and High-Risk Areas.\n \nGiven the poor record of the extractives sector on hu\nman rights, UK companies seeking government support (\neither through financing, insurance  or \n ‘soft’ support from \nUK Trade &amp; \nI\nnvestment\n) for extractives projects should be\n required\n to carry out human rights due dil\nigence as outlined \nin the UNGPs.\n \nThere mu\nst be a consistent approach across government on business and human rights in relation to the extractives sector\n.\n In particular, UK Trade &amp; Investment \nmust be transparent about its promotion of potential extractive projects and should not promote projects\n which pose risks to human rights, where it is not clear how the company concerned proposes to mitigate those risks. \n4.5 \nFinally\n,\n we urge the UK government to support and encourage the passage of the new European regulation in two key areas which will imp\nrove corporate transparency and accountability. The first is the Non-Financial Reporting for companies on their supply chains and human rights\n,\n and the second is for companies and individuals using natural resources\n to conduct risk-based supply chain due \ndiligence that meets international standards endorsed\n by the United Nations\n and by the OECD. The aim of such legislation would be to ensure that European companies source commodities responsibly and avoid funding conflict and instability or contributing to\n the commission of grave human rights abuses through their purchases. \n&#xa0;September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMining Contribution Index\n – Mining’s contribution to national economies in brief, \nhttp://www.minalliance.ca/pdfs/ICMM-Minings-Contribution-to-national-economies-InBrief.pdf\n \nRevenue Watch, \nhttp://www.revenuewatch.org/countries/europe/united-kingdom/overview\n \nhttp://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/05/15/alchemy-on-the-london-stock-market/\n \n Equatorial guinea, DRC, Angola, Nigeria, Chad, Gabon, Botswana, Cameroon, Congo, guinea, Mali, Niger, Zambia, Namibia, Ghana, Central African Repu\nblic, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Zimbabwe.\n \nAfrica Progress Panel Report\n, at 15 \n 2013 African Economic Outlook\n, \nhttp://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/\n \n \nAfrica Progress Panel Report\n, at 21\n \nIbid \n \nPrime Minister's speech at G8 Open for Growth\n \n \nPress conference: Prime Minister at end of G8 Summit\n There are too many reports to reference here, but a selection includes; \nAfrica Progress Panel Report 2013\n, \nWho Pays the Price?
