[[[This response from Assistant Chief Constable Janette McCormick, Cheshire Constabulary, National Policing Lead for Gypsy / Roma / Traveller issues, part of the Equality, Diversity &amp; Human Rights ]]]

[[[National Policing Business Area. ]]]I wish to comment on Clause 21 of the Draft Deregulation Bill regarding the removal of the power of Ministers to require local authorities to prepare housing strategies under Section 87 of the Local Government Act 2003 (including the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers). Whilst this proposal is consistent with the Government’s desire to promote the localism agenda, I am concerned that it fails to recognise the particular and urgent need for the provision of additional Gypsy and Traveller sites and the slow progress of local authorities towards meeting that need.Clause 21 proposes as follows:(1) Section 87 of the Local Government Act 2003 (which confers powers on the Secretary of State, in relation to England and the Welsh Ministers, in relation to Wales, to require local housing authorities to have housing strategies and to prepare housing statements) ceases to have effect in relation to England.Under 

[[[Section 225 of the Housing Act 2004]]], local authorities are required to develop and implement strategies to respond to the specific accommodation needs of the Gypsy and Traveller communities living in their areas. 

[[[Section 8 of the Housing Act 1985]]]

[[[ ]]]requires local authorities to consider the various accommodation needs of 

[[[all]]] local populations and to carry out periodic reviews in order to provide relevant and appropriate provision to meet these needs. Section 8 (1) actually says:-&#xa0;Every local housing authority shall consider housing conditions in their district and the needs of the district with respect to the provision of further housing accommodation.&#xa0;Given that the duty to consider the "needs of the district" will still apply in the future, it would only be sensible to continue the requirement to produce housing strategies and statements for reasons of public accountability at the very least. &#xa0;The key issue in respect of unauthorised Gypsy &amp; Traveller encampments is the lack of accommodation for the Travelling community. The shortage of suitable sites for Gypsy and Traveller families to live on and access as they move around the country leads to groups setting up unauthorised encampments (and increasingly unauthorised developments), thus creating the biggest single source of conflict between the Travelling and settled communities. Local Authorities were previously under a formal legal duty to provide sites for Gypsies and Travellers. This was established by the Caravan Sites Act 1968 which was a private members bill. The duty upon local authorities to provide sites was repealed by the then Government as a result of measures contained within the Criminal Justice &amp; Public Order Act 1994. By that time less than half of all local authorities had in fact complied with the previous duty. Virtually no action was taken against any authority in respect of that failing. Over the subsequent years since 1994 - coupled with continued migration and household formation - this has meant that the numbers of Gypsies and Travellers requiring authorised places to live or stop on far outweigh the number of authorised pitches available. In addition to the lack of available authorised pitches, Gypsies and Travellers have also historically found gaining planning permission a major obstacle to providing a site for themselves and their families. Those Gypsies and Travellers who can afford to buy land are frequently in breach of planning laws when they attempt to develop that land for residential use. Subsequently, they find themselves subject to enforcement action and often evicted, frequently resorting to the use of further unauthorised land or accommodation.Since Section 225 of the Housing Act 2004 was enacted along with other measures, there has been at least some positive progress in site provision, but the effect of Clause 21 of the Deregulation Bill would threaten such progress. According to the current most reliable figures, some 20% of the Gypsy and Traveller population in England who live in caravans reside on unauthorised encampments and unauthorised developments.  The simple reason why this occurs is that there is still inadequate provision of sites.  It has been widely reported that the UN Special Rapporteur on Housing, following her recent visit to the UK, stated:In closing, let me also mention that during my visit I have also received multiple testimonies on the shortage of sufficient, adequate and safe sites for Gypsy and Traveller communities across the United Kingdom, many of whom feel this is part of the stigma and discrimination they regularly face from Governments and society as a whole. Despite multiple efforts and policies put in place to address this situation, it is fair to say that leaving local authorities to make their own decision with no accountability and national process to reconcile the Gypsy and Traveller settled communities remains a source of concern.The Government’s current planning policy, Planning policy for traveller sites, states that every local authority should already have in place a five year deliverable supply of sites. As I understand it, virtually no local authorities have such a supply in place within their Local Plan.I suggest that this means that not only should there continue to be proper local housing strategies in place but also there should be on-going Government involvement to ensure that sites are provided, otherwise history has shown over the last five decades that local authorities will not provide the necessary sites.

[[[I foresee considerable issues ]]]

[[[with Clause 21 ]]]

[[[that would impact on policing and ask that these ]]]

[[[be taken into consideration when the bill is drafted. ]]]
