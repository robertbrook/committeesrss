[normal]Summary and Conclusions
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]The hourly rate[bold] used to value savings[bold] is reduced[bold] by a third[bold] 
[normal]but this is too little for HS2
[normal]Th[bold]at the[bold] [bold]time saved is [bold]already [bold]productive is ignored[bold]The proportion of business[bold] travel [bold]on HS2 [bold]increases[bold] by over a third[bold]Conclusion[bold]: [bold]The new treatment of the value time is profoundly unsatisfactory[bold]. It neither [bold]properly [bold]discusses the issue of working on trains, nor provides [bold]the evidence [bold]to justify the new approach. [bold]It def[bold]ies[bold] common sense – why would businesses be willing to pay as much to reduce [bold]already [bold]productive time as unproductive time? The[bold] proportion of business passengers using HS2 has very substantially increased (from about 28% to 38%), [bold]more than offsetting the reduction in unit values.[bold] [bold]Conclusion[bold]: [bold]The [bold]crowding benefits are not [bold]realistic. De-crowding benefits are attributed to HS2 [bold]when the real alternative (51m[bold] [bold]OA) is simply [bold]no more[bold] crowded.[bold]Conclusion[bold]: [bold]W[bold]hile w[bold]e are pleased that the new rail [bold]forecast [bold]model is [bold]finally being used[bold],[bold] [bold]we are puzzled[bold] that[bold] the intermodal [bold]comp[bold]etition[bold] that is not even [bold]recognised[bold] in [bold]DfT’s[bold] model [bold]is claimed to [bold]negate its effect[bold]. [bold] [bold]We remain concerned that[bold] demand [bold]growth [bold]is assumed to continue[bold] until [bold]demand[bold] doubles ([bold]instead of being [bold]capped[bold] [bold]after[bold] a [bold]set[bold] period[bold] related to the properties of the model[bold])[bold].[bold] [bold]Conclusion[bold]: [bold]Although [bold]optimism bias [bold]no longer inflates the [bold]savings figures, [bold]we are[bold] surprised at the large[bold] unexplained[bold] increase in savings[bold] since the August 2012 business case.[bold] [bold]Conclusion[bold]: [bold]Price competition does not just affect revenues. It affects demand too and in doing so has implications for classic network and re-use of freed up capacity.[bold] [bold]Conclusion[bold]: [bold]The [bold]KPMG work is not only defective, but its role as [bold]estimating benefits not already assessed in the NATA assessment[bold] [bold]is [bold]in[bold]correct.  The use of the value for money classifications intended for the assessment without WEI are misapplied and exaggerate the value for money [bold]DfT’s[bold] own analysis indicates.[bold]Conclusion[bold]: [bold]It is surprising that despite all the reviews of the business case there is still no provision [bold]or discussion about[bold] the cost of capital.[bold]Conclusion[bold]: The inconvenient truth is that the justification for [bold]high [bold]speed has ceased to exist, but it’s disadvantages remain.[bold]Annex[bold]&#xa0;[bold]November 2013

[normal]we have undertaken a comprehensive review of the 
[normal]evidence on values which have been estimated using different academic approaches. This shows that the values we use for business travel time savings lie very comfortably in the middle of the range suggested by other research evidence. The Department has th
[normal]erefore concluded that these values are a suitable representation of businesses’ willingness-to-pay for quicker journeys and take appropriate account of the extent to which people work on trains. ‘
