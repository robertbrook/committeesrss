&#xa0;Written evidence from Dr Paul Harlow&#xa0;

[[[Summary]]]No full and thorough contingent valuation has been made of the damage that HS2 will cause to the Chilterns AONB. Such a financial valuation should be made under best practice in order to make an appraisal of the scheme.In light of the State of Nature Report we now know that all significant areas of ecological and environmental significance must now be viewed as being of National Significance. The Chilterns AONB as an intact and well-preserved, protected landmass near its’ Metropoleis London and Birmingham deserves careful stewardship and the swift removal by Parliament of the risk that HS2 poses to it.&#xa0;

[[[HS2 Ltd]]]

[[[ has avoided any proper consideration of the monetary valuation of the Chiltern AONB as a whole and to its commercial/ tourist value (being one of the most visited Landscapes in Europe). This failure is largely as the issue represents one of the most perni]]]

[[[cious aspects of the scheme alongside proper compensation of the victims of HS2 and regional economic winners and losers.]]]

[[[KPMG’s report did not address the first two factors and barely hinted at the third (by the use of unexplained illustration, the matter]]]

[[[ was clarified under FOI).]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The committee needs to ensure that proper financial valuations have been made and factored into the business case.]]]&#xa0;At present Transport projects are currently appraised using detailed guidance produced by the Department for Transport (DfT). This approach uses the environmental capital approach, which describes sequentially the characteristic environmental features being appraised. HS2 ltd have taken a component rather than a whole approach to the AONB which I believe suits their purpose and business plan whilst effectively devaluing a National Asset that the Government is legally bound to protect.&#xa0;HS2 ltd promulgates a fiction that HS2 will not be damaging to the AONB (and draw false parallels to HS1 which used manor transport corridors). The Chiltern AONB Board and many environmental groups contest HS2 LTD view as to damage.The cost of following the M40 corridor was rejected on the basis of cost of tunnels(3Bn) to mitigate populations. The cost of mitigating tunnels (for engineering reasons / cost cutting (HS2 ltd)) in route 3 has already exceeded this amount

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The committee may want to consider the following guidance taken from the European Landscape Convention to which the UK is a signatory and appraise this.(I have bold italicized the pertinent aspects).&#xa0;Landscape is about the relationship between people and place. It provides the setting for our day-to-day lives. The term does not mean just special or designated landscapes and it does not only apply to the countryside. Landscape can mean a small patch of urban wasteland as much as a mountain range and an urban park as much as an expanse of lowland plain. It results from the way that different components of our environment - both natural (the influences of geology, soils, climate, flora and fauna) and cultural (the historical and current impact of land use, settlement, enclosure and other human interventions) - interact together and are perceived by us.The European landscape convention defines landscape as an „area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors. Landscape can be defined as “an expanse of scenery and objects which can be seen in a single view”. Landscape and townscape includes the look and form of buildings and includes heritage assets, for example, ancient field patterns and the layout of towns. This document helps consideration of whether your policy may have significant impacts on the landscape or townscape. These effects could be direct or indirect. You need to identify policy impacts, quantification of the impacts and finally monetisation those impacts where possible. You should also be aware of existing controls and restrictions on changes to the landscape and townscape. The paper is divided into seven sections &#xa0;1. Landscape as an ecosystem service &#xa0;2. Existing controls and restrictions on changes to the landscape and townscape &#xa0;3. Does the policy impact on landscape? &#xa0;4. Is the impact significant? &#xa0;5. Identification of the impact &#xa0;

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The E.L.C. advisesThe first question to consider is whether your policy will have an impact on landscape. 

[[[You should consider if your policy will: ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[· Lead to a change in land-use or farming practices ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[· Lead to visually intrusive development ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[· Lead to significant land-take (use of land for development) ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[· Lead to the demolition or dereliction of notable buildings ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[· Lead to the loss of local character ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[· Adversely affect land in any National Park, Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty or in their setting ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[If your policy will have an impact on landscape the second question is whether that impact will be significant.]]]

[[[you should include in your considerations the value which people place on the landscapes which will be changed (or created) by the policy option. ]]]
