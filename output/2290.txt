[[[What is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK? ]]]1.1  PWYP is concerned that the economic contribution of EI in the UK and other countries is not as positive as it should be. Globally, corruption and other aspects of the widely documented “resource curse” (or better: “resource challenge), including economic “externalities”, are recognised as wide-scale and largely socialised in terms of costs, i.e. costs are borne by society at large including in the UK. By contrast, EI profits are excessively privatised, including through exploitative contractual terms with some host countries (which ultimately impact on the UK through the effects of global poverty and poor resource governance), the use of profit shifting through transfer mispricing, secret deals, and the use of secretive shell companies and tax havens – the latter including UK Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. &#xa0;1.2  The world’s ten largest extractive companies, including London-listed BP, Shell, Glencore Xstrata, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Anglo American, are reported as owning and controlling more than 6,000 separate companies, at least a third of which are incorporated in tax secrecy jurisdictions (tax havens).&#xa0;1.3  Recommendation: To address concerns about profit shifting, transfer mispricing, secret deals and the use of secretive shell companies and tax havens, The UK Government should implement an open public registry of beneficial ownership for all UK-listed and UK-registered companies, and with other countries take speedy and effective action to curtail profit shifting and the use of tax secrecy jurisdictions (tax havens) – including among them UK Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies – and ensure publication of all EI contracts and licences.

[[[What are the corporate governance concerns raised by the number of extractive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there ]]]

[[[reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?]]]2.1  Besides the “externalities” referred to in para 1.1, which include negative environmental and human rights impacts, EI are associated in resource-rich developing countries with corruption,  capital flight and similar aspects of the “resource curse” (“resource challenge”), which across all economic sectors cost Africa an estimated $854bn from 1970 to 2008. &#xa0;2.2  Corporate governance concerns about EI companies listed and registered in the UK, and reputational risks for the UK and for UK financial institutions, are considerable and will remain significant and in some cases high for as long as the EI globally exhibit a lack of transparency and accountability and do not visibly contribute to equitable and sustainable patterns of economic development. An estimated 1.6 billion people live in resource-rich developing countries, of whom at present approximately 640m or 40% live on less than $2 a day (a higher proportion than in resource-poor countries), while EI senior executives earn far more than is reasonable. &#xa0;2.3  UK-listed EI companies and UK financial institutions will therefore be associated with a sense of injustice on the part of hundreds of thousands of citizens of resource-rich developing countries unless and until UK-listed/registered companies are clearly and comprehensively proven to be contributing equitably and sustainably to host-country economies through payment of appropriate levels of taxes, royalties, etc., for the non-renewable natural resource they extract. &#xa0;2.4  Recommendation: The UK Government should ensure speedy and effective implementation of the EU Accounting Directive (Chapter 10: country-by-country reporting of payments to governments) and the Transparency Directive, and as soon as possible implement the Directives with open and machine-readable data according to the G8 Open Data Charter. In addition, EI financial transparency in the UK and EU needs to be accompanied by the establishment of a global mandatory EI financial transparency standard, i.e. equivalent disclosure rules in all major jurisdictions and capital markets, and to lead to effective EI financial accountability, including regarding company beneficial ownership and contract transparency as noted in para 1.3 above, with empowered and informed civil society in resource-rich developing countries able to hold companies and their governments to account for natural resource revenues.

[[[Is there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive ]]]

[[[industries and NGOs?]]]3.1  To date there has not been sufficient constructive engagement between UK EI companies and NGOs. In PWYP’s experience, EI companies have engaged only very reluctantly in initiatives that enhance transparency and accountability, often alleging – but failing to satisfactorily substantiate – cost, confidentiality, competitiveness and supposed criminal liability as reasons why they cannot become more transparent and accountable. &#xa0;3.2  However, there have been differences between mining and oil companies in this regard, and among oil companies. Among the larger companies, miners have appeared more willing to recognise and implement the emerging global mandatory transparency standard than have oil companies, although among UK oil companies one smaller company has already embraced financial transparency on a proactive and voluntary basis. &#xa0;3.3  PWYP has concerns about the fact that UK-listed and UK-registered EI multinational companies that belong to the American Petroleum Institute (API) have not dissociated themselves from, and therefore can be considered to support, the API’s law suit in the US against the SEC’s rules for Dodd-Frank Section 1504 (country-by-country reporting of payments to governments, equivalent to the EU Directives’ requirements).&#xa0;3.4  Some EI companies have been lobbying to delay and/or weaken UK and EU implementation of the Accounting and Transparency Directives, such as by pleading the need for specific country exemptions and/or alleging competitiveness concerns in light of delays in US implementation of Dodd-Frank Section 1504 following the API court case, which the companies themselves instigated. All this despite the UK Government’s and the G8’s public commitment to see these Directives speedily and fully implemented. PWYP regards this as a lack of good faith on the part of such companies, which claim to champion transparency and to obey the law wherever they operate.&#xa0;3.5  Recommendation: The UK Government should make it clear to EI companies that a global mandatory transparency standard, without any country reporting exemptions, is here to stay and that it will not consider special pleading on the part of EI companies on alleged competition, confidentiality, cost or other grounds. &#xa0;

[[[ the industry of the UK signing up to the EITI?]]]4.1  PWYP has called for the UK to sign up to the EITI for some years and sees this as a positive step. As the initiator of the EITI, the UK’s commitment to implement helps address objections that the EITI has been yet another instance of the global North telling the South what to do. It will also provide a forum in which UK civil society can, potentially, dialogue constructively with industry and government.&#xa0;4.2  There is a need for UK EITI delivery to match the rhetoric about the UK “getting its house in order”. Although, unlike Norway, the UK failed to invest proceeds from its North Sea oil bonanza in long-term funding for pensions and other public goods, the UK needs a well-informed public debate about resource sustainability, progress towards a low-carbon economy and the entrenchment of transparency as a national norm.&#xa0;4.3  The UK should implement the EITI to a high standard. Anything less will reflect negatively on the UK’s reputation as a champion of EI good governance. &#xa0;4.4  Recommendation:  The UK Government should ensure that the UK pilots the EITI‘s recommendation for beneficial ownership public transparency; ensure full EI contract transparency in the UK; through the multi-stakeholder group support “capacity-building efforts, especially with civil society and through civil society organisations, to increase awareness of the process, improve understanding of the information and data from the reports, and encourage use of the information”; and as soon as possible implement the EITI with open and machine-readable data. &#xa0;

[[[Would increased regulation for London listed extractives companies result in competition from elsewhere or can it be used to make the UK a]]]

[[[ centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance?]]]5.1  The UK should apply proportionate and effective regulation to UK-listed and UK-registered EI companies, irrespective of potential or alleged effects on competition. Attempting to benefit from anything resembling a “race to the bottom” would be a poor approach for the UK to take and undermine its international moral authority in this area.&#xa0;5.2  Prompt, comprehensive and effective implementation of the Accounting and Transparency Directives, as noted above, can and should improve the UK as a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance.&#xa0;5.3  Recommendation: The UK’s enforcement regime under Article 51 of the Accounting Directive needs to be seen to be effective. This requires adequate Government resourcing of scrutiny of company reports under the Directives and sufficient penalties to deter misreporting.&#xa0;&#xa0; 23 September 2013
