[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Overview]]]This submission is based on the results of a survey sent out to all NAPIT Trade Association full scope electrical members. The survey was designed to capture members views on the questions put forward in the CLG Select Committee’s call for evidence. Survey respondents were full scope competent registered electrical installers with the competent person scheme provider NAPIT Registration. In total, 450 registered electrical installers filled in the questionnaire. &#xa0;Please note this response reflects the views of the 450 registered electrical installers who responded to the survey and anecdotal evidence I have received as Chairman of the NAPIT Trade Association and is not designed to reflect the views of all individual members. &#xa0;

[[[About ]]]

[[[NAPIT ]]]

[[[Trade Association]]]The National Association of Professional Inspectors and Testers (NAPIT) is a trade association that has been representing professional electricians for over 20 years. The trade association strives to enhance the success and excellence of its membership through the promotion of professionalism and best business practice. &#xa0;

[[[ Awareness]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[1.1]]] When asked about levels of consumer awareness of the Competent Person Scheme, the majority of respondents (39.3 per cent) said few of their customers had a basic understanding. A further 35.6 per cent said hardly any of their customers were aware of the initiative.

[[[1.2]]] In response to whether consumers were aware of their responsibility to ensure electrical work in their home complies with the Building Regulations, almost half (48.2 per cent) said hardly any were aware, with a further 36.2 per cent saying that few were aware of their responsibilities.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[1.3]]] When asked whether the two consumer facing registers should come together and form one that would promote all full scope registered electrical installers working in England and Wales, 72.2 per cent of respondents thought they should, 16.7 per cent weren’t sure and only 11.1 per cent thought they shouldn’t. The creation of one single list would help to create an easier message to promote the use of Competent Registered Electricians to consumers via. The promotion of this single quality mark and list by all electrical Competent Person Scheme Providers would also help focus the message and therefore the promotion.&#xa0;

[[[1.4]]] The single quality mark would go some way to raising the profile of competent, registered electricians and electrical safety in the home, but awareness is not just about a memorable mark, easy to use search facility, and a simple message. Tightening up the Building Regulation enforcement framework and introducing measures that may reduce the ability of unsafe, electrical installers to undercut competent, registered operatives are also steps that would need to be taken to decisively address the problem of low consumer awareness.&#xa0;

[[[Lack of Enforcement]]]

[[[1.5]]] The limitations of current Building Control enforcement of Building Regulation compliance were highlighted in a DCLG report commissioned during the consultation process for changes to Part P which took place in 2012. The report, compiled by EC Harris, noted: “The building control enforcement landscape is one of extremes. On the one hand there is an extremely, perhaps unduly, low level of formal enforcement applied. Against this there is a massive (5million p.a.) portfolio of informal compliance interventions being conducted. It has also been shaped by the particular unwieldiness of building control law and the constraints of its formal enforcement procedures”   &#xa0;

[[[1.6]]] The lack of adequate enforcement of the Building Regulations alluded to here, and supported by extensive anecdotal evidence from NAPIT members, means unregistered installers and cowboys who chose not to comply with the regulations or notify work are able to undercut those competent registered electricians. &#xa0;

[[[1.7]]] Anecdotal evidence also exists to suggest that work carried out by registered installers does not always comply with Building Regulations and is not always notified as it should be.

[[[Adequacy of T]]]

[[[raining ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Non-registered Individuals]]]

[[[2.1]]] There are many electrical installations carried out each year by inadequately trained individuals such as unregistered electricians and rogue traders. 

[[[When asked about the nature of the electrical work they do, 60.4 per cent of survey respondents said remedial work to electrical installations accounted for, on average, between 26 and 75 per cent of their work load.]]] This type of work accounted for less than 26 per cent of the workload of 30.7 per cent of respondents but a worrying 7.6 per cent said this accounted for more than 76 percent of their workload. &#xa0;

[[[2.2]]] When asked about the nature of this remedial work, 88.9 per cent of respondents indicated that they had been called out to fix the work of a non-registered electrician, 45.8 per cent said dealing with the work of non-registered electricians accounted for between 26 and 75 per cent of their work and 7.8 per cent estimated that the figure was higher

[[[.]]]

[[[ ]]]The extent of non-compliant work which had been carried out by registered members of Electrical Competent Person Schemes did not form part of the survey. &#xa0;

[[[2.]]]

[[[3]]] The Committee may be aware of the provision of new Conditions of Authorisation set by DGLG in 2012.  One of the most significant requirements set out in this new document is that all CPS providers gain must UKAS accreditation before June 2014. The industry standard the CPS providers work to in order to satisfy UKAS accreditation criteria is the Electrotechnical Assessment Specification (EAS). This specification was written by the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) in collaboration with a number of industry stakeholders including NAPIT Trade Association and UKAS. &#xa0;

[[[2.]]]

[[[4]]] 59 per cent of respondents to the survey believe the EAS standards are satisfactory in showing the electrical installers are of a standard to complete work which complies with wiring regulations and building regulations. Only 5.3 per cent said EAS standards were too low, while 6.2 per cent said they were too high. A further 29.3 per cent weren’t sure.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[2.]]]

[[[5]]] However, the EAS only refers to ‘enterprises’ and does not ensure all operatives working on electrics within a company are brought up to the same skill level. NAPIT TA members have often expressed concerns that the current emphasis in this document on registered enterprises/ qualified supervisors (QS) means only one electrical installer in each registered enterprise need to demonstrate their competence via the EAS standards and through regular assessments.   

[[[2.]]]

[[[6]]] Many survey respondents profoundly disagree with this approach. When questioned on the qualified supervisor model, 64.4 per cent of respondents said that it was unacceptable and dangerous as the QS may not always be present at all stages of installation process and may not see a potential fault. Only 25.1 per cent were of the opposite view, that it was acceptable and safe as the QS has responsibility for all electrical work done by non-assessed electricians. A further 10.4 per cent weren’t sure. This suggests the majority of respondents would support steps towards an individual competency model that would increase the extent to which all operatives are brought up to the same skill level.&#xa0;

[[[Electrical Work and those carryin]]]

[[[g it out]]]

[[[3.1]]] Industry estimates suggest that there are currently 58,000 practicing electrical installers in England and Wales, of which only 40,000 are currently registered. This means there may be around 18,000 electrical installers whose competency, and therefore ongoing ability to comply with the Building Regulations, is not reviewed. On top of this, it is estimated that a staggering 0.95 million jobs a year are carried out by DIYers, of which five per cent are currently notifiable. A 2011 survey of 3,763 electrical installers registered with ECA, Elecsa, NAPIT and the NICEIC provided a useful insight into this. Respondents to that survey estimated that 25.19 per cent of non-registered installers’ work, and 63.43 per cent of DIY enthusiasts’, was “usually poor”. This suggests that there are lots of people carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply, who may not have had their work reviewed at all&#xa0;

[[[3.2]]] Introducing a more effective framework to encourage more electricians to choose to register under the Competent Person Scheme and discourage householders from attempting electrical work themselves, would improve this situation. In total, 85.3 per cent of survey respondents thought all installers carrying out work under the Building Regulations should be registered as Competent Persons, while 81.1 per cent would support the introduction of a legal requirement for all practicing electrical installers to be registered as individually competent.&#xa0;

[[[3.3]]] In total, 86.4 per cent of respondents, say they have had their work reviewed by their Competent Person Scheme Provider NAPIT Registration, to a standard that ensures it continues to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations. A further 7.1 per cent were unsure while 6.4 per cent said they did not.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[3.4]]] The specification mentioned above, EAS, will further regulate the training and assessment criteria to be met by competent registered electrical installers. In total, 65.5 per cent of respondents said they thought these standards were either satisfactory or too high (with only 5.6 per cent saying they were too low). 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Effect of ]]]

[[[Registration Scheme and Register Competition]]]

[[[5.1]]] The survey asked: Which of the statements about the competition between CPS providers do you agree with:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[5.2]]] Responses indicate that all of these factors play a part in the current electrical Competent Person Scheme arena. A total of 20.4 per cent thought competition was bad because it drove standards down and 28.2 per cent thought it was bad because it limited consumer awareness. However, this is set against the 38.2 per cent of respondents who thought that competition was good because without it prices would be higher and the 59.6 per cent that thought competition was good because it offered them choice.&#xa0;

[[[5.3]]] By recoding this data into positive and negative statements, we can see that while 48.6 per cent of respondents thought competition was bad, more than twice as many (97.8) saw competition as a good thing for them. &#xa0;

[[[5.4]]] The two negative aspects of competition that we have identified here are currently being addressed in line with DCLG’s 2012 Conditions of Authorisation. &#xa0;

[[[5.5]]] It is hoped that the new EAS 2012 standards, to be introduced in June 2014, will help to address the current issues in the industry around the dilution of standards. &#xa0;

[[[5.6]]] The concern that competition creates a confused market for consumers has also been addressed. One of DCLG’s Conditions of Authorisation is to promote awareness of the Competent Person Scheme to consumers. This response highlights the effects of competition in the market going forward, will be predominantly positive. &#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0; EC Harris (January 2012).,
