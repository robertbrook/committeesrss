[normal]Distraction of [bold]private industry[bold] -I am spending a lot of personal time on this issue when I could be growing my business faster (Synseal extrusions employ 850 people

[normal]currently- grown from 500 23 years ago) (Doc 19)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The solution to much of the above loss of revenue and waste of taxpayers
[normal]’
[normal] money is to add some additional rights of way clauses into the Bill which would have the following effect
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What I am suggesting would for the most part either be highly deregulatory or have a nil
[normal] 
[normal]net effect on regulation and red tape. (Reclassifying green lanes to become restricted byways will eliminate altogether the costs and bureaucracy involved in the processing of rights of way claims on them. The downgrading of BOATs to restricted byways would have
[normal] 
[normal]a net nil effect in terms of red tape/bureaucracy. The creation of a right to appeal against a highway authority refusing to use a Traffic Regulation Order would not be deregulatory but it does, however, fit squarely within the government's localism agenda.)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Everything suggested will have the key benefits of protecting the environment of the national parks and non-vehicle users, and it would eliminate the waste of the public money
[normal] 
[normal]which is being spent by highway authorities on repairing and re-repairing unsealed lanes damaged by 4x4s and motor bikes.
