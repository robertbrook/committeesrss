[[[Written Evidence from Women on Boards UK [CEP0003]]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Women on Boards UK is a UK-wide organisation for women seeking to leverage their professional skills and experience into board and leadership roles.  Our focus is to encourage, inspire and actively support women - from all sectors - to find their own pathway to the boardroom.&#xa0; Our goal is a measurable and sustainable increase in the number of women on boards and in leadership roles across all sectors in the UK.  We provide a complementary service for charities to advertise board vacancies and support our members to apply for trustee roles.  Currently we have 4700 members in the UK. &#xa0;

[[[Women on Boards UK:]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Under the Charities SORP, charities are already required to disclose in their accounts the number of staff paid over £60,000, in £10,000 bands.  Women on Boards supports extending this requirement to disclose the total amount of employee benefits received by any individual employee paid over £100,000. &#xa0;The 2012 Women Count: Charity leaders 2012 report provided evidence that – as the sector with the most female CEOs - the charity sector is an important training sector for women, equipping them to move into executive and board roles on the FTSE and in private companies and the public sector.&#xa0;Women on Boards does not support a statutory cap on salaries in the charity sector as we believe reducing the pay of CEOs in this sector would further disadvantage already underpaid women working in this sector, and would lead to a reduction in the caliber of the women seeking the CEO roles with obvious knock-on implications.&#xa0;The 2011/2012 annual pay survey of the Association of Chief Executive Officers of Voluntary Organisations reports a pay gap of 16% between male and female chief executives in voluntary bodies with the pay gap rising to almost 30% for some roles.  &#xa0;Women on Boards believes that requiring organisations in all sectors to analyse and report their gender pay gap publically, is the single most important step that can be taken towards reducing these inequities.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
