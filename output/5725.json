"Welsh Affairs Committee\nOral evidence:\n \nPre-legislative scrutiny of the Draft Wales Bill\n, HC \n962\nThursday 30 January 2014\nOrdered by the House of Commons to be published on \n30 January 2014.\nWatch the meeting\nMembers present: \nDavid T. C. Davies (Chair); \nGuto\n \nBebb\n; Glyn Davies; Stephen Doughty; \nNia\n Griffith; Mrs \nSiân\n C. Jones; Jessica Morden; Mr Mark Williams; \nHywel\n Williams\nQuestions 371-438\nWitness\n[\nes\n]\n: \nRt Hon David Jones MP, Secretary of State for Wales,\n David Gauke \nMP, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, and \nGeth Williams,\n Deputy Director, Constitution\n and Corporate Services\n, Wales Office,\n \ngave evidence.  \nQ371 &#xa0; \nChair: \nGood afternoon, Mr Jones and Mr \nGauke\n,\n \nSecretary of State, Minister.\n \nMr Jones: \nGood afternoon, Minister Davies.\nQ372 &#xa0; \nChair: \nI am glad to see that some of us agree that a certain air of formality is a good thing on these occasions. \nMr Jones: \nMr Chairman, I did make a request that I deliver a very\n, very\n brief statement beforehand. If you would be willing to allow me to do so, I would greatly appreciate it.\nChair: \nI am perfectly happy with that.\nMr Jones: \nCan I say that I am very pleased to appear before you here today to \ntalk about the draft Wales Bill?\n I am grateful to you and the Committee for the rigorous scrutiny of the Bill and the commendable speed with which you are undertaking it. It is eight years since a Wales\n&#x2011;\nonly\n Bill was last before Parliament\n, and I think that this Bill is \nevery bit as important for Welsh devolution as the Government of Wales Act 2\n006. \nThrough this Bill, the Government will deliver an ambitious package of devolved powers for \nWales\n. I believe that the tax and borrowing powers we propose devolving, as well as the power to trigger a referendum on the devolution of a portion of income tax, present very real incentives and opportunities for the Welsh Government to grow the Welsh economy and increase prosperity in \nWales\n. Since devolution, the Assembly and the Welsh Government have been accountable only for how they spend taxpayers\n’\n money. This draft Bill will ensure that they now become more accou\nntable for how they raise it. \nThe draft Bill also includes provisions relating to Assembly elections, on which we consulted in 2012, and several provisio\nns that the Welsh Government have\n specifically requested. Taken together, Mr Chairman, I believe that the significant package of powers contained in the draft Wales Bill makes devolved governance in Wales fairer, more accountable and places more economic levers in the hands\n of the Welsh Government, which \nthey hope\nfully\n will use to support economic growth in Wales \nand \nto give the Welsh economy a real competitive edge.\n Thank you very much, Mr Chairman.\nQ373 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThank you very much. May I say \nthat \nwe are grateful for your recognition of the quite significant extra wor\nk this has put on the Committee? The m\nembers have been very happy to fulfil\n their obligation, of course. \nOne thing that would interest us is, given the amount of work the Committee has put into scrutinising this and the criticisms that we have heard, how willing are you as a Government, as Ministers\n,\n to amend the Bill following the report that we will be shortly writing?\nMr Jones: \nPredictably, Mr Chairman, I must say it depends on what the proposed amendments are. Clearly\n,\n we will give very careful consideration to them and we will respond in the usual course, but\n,\n without knowing what they may be\n,\n it is hard for me to comment further. \nQ374 &#xa0; \nChair: But you would be open-\nminded and willing to make those changes if you feel they are reasonable\n.\nMr Jones: \nIf we felt that there were compelling reasons to make amendments, we would. What I would say, however, in all fairness\n,\n is that parliamentary time is very constrained now. We are anxious to proceed with this Bill as quickly as the pa\nrliamentary calendar will allow, and\n I would hope that that would be borne in mind by this Committee too.\nChair: \nThank you very much.\nQ375 &#xa0; \nHywel Williams: Good afternoon. Both Gerry \nHoltham\n and the Silk Commission came out against the lockstep. The First Minister, giving evidence to us down in \nCardiff\n, said that it would be an immense straitjacket\n,\n and \nhe also \nwent as far as to say that it would make the power unusable. Indeed, that was the evidence given to us by other witnesses, both people from the world of business and from political studies. Do you accept that the Welsh Government would be unlikely to call a referendum because of their perceived difficulties in using this power?\nMr Jones: \nI have to say, Mr Chairman, that that really will be a matter for the Welsh Government\n,\n because, as you know, we propose to devolve the competence to the Welsh Government to call a referendum at such time as \nthey consider\n appropriate. But I disagree entirely with the suggestion that the powers proposed are unusable. I think that the powers proposed are extremely desirable. Frankly, too much focus has been placed on the\n issue of variation—of varying the rates.\nThe important thing about the proposed devolution of income tax powers is, first, that it renders the Welsh Government far more accountable to the people of \nWales\n. It would provide that almost half of the income tax raised in \nWales\n would be spent, if you like, by the Welsh Government. I think it is very important to introduce that level of accountability into the process. Importantly\n,\n too, it would act as a strong incentive to the Welsh Government to grow the Welsh economy\n,\n because, clearly, the more the economy improves\n,\n the more likely it \nis that the tax take from the devolved eleme\nnt of income tax would increase—\nand that is desirable as well. Thirdly\n—\nand I think possibly, in the eyes of some, most importantly\n—\nit would provide a significantly enhanced income stream against which the Welsh Government could borrow. So\n, while on the face of the Bill\n we have £500 million\n&#x2011;\nworth\n of borrowing powers, which is actually more than the Welsh Government should have strictly if we have regard only to the devolved small taxes, \nit\n could increase to around £1 billion once the income stream from the income tax is there. But, to complete my answer, I \nactually \nbelieve that \nWales\n should be ambitious\n,\n and \nI believe \nthat it could give a strong competitive advantage to \nWales\n if they were to go for a modest reduction in the level of tax that they levy on the people of \nWales\n.\nMr Gauke: \nCan I just add\n,\n with regard to the lockstep\n,\n that it is worth pointing out that our view, as a Government\n—\nand this applies across the United Kingdom\n—is \nthat, in terms of the differentiation between rates, we do believe that that is something that should be determined on a UK basis in Westminster elections\n?\n I think, in a way, putting aside for the moment the merits or otherwise of the shadow Chancellor\n’\ns announcement at the weekend, none the less tha\nt does demonstrate the degree in\n which the gaps between rates is a very important issue that should apply across the \nUnited Kingdom\n. That, as I say, is the approach that we have taken in \nScotland\n,\n and we believe that the same case applies with \nWales\n. \nThere is also an issue, looking at this, in terms of not causing any detriment to the public finances collectively in the \nUnited Kingdom\n. One possible result of allowing a different rate to be set for the additional rate is that \nWales\n, for example, might decide that the rates set in \nWestminster\n are too high. They may be right in making that judgment, potentially, and in those circumstances we see a degree of tax competition, trying to get people to move from, say, \nEngland\n to \nWales\n. That throws up a number of issues, but one consequence of that is likely to be a detriment to the overall public finances in the \nUK\n. So we are nervous about that. \nQ376 &#xa0; \nHywel Williams: \nI would like to question you about that particular issue next, but can I go back to the question I asked you, Secretary of State? I think most people would accept the points that you make about accountability, about growing the Welsh economy, and, of course, the point about the income stream, but the question I asked you was specifically, I suppose, aimed at the variation issue. I am in danger of repeating myself, but all the evidence we have had points to the lockstep making variation in rates across all the rates essentially unusable. Would you concede th\nat—\non that narrow point?\nMr Jones: No, I don’\nt think it does. \nI think i\nt is quite possible for the Wels\nh Government to be brave and \ndecide to go for a modest reduction in the rate of income tax. That would be thoroughly good for the Welsh economy. It would give \nWales\n that little competitive advantage and I think that that is what they should do.\nQ377 &#xa0; \nHywel Williams: \nCould you, for the purposes of the record, tell the Committee how much, say, a reduction of 1p across income tax in \nWales\n would cost or generate?\nMr Jones: \nIt depends which way you look at it. It would probably equate to a reduction in the block grant of £185 million and £200 million. That, of course, is not the net figure because clearly there would be more money in the economy. My suggestion is that a reduction in the rate of tax would stimulate the economy further. But I think I have to get back to the fundamental point: that does not render the tax unusable. The tax is extremely usable to the extent that it amounts to an incentive to the Welsh Government to grow the economy\n,\n and\n, \nof course,\n it gives that additional borrowing stream, which is enjoyed in \nScotland\n, which does have the lockstep.\nQ378 &#xa0; \nHywel Williams: \nIs it your perception that\n—\nperhaps this is a rather political question\n—\nthe Welsh Government, as presently constituted, \nare\n sufficiently courageous to take this step?\nMr Jones: \nJane Hutt described the proposals on the day of their announcement as, and I quote, \n“\na good deal for \nWales\n,\n”\n and I can only assume that she is enthusiastic about the proposal.\nQ379 &#xa0; \nHywel Williams: \nCan I therefore ask you about another position down in the Assembly\n?\n Your colleague Mr Andrew R.T. Davies was giving evidence this morning \nand he\n, to say the least, does not share your enthusiasm for the lockstep. I wondered\n—\nagain, Chair, forgive me for being perhaps overtly political\n—\nwho speaks for the Conservative Party in \nWales\n. Is it you\n or him?\nMr Jones: \nI think that the view that Mr Davies is enunciating is very much a personal view\n of his own\n. It certainly does not represent the policy of the Welsh Ass\nembly Group, nor, certainly, does it \nrepresent the policy of HM Government.\nQ380 &#xa0; \nStephen Doughty: \nTo follow on from that, I find that rather strange, Secretary of State, given that he is the leader of the Conservative Group in the Assembly and the leader of the opposition. \nI\nf you could dig into it a little bit more, what are the differences between you and \nhim,\n and why have you come to those different positions? To the Minister from the Treasury, what assessment \nperhaps \nhas the Treasury made of the differing positions of the Secretary of State and\n,\n indeed\n,\n of the le\nader of the Welsh Conservatives, because I think i\nt is important to know and understand\n, obviously,\n what the implications of those t\nwo different policies would be?\nMr Jones: \nI find it hard to see that there are any implications at all. The Government\n’\ns position has been set out clearly in the draft Bill. That is what we propose. Mr Davies has enunciated a personal opinion this morning.\nMr Gauke: \nI am not sure I have anything much more to add to that. The\n position of the Government, \nthe Secretary of State for \nWales\n and the position of the Treasury is one and the same. \nQ381 &#xa0; \nStephen Doughty: \nHas the Treasury made any assessment of the statements by the leader of the Welsh Conservatives?\nMr Gauke: \nThe Treasury makes an assessment of what we think is the right policy to pursue\n,\n and we believe this is the right policy to pursue.\nQ382 &#xa0; \nChair: \nMr \nGauke\n, on this matter you made it quite clear in your earlier answer that you believed that progressivity is something that should be decided by the UK Government at a \nUK\n level. That is absolutely something you firmly believe.\nMr Gauke: \nYes. That is the approach we have taken in \nScotland\n as well.\nQ383 &#xa0; \nChair: \nSo\n,\n if \nScotland\n does not vote for independence, the \ndevo\n max procedures that are being touted as an alternative will not include the end of the lockstep or freedom for \nScotland\n to vary income tax outside of a lockstep mechanism. Am I correct?\nMr Gauke: \nOur position is that we believe that progressivity, the differentiation between rates, should be at a \nUK\n level. I am not going to get into\n—\n \nChair: \nNo, but if that is your position\n—\n \nMr Gauke: —\nareas of speculation. That is the position that we hold and have held consistently. \nQ384 &#xa0; \nChair: \nIncidentally, I fully agree with you personally, but that is neither here nor there for the moment. If that is the UK Government\n’\ns position, obviously we can assume that the UK Government will not suddenly change \ntheir\n mind and allow \nScotland\n to have greater freedom over income tax levels if, after a referendum, the Scots decide to vote against full independence. We can make that assumption, can we not?\nMr Gauke: \nI am not in a position to bind what future Governments may do or over a long period of time.\nQ385 &#xa0; \nChair: \nIt would be this Government. \nMr Gauke: \nIn terms of the position of this Govern\nment, our view is that it remains the case \nthat progressivity is a matter for the UK Government.\nChair: \nThank you.\n Mark Williams?\nMr Mark Williams: The Chair\n has just pinched the question.\nChair: \nIf I have, I apologise. \nQ386 &#xa0; \nMr Mark Williams: Don’\nt worry\n—well, \nthe theme anyway. I was going to talk specifically about \nScotland\n and the line that we have heard so far about the need to have that consistency of income tax models between \nWales\n and \nScotland\n. It has been asserted by some, at least, that the real reason for the lockstep in the current political climate is that it would not be possible to give \nWales\n a more advanced form of tax devolution than \nScotland\n. How do you respond to those assertions, for instance, by Mr Gerry \nHoltham\n, who described the lockstep as a great flaw\n,\n with \nWales\n getting hand\n&#x2011;\nme\n&#x2011;\ndown policies that others have had? What is your analysis of those kinds of comments?\nMr Gauke: \nPerhaps I can say in response to this that I was the Treasury Minister involved in the Scotland Bill and the \nCalman\n process\n,\n and gave evidence to Select Committees of the Scottish Parliament on this matter. \nCalman\n recommended a lockstep arrangement. It was an issue that was not, if my memory serves me correctly, particularly controversial in \nScotland\n. There was an acceptance of that as a principle and it was not one of the more contentious elements to that Bill. As I say, we believe that there is a very strong case that progressivity should be a matter for the Westminster Parliament. I would perhaps highlight the amount of interest there has been in the last few days in the general debate in the UK because of the intervention by the shadow Chancellor, which rather underlines that this is an important UK issue. \nMr Jones: \nAll I would add is that I was very surprised by Mr \nHoltham\n’\ns\n comments about \n“\nrunts of the litter\n,”\n \n“\nhand\n&#x2011;\nme\n&#x2011;\ndown policies\n”\n and other colourful bits of language. The fact is that Wales is being treated exactly the same as Scotland in this respect\n,\n and it seems to me \nthat, far from treating Wales with a lack of respect, it is treating Wales with full respect and according Wales equal respect to that it accords to Scotland.\nQ387 &#xa0; \nMr Mark Williams: \nThank you. Quickly on the lockstep again, one of the messages from the three party leaders\n—\nthe Plaid \nCymru\n leader, the Conservative leader and the Lib Dem leader\n—\nwas that they s\naw the original Silk proposals—\nhe used the \nphrase, I think—\nas a \n“\npackage\n.”\n Those three party leaders did similarly this morning\n,\n and somehow the lockstep is deviating from that principle that actually drew all four parties in the National Assembly to the process in the first place. What are your thoughts on that?\nMr Jones: \nAll I can say is that we gave very careful scrutiny to what the Silk Commission proposed. We accepted almost all of the recommendations, as you know. The two respects in which we deviated from the recommendations were air passenger duty and the form of income tax devolution. It was not done lightly. It was done after careful consideration\n,\n and we believe, for the reasons that Mr \nGauke\n has set out, that it is the right way forward.\nQ388 &#xa0; \nHywel Williams: \nCan I ask you about progressivity as a principle, as it were? You did refer, Mr \nGauke\n, to uniformity across the \nUK\n and also \nto \nthe dangers or otherwise of tax competition. However, thinking in terms of progressivity, the jump from one rate to another, if the Welsh Government increased, say, all rates by 1p, the actual progressivity of the system is lessened, is it not, because of the ratios of 1p to 30p, 40p, 45p, or even 50p, w\nhatever we have as a top rate? So they would not have a\n uniform progressivity comparing \nWales\n perhaps \nwith\n \nEngland\n or \nScotland\n, whatever their arrangements. The emphasis that you put on the \nUK\n actually would not be observed in that way, would it?\nMr Gauke: \nI can see the point \nthat \nyou are making in terms of ratios, but at a practical level the idea that any change in thi\ns way—\nthat the ratio should be the ba\nsis rather than the percentage—\nwould result in a great deal of complexity\n,\n with rates running into several decimal points before you got very far. I do think that that is not workable. But I think that\n—\nQ389 &#xa0; \nHywel Williams: \nBut you can see the point, though.\nMr Gauke: \nI think in broad terms\n, with regard to\n the difference between 20 and 40 and 45, the significant point, particularly within the range that we are talking about here, is the difference of 20p and 5p\n—\n \nMr Jones: \nAnd, of course, in terms of pence it would remain exactly the same.\nHywel Williams: \nYes, of course. Thank you.\nQ390 &#xa0; \nGuto Bebb: \nMy first question is to the Exchequer Secretary. Obviously, with the devolution of some taxes as a result of this Bill being passed there will be a need to cut the Welsh block grant. Could you explain how that process will work initially and what subsequent changes would then occur on a year\n&#x2011;\nby\n&#x2011;\nyear\n basis to the formula used to reduce the block grant?\nMr Gauke: Yes, c\nertainly. In terms of funding, the issue will be first of all to make an assessment of the amount raised from the devolved element of income tax. It will then be based on an assessment of changes in the \nUK\n tax base, excluding dividends and savings, versus the Welsh tax base. So there is an indexation in terms of what happens to the Welsh element, if I can put it that way, versus the changes to the \nUK\n tax base on a non\n&#x2011;\nsavings\n/non\n&#x2011;\ndividend\n basis. The consequence of that means that changes in the Welsh \neconomy relative to the \nUK\n economy will result in changes in the revenue coming to the Welsh Government. That, as the Secretary of State was pointing out, puts in an incentive within the formula for the Welsh Government to grow the Welsh economy.\nQ391 &#xa0; \nGuto Bebb: \nTo clarify, if the Welsh \neconomy grows\n, the impact upon the block grant would be po\nsitive for the Welsh Government\n therefore?\nMr Gauke: Than w\nhere it remains\n—\n \nQ392 &#xa0; \nGuto Bebb: \nSo there is an incentive, in effect\n—\nMr Gauke: \nAbsolutely. \nQ393 &#xa0; \nGuto Bebb: —\nto use these powers for the benefit of the\n Welsh economy. That is fine. \nThe second point I would like to ask is in relation to the issue of the Barnett formula. We were taking evidence in Cardiff two weeks ago\n,\n and the First Minister made it very clear that he did not believe we should be approaching the issue of income tax devolution unless there was a review of the Barnett formula. Quite clearly, with the reduction in public spending over the past three or four years, the issues of the Barnett squeeze have gon\ne into some degree of reverse. \nIs there a likelihood of \na \nreassessment of the Barnett formula as it affects Wales prior to any potential referendum on income tax devolution?\nMr Gauke: \nThe point I would make on that, and the point that we have consistently made as a Government, is that our focus is on reducing the deficit. That is the key challenge. Any change to the Barnett formula has to await the stabilisation of the public finances. That remains the case. Obviously, the Barnett formula is a UK\n&#x2011;\nwide\n issue and we would need to evaluate that in its application across all parts of the \nUnited Kingdom\n.\nQ394 &#xa0; \nGuto Bebb: \nI accept the point about the stabilisation of the financial position of the UK as a whole, but\n,\n in terms of going for a referendum on income tax as it stands, is it not the case that\n,\n unless the Barnett formula is actually revised\n,\n there is a potential that the issue of the Barnett squeeze will come back into play once income tax has been devolved to the detriment of the Welsh public purse, as it were? Is it not the case, therefore, that it would be irresponsible to go for that devolution of income tax powers without at least the issue of a floor under the Barnett f\normula being taken into account?\nMr Gauke: I don’\nt think so. I am sure the Secretary of State has his views on this, but I \ndo \nthink that\n,\n because of the case which the\n Secretary of State has set out\n in terms of the advantages for Wales of proceeding with this devolution, it would be a pity to miss the opportunity to proceed with that at a time when, rightly, our focus is on the stabilisation of the public finances and then we will return to it. The idea that one should wait until all elements of uncertainty are eliminated before moving on this may result in waiting some time because there are always elements of uncertainty.\nMr Jones: \nCould I add to that too? In October 2012\n,\n HM Government and the Welsh Government made a joint statement outlining commitments on funding in Wales, including putting in place a mechanism to review convergence of relative funding levels in advance of each spending review, and in fact that was done prio\nr to the last spending review. \nThat\n,\n to a large extent\n,\n addresses the Barne\ntt squeeze point that you made—p\nlus, of course, convergence is not currently happening.\nQ395 &#xa0; \nChair: \nMr \nGauke\n, over the years we have heard compelling evidence on this Committee that \nWales\n receives less than its fair share of funding as a result of the 35 or 30\n&#x2011;\nyear\n&#x2011;\nold Barnett formula. I entirely agree with you about the need to stabilise public finances\n; \nI might even go further than you if I were in your position\n. B\nut surely the issue of the Barnett formula is absolutely nothing to do with it\n,\n because the Barnett formula is a formula used to determine how much a give\nn amount of money is divided up\n or\n,\n rather\n,\n to which parts of \nthe \ncountry it is sent. The overall figure that is used obviously has an effect on the stabilisation of public funds, but the way in which that amount is divvied up does not affect \nUK\n finances at all. It is a matter of a fair division of spoils for everyone. Is that not the case? \nMr Gauke: \nThe point I would make is that there is a very significant challenge for us as a country and as a Government in getting the public finances back under control.\nChair: \nAbsolutely.\nMr Gauke: \nWe have made considerable progress on that but there is still much more to do. In terms of dealing with public spending, departmental spending and spending in particular nations and regions within the \nUnited Kingdom\n, there is a very large task in front of us, which is to get public spending under control. Were we at the same time to be trying to re\n&#x2011;\nopen\n \na \nwell\n&#x2011;\nestablished formula, \nit\n would add complexity and additional challenge to what is already a difficult task.\nQ396 &#xa0; \nChair: \nI may not be asking the question in a very clear way. I am not asking about the amount. There are some that would like more to be allocated and some might argue less, but that is not my question. My question is about the way in which it is allocated\n—\nthe formula itself. We have heard compelling evidence that the formula is unfair to \nWales\n—\nthat it underfunds \nWales\n. Is it not possible for the Government to look into this and to look at the formula rather than the overall amount, which I agree would have an impact on the stability of the \nUK\n’\ns finances? I mean the formula itsel\nf. You say, S\nir, that it is well established, but my interpretation is that it was made up on the hoof about 35 years ago and nobody has done very much about it since. That seems to be the verdict of the man who actually produced it, although I paraphrase him slightly.\nMr Gauke: \nYes. I am not sur\ne he ever quite used the phrase\n \n“\nmade up on the hoof.\n”\nChair: \nNo, he did not put it quite like that\n; I agree\n.\nMr Gauke: \nBut I appreciate where you are coming from. It is not possible to just remove the formula from the whole issue of the debate. The reality is that all nations and regions of the \nUnited Kingdom\n are having to make a contribution towards deficit reduction. It is particularly challenging to look also at a formula where\n,\n inevitably\n,\n there will be winners and losers\n,\n and put that into the context of significant deficit reduction.\nQ397 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThis is my last go at this because I also take that point. Where formulas such as this have been changed previously and there have been winners and losers, what are called floors and ceilings are put in place. I think it happened with the police funding formula a few years ago in \nWales\n. So it would still be quite possible to change the formula but to do so in a way that re\nduced the impact for the losers\n or\n,\n rather\n,\n brought in the changes over a period of years so tha\nt people were not affected over\nnight, would it not? \nMr Gauke: \nYes, it would be, although that of course has consequences in terms of reducing the benefit for the winners as well as softening any loss for the losers.\nChair: \nOf course.\nMr Gauke: \nBut, as I say, the position of the Government\n—\nwe have been very consistent on this and I am sure, Mr Davies, you have heard others make this point before\n—\nis that we do believe that our focus has to be on stabilisation of the public finances before \nwe re\n&#x2011;\nopen the Barnett formula.\nChair: \nI must not take up any more time.\nQ398 &#xa0; \nHywel Williams: \nC\nan I ask you bluntly whether\n your reluctance to re\n&#x2011;\nopen\n the Barnett question \nhas \nanything at all to do with the question of the money that goes to \nScotland\n,\n because changing the proportion that goes to \nWales\n might have some implications pre\n&#x2011;\nreferendum\n for our Scottish colleagues?\nMr Gauke: \nThe position has been very straightforward and very clear throughout this coalition Government that we were not going to look at the Barnett formula until the public finances were sorted. The focus is on the public finances. They need to be stabilised\n,\n and\n being \nin a position where public finances are strong\n \nis a much better time to look at a funding formula of this sort than at a time where it is already the case that, as I say, every nation and region in the \nUK\n is having to make a contribution towards deficit reduction.\nQ399 &#xa0; \nHywel Williams: \nI thought the agreement between the Welsh Government and the Government here was that the Barnett formula would be reviewed at every future spending review. Is that the case?\nMr Jones: \nNo. It is the operation of the Barnett formula, which is a slightly different matter.\nQ400 &#xa0; \nMrs James: \nThis question is for the Secretary of State. We have heard evidence that the partial devolution of income tax to t\nhe Welsh Government is not of “\nsufficient constitutional importance to warrant a referendum.\n”\n How do you respond?\nMr Jones: \nI think it is a serious constitutional issue. The Scottish people, of course, had the opportunity to vote on income tax devolution\n,\n and I think, frankly, the people of \nWales\n would be affronted if they felt that income tax devolution was being imposed upon them without having their say. Of course, in \nWales\n, a large number of people live and work very close to the border with \nEngland\n. A lot of people cross the border daily backwards and forwards to work. The issu\ne of income tax devolution will\n be a very significant issue \nparticularly \nfor that particular category of people. I think it shows proper respect to the people of \nWales\n,\n and, of course, it was specifically recommended by the Silk Commission.\nQ401 &#xa0; \nMrs James: \nThe Electoral Commission told us that a referendum should only be held when there is a clear campaign on both sides. Are you concerned at all that there may not be clear leadership from both sides of the campaign?\nMr Jones: \nI think \nthat \nit is necessary for people to be fully informed about the pros and cons of the proposal. Therefore, I would agree entirely with the Electoral Reform Society that we do need to see a properly organised campaign, both yes and no, and this is a matter that we will be taking a very close interest in.\nQ402 &#xa0; \nMrs James: \nAre you confident in that\n,\n because in part of that evidence the issue comes up time and time again of the good, clear information that go\nes\n out and somebody has to pick up the cost for that?\nMr Jones: \nYes, and of course there was an unfortunate experience, as you know, in the last referendum we had in \nWales\n in 2011 when there was no \n“\nno\n”\n campaign, which of course had an immediate impact upon the \n“\nyes\n”\n campaign. I think lessons have been learned from that and we are quite clear that there should be properly organised campaigns on both sides.\nQ403 &#xa0; \nMrs James: \nAgain, \nwhat do you think turn\nout would be for a referendum? Professor Scully thinks\n that it could be as low as 25%.\nMr Jones: \nIf you are talking about tax devolution, \nit\n might be a fairly strong incentive to people to turn out and vote.\nMrs James: \nThank you. \nQ404 &#xa0; \nNia Griffith: \nSecretary of State and Minister, I would like to turn to the issue of borrowing now. Could you give us a little bit more detail as to how you came to the conclusions that you did in terms of the amount of borrowing that is to be allowed in the first stage, pre\n&#x2011;\nincome\n tax devolution, and how do you respond to the comments from the First Minister about wanting to see £1 billion as the limit for borrowing rather than what you have been suggesting, which is half of that?\nMr Gauke: \nIf you like, there are two stages there. First of all, it is worth looking at the amount of tax that\n \nis devolved and applying the same ratio that applies in \nScotland\n where, of course, an element of income tax is devolved. That would give us a number in the region\n of round about £100 million. \nBut we are very keen to proceed with the M4 improvements. That is the reason why we have a higher number, which is the £500 million. In terms of it going up and getting to the £1 billion mark, again\n,\n we do have to look at the relationship with the control over taxes which the Welsh Government would have, and in the circumstances where there is devolution of income tax, as is proposed, then, yes, the number would be around the £1 billion mark.\nQ405 &#xa0; \nNia Griffith: \nSo you would tie that number to the devolution of income tax.\nMr Gauke: \nExactly, yes, precisely. \nQ406 &#xa0; \nNia Griffith: \nHow would you respond to comments by Jo\ncelyn Davies AM, who chairs the Finance C\nommittee in the Assembly\n,\n that there should not actually be a figure on the face of the Bill but it should be something that is negotiated between the Welsh Government and the UK Government?\nMr Gauke: \nIt doe\ns provide a degree of certainty—\na degree of reassurance, as I say. If we were just doing it purely on the ratio with the tax powers, the number would be significantly l\nower and one could look at the £\n500 million \nnumber \nas being generous, in these circumstances, and the reason is our support of the work on \nthe \nM4. As to whether or not it is in the Bill, it provides a degree of certainty and reassurance\n. P\narticularly given that the sum is significantly more than would be the case if we simply applied the ratio, it seemed to me to be something that should be welcomed and supported.\nMr Jones: \nI think it is fair to say, for the information of the Committee, that that figure would be likely to be £100 million. So \nI think it is very unlikely\n that, having regard to that, a negotiated process would be preferable to having the certainty of the \nhalf a billion\n \npound figure \non the face of the Bill.\nQ407 &#xa0; \nNia Griffith: \nThat is very useful. I move on now to the issue of bonds. Obviously, in the Scotland Act there is \nthe\n provision that \nScotland\n could, without further legislation, issue its own bonds\n,\n and we do have examples of housing associations doing likewise. Why is that not something which \nis\n be\ni\nn\ng\n considered for the Welsh Government?\nMr Gauke: \nThe reality is that the cheapest way of borrowing is through the NLF\n—\nthe National Loans Fund. That was recognised by the Silk Commission. That, alongside commercial lending, which provides a degree of flexibility, we believe\n,\n provides the Welsh Government with the most suitable sources for borrowing.\nQ408 &#xa0; \nNia Griffith: But i\nf the Welsh Government could\n obviously \nhave the option to make \ntheir\n own mind up as to whether to issue them \nthemselves\n or whether to work through the Treasury, could there not be some provision in the Bill to allow for that?\nMr Gauke: \nAs I say, partly this is an issue where we have to look at the overall position of the public finances\n, and, p\narticularly in the circumstances that we are in with the public finances\n,\n a degree of caution is always appropriate\n when it comes to these matters. B\nut we do believe that, as a matter of practicality, the best ways open for the Welsh Government to borrow are through the National Loans Fund\n,\n with some flexibility as a consequence of commercial borrowing. In truth, \nas to \nthe bonds that are issued by, for example, local authorities, it very rarely happens other than if you\n are looking at—I think in recent years—\nBirmingham\n and Transport for London. The reason for that is \nthat there are better ways of doing it.\nQ409 &#xa0; \nChair: \nIf I could put you on the spot there, is it not the case\n—\nand\n,\n if it is, by the way, I agree with you\n—\nthat the reason you wish to do that is that the Treasury will maintain some control over how much the Welsh Assembly could borrow, because obviously the Welsh Assembly could issue its own bonds? There would be nothing to stop it from doing so left\n,\n right and centre. It would presumably have to pay higher interest rates, depending on what the international markets thought of the Assembly\n’s credit\nworthiness, but ultimately the UK Government would become responsible for any debts that the Assembly might decide to run up. The route which you are taking allows yo\nu to have control over that. Some may disagree, but \nI actually think you are doing the right thing if that is what your motive is.\nMr Gauke: \nIt is worth pointing out the overall limit, say\n,\n the £500 million limit\n,\n still applies\n.\nQ410 &#xa0; \nChair: \nYes, but it would not if they were issuing bonds, would it?\nMr Gauke: No, i\nt would still apply with bonds. As I say, the approach that the Treasury tends to take, and this is an historic approach, is a certain reluctance to give that power out. But the reality, on a practical level, \nis that \nthat is not the cheapest way in which the Welsh Government would be able to borrow.\nMr Jones: \nI think that was recogn\nised by Silk \ntoo, Chairman.\nQ411 &#xa0; \nChair: \nFraming the question slightly differently, it does \nallow\n you to refuse to \nallow \nthe Assembly \nto \nborrow money if you felt that it had not made a good business case for whatever project it \nwanted\n to b\norrow money on.\nMr Gauke: The Welsh Government have\n the ability to borrow up to the limit, which is, as I say, £500 million\n, and were income tax to be devolved\n that number would go up.\nQ412 &#xa0; \nChair: \nLet me have one last try and then I will go back. Why not let them issue bonds? After all, if it is going to be cheaper to do it via the UK Government, there is no particular reason why they would go elsewhere anyway, is there, so why not just give them the power to do so?\nMr Gauke: \nIf your argument is that we should give the Welsh Government power which is in reality not likely to be used\n—  \nChair: \nThat is what we are doing.\nMr Gauke: —\nthat may be what you want, but I am not sure that necessarily adds anything to the capability of the Welsh Government to deliver for the Welsh people.\nChair: Well, \nI have tried. Thank you.\nQ413 &#xa0; \nJessica Morden: \nMoving on to the electoral issues, can I ask the Secretary of State what advantages you see to the ban on dual candidacy?\nMr Jones: \nThe advantage I see is restoring the position to what it was prior to the Government of Wales Act 2006\n,\n when this proposal was universally condemned. In fact, Mr Chairman, looking around this Co\nmmittee today, it is very much déjà \nvu because a lot of the \nm\nembers on this Committee sitting here today, myself included, actually carried out pre\n&#x2011;\nlegislative\n scrutiny of the Government of Wales Bill.\nQ414 &#xa0; \nJessica Morden: \nBut why do you th\nink it is the right thing to do?\nMr Jones: \nWhat I would like to do, if I may, is quote Professor Scully, who I think has given evidence to this Committee on this particular occasion. I was reminded of what he said when he appear\ned before this Committee on 18\n October 2005. Someone had referred\n—\nyou might remember, Mr Chairman\n—to the proposal as the “Mugabe\n&#x2011;\nisation\n of Welsh politics.\n”\n That may strike a chord, Mr Chairman, with you. \nW\nhen I asked him about this, \nDr Scully \nfirst of all disapproved of that label because he said it was intemperate, but he went on to say\n—\nand I think it is worth quoting\n— “G\niven that the reasons offered in the White Paper for doing this do not stack up, frankly, \nare \nnot supported by the evidence, given also that La\nbour currently do not have any m\nembers coming through the list so if it is going to create problems for any parties it is going to create problems for the other parties, it is difficult to rule out the hypothesis of partisan motivation. I have no particular \nprivate evidence on that matter\n but, as we say, even if thi\ns is not intended\n it is unfortunate because it is going to look deeply partisan.\n” He went on to say:\n \n“\nIt appears to be trying to adjust the electoral system in favour of one party against the interests of the other parties\n,\n and it is not being done on an inter\n-\npartisan\n,\n cross\n&#x2011;\nparty\n basis.\n”\n \nChair: \nCan we hear from Jessica Morden again?\nMr Jones: \nI agree entirely with everything that Professor Scully said.\nQ415 &#xa0; \nJessica Morden: \nAre you not just adjusting it back, though? Are we just ending up in a farcical situation where whoever is in just changes it back and forth?\nMr Jones: \nNo. It should never have been introduced in the first place. It was a nakedly political measure intend\ned to favour the Labour party. \nEvery other party thought that it was thoroughly reprehensible and I am very proud of the fact \nthat \nwe are overturning the\n—\nQ416 &#xa0; \nJessica Morden: \nWhat are the positive advantages, though, of letting people stand on both lists for the election? \nMr Jones: \nBecause they can s\ntand in two electoral processes.\n \nIn fact,\n under t\nhis particular electoral system,\n the ban on dual candidacy is unique to \nWales\n,\n and were we \nengaging in a debate\n I would be asking you to justify its continued existence.\nQ417 &#xa0; \nJessica Morden: \nIf you have, \nlet us \nsay, \nin an Assembly election local issues coming\n in \nin\n a particular constituency and on a particular local issue\n—\nclosing something or another\n—\nthe electorate vote tactically against a particular candidate and then that candidate gets in on the list and is able to call themselves the AM for a local area. Are you happy with that situation?\nMr Jones: \nThat was the situation that was entirely envisaged until the Labour party decided that it was unpalatable to them politically\n,\n and I think it is right to revert to the position as it\n—\n \nQ418 &#xa0; \nJessica Morden: \nWould you be happy with that position then\n—\nyes?\nMr Jones: \nI am entirely happy. That is why I am proposing to put it in the Bill.\nJessica Morden: \nI\n was going to move on to double-\njobbing then.\nChair: \nNia\n wants to come in quickly on that point first.\nQ419 &#xa0; \nNia Griffith: C\nould\n you\n just clarify a cou\nple of things on dual candidacy?\n First,\n as you well know\n, Secretary of S\ntate, in the impact assessment the \nresponse from the public was not for reversing the ban\n.\n \nIn his \nevidence\n,\n Professor Scully makes a distinction bet\nween what he calls MMM and MMP—\nin other words the MMP, which is the proportional idea that we have in Wales where, if you like, the list people are in reverse proportion to what w\nas elected in the constituency, \nover eight or nine constituencies or however many are in each block. \nIt\n is a very unusual system, so most of his examples come from MMM where you have a parallel voting for your regional and \nvoting \nfor your own area, which we do not have. We have a proportional thing\n,\n which automatically calculates that. \nM\nost of the examples are not all that comparable\n. S\no the problem we have in our particular system is that, as my colleague has just said, you end up with a situation where people think they have not voted for somebody and they actually get them all the same, as you well know in your own seat, where not only did the Labour candidate get in for the constituency but all three of the opposing parties als\no all got in at the same time. I\nn other words, you might as well not have bothered to go out to vote.\nMr Jones: \nThat was a perfectly foreseeable state of affairs from the outset. That was something that was inherent in the system that was put in place in the original Government of Wales Act\n,\n and, frankly, the ban, just to reiterate, on dual candidacy is unique to \nWales\n under this particular system\n.\n \nI\nf you have regard to the other system that you mentioned\n, it is still pretty rare.\n I think \nthey\n have it in the \nUkraine\n, \nSouth Korea\n and one or two other places. I \nthink that it was a straightforward, nakedly partisan introduction by the Labour party and I am very proud of the fact \nthat \nwe are overturning it.\nChair: We had better move on to double-\njobbing\n where I should declare an interest myself\n.\nQ420 &#xa0; \nJessica Morden: \nLess controversially\n then, double-\njobbing. Can you exp\nlain why you want to ban double-\njobbing?\nMr Jones: \nIt is quite clear that the job of an Assembly Member is a significant one and has become more significant as a consequence of the devolution of primary powers after the 2011 referendum. We take the view that Assembly Members should concentrate on being Assembly Members\n,\n and Members of Parliament should concentrate on being Members of Parliament. \nI\nt is a bit disrespectful to Assembly Members to suggest that they have the sort of job that they can fit in on a part\n&#x2011;\ntime basis\n—\nto sort of do a foreigner.\n I don’t think that is acceptable.\nQ421 &#xa0; \nJessica Morden: \nCorrect me if\n I am wrong, but did you double-\njob at one stage?\nMr Jones: \nNo.\n&#xa0;\nQ422 &#xa0; \nJessica Morden: \nThen why does that not apply \nto\n being a councillor\n,\n a Lord or an MEP? Why should it apply just between AMs and MPs\n?\nMr Jones: \nIt is generally recognised that the duties of a Member of Parliament and \nthe duties of \nan Assembly Member are fairly onerous. \nI\nt is possible to fit in the work of a council\nlor—which is still significant,\n but nevertheless not \nas\n onerous as either of the two functions\n—\nwith the work of being an MP and an Assembly Member. It is important to distinguish between the level of commitment that we are expecting. I hear constantly that Assembly Members feel that they should be doing more work\n. I\nn fact there was a suggestion this week that they should be doing more work. I think, therefore, it is \nreally \nimpossible to fulfil two important functions satisfactorily.\nQ423 &#xa0; \nJessica Morden: \nWhat about being an MEP?\nMr Jones: Well, t\nhat is a matter for \nEurope\n. They have already introduced a ban on Members of Parliament also sitting as MEPs\n,\n and we feel that if any prohibition should be introduced it should be from Europe rather than Parliament. \nQ424 &#xa0; \nGlyn Davies: \nI want to ask you a question on this one, Secretary of State. I must admit that I am not wholly convinced about this. I agree with every point you make about the desirability of not having people sit as Assembly Members and as MPs. I think that is right\n. I actually think\n it is a fair point to be made about other jobs as well, including substantial private sector jobs and being an MP \nand being\n an AM. But why do we have to pass a law? The electorate has the power to deal with it. Every political party can ban it within their own systems. Generally speaking, I am suspicious of passing a law to ban something that nobody actually wants.\nMr Jones: \nIt is not exactly unprecedented. Of course it is happening in \nNorthern Ireland\n, as you know, too. \nG\nenera\nlly, the Government have\n made an assessment that\n,\n \nif \npeople want to \nbecome Members of Parliament\n,\n \nthey \nshould be full\n&#x2011;\ntime Members of Parliament. Similarly, if they want to become Assembly Members, they should be doing \nthat on a full\n&#x2011;\ntime basis too. S\no I take your point, but we will have to agree to differ.\nQ425 &#xa0; \nChair: \nBut, Mr Jones, as a Secretary of State\n,\n you must have very many onerous duties in addition to your role as \na \nconstituency MP. Surely\n,\n your position as Secretary of State for \nWales\n has not affected your abil\nity to serve your constituents.\nMr Jones: \nIt \nha\ns not, Mr Chairman, but I work seven days a week.\nQ426 &#xa0; \nChair: \nBut surely you can see that it would be possible to hold a position as an Assembly Member or an MP\n,\n and to also hold down another difficult and time\n&#x2011;\nconsuming position\n at the same time\n, as I did myself.\nMr Jones: I was going to say\n that you probably are now speaking from experience\n,\n and I am disappointed to hear that Ms Morden is confusing you and me.\nQ427 &#xa0; \nChair: I h\nave n\never had the privilege of the \nred box, but I would have said that probably you have an even more onerous time of it than I did because all of my constituency casework was exactly the same\n,\n taking up no extra time. My problem was managing to do work in Parliament and\n the Assembly—\nthe political\n or\n legislative side of it. But I found that it was possible to do it, albeit challenging at times, for a short\n period of time. I must say I agree with \nGlyn\n.\n \nI don’t\n \nreally \nsee why we are makin\ng a law on this and why we can’\nt simply allow the voters to decide.\nMr Jones: O\nne has to bear in mind too that\n,\n since you were an Assembly Member, of course, primary powers have \nnow been devolved. Again,\n \nI think \nwe are goi\nng to have to agree to disagree. T\nhe view of \nthe \nGovernment is very clearly that the focus of elected Members should be either in the Assembly or in Parliament, depending on where they are elected. \nQ428 &#xa0; \nNia Griffith: \nI have one small technical point on the time scale. \nW\ne know that there are some current AMs who are going to put their names forward as candidates for the general election in 2015. \nI\nf they are list candidates, then there will probably be someone else on the list who can take their place straight away without a by\n&#x2011;\nelection, but if they were constituency Assembly Members and they became Members of Parliament in 2015\n—\nand there is a six\n&#x2011;\nmonth limit by which t\nime an election has to be held—\nthen obviously an election would be being held just six months before the actual Assembly elections. So is there a case for maybe revisiting that time limit in the Bill and considering whether a year might be more practical?\nMr Jones: \nI would be very interested to hear the views of the Committee\n,\n but the view that we took when considering the Bill was that six months was about right. But\n,\n clearly\n,\n it is not an exact science. \nI\nf the Committee wishes to feed in its views, I will be very interested in seeing what those are.\nChair: \nWhich in your first answer you kindly said you would be taking great note of, so we will definitely feed that in. Could I ask \nSiân\n James if she has some questions\n?\nQ429 &#xa0; \nMrs James: \nI have a quick couple of questions about changing the term and the length of the Assembly. Why do you think it is important that the Welsh Assembly elections do not coincide with the \nUK\n general elections?\nMr Jones: \nI think it is generally accepted that there would be a strong possibility\n—\nif not a probability\n—\nthat\n, if you like,\n Assembly issues would be overshadowed by national issues. I think it is proper that, at an Assembly election, the focus should be given to those issues for which the Assembly is responsible. What we are seeking to do, as you know, is to ensure, so far as possible, that general elections and Assembly elections do not coincide.\n&#xa0;\nQ430 &#xa0; \nMrs James: \nWe have a possibility of a clash in 2021 with the local government elections. You are always in some part of the cycle going to have a clash with something. So that could apply to other elections as well.\nMr Jones: \nThat is true. On the other hand, of course, you have two bodies with primary powers\n.\n I believe it is essential that the elections to those two bodies should not become confused and that the important issues to be considered in an election for the Assembly should not be drowned out by the debate about general election issues.\nQ431 &#xa0; \nMrs James: \nAgain, we have had evidence th\nat the Welsh Government believe\n that the changes to the Welsh electoral arrangements should be a matter for them and for the Assembly rather than \nWestminster\n. Would you prefer to maintain the status quo?\nMr Jones: \nCertainly for the purpose of this Bill we do not intend to make any changes. The Silk Commission, of course, has yet to produce part 2 of its work. It remains to be seen what they recommend in that regard.\nQ432 &#xa0; \nGuto Bebb: I have\n a question on the issue of the capacity of the Welsh Assembly to deal with the proposed new powers \nthat\n are to be devolved. We have heard a lot of evidence claiming that the proposals in question will put a strain on the current number of AMs, which is 60. Do you in any way share those views\n,\n or is it your view that the devolution of further power should result in a change in the working practices of the Welsh Assembly? \nMr Jones: \nThat\n,\n of course\n,\n has attracted interest only this week\n,\n and it seems to me that a significant number of Assembly Members do believe that their own working practices should be reviewed. But I was heartened by\n,\n I think\n,\n the First Minister\n’\ns comments\n,\n who said that he was quite satisfied that the Assembly, in its current form, could deal quite happily with the fiscal powers\n \nas proposed\n \nthat will be devolved to it.\nQ433 &#xa0; \nGuto Bebb: \nTherefore, in your view, 60 Members should be sufficient even if there are further powers given.\nMr Jones: \nYes, otherwise we would not be recommending the devolution of powers to the Assembly.\nQ434 &#xa0; \nGuto Bebb: O\nn the issue of whether the decision as to whether there could be more Members or not could be taken in the future, should that be an issue for Westminster\n,\n or could it be an issue for the Welsh Assembly itself?\nMr Jones: \nThat is not something within the contemplation of this Bill\n,\n and, interestingly, it is not something which is within the remit of the Commission itself because that is something that has been excluded. \nA\ngain, to reiterate, \nI \ntake heart from what the First Minister says. I \nbelieve there is plenty of capacity in the Assembly to deal adequately with the \npowers that are to be devolved—\nor we hope will be devolved.\nQ435 &#xa0; \nGuto Bebb: \nWe certainly have some evidence to support that viewpoint, which I am quite sympathetic with. \nThe other issue I would like to highlight is the issue of the Silk recommendations in terms of legislative control of budgetary issues. Currently\n,\n there is no proposal within the Bill as it stands to devolve those legislative competencies and controls over the budgetary issues. Is there a specific reason why there is a view that we are going to devolve income tax powers perhaps, subject to a referendum, but no devolution of the issues in terms of legislative control of the budgetary process?\nMr Jones: \nI believe it is something that we are giving further consideration to, but\n,\n again\n,\n I think it is a matter that we would welcome the Committee\n’\ns views on.\nQ436 &#xa0; \nGuto Bebb: \nFrom a purely practical viewpoint, the Government would be open to practical suggestions in relation to that issue.\nMr Jones: \nYes. It is a matter \nto which\n we are giving consideration and I think that any recommendations that this Committee were to make would be paid close attention.\nMr Gauke: \nIndeed\n,\n \nand \nI think the response to the Silk Commission very much confirmed what the Secretary of State has just said.\nChair: \nWe are coming to a close, bu\nt I am quickly looking \nround to see if anyone has any final questions for the Ministers while they are in front of us. Nobody seems to be catching my eye.\nQ437 &#xa0; \nNia Griffith: \nI have one question about time scale. When does the Secretary of State think that he will be bringing forward the actual Bill itself?\nMr Jones: \nClearly, a lot depends upon the work of this Committee\n,\n and that was why I was at pains at the outset to thank this Committee for the hard work it is putting in\n,\n and particularly the speed with which it is proceeding. We hope to publish the Bill as soon as \nparliamentary time allows, and I think\n \nw\ne have made that clear repeatedly. \nW\ne look forward to your report, which will be an important stage of the process.\nQ438 &#xa0; \nNia Griffith: Are we saying it would be through i\nts p\narliamentary stages by the next election?\nMr Jones: \nI sincerely hope so. As I say, we have made a commitment\n to proceed with it as soon as p\narliamentary time allows\n,\n and I do not think I can give a clear\ner\n indication of our intention to proceed with it than saying that.\nChair: \nWe are grateful to you, Secretary of State. I think the Committee will not mind my saying that probably we would have welcomed it if we could have had a look at the draft Bill earlier given the amount of meetings that we have had to have this month. I am about to call this session to a close, but we are going to meet afterwards in private and start to discuss our findings\n,\n fo\nr those who are still available. B\nut thank you very much indeed for coming along this afternoon to both Ministers. T\nhank you very much.\n&#xa0;\n              \nOral evidence: \nPre-legislative scrutiny of the Draft Wales Bill\n, HC \n962\n              \n              \n2\n"
