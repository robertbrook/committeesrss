"&#xa0;\nBNI0002&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by theNorthern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association (NIIRTA)&#xa0;&#xa0;The Northern Ireland Indep\nendent Retail Trade Association\n welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to this timely enquiry into Banking in Northern Ireland.\n&#xa0;\nNIIRTA r\nepresents over 1400 Independent Retailers, Wholesalers; Suppliers to the sector and many local town based Chambers of Commerce and Traders\n’\n Group\ns. We have members in every village, town and city in Northern Ireland.\n&#xa0;\nAs part of our submission we have conducted the first ever survey of independent retailers\n’\n views on Banking issues and how it impacts on their business\nes\n. 100 independent retailers f\nrom across Northern Ir\neland (representing 14% of our members responded to a\n telephone survey conducted in August.\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;In our approach to this submission we wanted to avoid a finger pointing exercise or a blame game and instead\n look to the future\n and learn\n from the past.\n In the course of preparing this submission we have met the four main banks in Northern Ireland, Ulster Bank, Danske\n Bank\n, First Trust and Bank of Ireland.\n&#xa0;\nWe want a new\n,\n more \nflexible\n and open banking \nsystem, which\n can support an\nd finance a \nnew \nsmall business led sustainable recovery. \n&#xa0;\nSurvey Results&#xa0;\nThe survey focused on NIIRTA members’ ability to access finance, credit card and overdraft services, the bank branch closure programme and overall customer satisfaction with their \nbanks.\n&#xa0;\nThis is the first ever survey of the views on banking services from independent retailers across Northern Ireland and shows that a majority of those surveyed are satisfied with the services they receive from local banks\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n65% of those who have applied for finance within the last three years were successful in accessing it, which suggests an improving trend given the\n difficult trading conditions of\n the last year.\n&#xa0;\nHowever banks still have some way to go in this area as 35% w\nere turned down for finance.\n \nWe hope that when we repeat this survey next year there will be great improvement shown in this area.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n64% of those surveyed have an overdraft with a third of them unhappy as their bank had unilaterally change\nd the conditions of the overdraft re\nsulting in a negative impact on \ntheir business.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n62% of those surveyed have a company credit card with only 3% claiming that their bank had altered the contract to the detriment of their business.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGiven the recent closure of bank branches, we were keen to see how this had impacted on footfall and spending patterns.\n \nWhile 76% said there has been no impact, 24% said they have been affected.\n \nRural members especially expressed concern a\nt the greater distances they now had to travel to their local banks to lodge money.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n42% rate the service from their bank as good or excellent, 38% average and 20% below average or poor. The banking sector overall will be happy with \nthis figure and it demonstrates that they have responded to pressure from our members and Government to improve.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAccess to Finance&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nyesno&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHave you tried to access finance from a bank in the last 3 years \n34%\n66%\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIf yes were you successful in gaining finance\n65%\n35%\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBank Overdraft&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDo you currently have a Bank overdraft? \n64%\n36%\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIf yes, has the bank tried to alter the conditions of the overdraft, which has had a negative impact upon your \nbusiness?\n34%\n66%\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCredit Card&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDo you currently have a credit card for your business? \n62%\n38%\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIf yes, has the bank tried to alter the conditions of the credit card, which has had a negative impact upon your business?\n3%\n97%\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBank Branch Closures&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHave recent branch closure had a negative impact on your business?\n24%\n76%\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOverall, how would you describe the service from your bank?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nExcellent\n14%\n&#xa0;\nGood\n28%\n&#xa0;\nAverage\n38%\n&#xa0;\nBelow Average\n12%\n&#xa0;\nPoor\n8%\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Recommendations&#xa0;\nThe independent retail sector in Northern Ireland is one of the most innovative, vibrant, varied and important - but it is also one of the most fragile. \n&#xa0;\nLacking the critical mass and resources of the large multiples, \nindependent traders can be more susceptible to economic changes. Of those we surveyed who tried to access finance in the last three years, 35% were unsuccessful. This is concer\nning. We need a banking system \nwhich better understands small retailers. Our mem\nbers are a key driver of growth in Northern Ireland and efficient funding and support is vital to our sector in supporting economic recovery.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe would \nmake the following recommendations\n:\n&#xa0;\nNorthern Ireland Banking Forum&#xa0;\nAs Banking regulations are not a devolved matter, we suggest that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland establish and Chair a \nNI Banking Forum\n. This would include representatives from the Banks, Business Organisations and Executive Ministers for Ente\nrprise and Finance.\n&#xa0;\nWe envisage this Forum to be a mechanism to promote good communication and indeed to resolve any issues such as we have identified in our survey. This Forum should meet at least twice a year.\n&#xa0;\nBranch Vacancy Strategy&#xa0;Bank b\nranch\nes are\n a\nn\n essential element in our High Streets and Town Centres, both in terms of generating footfall and service provision for local traders.\n All the banks need to ensure that \nthere is \nadequate consultation with local stakeholders in advance of any intended cl\nosures.\n&#xa0;\nWith the high volume of bank branch closures in Northern Ireland we need all banks to commit themselves to a target of alternative use of the empty buildings within three months of closure.\n&#xa0;\nAlternative use such a new retail store, pop up shop, or\n being used a communi\nty group will boost \nthe \nfootfall which the branch closure has reduced. \n&#xa0;\nOverdrafts and Credit Cards&#xa0;\nAs evidenced in our survey B\nanks unilaterally changing the o\nverdrafts of our members is still a cause for concern. We recommend a tig\nhtening of regulations covering the conditions on Overdraft and Credit cards to ensure that small business customers are not negatively impacted by any \nsuch \nchanges.\n \n&#xa0;\nWe would recommend that \nthe \nFinancial Conduct Authority examine this area as a matter of\n priority.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
