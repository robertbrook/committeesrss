[[[ - Written evidence]]]&#xa0;I wish to submit that I support the representations and submissions by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA), and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (TDGLA) with regards to this bill.&#xa0;The reason for my support for these organisations and their causes is that whilst I am a town dweller, I believe the countryside should be preserved as best we can. I consider it is essential that the peaceful tranquil atmosphere and natural beauty of the countryside should be retained for the enjoyment of the majority and for the safety of the local inhabitants and visiting public; not to mention for the protection of the natural flora and fauna and indigenous wildlife (both now and for the future). &#xa0;There will be obvious exceptions, such as agricultural vehicles going about their normal business, but it is my belief the majority of the public would not wish our green and pleasant land to be blighted by anti-social noise and unsightly damage to our rural landscape caused by anti-social activity .&#xa0;I have of course witnessed on many occasions on some countryside walks erosion caused by off-road vehicles such as motorcycles and 4x4 motorised vehicles. These vehicles are driven to otherwise inaccessible locations (except on foot or by agricultural transport) for the sole and selfish purpose of driving in these areas for fun, without due concern by the drivers for the environment or the enjoyment of the area by others,.&#xa0;The above named organisations believe their cause will be furthered by the Deregulation Bill and if this is their opinion, given their superior experience and knowledge in these matters, they have my support.&#xa0;I hope you will take my opinion into consideration during your deliberations.&#xa0;11 September 2013                                                                                    &#xa0;
