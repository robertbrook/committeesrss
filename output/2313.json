"EIS 28Written evidence submitted by the CBI Minerals Group&#xa0;\nIntroductioni\n              \nThe \nCBI\n Minerals Group represents the minerals extraction industry within the United Kingdom including all major non-energy minerals and coal. The Group represents \nover \n500 mineral extraction and related companies either directly through being members of the Grou\np or indirectly through member trade associations. \nii\n              \nThe approximate total value of minerals produced in the UK (including oil and gas) was £37.7 billion in 2011.\n The industry (excluding oil and gas) usually \nextracts between 22\n0 \nand 350 \nmillion tonnes of minerals \nper annum from the UK landmass, \ndirectly contributes over £10\n billion a year to the economy and provides\n direct and indirect employment\n around 8\n0\n,000 people. It\n is essential to provide the raw materials on which many important in\ndustries depend. Minerals are the largest material flow in the Country.\n&#xa0;\nIii\n              \nThe purpose of this evidence is to highlight the important role of the UK based minerals extraction industry plays in supporting \nsustainable economic growth\n and that s\nustainable d\nevelopment is only achievable by ensuring an adequate and steady supply of all minerals\n.\n \nExecutive Summary&#xa0;\nQuestions&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nT\nhe \ncontribution\n that the \nindigenous minerals industry makes\n to the economy is highlighted in paragraph 142 of the National Planning Policy framework published by the Government in March 2012. This states:\n&#xa0;\n142. Minerals are essential to support sustainable \neconomic growth and our quality of life. It is therefore important that there is a sufficient supply of material to provide the infrastructure, buildings, energy and goods that the country needs. However, since minerals are a finite natural resource, and c\nan only be worked where they are found, it is important to make best use of them to secure their long-term conservation.\n&#xa0;\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/6077/2116950.pdf\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nThis importance is restated in \nthe \nResource Security Action Plan\n published by the Government in March 2012. This states in paragraph 21:\n&#xa0;\n21. It is essenti\nal that there is an adequate and steady supply of minerals to provide the raw materials for infrastructure, buildings and goods that society, industry and the economy need. Government recognises that where there is increasing and unprecedented demand for n\new mineral resources, such as the ‘speciality’ metals vital for a range of high-tech applications and green technologies, further primary production will be necessary as there is insufficient recyclate from end-of-life products to meet new demand.\n&#xa0;\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/resource-security-action-plan-making-the-most-of-valuable-materials\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nThe UK is fortunate \nto have such diverse \ngeology\n \nwhich \nhas endowed \nit \nwith a wide range of mineral \nresources\n making it\n self-sufficient in non-energy minerals. Abundant coal and hydrocarbon resources also remain. \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nT\nhe Br\nitish Geological Survey \nMinerals UK \nwebsite \nstates \nthat:\n&#xa0;\nThe UK is an important producer of a range of minerals that are consumed in many sectors of the economy. Some 218 million tonnes of minerals were extracted from the UK landmass for sale in 2011. These can be broken down into the following main categ\nories with percentages of total production in brackets:\nA \nfurther 110.3 million tonnes, consisting mainly of oil and gas (oil equivalent), but also marine–dredged sand and gravel, were extracted from the UK Continental Shelf\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.bg\ns.ac.uk/mineralsuk/statistics/UKstatistics.html\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n              \nThe \nUK\n has in the past\n also\n supported an import\nant metal mining industry. \nThis is poised \nto \nagain \nmake an \nimportant  c\nontribution to the \neconomy\n and \nthe \nsecurity of supply of \nessential\n raw materials with the development of\n,\n \nfor example\n,\n \nthe Hemerdon \ntungsten\n mine\n \nin \nDevon\n and gold mining in Scotland\n.\n&#xa0;An example of supplies of critical materials in the UK – Hemerdon, DevonHemerdon is the fourth largest deposit of tungsten in the world.\n It is an example of the new opportunities for the UK to provide secure supplies of critical and economically crucial minerals for our economy from within our own significant and undeveloped resources. Tungsten is important as it is an essential mineral fo\nr use in cutting tools and for hardened steel. Currently almost 78% of the world’s production of Tungsten comes from China. The annual production from Hemerdon will provide around 4% of global demand, meet the demand from within the UK and contribute towar\nds exports\n. \nThe mine will employ around 250 people directly, with additional indirect employment.\n&#xa0;\nSource: \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69511/pb13719-resource-security-action-plan.pdf\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n              \nThe Minerals Products Association\n (MPA)\n recently com\nmissioned Capital \nE\nconomics to \nassess the contribu\ntion the mineral product\ns sector\n (principally minerals extracted to supply \nthe construction sector) \nmakes to\n the UK economy.  \n \nThe research concluded that the sector:\nSource: \nhttp://www.mineralproducts.org/feature_ce_report.html\n&#xa0;\nThe MPA publication\n \n“\nThe mineral products contribution to the \nUK\n”\n \nsummarises these key facts:  \nhttp://www.mineralproducts.org/documents/MPA_MTL_Document.pdf\n1.7\n              \nThe contribution of the other sectors is\n less readily quantifiable. The s\nt\natist\nic\ns\n published by the BGS\n referred to \nabove \nstate \ntha\nt\n the\n \napproximate\n value of minerals produced \nin the \nUK (including oil and gas) \nwas \n£37.7 bill\nion \nin 2011\n. This figure is calculated on as ‘ex-works’ basis and does not take account of the down-stream \nadded value.\n1.8\n              \nBGS statistics\n show that the\n balance of trade in minerals and mineral based products in 2011 was £106.7 billion in i\nmports and £84.7 billion in expo\nrts leaving and balance of trade deficit of £21.0 billion.\n1.9\n              \nThe national and regional \nco\nntribution\n of the sector is more clearly demonstrated by looking at case studies:\nCase Study 1: \nCleveland Potash\n Boulby Potash Mine\n \nCleveland Potash owns and oper\nates a potash mine (Boulby Mine\n)\n on the n\north east coast of Yorkshire.  The C\nompany \nproduces\n in the order of 3\n million tonnes per annum (\nmtpa\n) \nof \npotash ore and refines \nthis into 1mtpa \nof \npotash mainly used in the fertiliser industry. Although the Company produces enough potash to satisfy the UK demand, in practice they supply about half \nof \nthis \nmarket with the remainder being imported from Germany, Russia and Canada.  In order to access the potash ore deposit, the Company also mines rock salt\n, which occurs in association with potash,\n producing about \n0.8 m\ntpa which is mostly sold to local authorit\nies and highway authorities as de-icing salt. \nThe Company contributes £225M per year of economic activity as measured by product sales.  They support many local small suppliers and service companies.  Half their sales are overseas with approximate foreign\n earnings of £100M per year.\nThe Company employs approximately 900 persons in high quality jobs, and a further 150 full time contractor employees. All direct employees are employed at the Boulby Mine with a few\n based at\n the nearby export terminal on the Ri\nver Tees. A socio-\neconomic study carried out on behalf of the company concluded that they support approximately 4,000 up-stream and down-stream jobs with a predominantly regional impact.  \n&#xa0;\n              \n              \nCase Study 2: \nKier Minerals Ltd Greenburn Surface Coal Mine\nKier Minerals Ltd (part of Kier Group Plc)   currently own and operate a surface coal mine in the UK, the Greenburn Surface Mine, near New Cumnock in East Ayrshire. Reserves exist to continue until 2022.\nBy\n the end of August 2013 site ha\nd\n produced 5,492,00\n0 tonnes of coal \nsupplying English\n power stations by rail and contributing to an indigenous solution to UK energy security.\n&#xa0;\nThe Greenburn operation currently employs 151 hourly paid individuals and additionally 48 sub-contractors are permanently employed \ngiving a total of 199. Of this total 84 live within 10 miles of the site and 116 live within a 15 mile radius. \nIt is estimated that 160 indirect jobs and 234 induced jobs (jobs supported by\n employee spending) are employed\n. \nThese figure are in the context o\nf significant unemployment of 10.9% (April 2012 to March 2013)\n \nfor East Ayrshire\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\nKier have also contributed £1.54 million (end August 2013) into the local community trust which provides funding to local community projects and will continue to contribut\ne on future production.  Kier Group plc has established a Non-Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Centre at Greenburn. To date the Centre has completed 116 vocational qualifications in level 2 Plant Operations plus 6 supervisors achieving level 3 awards.\n&#xa0;\nCase Study 3: \nSibelco Kingsteignton (Bovey Basin, Devon) Ball Clay Operations\n \n&#xa0;\nThe Devon Ball Clay operations provide a range of plastic clays unique in Europe and much of the rest of the world. \n&#xa0;\nThe properties of these premium Ball Clays and the consiste\nncy of the blended products are very highly regarded globally, with exports to over 80 countries and the fact that more than 50% of the world’s sanitary\n \nware contains UK Ball Clay as an essential ingredient. \n&#xa0;\nThere are few if any viable alternatives to the\n UK Ball Clay component in the UK and the EU sanitary ceramics industry. \n&#xa0;\nSanitary\n \nware producers regard the UK Ball Clays as essential to their production process. \n&#xa0;\nSimilarly there are currently no viable substitute materials for Ball Clay in most other c\neramic applications. \n&#xa0;\nThe UK Ball Clay is of great importance with potentially in the order of 70-80,000 jobs at risk if the supply of ball clay is interrupted. (Source: DTI). \n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nTypically ceramic manufacturers cannot carry large stocks of Ball Clay and th\nus are highly dependent on the producers for frequent and uninterrupted deliveries.\n \nThe recently published National Planning Policy Framework reaffirmed the status of Ball Clay as a nationally important mineral in the context of the English planning syste\nm. \n&#xa0;\n \nThis status is nothing new and has been consistently afforded to Ball Clay in the UK since the Government’s Standing Conference in the 1940s, in part, due to its scarcity and limited distribution in the global context.\n \n&#xa0;\nSibelco’s operations \ncontribute some £15m to the local economy of Newton Abbot and sustain direct employment of over 200 people in the local area, together with a significant number of indirect jobs from servicing through to catering. \n&#xa0;\nThe international trade in Ball Clay is a\nlso an integral element in sustaining Devon’s local ports, particularly Teignmouth, with between 80 and 90% of extracted mineral being exported. \n&#xa0;\nThe export of Ball Clay through Teignmouth consistently equates to circa 60% of the total annual tonnage throu\ngh the docks, being almost twice the volume of the next highest tonnage (animal feed). (Source: Teignmouth Harbour Commissioners Financial Report: Y/E April 2011).\n \n&#xa0;\nThe £10m realignment of the B3193 Chudleigh Road currently being developed, will release \napproximately 3,500,000 tonnes (3.5mt) of consented premium grade plastic clays with an estimated 81% yield (average yield of Bovey Basin Ball Clays is circa 65%), over the next 22 years. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, the 3.5mt is only the first phase of development, with the\n existing B3193 currently sterilising an estimated total of 24mt of premium grade Ball Clay.\n&#xa0;\n1.10\n              \nGlobally\n, the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) advise that\n listed \n extractive industry companies account for approximately 16 per cent of LSEG’s markets b\ny number of companies and 22 per cent by market capitalisation. \n&#xa0;\n1.11\n              \nThe development of the UK as a listing destination for extractive industry companies benefits the UK economy in many ways, including job creation, taxation, and strengthening the market\n – for example by increasing the diversity of the UK’s capital markets - which benefits other listed companies and the wider financial services sector.\n&#xa0;\n1.12\n              \nBy forming part of a global extractive industries peer group, these companies attract specialised \nglobal investors, analysts and intermediaries to London, giving them access to a global pool of investment capital. The UK’s financial services sector also benefits from extractive industry companies choosing to list in London. Regardless of where a compan\ny is incorporated, it is likely to employ UK banks, legal firms and communications firms in its syndicate as it undertakes its IPO (initial public offering) process and whilst it is listed on the market. This provides a source of revenue and job creation f\nor the UK’s financial services sector.\n&#xa0;\n1.13\n              \nAnother way the listed and quoted extractive industry companie\ns\n support the growth of the UK economy is though taxation. There are 196 UK-incorporated extractive industry companies on our markets. The LSEG estim\nates from these figures \nthat extractive companies on their\n markets, as a group, \npay £23 billion in domestic taxes\n – more than Government spending on transport or housing and environment for 2013/14\n&#xa0;\n1.14\n              \nThe contribution of UK listed global mining industry to the UK economy is \nalso \nwell documented in the recent UKTI publication UK – Deliveri\nng Global Mining Solution. This \nstates: \n&#xa0;\nThe UK has world leading expertise in all aspects of the mining lifecycle. \nThis publication showcases a wide selection of capabilities and case studies from UK organisations, institutions, consultants, companies and experts. It demonstrates that UK companies have the depth, breadth and global reach to deliver expert, effective an\nd profitable solutions throughout\n the mining lifecycle and beyond.\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/search.ht\nml?sort=ByScore&amp;search=UK+delivering+global+mining+solutions&amp;sector=-1&amp;country=-1&amp;focusOn=-1\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nThe indigenous mineral extraction industry is a major employer in the UK often providing high quality jobs in \nrural areas\n both directly employed in the mining /quarrying operations but also in the downstream industries which depend on the minerals as their\n raw material. The MPA estimate that the mineral products sector alone employ\ns\n over 70,000 people\n. It is \nestimated\n tha\nt\n the secto\nr as a whole employs close to 8\n0,000 people. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nThe UKTI\n report quoted in 1.14\n above recognises the support the UK based extractive industries provides in all aspects of the mining lifecycle:\n&#xa0;\nThe UK has world leading expertise in all aspects of the mining lifecycle. This publication showcases a wide selection of capabilities and case studies from UK organisations, institutions, consultants, companies and experts. It demonstrates that UK compani\nes have the depth, breadth and global reach to deliver expert, effective and profitable solutions throughout the mining \nlifecycle and beyond.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nThe Committee should be aware of the shape of the ownership o\nf\n those c\nompanies engaged in the extraction of minerals in the UK. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nIn the non-energy minerals sect\nor, the leading\n companies\n are almost exclusively non-UK listed\n. These include\n \nCemex\n (aggregates and cement)\n, St Gobain\n (Gypsum)\n, Imerys\n (china clays and b\nall clay)\n, Cleveland Potash\n (potash and rock salt)\n, Sibelco\n (industrial sands and b\nall clay)\n, Heidelberg\n (aggregates \nand brick clays)\n, Holcim\n (a\nggregates)\n,\n Sibelco (industrial minerals), Eurovia Group (construction products),\n \nColas UK (construction products), Lhoist Group (industrial lime)\n and \nLafar\nge Tarmac (aggregates, cement,)\n \nwho are \na 50:50 joint venture between Lafarge which is not listed in UK and Anglo American which is. \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nWhile there are numerous \nUK listed c\nompanies \nassociated with the industry, those \ndirectly involved in extraction \nin the UK \nare limited to a handful. They\n inc\nlude \nBreedon Aggregates\n, Kier Group\n and Marshalls\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nPrivately owned companies \nnormally operating one or two units \nmakeup\n up the remainder of the companies operating in the UK. These represent less than \n20\n% \nof the market and are focused almost exclusively in the local aggregate supplies. \n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nDespite efforts by the government to \nstreamline\n the planning and regulatory system in the UK\n,\n \nit\n remains cumbersome, time consuming and expensive. The uncertainty and level of bureaucracy this creates acts as a disincentive for those operating in the UK to invest in new UK based operations.\n4.6\n              \nThe \nBritish Ceramic Confederation (BCC) \nhas\n advised \nthat\n UK operations of multinational companies in their membership have reported that they are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain money for capital investments as the payback is much quicker in many overseas countries. A major concern is the cumulative\n (energy + climate-related charges) costs which in the case of brick and clay roof tile manufacturers can be up to 35% production costs in the UK. The perceived lack of energy security – essential in continuous high temperature processes - has also deterre\nd some companies in this sector from investments due to risk of damage to assets and / or uncertain business models with highly volatile prices. As a result brick and clay roof tile imports are increasing\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nPlease refer to our answer to \nQuestion 9.\n I\nt should\n also\n be noted\n, \nas \nstated in the answer to Q.4 above\n \nthat the vast majority of the leading companies engaged in mineral extract\nion are non-\nUK listed.  \n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nWe believe the level of engagement with NGOs and communities in the UK is excellent at both a local and national level. Examples of t\nhe engagement are set out below.\n&#xa0;\nNational Engagement - The UK Minerals Forum.\n6.2\n              \nThe UK Minerals Forum was set by the CBI Minerals Group in 2006 because there was \na perceived n\need to draw together all key stakeholders, to debate and inform \ngovernment and the public on the prudent use, sustainable management and \nsupply of UK minerals. The UKMF has a broad membership drawn from industry, regulators, NGOs and government\n who sit as observers\n. It holds regular meetings and convenes working groups to research and report on critical issues. \nWe believe the Forum is a goo\nd example of best practice in engagement between all stakeholders who have an interest in the UK based extractive industry.\nhttp://www.bgs.ac.uk/ukmf/home.html\n&#xa0;\n              \nLocal Engagement6.3\n              \nEngagement with local\n communities is enshrined within the land use planning legis\nlation and the industry has for\n many years worked hard to be part or the local community rather apart from it. \nMany operator\ns actively engage with their communities though regular open days, educa\ntion initiatives and other forms of community engagements  such as site specif\nic liaison group involving loca\nl elected representative\ns\n, local re\nsidents and locally based NGOs.\n Further details on the statutory obligation to engage with local communities can\n be viewed at:   \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development\n&#xa0;\nNature after minerals6.4\n              \nMinerals sites are often ideal for creating wildlife habitats such as wetlands, heath, grasslands and woods.\n&#xa0;\n The Nature After Minerals Programme is\n&#xa0;\na partnership between \nNatural Engla\nnd \nand the \nRSPB\n, with support from the \nMineral\n&#xa0;\nProducts Association \nand the \nBritish \n              \nAggregates Association\n.\n&#xa0;\n Th\ne\n&#xa0;\norganisations are working with mineral planners and industry to help nature during and after\n&#xa0;\nminerals extraction. Together, \nthey\n will make substantial contributions to priority\n \nhabitats and species, in particular to the \nEngland \nBiodiversity Strategy 2020 \ntargets and provide richer places for people to enjoy.\n              \nFurther details can be viewed at:\nhttp://afterminerals.com/index.aspx\n&#xa0;\nThe Minerals Products Association (MPA) Biodiversity Strategy 6.5\n              \nThe MPA has\n developed a biodiversity strategy \nwhich \npromotes \ncontinuing good site management, restoration \nand after-use of minerals sites This \nis \nexpected to contribute significantly to the achievement of biodiversity priorities, particularly for more bigger, better and joined-up habitats, and MPA member have a unique role to play in this.\n \nThey are \nalso \nworking closely with a range of organisations\n,\n including \nNatural England who sponsor the annual biodiversity awards.\n \nhttp://www.mineralproducts.org/sustainability/pdfs/MPA_Biodiversity_Strategy.pdf\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nIn its heyday\n,\n the UK underground coal industry was a key driver in prov\niding the skills base for the extractive industries but with it\ns\n now virtual demise the number of \nmining and related\n training\n course\ns\n has dwindled\n. \n  \nThe lack of this indigenous industry\n also\n means there is reduced opportunity for students to gain practica\nl experience or interest \nin \nmining operations.  \n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nThe main \nuniversity level \nmining relate\nd courses are no\nw\n restricted to \nvery few universities, such as Cambo\nu\nrne School of Mines, part of the Exeter University\n,\n and course\ns\n provided by \nD\nerby and Northumbria Universities  \n&#xa0;\n7.8\n              \nThe Mineral Products Qualification Council (MPQC)\n was set up by the industry as a Awarding\n&#xa0;\nOrganisation \nwhich offers a wide range of qualifications specifically designed for the quarrying,\n&#xa0;\nmineral products,\n&#xa0;\nmining and related manufacturing\n&#xa0;\nsector. They have qualifications\n&#xa0;\nsuitable for personnel at all levels working in the extractive and\n&#xa0;\nmineral products\n&#xa0;\nand\n related industries.\nhttp://www.mp-qc.org/\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.1\n              \nThe Minerals Group is \nsurprised \nthat\n \nthere \nwas \nno dialogue /consultation\n \nwith its members who \noperate within the UK\n \nprior to the adoption \nof EITI in the UK\n. We understand \nthat\n a multi-stakeholder group has been\n set up to \noversee the implementation of EITI\n on which the Mining Association of the UK\n (MAUK)\n is represented. \nMAUK are members of the Miner\nals Group but w\ne believe there is a\nn urgent\n need for much wider representation of those actively involved in the extraction of minerals in the UK.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9.1\n              \nWhile the CBI Minerals Group focus is on \nprincipally on \nour indigenous extractive industries, it is clear from discussions with\n t\nhe London Stock Exchange \nGroup that t\nhe UK’s strong listing and corporate governance standards are vital for continuing to attract international companies to list here. Development of the UK’s corporate governance regime has enabled London’s markets to flourish. The UK is consiste\nntly ranked as having the world’s strongest standards of corporate governance\n1\n. Indeed, the UK’s listing and corporate governance regime has been replicated by financial centres around the world. Strong listing and corporate governance provides a stable b\nase on which a company can operate, and also generates investor conference in that company. Therefore strong corporate governance and listing standards are not just important for how a company is perceived by investors, they, they also have a bearing on a \ncompany’s long term financial performance.\n&#xa0;\n9.2\n              \nAs a result of the nature of their business and the jurisdictions extractive companies frequently operate in, they are subject to additional due diligence and reporting requirements compared to companies in \nother sectors making them significantly more transparent and accountable relative to companies that remain private\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n10.1\n              \nThe \nUK \nremains \na global centre but\n t\nhe\n Government should champion a UK Minerals S\ntrategy which put\ns\n indigenous minerals extraction at the centre of \nits \nindustrial strategy\n to ensure we do not lose that status\n.\n&#xa0;\n10.2\n              \nWe believe there is \ntoo much focus on short term\nism\n \nin \ng\novernment. T\nhere are long lead times\n, often \nat least \nten years,\n \nto \nbring\n new mineral \nextraction operation\ns\n \non stream. They cannot be switche\nd on\n and off\n and\n,\n once \nlost overseas, the industry and its s\nupport infrastructure will be very difficult to get back.\n  The issue of unnecessarily “exporting the environmental impact” of extraction operation\ns should also not be overlooked.\n&#xa0;\n10.3\n              \nR\nesource efficiency and \nrecycling\n will \nhave an increasing importance to\n counteract increased security of supply issues. As acknowledged in the recently published report of the Circular Economy Task Force\n,\n this \nwill not replace the \ncontinuing\n need for new secure \nreserves- refer to \nS\nection 2 \n“recycling isn’t enough”\n \nhttp://www.green-alliance.org.uk/grea_p.aspx?id=7179\n&#xa0;\n10.4\n              \nGlobal demand \nfor minerals will continue to increase and not \nall minerals can be recycled –potash \nused as \nfertilizer\n or salt for \nde\n-\nicing \nroads cannot be reused or recycled\n. Minerals are often \nphysically and chemically cha\nnged in manufacturing process – for example the use of fluorspar in the chemical industry and l\nimestone in the steel industry. \nAdvances in technology \nare\n likely to \nrequire \nthe use of \nexotic alloys\n which are impracticable to recycle.\n&#xa0;\n23 September 2013\n              \n              \n              \n&#xa0;\n1]\n For an example of corporate governance rankings, see GMI Ratings, \nList of countries by corporate governance, 2010:\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.gmiratings.com/Images/GMI_Country_Rankings_as_of_10_27_2010.pdf\n \n"
