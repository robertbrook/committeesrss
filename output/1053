VEP 0028
defaultWritten Submission defaultbydefault Dr Cormac Behandefault default(University of Sheffield)default VEP 0028default&#xa0;defaultSummary of the main points defaultThe main objective of my submission is to bring to the attention of the Joint Committee
default on the draft Voting Eligibility (Prisoners) Bill 
defaultthe experience of prisoner enfranchisement in a number of jurisdictions where it has been the subject of parliamentary and legal debate, with particular reference to the Republic of Ireland. This submission begins with answering the questions set out by the Joint Committee
default. 
defaultIt invites the Joint Committee to consider enfranchisement of prisoners and outlines some of the arguments and evidence in favour of this proposal. It makes the case that ‘civil death’ status on which prisoner enfranchisement is based is an antiquated concept and is not compatible with modern democratic principles. It concludes with an examination of prisoner enfranchisement in a number of jurisdictions which may assist the Joint Committee in their consideration of the issue.  
default&#xa0;defaultAuthordefaultI am a lecturer at the Centre for Criminological Research, School of Law, University of Sheffield. Prior to taking up this position, I was a teacher in Irish prisons for 14 years. I have undertaken a comparative study of prisoner enfranchisement and conducted research with prisoners about political participation and civic engagement. This research has been published in academic journals and presented at conferences internationally (see references at end of submission).
default&#xa0;
defaultSubmission defaultThis submission will 
defaultinvite the committee to consider alternatives to a
default, b and 
defaultc set out in the proposals above. It will begin by making the case that all prisoners should be enfranchised for philosophical, political and practical reasons. It will examine many of the issues that form part of the committee’s deliberations and 
defaultc
defaultonclude by outlining the experience 
defaultof a
default number of jurisdictions that allow prisoners to vote
default, with particular emphasis on the Republic of Ireland
default.   
default&#xa0;
defaultThe cornerstone of modern democracy is the right to vote. D
defaultepriving any person of th
defaultis 
defaultright negates the social contract on which 
defaultdemocratic legitimacy 
defaultis built, as power is wielded without the authority of 
defaultall citizens
default.
default 
defaultIn a modern democracy, without consent being given by all the members of society, the whole polity is undermined. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe concept of civic death is an antiquated and outdated idea in a modern democracy. The denial of the right to vote by the judiciary, executive or legislature undermines the consent on which modern democratic authority is built. Society cannot go back to a time when an elite decided on who should be the electorate. 
defaultRemoving the right to vote not only undermines the social contract but damages the social compact on which community and citizenship is constructed. While it is argued that governments have an obligation to those who obey the law to punish those who break the law, this fails to locate the law in a wider social and political context.
default&#xa0;
defaultDisenfranchising a section of the population tests the limits of liberty in a democracy. Denying the franchise to any section of the population, even because of wrong-doing, leads to 
defaultthose 
defaultwho have the vote deciding who has the right to the franchise. According to the European Court of Human Rights, to deny the right to vote to prisoners is ‘tantamount to the elected choosing the electorate’ (
defaultHirst v. United Kingdom (No.2), 
default2005
default). It tilts the outcome of elections in favour of those who are allowed to vote. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe denial of the vote to a prisoner
default, in category a or b above 
defaultis also related to the timing of an election
default. 
defaultIf an individual is serving a sentence on election day for a minor offence they may be denied the opportunity to exercise their franchise.
default 
defaultAn individual could serve a number of years in prison for a more serious offence and still have the opportunity to vote, if they were no longer incarcerated on election day. If 
defaultvotin
defaultg is one of the most important aspects of social contract, then
default these considerations make 
defaultdenying it in this context 
defaultsomewhat arbitrary
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn a and b above, i
defaultt is imprisonment that will decide if a prisoner keeps or loses the right to vote rather than their receiving a conviction. In the 
defaultHirst 
defaultcase, two judges of the European Court of Human Rights observed that ‘the reasons for handing down a custodial sentence may vary. A defendant’s age, health or family situation may result in his or her receiving a suspended sentence. Thus the same criminal offence and the same criminal character can lead to a prison sentence or to a suspended sentence’ (
defaultHir
defaultst v. United Kingdom (No.2
default), 
default2005). They concluded that the reason the right to vote is denied ‘is the fact that the person is in prison’. In 
defaultdifferent 
defaultjurisdictions, two individuals may be convicted of the same crime, and one may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment and not allowed to vote while the other receives a non-custodial sentence and exercises their franchise. 
defaultAs the majority of those sentenced in the United Kingdom do not receive a custodial sentence, this reiterates the point about its arbitrary nature.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are strong arguments 
defaultand evidence 
defaultthat prisoners’ maintaining a link with society outside
default,
default and in particular with their local community and electoral area, can act as 
defaultstimulus 
defaulttowards reintegration. To remove the right to vote - one of the most important aspects of citizenship – adds to the dislocation from, and disconnection with, the world outside prison walls. It creates another layer of punishment beyond the denial of liberty, becomes an instrument of social exclusion, and can have significant longitudinal consequences in terms of voting among ex-prisoners. To deny the right to vote not just undermines an individual’s citizenship, it can weaken the fabric of communities that have greater proportions of their citizens incarcerated
default.
default 
defaultFinally, it
default undermine
defaults
default the universality on which modern democra
defaultti
defaultc authority is built. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDisenfranchisement has its roots in the ancient concept of ‘civil death’ based in Greek, Roman, Germanic and Anglo-Saxon law. In ancient Greece, ‘civil death’ meant that certain offenders forfeited all their civil rights, including the right to property and possession, the right to inherit and bequeath, the right to bring suit, the right to vote and the right to appear in court
default.
default In Roman law, an individual pronounced ‘infamous’ was prohibited from serving in the army, appearing in court, making speeches, attending assemblies, and voting
default. 
defaultBeing declared infamous could be for a criminal or immoral act. In later times, ‘outlawry’ 
defaultwas used 
defaultto punish those who committed serious crimes. The outlaw was expelled from the community, their property confiscated and they were denied all rights. During the Middle Ages, the outlaw was deprived of legal existence. Ultimately, in extreme cases, the outlaw being outside society and therefore beyond protection from the 
defaultrealm
default could be killed with impunity.
default&#xa0;
defaultEnglish law created its own punishment of 
defaultattainder. 
defaultIn feudal England, the Crown seized the property of felons as part of their punishment. The attained, for a felony or crime of treason, was liable to three penalties: forfeiture – the confiscation of chattels and goods; ‘corruption of the blood’ – they were unfit to inherit, possess or leave their estate to heirs, and the land was forfeited to the local lord; finally, the attained was ‘dead in law’
default,
default 
defaultand 
defaultcould not bring suit or 
defaultappear as a witness in court
default. 
defaultThe
defaulty 
defaultcould not perform any legal function, including 
defaultvoting. 
defaultWhile most civil death statutes have been abolished in modern democracies, one of the few which remains as a direct result of conviction and sentence to imprisonment is loss of the right to vote. 
default&#xa0;defaultThose who argue for disenfranchisement of prisoners use a social contractarian model with reference to Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and Kant
default. 
defaultModern 
defaultproponent
defaults
default of 
defaultprisoner disenfranchisement tend to argue that those who have broken the law should not be allowed to make the law. Some argue that 
defaultlaw abiding citizens have a right to de
defaultcide 
defaultwho they wish to exclude – for example prisoners – from
default the polity
default. Indeed, they argue that 
defaultit is incumbent on a
default society to define the limits of liberty and create laws that exclude those who will not accept this framework. 
defaultThis 
defaultindicates 
defaultthat certain activity 
default– breaking the law- 
defaultis unacceptable and therefore those who engage in it should be placed outside of the polity by being denied the right to vote.   
default&#xa0;
defaultThose who argue for disenfranchisement believe individuals sentenced to prison lose not only their liberty, but by virtue of being incarcerated, other rights. It is sometimes an intended outcome of imprisonment and at times one of the unintended consequences. In most countries, 
defaulton imprisonment, citizens 
defaultlose many other rights, along with their liberty. Those in favour of disenfranchisement believe 
defaultthat losing the right to vote should be a direct, rather than merely a collateral consequence
default,
default of imprisonment. To disobey the law, communally created, undermines the right to 
defaultinfluence who makes the law. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThose in favour
default of prisoner disenfranchisement
default argue that is the most powerful message, both real and symbolic, to both law-abiding and non law-abiding citizens of the importance society places on obeying the rules created by representatives of the people. Advocates of dise
defaultnfranchisement believe it
default 
defaulta
defaultct
defaults
default as a lesson in civic education. A belief in the democratic process means that those who have not been willing to accept the outcome of that process - the passing of laws – debar themselves from the right to participate in it. Those who argue for prisoner disenfranchisement are convinced that the rights of citizenship are inextricably linked with responsibilities and obligations. Failure to appreciate the responsibilities and obligations takes away the rights of citizenship, central to which, is the right to vote. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCitizens 
defaultbring rights with them to prison. These are set out in 
defaultvarious policy documents and international agreements, including 
defaultthe UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (1955)
default,
default the European Convention on Human Rights (1
default951), European Prison Rules (2006
default) and Prison Rules for 
defaultEngland and Wales (1999). 
default 
defaultThese include the right to life, to be treated with dignity, t
defaulthe right to legal representation, a free and fair trial, a safe living environment, education, etc. In 
defaultRaymond -v- Honey
default  (1983 1 AC 1), 
defaultLord Wilberforce stated that: ‘under English law, a convicted prisoner, in spite of his imprisonment, retains all civil rights which are not taken away expressly or by necessary implication.’ The E
defaulturopean 
defaultC
defaultour
defaultt
default of 
defaultH
defaultuman 
defaultR
defaultights 
defaultin the 
defaultHirst
default case ruled that: ‘Prisoners in general continue to enjoy all the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention save for the right to liberty, where lawfully imposed’ 
default(Hirst v United Kingdom (No. 2), 
default2005
default). 
defaultThe right to vote is 
defaultincluded 
defaultin European and international treaties
default. The 
defaultEuropean Convention on Human Rights guarantees that: ‘
defaultThe High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature’ 
default(Protocol 1: Article 3)
default.
default 
defaultU
defaultnless there 
defaultare substantive reasons
default otherwise, 
defaultimprisonment should not remove th
defaulte
default right
default to vote
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPrison is about loss of liberty, not the loss of citizenship. Voting is a cornerstone of the concept of citizenship in a modern democratic polity. 
defaultFor those who would argue that imprisonment should comprise more than the denial of liberty, including the removal of the franchise as a direct or collateral consequence of imprisonment, this changes the nature of that punishment. If imprisonment, rather than conviction, is the deciding feature, this is a very arbitrary way of denying citizenship rights as many of those who receive a conviction are not given a custodial sentence.
default In the United Kingdom, the majority of those convicted will not automatically receive a 
defaultcustodial 
defaultsentence. 
defaultIf imprisonment is a deciding factor, this will only include those who have a custodial sentence at the time of elections.

default&#xa0;
default7. defaultWould giving prisoners the right to vote have any significant administrative impact on either the prison system or the Electoral Commission?defaultUsing the Irish experience as an example, there was no 
defaultsignificant administrative 
defaultimpact
default,
default either 
defaulton 
defaultthe prison system or the electoral authorities. 
defaultPrisoners registered in their home constituency and became another
default 
defaultcategory of
default postal voters
default. 
defaultUnder the legislation, the prison
default management
default, in liaison with local electoral authorities, 
defaultorganised voting in each institution. After 
defaultan 
defaultindividual 
defaultvot
defaultes,
default the
defaultir
default ballot 
defaultpaper 
defaultis put inside an envelope and this envelope and a declaration of identity are 
defaultthen 
defaultplaced in a covering envelope. The prison official forwards the ballots to the returning officer and these
default ballots 
defaultare
default opened and counted in the same 
defaultway as
default other
defaults in th
defaulte postal voter
default category
default. 
defaultThere were no reported administrative difficulties, fr
defaulto
defaultm either prisoners or prison authorities, with this procedure
default.
default 
defaultIf 
defaultUK decides to enfranchise prisoners by means of a postal ballot
default in their home constituency, 
defaultit 
defaultis unlikely to have a major administrative impact on either the prison system or Electoral Commission. 
default&#xa0;
default8. defaultIs there any evidence to suggest that allowing prisoners to vote would have a significant impact on particular constituencies?defaultMost jurisdictions that allow prisoners to vote 
defaultdo so 
defaultby way of postal ballot from their home, rather than the prison
default,
default constituency. If the United Kingdom follows this example, th
defaultis reduces the 
defaultpotential of a 
default‘voting bloc’, i.e. all voter
defaults in the same prison 
defaultcasting their ballot 
defaultfor a single candidate in the constituency
default of the prison
default.
default If 
defaultregistration is in the home constituency by p
defaultostal voting, this will dilute the opportunity for prisoners to skew the outcome of a particular constituency, even if they all voted 
default(although there is no evidence that this is the 
defaultcase) 
defaultfor the same candidate
default.
default 
defaultTherefore it should not have an impact on particular constituencies that contain prison/s.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is another consideration in determining if voting would have a significant impact on particular constituencies. 
defaultIn 
defaultthe Republic of Ireland, various studies have found that 
defaultthe bulk of prisoners come from 
defaultdisadvantaged 
defaulturban areas
default,
default with a number of electoral districts and constituencies containing a higher proportion of those incarcerated in comparison to 
defaultother districts
default. 
defaultIf the experience of Ireland is the same in the United Kingdom, then, because of the disproportionate number of prisoners from certain 
defaultelectoral 
defaultareas, this could impact on the outcome of certain constituencies.
default 
defaultHowever, t
defaulthis perhaps raises issues outside the remit of this committee. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn terms of the impact of prisoner voting in general, 
defaultif the objective of prisoner enfranchisement is not only to facilitate, but as with all citizens, encourage democratic participation, prisoners as voters will have the same impact on election outcomes
default as other citizens
default, their input being equal to every other voter 
defaulton election day
default. 
default&#xa0;
default  
default9default. defaultWhat lessons can be drawn from the experience of other countries regarding prisoner voting? defaultThe following briefly outlines the experience of prisoner enfranchisement in 
defaultnumber of jurisdictions
default 
defaultwhere
default the 
defaultissu
defaulte has caused some recent debate
default, 
defaultespecially those which allow prisoner
defaults
default to vote, 
defaultwith particular emphasis on the 
defaultRepublic of Ireland. 
defaultPrisoner enfranchisement has been a subject of controversy in a number of jurisdictions outside Europe. 
defaultThe following are some examples: 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
default1996, the Israeli Supreme Court upheld prisoner
defaults’
default right to vote after a case was taken to try to prevent voting by a prisoner in the election to elect the successor to Yitzhak Rabin. 
defaultOn the Knesset website, there is information in English about prisons and places of detention where electors are allowed to vote (
defaultwww.knesset.gov.il
default). During election
defaults
default, polling stations 
defaultare
default set up in prisons and detention centres. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
defaultSouth Africa, during 
defaultthe election to succeed Nelson Mandela, the issue of prisoners’ access to the franchise was a subject of some controversy with the Constitutional Court instructing the government and the Electoral Commission to make ‘all reasonable arrangements’ to enable prisoners to vote in the forthcoming election because the right to vote imposes ‘positive obligations on the legislature and the executive’ (
defaultAugust v. Electoral Commission, 
default1999). In the 2004 election, the Court again intervened and reiterated 
defaultits earlier ruling guaranteeing prisoners the right to vote. In a majority verdict, it ordered the government to put in place mechanisms to allow all prisoners to vote in the forthcoming elections. The Chief Justice, Arthur Chaskalson, 
defaultdeclared: 
default‘In light of our history where denial of the right to vote was used to entrench white supremacy and to marginalise the great majority of the people of our country, it is for us a precious right which must be respected and protected’ (
defaultMinister for Home Affairs v. Nicro, 
default2004). 
defaultThe legislation targeted ‘
defaultevery prisoner sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine’. 
defaultThe Court rejected the government’s blanket ban as disproportionate on the basis that it did not discriminate between those who had longer or shorter sentences (
defaultMinister for Home Affairs v. Nicro, 
default2004). 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2002, the Canadian Supreme Court by a margin of five to four found a 1993 electoral law to be unconstitutional. In 
defaultSauvé
default 
defaultv. Canada ((No. 2) 
default2002
default), the majority found that the ‘right to vote is fundamental to our democracy and rule of law and cannot be lightly set aside.’ The 
defaultdenial of the vote would not promote civic responsibility as the government had argued but it was ‘more likely to send messages that undermine the respect for the law and democracy than messages that enhance those values.’ The Court rejected the government’s argument that denying prisoners the vote because of some ‘vague and symbolic objectives’ of enhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law
default and 
defaultrefused to accept the government’s case that certain categories of prisoner
defaults
default should receive additional punishment by denying them the right to vote. It also rejected the lack of proportionality in the exclusion of all prisoners sentenced to over two years to vote in federal elections. The Supreme Court ruled that the government had ‘failed to identify particular problems that require denying the right to vote, making it hard to conclude that the denial is directed at a pressing and substantial purpose.’ Therefore, it declared that they could not ‘permit elected representatives to disenfranchise a segment of the population’. The Court concluded that to ‘deny prisoners the right to vote is to lose an important means of teaching them democratic values and social responsibility’ (
defaultSauvé v. Canada (No. 2), 2002
default). 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn August 2007, in time for the upcoming general election the Australian High Court struck down legislation
default introduced 
defaulta year previously that enforced 
defaulta blanket ban on prisoner
defaults’
default voting (prior to this
default,
default some prisoners, depending on sentence, were allowed to vote)
default. Four of the six judges believed that the 2006 Act did not sufficiently differentiate between the gravity of crimes. The Court found that there were circumstances in which limitations could be placed on the right to vote but there was not enough evidence in the case of Vicki Roach, an Aboriginal prisoner, who took the case. It should only be f
defaultor a ‘substantial’ reason. The C
defaultourt emphasised the centrality of the franchise to the concept of representative government and ‘
defaultthe existence and exercise of the franchise reflects notions of citizenship and membership of the Australian federal body politic
default’ (
defaultRoach v. Electoral Commission
default, 2007). They rejected the argument that the mere fact of criminal conduct sufficiently serious to warrant imprisonment necessitates this exclusion. There was no distinction in treatment between those who were serving a few days and those serving much longer sentences.  The Court continued: ‘
defaultthe franchise is critical to representative government, and lies at the centre of our concept of participation in the life of the community, and of citizenship’ 
default(
defaultRoach v. Electoral Commission
default, 2007).
default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultn 2006, the Republic of Ireland passed legislation allowing prisoners to vote. Prior to the passing of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006, 
defaultprisoners in the Irish Republic were in an anomalous position: there was no law on the statute books which specifically barred them from voting; however, there was no facility to allow them to cast their ballot. Under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1992, prisoners could register to vote at the address where they were ordinarily resident prior to their imprisonment. This position was challenged by a prisoner and held to be constitutionally lawful in the case of 
defaultBreathnach v. Ireland (2001). 
defaultAccording to the Chief Justice, Ronan Keane: ‘It is of course clear that despite the deprivation of his liberty which is the necessary consequence of the terms of imprisonment imposed upon him, the applicant retains the right to vote and could exercise that right if polling day in a particular election or referendum happened to coincide with a period when he was absent from the prison on temporary leave’ (
defaultBreathnach v. Ireland
default, 2001).
default While prisoners had a right to be registered in the constituency where they lived prior to incarceration
default,
default they had no right to postal voting or access to a ballot box. However, if a prisoner was on temporary release on election day, they could vote if they were registered. 
defaultIn the aftermath of the 
defaultHirst
default case, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government introduced 
defaultthe Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2006 which allowed all prisoners to vote, regardless of sentence or crime. Voting was to take place by means of a postal ballot. 
defaultA 
defaultselect committee considered many aspect
defaults
default of the bill and their d
defaultiscussions
default are available at 
defaulthttp://debates.oireachtas.ie/ENS/2006/11/02/
default. A number of issues were covered in these discussions, including penal reform, using the electoral process to promote responsibility among prisoners, encouraging civic engagement and prisoner reintegration. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn contrast to other jurisdictions, there 
defaultwas virtually no disagreement
default about prisoner enfranchisement in the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament), media 
defaultor
default wider civic society. The Oireachtas passed the legislation, with no member speaking against enfranchisement; there was negligible media attention and virtually no public discourse about the issue. As the discussion was relatively low-key, very few prisoners were aware of the significance of the change in legislation that enfranchised them.   
default&#xa0;
defaultResearch 
defaultin the Republic of Ireland 
defaultindicates that when enfranchised, prisoners remain part of the hard-to-reach groups
default. Even after enfranchisement, prisoners are among the 
defaultgroups 
defaultthat 
defaultwill 
defaultneed extra 
defaultsupports 
defaultto encourage them to participate in the 
defaultdemocratic
default process.
