"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Coalition of Care and support Providers in Scotland1.0 Introduction &#xa0;\n1.1 \nCCPS is the Coalition of Care and support Providers in Scotland. Its membership \n   \ncomprises more than 70 of the most substantial providers of care and support in Scotland’s voluntary sector, supporting approximately \n350\n,000 people and their families, employing around 4\n3\n,000 staff and managing a combined total income of over £1.\n3\nbn, of w\nhich an average of 7\n8\n% per member organisation relates to service provision that is commissioned, purchased or otherwise funded by the public purse. \n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nCCPS members provide services right across the spectrum of care and support, including services for o\nlder people; children\n, young people\n and families; adults with physical and learning disabilities\n, sensory impairment, dementia, acquired brain or spinal injury\n; and people facing a range of challenges in their lives, including mental health problems, addic\ntions and involvement in the criminal justice system.\n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nThe \nHousing Support Enabling \nUnit \n(HSEU) \nworks with providers of housing support across Scotland across the voluntary and private sectors and has done so since 2004. \n&#xa0;\n1.4 \nThe Criminal Justice Volu\nntary Sector Forum (CJVSF) promote\ns\n the role of the voluntary sector within criminal justice and support\ns\n voluntary sector providers working in the field of criminal justice in Scotland to increase the impact of their activities.  \n&#xa0;\n2.0 Summary&#xa0;2.1 \nVulnerable people across Scotland face growing difficulties accessing and sustaining the housing and support they need due to the cumulative impact of welfare reform.  \nProviders of housing and housing support have concerns about the following aspects of we\nlfare reform:\n&#xa0;3.0 The impact of changes to the way housing costs are dealt with under welfare reform                            \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n3.1 \nOne of the changes which has not yet been fully implemented but which is causing some concern is the plan to pay housing costs through a monthly payment directly to the tenant rather than to the landlord.  \nThe\nre have been various\n direct payments demonstrat\nion projects\n across the UK and they\n have highlighted an increase in rent arrears. Arrears across the demonstration \nprojects ranged from 3% to 12%. In Scotland\n, Dun\nedin Canmore has been a \nde\nmonstrator project and \nhas found that ‘\nengagement, advice on budget\ning and financial inclusion will involve markedly more intense housing management resource commitment and staff liaison than has traditionally been the case’\n.\n \nThis could have significant cost implications in terms of housing management at a time when renta\nl income is under increasing pressure.   \nIn addition, we are aware that during this demonstration project a dedicated Citizens Advice Bureau adviser was made available to assist tenants and we are concerned that this level of resource will not be available\n to other registered social landlords on full roll out. \n&#xa0;\n3.4 \nDirect payment\n is\n just one aspect of welfare reform; there are other aspects\n, such as the expectation that claimants will submit benefit applications online\n which will have an impact on the way \nin which \nclaimants obtain assistance \nto meet \nhousing costs\n and will impact on the way local services \nprovide support to do so\n \n.\n \nUnder the Local Support Service Framework\n \n(LSSF) \nvarious groups of people\n, including those with support needs,\n \nmay not be \nexpected to manage direct payments\n and digital access at least\n initially.  Th\nis approach is to be welcomed.  \nWe urge that further detail be provided to set out exactly who will be eligible for this different approach and for how long so as to avoid unnecessary confusion which will serve only to disempower vulnerable claimants further.  This is particularly important for those people using short term supported accommodation and the providers of those services including homeless hostels and womens refuges.\n&#xa0;\n3.5 \nWe \nare aware\n that under th\ne LSSF, local partnerships are to \nbe formed to assess and plan services to help claimants who require support to deal with the \nchanges t\no the welfare system and that these partnerships may involve the voluntary sector. \nWe have already provided some input into the DWP’s plans to use ‘keyworkers’ as a means of providing the assistance that vulnerable claimants will require.  \nWe urge that a distinction between advice work and support work be maintained.  Already we are awar\ne that \nmany housing support services are working with people who face increasingly complex issues around managing money and budgeting and there is \na risk\n that support services are being diverted away from essential work on other \nimportant daily living skil\nls and social skills. \n&#xa0;\n3.6 \nWe \nnote that the statutory issues relating to the claimant commitment \nwill be dealt with separately\n \nfrom the local partnerships set out in\n the LSSF\n. \n We are already aware\n, however,\n \nthat the support the voluntary sector ha\ns been \noffering to claimants can be negatively \nimpact\ned\n up\non by the requirements of the\n DWP’s\n ‘claimant commitment’. \n \nOne of the ways voluntary agencies have tried to help claimants has been to provide access to \ncomputers and the \ninternet. The numbers of people t\nhat have been able to use this facility has \nbeen restricted\n by a requirement in some areas that claimants show they have been using the internet to job search on a full time basis.  \nWe would suggest that statutory agencies (DWP and Work Programme) become involved with local partnerships at an appropriate level to ensure the support services, planned and delivered locally, are available and effective for all those who need them.  \n \n&#xa0;\n3.7 \nIn Scotland the ‘bedroom tax’ has affected 82,500 people\n.  This figure is somewhat lower than initially predicted due in part to the efforts made by social landlords to assist their tenants \nto \nmove if at all possible. The scope for more people to move to smaller properties is\n, however,\n greatly limited by the la\nck of smaller properties.  It is estimated that 20,000 one bedroom properties will become available \nin the social rented sector in Scotland \nover the next year but 60,000 \nof the \npeople affected by the ‘bedroom tax’ would need to move to a \none bedroom proper\nty to avoid the penalty\n plus around 23,000 homeless households require a one bedroom property in a year.  \nIt is evident that the ‘bedroom tax’ has created additional demand for a property type in short supply.  It is of particular concern that disabled peo\nple are being disproportionately affected by this penalty; 80% (63,500) of households in Scotland affected by the ‘bedroom tax’ include an adult with a disability under the \nDisability Discrimination Act.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.8 There \nare 3,200 single-bed households in City \nof Edinburgh Council area currently seeking housing &amp; only approximately 900 tenures available from local authority and registered social landlord allocations.\n \nIn one week in May\n, \n32 one bedroom social rented properties were advertised in Edinburgh, with a\nn average of 121 bids per property through its choice based lettings system.  Of these 32 properties:\n•\n              \n4 were sheltered housing\n•\n              \n4 were amenity properties or had some sort of age restriction (usually 55 and over)\n•\n              \n8 were on the ground floor\nOf the 16 re\nmaining properties there was an average of 149 bids per property.  This highlights the particular challenge that working age single people or couples may face in obtaining one bedroom accommodation.  This could be a particular issue for ex-offenders seekin\ng to find settled accommodation; this is known to be an important factor in reducing the risk of re-offending.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.8 \nDisabled people living in properties which have housing adaptations are not exempt from the penalty and are being forced to make \nvery \ndifficult decisions about whether to look for another home or not.  To gain assistance with the penalty \na disabled person\n can apply to their local authority for a discretionary housing payment\n but there is not entitlement to an award and even if one is mad\ne it will be\n time limited \naward with no future award\n guaranteed.\n  \nWe urge that disabled people whose homes have housing adaptations be exempt from the ‘bedroom tax’.  &#xa0;3.9 \nWe note that children are not expected to share bedrooms with disabled siblings.  \nWe would also urge that couples who cannot share a bedroom because of illness or a disability of one of both parties also be exempt.&#xa0;&#xa0;4.0 Supported Housing&#xa0;4.1 \nSupported housing will be dealt with separately from the Universal Credit system initially \nbut\n a new system will be developed in the future (2014 onwards) and it is likely that the Westminster Government will devolve funding to Scotland for supported housing. \n \nThe future funding of supported housing for those who require assistance to meet housing \ncosts is uncertain.  There is particular concern about the future financial stability of supported housing in respect of:\n     \nunringfenced funding at a local level;\n     \ncurrent cost of supported housing. \n&#xa0;\n4.2 \nIn the meantime some supported housing in Scotland \nappears to be subject to aspects of welfare reform such as the ‘bedroom tax’\n,\n despite the Westminster Government’s stated intention to exempt supported housing from them.  The reason for this lies with the decision to restrict the definition of supported h\nousing to that of Supported Exempt Accommodation\n (SEA).  Unfortunately SEA\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n4.3 \nA joint survey\n undertaken by the HSEU, the Scottish Federation and Housing Associations and Homeless Action Scotland in March 2013 found that many supported housing providers anticipated difficulty in gaining exemptions from aspects of welfare reform\n,\n such as the bedroo\nm tax\n,\n because of the criteria associated with Supported Exempt Accommodation.  The survey found that:\n     \nhousing services would not fall within the definition\nof SEA. This \ncould mean that some vulnerable people in Scotland will not be able to meet housing related costs associated with supported housing. \nsome extent. Supported housing aimed\n \nat\n people with ment\nal health problems; \n      \npeople with \nlearning\n \ndisabilities; people with physical disabilities and homeless\n \nresettlement projects appear most likely not to meet the criteria for\n \nSEA.\n&#xa0;\n4.4 \nThe DWP has acknowledged the need to update the existing definition of Supported Exempt Accommodation and while we welcome this decision we are concerned that \nindications so far suggest that \nlocal authority owned accommodation will not be included in any r\nevision.\n  \n&#xa0;\n4.5 \nAlmost a third of refuge accommodation is owned by local authorities in Scotland and does not qualify as exempt. The majority of local authorities have continued to exempt this \naccommodation from the under occupation charge for this financi\nal year while \nthey await \nthe outcome of the DWP’s \nreview of\n housing benefit and supported accommodation. \nIn \n some area\ns, however,\n there has \nalready \nbe\nen an impact on refuge services, for instance in one area where a refuge has been assessed as not qualifyi\nng as exempt (although this is being challenged) it is now unable to offer a service to women and children unless they would qualify for a 3 bedroom flat under the ‘bedroom tax’ rules.  In other areas \nWomen\n’s Aid services are being advised that the local a\nuthority grant they have come to rely on will be reduced in the next year to offset the costs of covering the current benefit shortfall caused by the ‘bedroom tax’.\n&#xa0;\n4.6 \nRefuge services in Scotland are already unable to meet demand; \na recent \nannual census \nday survey found that 2 out of 3 women were unable to get a refuge space for themselves and their children because of the lack of safe or suitable space.\n  Where women are not able to access refuge for themselves and their children when they need to they ma\ny be at risk of returning to abusive partners or forced to accept unsuitable bed and breakfast accommodation through a local authority which will no longer have access to appropriate temporary self-contained accommodation.\n&#xa0;\n4.7 \nThe ‘bedroom tax’ is already\n limiting the options for people facing homelessness and could impact on the availability of supported accommodation provided through the ‘Housing First’ model which is being piloted in Glasgow by Turning Point.  Under this model\n,\n people facing homelessness avoid using temporary accommodation whilst accessing the support they need.\n  The ‘bedroom tax’ restrict\ns\n available accommodation for single people and couples facing homelessness\n,\n and result in greater demand being placed on te\nmporary accommodation.\n&#xa0;\n4.8 \nWhilst local authorities may decide to prioritise some assistance for supported housing services that do not meet the SEA criteria through the Discretionary Housing Payments (DHP) this can only be regarded as a short term soluti\non given the intense pressure on DHP. \nThis increase in pressure was evidenced by t\nhe\n number of applications for Discretiona\nr\ny Housing Payments \nin\n \nGlasgow City Council, for instance,\n \nwith\n 5,501 applications for DHP in April 2013 compared with just 1,437 in \nApril 2012.\n  \nAlthough\n the Scottish Government has set out plans to increase the amount available for discretionary housing payments in 2013/14 t\nhis is not a long term solution.\n&#xa0;5.0 Severe poverty&#xa0;\n5.1 \nThere is growing evidence that people are being \nforced into greater poverty due to welfare refor\nm.  The Tru\nssell Trust has been highlighting an increasing use of foodbanks\n and Citizens Advice services have reported that increasing numbers of people are coming to them in ‘extreme poverty’.  Whilst the v\noluntary sector is responding to this growing demand it is of great concern that people have to turn to them for help to survive.  Indeed the Stirling Citizen Advice Bureau has recently developed a ‘Survival Guide’ to help people deal with ‘no money, no fo\nod and no power’.\n  \n&#xa0;\n5.2 \nSupport workers are working with an increasing number of people who face benefit sanctions.  This is a particular issue for people required to demonstrate to \nJ\nob \nC\nentre staff that they are looking for work.  There appears to be a \nlack of consistency between job centres about what constitutes suitable evidence. \nYoung care leavers and \nyoung people in transition\n \nare facing major problems with sanctions and conditionality because of the p\narticular challenges they face\n \nand we would urge that their needs are given further consideration in \nl\nine with those set out by the National Care Advisory Service (NCAS)\n.\n \n \nOther people have faced sanctions relating to attendance at medical assessments and have had to wait 8 weeks witho\nut benefit payments until the outcome of their appeal.  In this case a crisis grant was obtained through the Scottish Welfare Fund but was not sufficient to last 8 weeks.\n \nThere is concern that once a sanction\n has been applied (even if it has\n clearly been a\npplied wro\nngly), there is nothing any organisation or authority can do to prompt the DWP or Job C\nentre to \nlift the sanction.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.3 \nPeople \nwho\n do not qualify for an advance benefit payment nor for a payment through the Scottish Welfare Fund are being advised to go to a food bank.  This is particularly difficult in rural areas where people may not have the means to travel the distances involved.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;6.0 Criminal Justice practitioners&#xa0;6.1 \nCriminal justice practitioners have highlighted a number of ways these reforms \na\nre \nimpacting on their service users.  Practitioners report particular concerns that service users \na\nr\ne \nstruggling to meet their day-to-day living costs and many \na\nre \nunable to afford any increase in housing costs arising from the ‘Bedroom Tax’.  At the same time, a lack of \nalternative housing available locally mean\ns\n that the individuals concerned \nd\no\n \nnot have\n the option to move to a smaller property and \na\nre \ntherefore facing rent arrears. \n&#xa0;\n6.2 \nPractitioners also anticipat\ne\n that the ‘Bedroom Tax’ could impact on families that have a family member going to prison.   An individual is eligible for housing benefit \nwhen they are in prison:\nIf an individual is in prison for longer than these periods, then they will not be eligible to claim housing benefit and the ‘Bedroom Tax’ could apply to the family. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n26 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n7\n&#xa0;\n \nWelfare
