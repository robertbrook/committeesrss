defaultData on taxes related to defaultScotlanddefault land transactionsdefault&#xa0;defaultFurther to your letter of 23 October 2013, I am enclosing hyperlinks to HM Revenue &amp; Customs’ published data on each of the three taxes identified by the National Audit Office (NAO), namely Stamp Duty Land Tax, Inheritance Tax and Capital Gains Tax.
default&#xa0;
defaultPublished estimates of Exchequer receipts from 1999-2000 to 2012-13 split between the four countries in the UK for individual taxes including IHT, CGT and SDLT are available on the HMRC website at:

defaultThe data we publish for each tax is slightly different, depending on the tax and below are the relevant links by tax.

default)
default&#xa0;
defaultThe first two publications are based on the date the property transaction was completed, whereas the third is based upon the date HMRC issued an SDLT certificate (i.e. after a correct return was received).
default&#xa0;
defaultInheritance Tax (IHT)defaultOur latest published estimate for the number of estates passing on death in 
defaultScotland
default with IHT liabilities is around 1,000 for 2010-11 deaths. This estimate has been published on the HMRC website at 
defaulthttp://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/inheritance/table12-11.pdf
default. 
defaultAlthough we have not published any regional estimates for the values of IHT reliefs/exemptions, HMRC’s latest UK-wide estimates of some of the main IHT reliefs/exemptions for estates passing on death in 2010-11 are published at 
defaulthttp://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/inheritance/table12-2.pdf
default. This is where the net estate value before reliefs and exemptions are applied is potentially high enough to result in IHT liabilities.
default&#xa0;
defaultCapital Gains Tax (CGT)defaultThe latest published tables for information on individuals and trusts with Capital Gains were published on 31 October at

defaultI hope you and other members of the Committee find this helpful.
