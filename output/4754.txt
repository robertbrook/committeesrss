[[[Additional Issues]]]We agree consideration should be given to better information sharing and MASS has been in discussions with the ABI for over two years to find agreement on what data can be shared with claimant solicitors at an early stage. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;One issue on transparency worthy of consideration is around the starting of new policies. Our understanding is that when a new policy is created through a ‘broker’ (such as gocompare) the insurer has little opportunity to cancel the policy if there are fraudulent aspects, before the expiry of the 14 day cancellation period.  We would suggest that this element needs to be investigated further in order to stop fraud at the instigation of the policy.&#xa0;
