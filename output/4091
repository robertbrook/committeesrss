defaultContractual requirements of ESF through the SFA’s contracts are divorced from local priorities, and don’t adequately reflect specific targeted wards, vulnerable young people or characteristics. Consequently, there is very little local accountability through the current co-financing system
default,
default or evidence of NEET figures reducing over a three year period as a result of SFA commissioned activity.
default&#xa0;
default1.2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommissioners who are far from Birmingham and its NEET young people are awarding contracts to national providers who often have no knowledge or track record of work with NEETS in this city. Major regional contracts are currently with Primes who have no local presence and are often poor at connecting with local NEET populations.default&#xa0;default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal Authorities are under a statutory duty to secure suitable and sufficient places in education or training, for all young people in their area aged 16-19 (and up to age 24 for those with learning difficulties or disabilities).  The current system of ESF co-financing through the SFA does not allow local authorities to discharge these legal duties effectively, as interventions for NEET young people are not specific enough to meet the needs and address the barriers of individuals. 
default&#xa0;default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs the national landscape changes, with regards to a shift from national policy making to localism (ie LEPs/Core Cities), there is a clear role emerging for local authorities to take a strong and influencing lead to drive forward economic development, including the skills system. Driving forward alignment of public sector investment with key strategies and priorities of the LEP/Core City is essential in tackling some of the most stubborn issues related to socio-economic activity…default There must be a dual approach of broadening access to jobs and skills and creadefaultting jobs in the first place.default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is little evidence of a community of good practice being shared across the city, specifically good practice related to employability and skills delivery in the workplace. Providers themselves acknowledge that the huge diverse tapestry of provision in Birmingham is hard to navigate.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.6default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA single organisation should defaultmanagedefault provision from beginning to end and ensure the necessary linkages, but not defaultdeliverdefault all components – specialist organisations are better placed in many cases. There are enough quality organisations locally to deliver these services to young people.default&#xa0;default1.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Local Authority needs to have more influence over what type of provision is commissioned in the City / Region so that specialist providers can advise them on what is required. For example ESF provider has not been able to respond to needs of young offenders; despite raising this issue being raised, it hasn’t been
default possible to influence a change.
default&#xa0;
default1.8default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe tendering, procurement, contracting and contract/performance management should all be done on a local level, led by Local Authorities in conjunctiodefaultn with LEPs.   Given the travel-to-defaultlearn patterns in 14-19 education, a Sub-regional approach (Birmingham and Solihull) would be effective. default&#xa0;
default1.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe underlying economic structures of a given economy and the interplay of the labour market makes public policy particularly challenging when administered at the national level … I would suggest that the local authority has a clear role to play marshalling the strategic levers and linkages bringing employers/providers and other stakeholders together to help resolve some of the most stubborn inequalities in the city. The city could use commissioning as a key strategy that would influence the whole process.
default&#xa0;default1.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThdefaulte supply of post 16 education and skills (and arguably pre-16) has become increasingly market-like over the last 20 years, with a proliferation of different types of providers drawn from the public, private and third sector. Evidence (high NEET rates and youth unemployment) suggests this has led to market failures resulting in many hard to reach groups being excluded from mainstream provision. Further, because providers exercise certain freedoms it is quite possible that working with disadvantaged young people takes second place, as disadvantaged learners could be considered high risk groups in terms of success rates and resource intensive (ie propensity for profit) compared to young people who have already achieved a standard of education ie 5 GCSEs A*-C and have a high probability of completing their programme of study.default&#xa0;
default1.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBirmingham requires a more nuanced system able to deal with the diversity and complexity of need which exists in the city... 
defaultCurrent approaches to developing employment opportunities for young people are hampered by their very ‘universality’: they do not take account of individual circumstances, barriers and psychological aspects affecting behaviour and motivation
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.12default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommissioners need to defaultassessdefault bidders’ understanding of defaultholisticdefault intervention which will address all barriers and improve young people’s confidence, motivation and resilience, rather than focus on mainstream educational ability.

defaultA combination of competition and data-sharing barriers prevent partnership, co-operation and pooling of resources between providers. Addressing this would require issues of double-funding and double-counting to be overcome.default&#xa0;default1.15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDiscounting in tenders leads to ‘race to the bottom’ on unit price, leaving insufficient funding to sub-contractors to deliver quality specialist provision

default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFunding is currently focused on intervention rather than prevention and delivered by providers that ‘parachute’ into the area while there is funding. This means that there is no local legacy from current ESF projects and we go through a cycle of short-term projects that reinforce the status quo. The SFA contracts do not ensure that there is sustainability of the methodolog
defaulties, relationships and systems.
default&#xa0;
default2.2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe current system of ESF co-financing through the SFA, does not allow the funding to be used to promote innovation, particularly for pump-priming new initiatives or for capacity building of the education and training sector. The nature of the providers often means defaultthere is a lack of awareness of what has already been tried locally.default default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCurrent contracts offer no incentives for providers to go the extra mile, either because unit price for each participant is too restrictive, or because the contract holder seeks to maximise income.
default&#xa0;
default2.4default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA great deal of resource and time is spent by those providing social support in bringing together the myriad of agencies who have been involved with the young person for some time in order that they effectively collaborate and communicate together. Where innovative examples of good practice have been developed, an ability to extend the programme is currently hampered by funding structures and requirements which do not ‘fit’ this programme, and a lack of engagement on the part of employers despite our best efforts.default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe often talk about young people 
defaultin deficit terms. 
defaultPerhaps rather than having low aspirations, life has taught many to have low 
defaultexpectations
default, and it is this that guides their behaviour. A successful approach must work with the entirety of the young person’s experience, accept the impact which this has on the most marginalised and seek to equip young people with the skills and resilient self-beliefs to exert control over their lives in order to override the negative effects of risk factors in their family, environment and personal history.
default 
defaultUnless people believe they can produce the desired effects by their actions, they have little incentive to act or persevere in the face of difficulties. Evidence suggests that a more structured system with guaranteed outcomes following successful completion of certain ‘staging posts’ (such as within the German model) give a greater scope for young people to develop a positive sense of self and are empowered to achieve their own successes in the future. A structured approach works well for those young people who wish to follow a professional route (GCSEs – A levels – degree), so why not build in more structure to alternative routes? We need to get better at developing a sense of p
defaultersonal agency and self-belief 
defaultamong whose life experiences have negatively affected their expectations and beliefs. 
defaultA
defaultchieving this for the most vulnerable and marginalised of our youth, who are most likely to be unemployed, and potentially be drawn into other activities which negatively affect them, their families and their communities requires a greater level of investment by highly skilled professionals. We also believe that the swiftest means to develop helpful beliefs and ‘workplace’ skills is achieved through socialisation in the work context and supported by mentoring and social support.

defaultThere is an immediate conflict of purpose with ESF funding arrangements and the needs of NEET young people with exceptional complex needs.  The funding structure of ESF grant is typicallydefault:default Start, On Course and Progression.  Agencies in receipt of defaultfundingdefault are driven by the targets of the required number of ‘learners’ to start the course, sustain attendance and achieve whatever progression is stipulated.  This structure could not be a worse fit for young people with complex needsdefault, especiallydefault young people with behavioural emotional and social difficulties. default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProvision should be targeted at specific wards and neighbourhoods that are NEET ‘hotspots’ and where there is a culture of inter-generational worklessness.

defaultBroader target groups include:default&#xa0;defaultThis approach will require greater use of defaultspecialist providers with a track record. However, it will also be crucial to combine specialist expertise with holistic support. This cohort requires a higher level of investment in time and money, as problems are deep rooted.

defaultFor 16 – 18 (24) year olds, all interventions should be individualised and ‘spot purchasing’ should be used 
defaultas a mechanism to achieve this.
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultData sharing issues do not assist with engaging with and providing effective services to unknown NEETS.

defaultA significant proportion of unknown NEETS are young offenders, who have a statutory obligation to attend the Youth Offending Teams for their Court Order.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProviders need to be responsible for ensuring their focus is on what is best for the young person; the young person is not there to help them achieve their targets. Young people will not be aware of whether they fit the criteria for particular NEET provision. They will not know before starting whether this contracted provision is the best one for them because they won’t be clear on what contracted targets and milestones are, and could get caught out that they don’t know what counts as a ‘progression’. These matters are often not clear for referral staff either, and so they are wary of “trapping” a young person into a provision that is not best for them because of contract requirements.

default&#xa0;
default7.2default default              defaultEU funding should be available to supplement school funding, to ensure that if school breaks down for a young person the right type of alternative can be found up to the school leaving age, working with the young person around next steps and supporting their progression onto to Post 16 options.  This alternative provision, which could be EU funded, would offer a different holistic approach, developing an innovative curriculum to raise aspirations, breed success and re-engage young people successfully; it could include a combination of work experience / taster opportunities with employers to give a better understanding of the work place, alongside more social activity designed to develop confidence, life skills, team work and participation.default&#xa0;

defaultWhen providers win EU bids, they state they have links with major employers, but it is often not evident that these links come to fruition in apprenticeship and job opportunities. When bids are assessed, the employer links should be verified and what likelihood is of job opportunities being offered within the Contract Period. To ensure good quality progression of route ways into employment, could employers themselves bid for ESF funding to enable them to provide the wrap around support needed and employment preparation courses for the vulnerable NEET cohort? If this helps generate employers to offer employment to those from the vulnerable groups, then this would be money well spent because final progression outcome would be committed to in the bid and quality progression into sustainable ETE is assured. Short term funding and constant turnover of Providers winning the ESF Contract would be a stumbling block to good employer engagement.
