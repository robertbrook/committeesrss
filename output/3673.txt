&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Yogesh Raja (CYS0004)Following suggestion will drastically improve safety of cyclists and motor cyclists in Britain.&#xa0;I suggest cyclists should attach beacon flashing lights to their helmets which will make them visible to everyone even in day light the way it does with police cars etc. Such battery or reachable battery operated beacons are available at nominal price in market. This system will motivate cyclists wear their helmets.&#xa0;This idea would also make motorcycle riders safer too by making them visible to everyone even from distance.&#xa0;Would you agree that unless we find a better system we should exploit proposed to make cyclists safer.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
