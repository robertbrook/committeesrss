[[[Written evidence submitted by Karen Human Rights Group]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Karen Human Rights Group ]]]The Karen Human Rights Group (KHRG) is a grassroots Karen-led human rights organisation, established in 1992 and now operating across rural southeastern Burma.&#xa0;With over twenty years of experience, and twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize (2000 and 2001), KHRG is recognised internationally as a leading authority on issues such as forced labour, landmines, internal displacement and conflict in southeastern Burma. KHRG aims to increase villagers’ capability and opportunity to claim their human rights, and ensure that their voices, priorities and perspectives influence decision makers. We encourage other local and international groups and institutions to support villagers’ self-protection strategies through village agency workshops and international-level advocacy. For more information about KHRG, please visit www.khrg.org.&#xa0;

[[[Submission objective ]]]Through this submission, KHRG hopes that DFID members and committees will be more aware of ongoing human rights abuse in Southeastern Burma during the ceasefire period. Additionally, we hope DFID can base its projects around the human rights conditions on the ground as documented by KHRG in Southeastern Burma. &#xa0;

[[[Summary ]]]&#xa0;1. Despite the preliminary ceasefire and the ongoing talks, KHRG has received reports on a range of human rights abuses related to the presence and expansion of Burma’s Armed Forces, the Tatmadaw. At the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013, KHRG researchers reported on four cases of villagers being

[[[ ]]]by the Tatmadaw and Tatmadaw Border Guard Force (BGF). KHRG also documented a case of a villager and his children getting injured as a result of fighting between the BGF and the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA).  KHRG community members have reported that armed group activity in areas of Southeastern Burma is linked with new cases of landmine injuries. A researcher from Moo Township, Nyaunglebin  District submitted four cases of landmine injury from 2013, an area in which both the Tatmadaw and KNLA are active.  &#xa0;2. KHRG researchers have also recently reported on two incidents of killings related to

[[[ ]]]in eastern Burma continues to put civilians' lives and livelihoods at risk and undermines their efforts to protect against other forms of abuse. From January to April 2013, KHRG received 10 documents that raised concerns or dealt with issues related to the use of landmines in eastern Burma, especially landmine causalities (death or injury); related to movement restrictions resulting from landmine risks; new use of landmines by armed forces and groups; and a development-related landmine incident.  One example of the landmine incidents reported in 2013 occurred in February 2013, when a landmine exploded in Hpapun District and five villagers were killed in the explosion, three of which were under the age of 18. Before the explosion, the villagers were transporting sand for a company affiliated with the BGF.&#xa0;4. While KHRG has received less documentation of

[[[ ]]]in our field documentation, KHRG continues to receive sporadic, yet serious, incidents of forced labour. As of September 2013, community members have reported on eight cases forced labour. The reports from 2013 document villagers being forced to transport supplies, build the bridges, serve as messengers, provide thatch shingles and cut bamboo poles for army camps, porter rations to military camps, provide labour for military camp maintenance and conduct agriculturally based forced labor. KHRG has also documented a shift in the way forced labour demands are made. In 2012 and 2013,  KHRG  received fewer  written  order  letter   issued  by  the  Tatmadaw,  and  field researchers note that area commanders have instead switched to issuing their demands for labour and goods orally.&#xa0;5. KHRG’s field information gathered over the last year contain reports on

[[[ ]]]that  have  caused  development-related human rights abuses, such as uncompensated damage to villager farms, contaminated water, loss of jobs, land confiscation and forced displacement. KHRG analysis reveals that development projects are implemented without consulting, compensating, or, often, notifying project affected communities.&#xa0;As has been summarized in this briefing document, KHRG continues to receive reports of human rights abuses during 2013 in Southeastern Burma. KHRG is also deeply concerned about human rights abuses accompanying business and development, specifically around plantation construction, infrastructure and the extractive industries, as such development related abuses comprise a large portion of reports received by researchers in 2013.

Negotiators from the two parties met for a 2nd round of talks beginning on 4th April, see “KNU and the Burmese Government Continued State-level Ceasefire Talks,” Karen National Union, 4th April 2012 and held a 3rd round of negotiations from 3rd-4th September 2012, see “KNU Delegations Departs for the Third Round Negotiation of Ceasefire with the Burmese Government,” Karen National Union, 1st September  2012
