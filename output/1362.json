"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Solid Fuel Association (HOT03)&#xa0;The Solid Fuel Association is the organisation which represents the producers, distributors, retailers and manufacturers of the British domestic solid fuel sector\n including wood fuel\n producers\n. We provide consumer guidance and technical support for installers, other industry professionals and the general public. \nThe SFA also administer the Approved Coal Merchant Scheme in accordance with the requirements of Tradin\ng Standards and in this capacity work very closely with the Coal Merchants Federation.\nWe have recently launched the Approved Woodfuel Merchant Scheme to protect consumers in this rapidly growing sector of the solid fuel industry.\nCoal mining\n itself\n is wor\nth around £1 billion to the UK economy. \nAround \n5\n,000 British people are employed directly in the industry and at least another 20,000 are dependent on the various support industries around coal for their living. Many of this number are in areas that are a\nlready economically disadvantaged.\n&#xa0;SummaryThe SFA \nbelieve\n that the \ntrue value of coal to the UK\n,\n \nincluding\n its potential \ncontribution to the\n domestic sector\n,\n is currently being completely \ndisregarded\n.\nRecent initiatives from government and in particular the Green Deal seem to completely \ndismiss\n the\n benefits of solid fuel heating. There is a dichotomy at the heart of government policy which sets solid fuels\n apart \nfrom other fossil fuels\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe have set out\n below in simple terms what our industry has to offer \nin terms of economy, security and sustainability \nand why coal \nhas \nall \nthe credentials to be a fuel of the future.\n&#xa0;\n1. EconomyIn terms of running costs, s\nolid \nf\nuel \nheating \ncompares very favourably with \nits competitors\n. \nThis is\n of \nparticular\n note\n \nwhen solid fuel is compared \nwith\n the fuels available to consumers who are beyond the \nreach of the \ngas grid.\nAccording to \nrecent \nfigures \ncontained \nwithin the \nSutherland Tables\n \n(\nwww.sutherlandtables.co.uk\n),\n \na switch to \na gravity fed \nanthracite\n burner\n for central heating could yield savings of 17% against \nnatural \ngas, 28% against electricity, 41% against oil or an incredible 57% \nagainst LPG.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe comparison below uses figures obtained from the \nSutherland Tables Comparative Domestic Heating Costs – Jan 2012 \n(\nwww.sutherlandtables.co.uk\n)\nTypical annual running costs for central heating and hot water in an average three bedroomed house in the UK &#xa0;\nSolid Fuel (Anthracite grains)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n£1000Conventional gas boiler\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n              \n£1200\nElectricity Economy 7\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n              \n£1400\nConventional oil boiler\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n              \n£1700\nConventional LPG boiler \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n              \n£2350\n&#xa0;\nThe direct\n comparison \nof \nsolid fuel running costs\n \nagainst those of its competitors\n \nmake\ns\n it all the more incredible \nthat \nno solid fuel measures \nqualify for Green Deal finance. This effectively means that \nunder an initiative \ndesigned in part\n to alleviate fuel poverty, \nsolid fuel customers are not able to up\n-\ngrade their heating without switching fuels. \nI\nt is \nhighly un\nlikely that \na switch away from solid fuel would yield \nany financial savings and it is \neven possible\n that \nsuch a switch would plu\nnge the consumer\n into fuel poverty.\n \nIronically\n, the\n installation of an \nanthracite burner \nor a \nmultifuel stove \nwith boiler \ncould result in\n an\n \nimmediate and \nconsi\nderable improvement for very little capital cost.\n&#xa0;\nThe economic advantage of solid fuel is even more clear-cut \nwhen considering \nsecondary space heating. \nFor a number of years, s\nmokeless solid fuel \nhas\n \nproved\n to be \nthe single most co\nst effective way to heat a room.\n&#xa0;\nTypical annual running costs for space heating in an average sized room&#xa0;\nSmokeless Solid Fuel \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n              \n£220Wood Pellets\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n              \n              \n£290\nEconom\ny 7\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n              \n£290\nGas wall heater\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n              \n£475\nGas radiant convector fire\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n              \n£560\nLPG radiant \nconvector fire\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n              \n£635\n&#xa0;\nIn \naddition\n, the cost of solid mineral fuel has shown a marked stability compared to the volatile fluctuations seen in the prices of \nits\n \ncompetitors\n i\n.\ne\n.\n gas and electricity\n.  Solid fuel costs \nhave risen\n in a steady way \nand \nhave\n stayed consistently lower than the other f\nuels. More\n importantly\n, solid mineral fuel is\n \ndramatically\n less expensive than \nall\n \nother fuels\n in the off-grid sector.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2. Security of supply and sustainabilityThe majority of solid fuel supplied to the domestic market is from indigenous sources. The \nUK \ndomestic \nmarket\n for mineral fuel\n is \nestimated to be \naround 1 million tonnes. \nTotal domestic production of coal is currently \naround\n 17 million tonnes and with a l\nevel playing field and \na \nproper coal \nstrategy in place\n to give more certainty for invest\nors\n, this could easily be increased to over 20 million tonnes. With \nproven \nreserves of \nover 1.5\n billion tonnes\n and potential reserves of over 3.5 billion\n, this level of\n production could be sustained for many years into the future.\nWe believe it is fair to say that \nin the UK and the rest of the world, \nsolid mineral fuel is the most secure of all fossil fuels. \nTh\ne\n \nsecurity\n of solid fuel supplies \ncontrasts starkly with nat\nural gas\n,\n for example\n. During \nperiods of sustained colder weather\n in \nCentral \nEurope,\n history shows that\n \nthe \ngas price rises steeply along with demand from both domestic and power markets. Other factors that \nimpact on \nthe security of \ngas include\n \nt\nerrorism \n(\ng\nas supply lines from \nabroad\n \nand LNG storage terminals in the UK are obvious targets for terrorism\n)\n,\n \ngeo-\np\nolitical impacts (\ns\nupplies \nacross borders\n \nhave been\n interrupted for \narbitrary\n reasons)\n and\n \nt\nemporary shortage \n(d\nuring periods of shortage, domestic su\npplies \nfor \ngas producing countries will take precedence over exports\n)\n all of which \nhave the potential to \nconstrain supplies \nand massively\n increase \nthe gas price\n.\n Moreover, as the gas price is\n also\n inextricably linked to oil, household heating costs are subject to the volatility of world energy prices.\nTh\nis year’s spring \ncold snap saw natural gas reserves plummet to dangerously low levels and the UK become \nwholly\n dependent on shipped supplies from t\nhe \nM\niddle \nE\nast.\n&#xa0;\nFor the individual \ndomestic \nsolid fuel \nconsumer, \nthe \nsecurity of supply \nbenefit of solid fuel \nis further \nenhanced by the fact \nthat \nthey\n \nthemselves \ncan hold stock. This not only insulates against the effect of price increases but it also gives a degree of self-sufficiency that other fuels just cannot match. \nMoreover, a\n solid fuel or multifuel boiler stove does not need electricity to heat  a room or \nproduce domestic hot water\n and b\necause of its high calorific value (about four times that of wood),\n it is likely that\n one full bunker of solid mineral fuel  could sustain a stove through the worst of the winter.\nA roomheater or stove of the type that many \npeople use for secondary heating could easily heat one or more rooms throughout the winter with just one full bunker\n of fuel\n. If the stove was flat-topped, a kettle of hot water would also be available - even during power cuts.\n(A jacket potato cooked in t\nhe ashpit or hot buttered toast could also be on the menu\n with solid fuel\n!)\nIn summary, \nwe believe that \ns\necurity of supply and stability of price are two\n sides of the same coin and that indigenous \nsolid fuel \nis stronger in both \nthese \nareas than its competi\ntors\n.\n&#xa0;\n3. EnvironmentModern coal mining practices are very much \ngeared towards\n protection of the environment. Where coal extraction at a site has ceased, mining companies \nare duty bound to \nrestore the area affected\n. I\nn \nsome\n \nrestoration projects\n, \nreclamation of derelict land means that \nthe appearance and amenity \nof a site is an improvement on what was there before mining commenced\n. \nAs a\n vivid\n illustration of \nthe industry’s commitment to the environment\n, t\nhe \ncoal \nmining \ncompany \n“\nUK Coal\n Ltd\n”\n plants 65,000 trees per year. \nModern coal \nproducers\n take great \npains\n to respect natural environments \nand \nto \naccommodate conservation\n \nas part of the planning requirements of\n their projects.\n&#xa0;\n4. EmissionsMany solid mineral fuels are authorised for use in smoke control areas. This is because they are very low in \nmoisture and \nvolatile organic content (less than 10% \nvolatiles \ncompared to around \n50-\n60% for wood fuel)\n. Smokeless mineral fuels\n \nburn very cleanly \nwith low levels of organic gaseous and particulate emissions. \nWith regard to \ngreenhouse gas \nemissions, \nit is an indisputable fact that when anything burns, carbon dioxide is emitted. However, \nthe SFA believe that an artificial distinction is \nbeing \nmade be\ntween coal and other \ncompeting \nfuels. For instance, woody biomass is assumed to be carbon neutral when in fact this is only partially true even for wood from a sustainable source. \nAny type of fuel requires the input of energy to bring it to the market – me\nchanical harvesting, transport and preparation/processing must be taken into account to arrive at an energy return against\n energy\n invest\ned\n. This is sometimes expressed as an EPR (Energy Performance Ratio). An EPR of less than 1 indicates that more energy h\nas been invested than returned. \nFor timber \nobtained \nfrom non-sustainable sources, the carbon dioxide emissions are at least as great as for coal. For a highly processed \nand imported \nproduct such as wood pellets, the\n CO₂\n emissions \nare likely to\n \nbe greater \nthan for coal.\nIn reality, the total indigenous supply of sustainable wood fuel is \nextremely limited and when added to the growing demand from electricity generators, 80% of wood fuel \nwill be imported in bulk carriers from overseas. In many cases, this imp\norted timber is produced by the clear felling of thousands of acres of virgin forest which is not replanted. This not only has a catastrophic effect on local ecosystems but also means that this material is by no means renewable. Even if trees were replante\nd, it would take many decades or even centuries to re-sequester the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during combustion. This is known as a “carbon debt”. Because biomass emits more carbon dioxide than \nmineral fuel\n per kW of \nheat energy\n generated, emissions\n over any sensible timescale are greater than for coal.\nTo make matters worse, the pellets themselves are a highly processed product requiring high levels of energy input throughout their production and transport.\nWe understand that t\nhe Government’s own an\nalysis shows that the use of whole trees as power station feedstock will increase greenhouse gas emissions by at least 49% compared to coal (Searchinger 2012). \nPower station use is likely to completely eclipse the domestic supply chain and eliminate\n even\n t\nhe \nvery \ndubious environmental benefits of biomass.\nIt should be obvious to all, regardless of political affiliation or views on climate change that measures aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions should not increase them. \nAs far as wood fuel is concerned, the SFA firmly believe that the very limited supplies of indigenous wood fuel would be better burnt \nalongside mineral fuel \non domestic stoves at 70% efficiency rather than in power stations at 30% efficiency.\n&#xa0;\nA \n2012\n report by \nPrincet\non academic Timothy Searchinger entitled “Dirtier than coal?”suggests that emissions from biomass are 49% greater than for coal.\nLocally sourced\n,\n well-seasoned logs will have the \nlowest emissions among biomass products. \nIndeed, a\n multifue\nl stove burning a 50:50 mix of coal and logs from a sustainable \nwoodland \nsource could have a smaller “carbon footprint” than a gas boiler.\nIf we compare coal\n \nto \nnatural gas\n,\n carbon dioxide emissions \nfor gas \nat the point of use are lower than for coal, givi\nng \nit\n a lower \n“\ncarbon intensity\n”\n. However,\n the total \n“\nglobal warming potential\n”\n of gas may be very much greater than \nthis\n figure\n indicates\n due to\n unintentional releases, \nleakage\ns\n from pipelines etc. \nThis is because \nmethane\n (natural gas)\n is considered to have a global \nwarming potential \n23\n times \ngreater than carbon dioxide.\n \nShale gas has been widely touted \nin\n some quarters as a “silver bullet” for energy supplies. Unfortunately, despite the hype, shale gas has one massive problem-the gree\nnhouse gas emissions and environmental damage are likely to be far greater than for coal.\n \nAccording to a recent study (European Commission 1 September 2011), \nthe greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas is greater than that of \nboth \ncoal\n and\n oil.\nLosses of \nmethane occur during the development of the wells, the extraction process and during the transport, storage and distribution of the gas.\nOverall, the life cycle estimated losses of methane emissions from a typical shale gas well amount to 3.6 to 7.9 per ce\nnt of the total amount of gas produced by the well. This compares with methane losses of 1.7 to 6 per cent of total gas production from conventional wells.\nAs we have already seen, accepted \nclimate\n theory has it that methane\n’s\n global warming potential \nis \n2\n3 times as great as carbon dioxide. Therefore, the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas production-primarily due to these uncontrollable methane emissions- could be up to twice the footprint for coal (data based on a European Commission report 1 September\n 2011).\nOther drawbacks for shale gas include the risk of groundwater contamination by the fracturing fluids, risk of earthquakes beneath residential areas and also the sheer number of wells that would be necessary to maintain \na reasonable level of \nproduct\nion \nbecause of the short-lived l\nifespan of each individual well. T\nhis could be as many as 10,000 wells across the UK\n (estimated by \nBloomberg New Energy Finance\n)\n. \nIn summary, if climate change theory is accepted, the substitution of gas for coal as an energy source results in increased rather than decreased global warming.\nIf the security of natural gas supplies depends on the rapid development of a UK shale gas ind\nustry, then even the very dubious\n \nenvironmental advantage of conventional gas over coal is completely lost. \nOne could easily argue that if global warming can be safely ignored in the case of shale gas, why not in the case of coal?\nMoreover, if we are able\n to ignore risks from global warming, why try to reduce coal’s contribution to the UK energy\n and heating\n mix in the first place?\nThe SFA fully supports \nthe drive\n to exploit new sources of fossil fuels. However, it needs to be emphasized strongly that repla\ncement of coal with shale gas has no environmental justification.\n&#xa0;\n5. Growth in the solid fuel marketThe appeal of a real fire has n\never\n diminished\n and w\ne believe that \nno other heating system can match the “wow” factor of a real fire or the cosy sense of \ncomfort and well-being that an open fire or stove lends to a home. To many people, the cosy glow and flickering flames are part of what makes a house into a home.\nThe current fashion for\n open fires and\n \nwood burning\n stoves\n has resulted in a\n corresponding\n ri\ns\ne in\n demand for mineral fuel as most “wood burners” should more correctly be called multi-fuel\n stoves\n. \nIt is fortunate for the reputation of the stove industry that mineral fuel is still widely available. A\n rapidly expanding wood market \nwhich\n exceed\ned\n supply\n would lead to shortage and result in stoves being abandoned as a \nreliable\n source of heat or lead to the burning of poor quality wood \nfuel \nwith dangerously high levels of moisture. \nMineral fuels are\n to a large extent\n facilitating the sustainable gro\nwth of a domestic wood fuel market. \nThe distribution system for coal is very well established and well regulated under the Approved Coal Merchant Scheme. \nAfter many years of decline, t\nhe number of \napproved \ncoal merchants in the UK has stabilised and we ar\ne \nnow \nseeing \nmany \nnew entrants \ncoming into the industry\n. \nMany c\nonsumers\n who start off burning wood, later switch to mineral fuel or a mixture of the two \nfuels \nbecause they recognise the benefits of mineral fuel in terms of comfort, convenience and cost. \nThe \ncontinuing popularity of solid mineral fuel is amply illustrated by the fact that the \nApproved Coal Merchant Scheme is now welcoming applicants \nwho started out as \nlog \nmerchants\n but have identified \nthe\n growing market for coal\n.\n \nAs well as our commitment\n to coal, t\nhe SFA is committed to increasing the \navailability\n of good quality wood fuel on the market\n \nthrough our\n “Approved Woodfuel Merchant Scheme”. This runs alongside the coal merchant scheme and promotes good practice and quality fuel by adherence to \na strict voluntary code of conduct.\n&#xa0;6. ConclusionThe \nUK \ncoal industry \nstabilised\n \nat the end of the last decade \nafter many years of decline and given the right conditions \nthere \nis\n potential for growth. \nD\nomestic \nsolid\n \nfuels\n are of excellent quality and\n are \ngradually \ngaining in popularity as consumers seeking a less expensive, more secure \nand \nmore \nself-sufficient \nmethod of heating become aware of \nthe \nadvantages\n of \nsolid\n fuels\n.\nThe only barriers to growth for solid fuel are the artificial constraints imposed by \ngovernment.\n \nThese are now hurting the industry and the lack of certainty is discouraging much-needed financial investment for the future.\nWe believe that the current appro\nach is \ncompletely \nflawed.\nS\nolid fuel \nheating \ncurrently accounts for \nan estimated\n 2% of the \ntotal market in the UK. Using the government’s own figures, a\n \nswitch from solid fuel to LPG\n \ncould\n reduce carbon emissions \nfor a heating system \nby \na \nmaximum\n of around\n 19%\n. \nUnfortunately,\n \nany\n consumer making this switch will \nalso \nsee their heating bill double\n and be placed at the mercy of the international oil price. \nTo put things into their proper pers\np\nective, total domestic heating emissions from all fuels in the UK only amount to around 0.2% (1/500th) of the World’s anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions (based on International Energy Agency estimates and assuming domestic \nheating at 15% of total UK em\nissions)\n. Even if solid fuel was completely eliminated\n from the \ndomestic \nmarket\n, the carbon saved would be a few \nhundredths\n of a per\n \ncent\n \nat most.\nThe \ndomestic \nsolid fuel industry is looking for a level playing field so that we can sustain and increase the\n market for our product based on its advantages and benefits. \nWe urg\ne\n the \nG\novernment to put the comfort, safety, security and prosperity of British people \nfirst\n by \nacknowledging the importance of\n the British coal industry\n.\n                       \n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n                                                                            \n&#xa0;\n"
