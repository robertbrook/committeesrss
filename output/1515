[normal]Written evidence submitted by Oil &amp; Gas UK (HOT06)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]Oil &amp; Gas UK 
[normal]is the principal trade association for the offshore oil and gas 
[normal]exploration and production 
[normal]industry in the United Kingdom, with 
[normal]more than 370 
[normal]member companies, comprising oil and gas operators and investors and a broad spectrum of the supply chain: contractors, suppliers, law firms and consultants
[normal].  We 
[normal]ha
[normal]ve
[normal] pleasure in submitting our evidence to the Energy and Climate Change Committee’s inquiry 
[normal]into heat.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the public debate about energy during recent years, there has been a lot of emphasis on electricity, but little about heat (or transport).  In overall terms, only about 35% of the primary energy consumed in the UK is used as electricity; the
[normal] remaining 65% has two main forms of consumption, namely heat, where gas is the principal source, and transport, where oil is dominant.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While industrial heat demand is reasonably constant, domestic demand is highly seasonal, being almost entirely temperat
[normal]ure dependent.  The 
[normal]variation
[normal] between summer and winter demand is large and, because gas provides 80% of domestic properties (and a large proportion of smaller commercial premises) with heat, the demand for gas varies widely as the seasons change.  However
[normal], gas is well suited to this; it is much more flexible than electricity which has to be balanced instantaneously, whereas gas does not – it is normally balanced over a 24 hour period.
[normal]              
[normal]Terms of Reference[bold]There are others who are better placed than Oil &amp; 
[normal]Gas UK to answer the Committee’s 12 questions and so we are taking the opportunity to make some broader points relevant to this inquiry, but also answering the specific question about the relative merits of using gas in space heating.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]General Points Relat[bold]ing to the Inquiry[bold]The following 
[normal]general 
[normal]points provide 
[normal]some context for
[normal] the specific
[normal] questions
[normal] of the Committee’s inquiry:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Speci[bold]fic Question Regarding the Use of Gas in Space Heating[bold]Q.6:
[normal]              
[normal]“What are the relative merits of using gas to directly pro
[normal]vide space heating compared with
[normal] central electricity production plus domestic heat pumps?”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are 
[normal]a number of
[normal] advantages of using gas directly
[normal] to provide space heating
[normal]:
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Gas is a primary source of energy and so
[normal], in converting gas to heat,
[normal] there are no
[normal]ne of the 
[normal]losses 
[normal]associated with 
[normal]converting it to a secondary source
[normal] of energy
[normal], such as happens when a primary sour
[normal]ce is converted into electricity
[normal] before
[normal] the resulting electricity is turned into heat
[normal].
[normal]  The best 
[normal](i.e. super-critical) 
[normal]coal fired power stations achieve about 45% thermal efficiency and the best gas fired ones about 58%, so there are s
[normal]ignificant
[normal] losses inv
[normal]olved
[normal] in generating electricity
[normal].
[normal]  The best coal fired power station in 
[normal]this country
[normal], Drax, is not super-critical and only achieves 38% thermal efficiency.
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The existing 
[normal]national 
[normal]gas transmission system 
[normal](NTS) 
[normal]probably
[normal] has the necessary 
[normal]overall 
[normal]capacity for m
[normal]ost 
[normal]future 
[normal]requirements
[normal], but will no doubt require some investment to take account of changing patterns of supply and demand
[normal].  
[normal]The NTS
[normal] has also proved to be very flexible in its operation during testing conditions in the past five winters.  By contrast, th
[normal]e electricity grid is going to need substantial investment 
[normal]because its capacity will have to be enlarged in 
[normal]a more electrified 
[normal]future.
[normal]  This will be expensive.
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Furthermore, as mentioned above, gas does not need to be balanced instantaneously (which electri
[normal]city does) and gas can be stored at scale (
[normal]which 
[normal]electricity cannot).  Indeed, the NTS itself acts as a short term store of gas by virtue of “linepack”, i.e. the ability to compress the gas in the system
[normal] 
[normal]during the night
[normal], when demand is lower,
[normal] and use such
[normal] extra gas during the day, as required.  This is impossible with electricity.  A
[normal]s a means of delivering energy to users, gas is much more flex
[normal]ible than electricity
[normal].
[normal]iv)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The conversion of gas directly into heat is highly efficient (c. 90%) where modern applianc
[normal]es 
[normal]are
[normal] used.
[normal]  This is better than 
[normal]modern 
[normal]combined heat and power plants 
[normal]gene
[normal]rally achieve (c. 80%).
[normal]v)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Gas heati
[normal]ng
[normal] gives households and smaller commercial premises complete control over heat
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]their
[normal] building
[normal]s
[normal].  District 
[normal]or similar 
[normal]heating systems, however good, do not 
[normal]generally 
[normal]provide the same degree of local control.
[normal]vi)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Gas heating is 
[normal]better 
[normal]than a heat pump
[normal] with 
[normal]thermally inefficient buildings, 
[normal]such as are common in the UK
[normal].  The incoming heat is at a lower temperature with a heat pu
[normal]mp than 
[normal]is delivered by
[normal] a gas boiler
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]H
[normal]eat pumps 
[normal]operate
[normal] best 
[normal]at constant load, 
[normal]with well insulated buildings
[normal],
[normal] and are not 
[normal]well 
[normal]suited to poorly insulated ones
[normal].
[normal]vii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The r
[normal]etrofitting 
[normal]of 
[normal]heat pumps to existing properties means that they will mostly be of the ai
[normal]r source type.  Although ground source heat pumps are more efficient than air source, they are more costly and, obviously, require land adjacent to a building which is not generall
[normal]y available in towns and cities, where the majority of people live.
[normal]viii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In cold 
[normal]weather, air source heat pumps operate at reduced efficiency and require “topping up” by electricity in order to maintain their heating effect which, therefore, places an additional load on electricity supplies at time
[normal]s
[normal] of highest demand.  National Grid fo
[normal]resees electricity demand for heating rising rapidly from 2035 in its 
[normal]Future Energy Scenarios
[normal], especially if its “Gone Green” scenario applies
[normal], but less so in the case of “Slow Progression”.
[normal]ix)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Gas fired power stations are going to be required 
[normal]in considerable
[normal] numbers
[normal] over the next 15-20 years in order to
[normal]But, it 
[normal]would 
[normal]make no sense to convert gas into electricity at a power station and then 
[normal]to convert the electricity generated into heat within buildings
[normal],
[normal] in order to satisfy demand during cold
[normal]er
[normal] weather.  This is inherently less efficient than converting gas directly into heat within buildings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Therefore, given the nature of the building stoc
[normal]k of this country, the high penetration of gas in supplying space heating and the current programme of conversion to high efficiency boilers, it seems inevitable that gas will continue to have a major role in heating until at least 2030.
