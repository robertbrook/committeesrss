"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence by National Parks England &#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;\n1. \n              \nNational Parks England (NPE) brings together the ten National Park Authorities across the country that work with farmers to ensure a high quality environment and produce.  We welcome the Efra Select Committee inquiry and have been active participants in workshops and groups that Defra have convened on CAP reform.  Our evidence is based on \nour understanding of the proposals at the current time.\n  We expect a consultation from Government soon.\n&#xa0;\n2. \n              \nTraditional farming systems have created the National Park landscapes that millions cherish and enjoy; it is essential that the next Rural Development Programme provides practical support to sustain those farming systems and the public benefits they generate.\n&#xa0;\n3. \n              \nWe support maximum voluntary modulation from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 with the specific aim of ensuring maximum funding to support delivery of public benefits in our most important landscapes.\n&#xa0;\n4. \n              \nAccepting that there will be less money in the next Rural Development Programme \nNPE is\n concerned to ensure that the key role of protected landscapes is recognised in the targeting of the new environmental land management schemes and funding for competitiveness and wider rural development. Targeting should be on the basis of maximising delivery of environmental outcomes.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nWe would like to see more detail on how the Government proposes to honour the commitment in \nthe\n coalition agreement \n(and referred again by the Secretary of State in a recent conference) \nto introduce a system of extra support for hill farmers.  The proposal to ‘move money up the hill’ is to be welcomed if there is no net reduction in the farm business income for hill farmers. \n&#xa0;\n6.  \n              \nIt is important \nthat \nthe next set of agri-environment schemes are focused on delivering multiple environmental benefits\n;\n with options that allow for delivery of landscape, biodiversity, carbon and water management, \npeatland restoration, \nhistoric environment, access and education objectives\n;\n whilst also facilitating the production of high quality food through sustainable farming systems. \n \nWe would also like to see a move towards outcome based agreements with less focus on what some have described as ‘management by prescription’.\n&#xa0;\n7.\n              \nWhilst \nNPE \nsupport\ns\n the aim of digital delivery or ‘digital by default’ it is important that there are other options \navailable \nas broadband connection speeds vary across rural areas and there is a risk that this aim could increase costs for farm businesses by forcing them to use agents.\n&#xa0;\n8. \n              \nWe would like to see greater integration across the six priorities of the Rural Development regulation and believe that National Park Authorities are well placed to work with local partners as delivery agents for such an approach – perhaps by delivering a single pot approach to rural development.\n&#xa0;\n9. \n              \nIt is important that conservation bodies /organisations/land owners\n who are actively managing land for conservation benefit \nare recognised as active farmers\n.\n&#xa0;\n10. \n              \nWe have potential concerns about the implications of increasing the minimum holding size for direct payments as this could have a particular impact in National Parks where there are a lot of smaller holdings\n.\n&#xa0;\n11. \n              \nWe support the basic greening measures with a certification scheme \nin order that \nkey additional options can be included.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDetailed response from National Parks England&#xa0;Fairness&#xa0;Whether the UK’s implementation of CAP might put English farmers at a competitive disadvantage? &#xa0;General \n&#xa0;\n12. \n              \nNPE \nwould like to see as level playing field as possible across Europe with minimum changes so that the farming industry finds the transition as straight forward as possible\n.  Generally we would support an \napproach to implementation\n that \nwork\ns \nwith the industry\n, that \nensur\nes\n there are no surprises\n,\n and that the new schemes are interrelated \nand \njoined up.\n  In order to achieve a wider range of public benefits without distorting the market, we believe it is also important to avoid coupled payments being introduced across Member States.  Were this to happen it would represent a significant change away from the direction of travel over the last seven years within the UK.\n&#xa0;\n13.\n              \nIn terms of \nCAP delivery arrangements\n – improved connectivity in protected landscapes will be vital if a single on\n-\nline process is to work from 2015.  Provision for agents and some form of support if farmers and land managers cannot use \nan \nonline interface \n(because of poor broadband provision) \nwill be essential.  \nNPE would welcome greater clarity from Government on \nwhat the proposed assisted digital service will involve\n.  Will this, for example, \njust \nbe \na helpline or\n include\n one to one support?\n&#xa0;\n14. \n              \nThe Defra (Aug 2013): \nCAP Reform in England Status report on Direct Payments\n \nsets out the Government’s current view on Severely Disadvantaged Areas.  This states, \n‘Ministers’ initial view is that hill farming plays a crucial role in maintaining the social, environmental and economic fabric of\n the \nuplands. It also has the potential to deliver ecosystems services. For these reasons, hill farming should be compensated by some movement of basic payments ‘uphill’ from the lowland region to the SDA and moorland regions’\n (para 6.2-6.3)\n.\n  National Parks England strongly agrees t\nhat the \n3 current English regions (non S\nDA, SDA\n non moorland\n &amp; SDA \nm\noorland) should be kept and that the payments for SDA \nnon\n moorland should be increased in order to recognise these areas of natural constraint and the social and public goods which these areas deliver\n.  This is also necessary to\n ensure that the loss of UELS is not detrimental to the sustainability of upland farms.\n&#xa0;\nDirect Payments System\n&#xa0;\n15. \n              \nOverall, we welcome the fact that \ncross compliance applies to all land whether payments are claimed or not.\n  NPE is concerned to ensure that further thought is given to the potentially detrimental impact on National Park landscapes from the proposal to exclude holdings of less than 5ha from direct payments.  Annex I to our evidence provides \ninformation on the size of land holdings within National Parks.  This illustrates that \n40% of \nholdings within National Parks are less than \n5 ha.  Defra’s assessment of the area of land \nthat\n would be removed from cross compliance in England is 1%\n.  I\nt would be helpful if Defra could assess the \npercentage\n for the English N\national Parks \nby comparison.\n  One example of potential \ndetrimental impact is the P\neak District National Park’s \nSouth West Peak.  This area consists of numerous small part time holdings which in themselves may not be significant but collectively give the area its character and provide opportunities to engage farmers and land managers to address the decline in wader populations at a landscape scale.\n \n We recognise that Defra is looking at this issue and look forward to further information becoming available on the potential impact\n&#xa0;\n16. \n              \nThere are a variety of ways in which this potential problem could be addressed.  For example, the minimum area could be kept \n1 ha \nwith \nadditional payments for the 1\nst\n x ha of land claimed on.\n  This would seem preferable and a less \nbureaucratic way of supporting small farmers\n, \nwho are not able to gain the benefits of economies of scale\n \nparticularly in the uplands\n.  An alternative would be to consider a small farmer scheme.  We understand Ministers are not minded to adopt such a scheme, and whilst we recognise that many feel this to be a complex mechanism for supporting farmers on smaller holdings, we would not wish to see this removed as an option until the full impact of any changes on the minimum claim area and associated cross compliance can be fully assessed.  A third \nalternative would be to rely on voluntary measures which would require more facilitation.\n  Whichever option is chosen, the intent should be to develop a \ncomprehensive approach \nthat \ndeliver\ns\n a consistent interconnected and interrelated landscape scale approach.\n&#xa0;\n17. \n              \nNPE supports in principle the proposal \nto reduce the number of \ncross\n compliance requirements\n.  For the Statutory M\nanagement Requirements (SMRs)\n this is from \n16 down to 13\n.  For the \nGood Agricultural &amp; Environmental Conditions (GAEC) \nthe reduction is from \n16 down to 7.\n  We support such a reduction where the requirements are already set out in legislation elsewhere as these do not represent a good use of public money.  However, it is important that the existing legislation works and is being properly applied before cross compliance requirements are removed.  We would hope that NPE and other organisations with an interest in conservation and land management be consulted prior to changes in the requirements to properly test this and ensure no loss in environmental protection and public access.  Examples where such specialist knowledge is important are the need to consult NPAs over the historic importance of dry stone walls before removal; and to retain access to CROW land in the revised guidance. \n&#xa0;\n \nN\new Environmental Land Management Service (NELMS)\n&#xa0;18. \n              \nNPE believes that f\nuture targeting of the new scheme will need to reflect the importance of protected landscapes\n.  These are recognised as areas of high environmental importance and \ndeliver public goods and \nhave been able to \ndemonstrate value for money.\n&#xa0;What steps Government might take in implementing CAP to help tenant farmers, farmers in upland areas, and to take account of issues pertaining to common land &#xa0;19.\n              \nNPE recognises that there is likely to be limited funding, and yet our expectations as a society of what agri environment schemes should deliver are increasing.  This means ever greater targeting will be essential.  This should be on the basis of value of money in providing public benefits.  We note and welcome the comments of the Secretary of State when addressing the Association of National Park Authorities Conference in September 2013. \n&#xa0;\n“We recognise that the uplands face particular challenges and that there is a specific role for taxpayers’ money in compensating farmers for the work they do in enhancing the environment and providing public goods for which there is no market mechanism.  I have asked my officials to look at how we might ensure that hill farmers are able to be more economically secure, continue to contribute to food production and remain custodians of our valuable uplands.”\n&#xa0;\nRt Hon Owen Paterson MP, Secretary of State \nspeech\n to\nthe\n Association of National Park Authorities Conference, 25 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n20.\n              \nWe look below at the direct payments system, the new environmental land management service, and the specific issues for those with large areas of common land.    \n&#xa0;\nDirect Payments System\n&#xa0;\n21.\n              \nNPE supports \nkeeping the \nthree\n current regions (non SDA, SDA\n non moorland &amp;\n SDA moorland) and ensuring that more funds go to the uplands to help support the social, environmental &amp; economic fabric of the uplands so that they can continue to deliver ecosystem services.  \n&#xa0;\n22.\n              \nWe are aware that with the Upland Entry Level Scheme (UELS) ceasing, and the NELMS under huge pressure, there is a danger that upland farming incomes could be reduced.  Farmers can receive £62/ha under UELS, but in future \nmight \nreceive \nonly an additional \n£40/ha for SDA non moorland, which would result in a net decrease in payments of £22/ha.  Smaller farms operating in marginal agricultural areas are more reliant on the support provided by such schemes.  The National Parks want to see sustainable upland farming that delivers a range of public benefits.  Yet, we are concerned that current changes could lead to a reduction in incomes for upland farmers.  As there is an underlying assumption that reductions in SPS and UELS cannot be offset by increased agricultural production, the detrimental impact on the sustainability of upland farms could be significant.  We would ask the Committee to consider this point and invite Defra to carry out further modelling of the likely impacts of the proposed changes. \n&#xa0;\n2\n3\n.\n              \nWe believe that the\n \nMinimum claim size \nrules could impact on farming in many of our National Parks.  W\nhilst increasing from 1 ha to 5 ha looks attractive there is a growing issue with the number of holdings of less than 5 ha\n,\n particularly when holdings are lotted up and sold on the open market\n.  A\nbout 8% of each NP is made up of holdings in this category\n (see Annex I).\n  So this proposal could have unexpected negative consequences in N\national Parks and we have asked \nDefra for a further breakdown of statistics so that any potential risk for N\national Parks \ncan be better assessed.\n&#xa0;\n24. \n              \nNPE s\nupport\ns\n making extra payments for the 1\nst\n x ha of claim which will support those small farmers in the uplands.  In principle\n, we also \nsupport the progressive reductions on claims over a threshold of 150,000 euros. However it would be helpful if Defra could carry out further modelling of the potential impact o\nf this on National Parks.\n&#xa0;\n2\n5\n.\n              \nThe implementation of Areas of Natural Constraint will be delayed until 2018.  We recognise that the need for mapping comes at a time of particular pressure for agencies in bringing forward the reforms for a new CAP and so understand the need for a delay.  However, it will be important to reserve consideration for additional top-up \npayments for ANCs if other reforms do not go far enough in terms of supporting the uplands\n.\n&#xa0;\n2\n6\n. \n              \nNPE supports maximum voluntary modulation from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 with the specific aim of ensuring maximum funding to support delivery of public benefits in our most important landscapes.\n&#xa0;\nNELMS\n&#xa0;\n2\n7\n.\n              \nThere are a number of detailed issues or changes in NELMs that have the potential to have a significant impact on upland farming within National Parks.  These are set out below.\n&#xa0;\n28. \n              \nObjectives – \nThere is concern that the current NELMs is likely to be too restricted in its focus towards \nbiodiversity and WFD (Water Framework Directive) \nobjectives.  National Parks see NELMs as a key delivery vehicle for biodiversity and water policy objectives.  However, we believe n\new scheme(s) should take a whole ecosystem services approach (as advocated in \nthe Government’s Natural Environment White Paper\n) and then set priorities around value for money (i.e. \nat its simplest, the \nmore pub\nlic goods the greater the value\n).\n  NELMs o\nptions \nneed to\n allow for delivery of landscape, biodiversity, carbon and water management, \npeatland restoration, \nhistoric environment, access and education objectives. \n \nWe would also like to see a move towards outcome based agreements with less focus on what some have described as ‘management by prescription’.\n&#xa0;\n29. \n              \nTargeting – limited money means \neffective targeting is essential.  This exercise should be undertaken on the basis of \nvalue for money in providing public benefits. \n \nN\national Park Management Plans (and their equivalents in AONBs) \noffer an existing locally agreed prioritisation at a \nl\nandscape scale.\n&#xa0;\n30. \n              \nFacilitation – an important ingredient to maximize \nvalue for money and help with joined up delivery is facilitation.  Facilitation means the debate is not \njust about agri-environment but also farm competitiveness\n,\n and from there to \nm\nake link\ns\n to wider rural \ndevelo\npment.\n&#xa0;\n31. \n              \nLength of agreement – Entry level agreements currently last for five years, and higher level stewardship agreements for ten years with the option of a five year break clause.  We understand the proposal is to move towards a five year set of agreements.  The fact that an agreement was for ten years was a significant positive selling point for farmers.  It gave them security to plan (and ride out short term market variations); to diversify, and has been essential for changes in management (eg. from commercial to traditional breeds, to restore salt marshes and blanket bog) which are major business decisions and take longer to achieve.  NPE believes agreements of longer than five years are important for the top and middle tier payments and should continue to be supported, albeit with the option of a five year break clause.  \n&#xa0;\n3\n2\n. \n              \nEngagement with farmers – it is important to engage farmers \nat the outset to get full buy in to \nagreed priority objectives.  This needs to be behind the ethos of the scheme and its delivery.\n&#xa0;\n33.\n              \nUELS has supported farmers in upland areas and has demonstrated the value of effectively ring fencing funds for the uplands.  If there is no separate uplands scheme \nin future \nthere is concern about the real impact \nthis will have \non upland farm net incomes \n(see paragraph 22)\n.\n&#xa0;\nCommon Land\n&#xa0;\n34. \n              \nFor some National Parks, ensuring the system works effectively for commons is critical.  The New Forest National Park, for example, now has a commons scheme which \nworks and is understood by both claimants and the RPA.  \nWe believe \nthe existing basis of allocation of entitlements for commons should be retained and carried forward into the direct payment scheme (DPS).  To facilitate this, we believe it will be important to update the commons registers, or implement the Commons Act 2006 to ensure accurate distribution of payments. \n&#xa0;\nBureaucracy&#xa0;What steps does the Government need to take to ensure the reformed CAP is less bureaucratic? &#xa0;35. \n              \nWe believe that there would be considerable benefits from having one IT platform.  Furthermore, thought needs to be given to how to avoid \noverlap between agencies and organisations operating across measures in the RDP.\n  \nLinked to this, business process, IT systems and information sharing needs to be common across all delivery organisations and agencies.\n \n&#xa0;\n36. \n              \nWe\n welcome and \nsupport the Government\n’\ns approach to \nCAP reform that has involved \nconsultation at an early stage\n.  This helps establish \ncommon ground, \nenables a \nno surprises \napproach to be adopted \nand \nincreases the opportunities for \nshared solutions\n.\n&#xa0;\nHow might minimum activity best be defined – for qualification of an active farmer?&#xa0;37. \n              \nOverall, NPE \nsupport\ns\n keeping th\ne qualifying criteria \nas minimal and simple as possible.\n  We support the Government’s current approach to the definition of the active farmer test – as set out in Defra (August 2013): \nCAP Reform in England: Status report on Direct Payments\n (paragraphs 7.21-7.23).\n&#xa0;\n38. \n              \nWe would, however, draw the Committee’s attention to the need to ensure \nthat land managing conservation \no\nrganisations/\n bodies and \nland owners who actively manage land for conservation benefit \nare included within the active farmer definition.  Such bodies would include National Park Authorities, the National Trust, Wildlife Trusts, \nWater Companies, RSPB, Local Authorities &amp; some large \nPrivate \nEstates\n.  \nConservation organisations now own a substantial proportion of National Parks\n,\n for example 31% in the Peak District National Park.  Whilst some of this land is tenanted\n,\n significant areas are managed in hand and deliver significant environmental benefits.\n&#xa0;\n39.\n              \nThe Government has the opportunity to define “the minimum level of activity” so that it does not exclude \nconservation \no\nrganisations/\n bodies and \nland owners who actively manage land for conservation benefi\nt.  For example management of moorland to achieve favourable condition for a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) may involve a period of no cattle or sheep \ngrazing,\n drain blocking and minimal management of birch or scrub.  The land may still be grazed by a population of wild deer.  Conventional agricultural livestock could be reintroduced at a later stage once favourable condition has been achieved.\n&#xa0;\n40.\n              \nDefra already seems minded to keep the negative list to a minimum and NPE would support this approach.  There are concerns about the possible definition of “Waterworks” and “Real Estate Services” so that traditional landowners who may be providing private water supplies or renting out property are not included in the negative list.\n&#xa0;\nGreening&#xa0;How should the Government ensure CAP delivers the best environmental benefits while supporting food production?&#xa0;41. \n              \nThe\n CAP is an essential mechanism for delivering a range of public policy objectives, not least \nBiodiversity 2020\n; the \nVision for National Parks\n; and our response to climate change.  There are a number of ways in which Government could ensure maximum environmental benefit is achieved.  These include:  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLessons learnt&#xa0;What lessons are there from previous implementation of CAP?&#xa0;42. \n              \nThe National Parks across the UK have had considerable experience in working with farmers, through established relationships, on the provision of public benefits from public funds.  Indeed, the Environmentally Sensitive Area scheme was born in the Norfolk Broads, whilst\n National Park Authorities have been behind many innovative projects (available on request) to further economic, social and environmental outcomes.  The first purpose of National Parks expressly relates to conservation; whilst the duty on NPAs and their culture means they fully recognise the need to work alongside the farming community to deliver long term benefits.  From this experience, we believe a number of lessons can usefully be learnt.  These include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\nAnnex I - National Parks England - assessment of impact of CAP Reform August 2013* &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPeak DistrictNorthum berlandLake DistrictN York MoorsYorkshire DalesThe BroadsExmoorNew ForestDartmoorSouth DownsNumber of holdings by total area size groups from 2009 Defra figures (All holdings)number of holdings&lt;5ha\n            1,070 \n                67 \n                813 \n             602 \n                497 \n             179 \n             426 \n             595 \n             890 \n                  56 \n5 &lt;20ha\n                543 \n                27 \n                284 \n             315 \n                156 \n                82 \n             199 \n             241 \n             381 \n                261 \n20 &lt;
