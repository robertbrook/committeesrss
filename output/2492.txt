[[[nd Registered Social Landlords):]]]In terms of private sector landlords, as Local Housing Allowance (LHA) has been in place for several years the issue of direct payment is relatively well established – although there are still instances of tenants not paying their Housing Benefit (HB) over to their landlords.  Local authorities are experienced in, and have the local knowledge to make ‘vulnerability’ decisions relating to direct payment and have done this successfully for a number of years.  Customers being paid Universal Credit (UC) monthly in arrears will cause an issue to many claimants in the first instance and support and financial advice would need to be provided to assist, in particularly, vulnerable individuals and groups.  Similar issues will apply for RSLs, although the added factor of direct payment would be new, and would cause issues for RSLs in terms of increased rent arrears, recovery costs and potential for increased evictions due to non-payment of rent.In all cases, local authorities would be well placed and have the skills and local knowledge to provide the support needed.

[[[laimants, particularly those in vulnerable groups (such as people with disabilities and families with children)]]]

[[[, and those in supported and temporary accommodation.]]]Over many years local authorities have established well run working relationships with local housing providers and vulnerable groups.  Named contacts in HB offices assist to make these run effectively.  These relationships are vital to ensure that customers receive the information, help and support they need.&#xa0;In summary, although wholly recognising the need for the Benefits system to be simplified, inclusion of housing costs in UC is a significant issue due to local variances, knowledge and expertise, established relationships with housing providers and vulnerable groups, and potential for increasing homelessness (in turn increasing the costs of housing customers in temporary accommodation).  Local authorities are well placed to overcome such issues.&#xa0;27 September 2013&#xa0;
