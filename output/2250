defaultT W M Eccles – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;
defaultI am writing to you as a countryside walker of over 30 years, who has seen many Green Lanes changed from beautiful grassy accesses to ugly, deeply-rutted 
defaultdeadzones
default created by the use of recreational vehicles which have no place in such scenic rural areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese green lanes were created many, many years ago as access routes to be used on foot and by pac
defaultk animals for trade associated 
defaultpurposes, and they were never designed for use by motor cycles and 4x4s which have severely 
defaultdefaced  them
default over recent years.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese vehicles create deep ruts which destroy vegetation and the soil structure, and when 4x4s can no longer traverse them, the drivers merely create adjacent new ruts, and the result is the creation  of ever-widening areas of dead ground carved through areas of outstanding natural beauty.
default&#xa0;
defaultI enclose several photographs of 
defaultDeadman’s
default Hill, 
defaultNidderdale
default, North Yorkshire, showing damage caused to this access by recreational traffic.  It is in far worse condition than the green lane I knew when I first walked this area many years ago, and if you were able to visit this area near Scar House and 
defaultAngram
default reservoirs you would be able to experience the devastation caused by recreational vehicles.
default&#xa0;
defaultI support the following two proposals and trust that they may be incorporated in the current Deregulation Bill:
default&#xa0;
default1. All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should, be re-classified as Restricted Byways.
default&#xa0;
default2. When a Local Authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector or a magistrate.
default&#xa0;
defaultI shall be glad if you will kindly acknowledge receipt of this letter and enclosed photographs.
