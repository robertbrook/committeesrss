"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Transport f\nor Greater Bristol Alliance\n (SRN 044)\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe support the idea of managing and repairing the strategic road network and believe that this is the way forward. In a modern society with an emphasis on the global traffic data, congestion can be best managed by better use of lanes, speed management and better information for motorists so that they are able to time travel better to avoid congested roads.\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have real concerns when it comes to the modelling done by the \nDfT\n and the knee-jerk response by government to supposed increased congestion on our roads, which is that therefore more road space is needed.\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEven if the traffic forecasts presented with the Action for Roads Command Paper are to be believed (and we are not convinced), then the option of building ourselves out of congestion is just not feasible. Quite apart from anything else, how could this work if the problem is so extreme that the majority of the strategic road network is expected to be solid with traffic by 2040? If the modelling is right then the strong message is that we urgently need to dampen down demand for car travel and manage the network overall, as well as direct real investment in alternatives including light rail and trams for our urban areas and their fringes, where most of the congestion is found. Many people in this country, despite living in urban areas, have no modern alternative than to travel by car. We are a very densely populated country (see later section). At a time when services (including local and bus and rail services) are being cut and councils are struggling with reduced grants from central government, spending £15 billion on roads wrong and unjustified.\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdding to capacity of our strategic road network will, we believe, only serve to exacerbate congestion generally, as traffic grows to fill the additional road space. This has been the story of road improvements during the last decades. Indeed even at the planning stage of new roads, modelling often reveals that road construction will not reduce traffic. Here in Bristol for example, the A370 Link Capacity Results from the \nSouth Bristol Link Road Environmental Statement \ndemonstrate this effect -see Figure 1. Generally we have found methods for estimating the value for money of individual road schemes very crude, with most monetary benefits arising from \nseconds\n times savings between where the scheme starts at point A, to point B, simply added up and \ncosted\n for all vehicles over \nhe\n next sixty years. \nThis the\n \nKingskerswell\n Bypass (4 km) therefore had a supposed value to society of over a billion pounds.\nFigure 1: the South Bristol Link Road fails to unlock junctions – \nmay\n are worse\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are unconvinced in any case that the predictions for traffic growth are realistic. If congestion on strategic roads is as projected, i.e. to the point that in 2040 the majority of the network is stuck, then the question begs as to why people would still be travelling by car given the conditions? Has the relationship between congestion and demand for car travel been factored in to the calculations? Has it been modelled? Surely graphs for traffic growth have simply been roughly estimated from value correlations between car ownership, oil prices and affluence, without considering how massive increase in journey times might shape travel behaviour and in fact, demand for other modes? It appears to us as though the model is crude and takes into account only very few parameters. A positive outcome – i.e. less congestion – has not been tested against other investment or management scenarios (road pricing, congestion charging, European-style public transport improvements, land-use planning policies orientated around rapid \ntransit  etc\n.). The value of the modelling is therefore, we think, very limited.\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf this traffic growth scenario holds water than before action, better analysis of cause is needed. Why are people travelling? Are we providing alternatives to the car? How crowded is local rail? What about light rail? The government has removed the need to support new development with excellent public transport infrastructure (the NPPF is very permissive and allows large scale car-based development). Is this doing us any favours? How many of our cities and larger towns have got trams? Is local rail rolling stock up to the job? Does public transport connect? In a crowded country, we need to be more analytical and visionary. Ultimately we have to do something more modern than just increase road capacity.\n1.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRegarding a general link between economy and transport investment, a tremendous amount of work has already been carried out by previous governments on the tie-in between investment in road infrastructure and economic growth. Just as an example, the summary if the SACRA report of 1999 concludes on this matter:\nEmpirical evidence of the scale and significance of such linkages is, however, weak and disputed. We conclude that the theoretical effects listed can exist in reality, but that none of them is guaranteed. Our studies underline the conclusion that generalisation about the effects of transport on the economy are subject to strong dependence on specific local circumstances and conditions'. The \nEddinton\n report \nechos\n these conclusions.\nWe agree that investment in transport infrastructure and its link to economic growth is complicated and not amenable to generalisation.\n&#xa0;\n2.1 The government Action for Roads Command Paper explains (section 1.22 to 1.23) that:\nOur latest estimates show that even in the worst economic circumstances and assuming low population growth, traffic levels on strategic roads will be 24% higher in 2040 than they are today. In our central case traffic will rise by 46% above today’s levels.\n              \nEven under our lowest growth forecasts we would expect traffic growth to cause major increases in congestion, greater delays and more unpredictable journeys. Without action, growing demand will place unsustainable pressure on our roads, constraining the economy, limiting our personal mobility and forcing us to spend more time stuck in traffic. This will mean more pollution and more frustration for motorists\n              \nFirst of all, if this is true, is an untenable situation not just for strategic roads but also for local roads. Google maps show where the traffic jams are and what you see are traffic jams not just on the strategic network, but on many, many smaller roads. Big roads feed into smaller roads; wider motorways and more capacity on trunk roads mean more traffic generally. More capacity for larger roads is likely to make things worse for the rest of the network.  This is because traffic enters and leaves urban areas via the non-strategic road network, and because we are a crowded country. It is wrong therefore, we think, to encourage more traffic onto our roads generally, by adding capacity to the network.\n              \nThen there is a question as to whether the traffic figures in past years support he prediction of near-gridlock in 2040. The figure presented for the \nDfT\n Central, Mid-point Car Traffic Projections and out-turn statistics\n demonstrates very clearly that traffic growth is not going up as it was before 2000 but is rounding off. Traffic growth is also falling in the\n \nDfT\n 2008 England Total Traffic Forecasts and Out-turn Statistics\n. A similar trend is shown in the figure plotting E\nngland Traffic on All Roads\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFrom the environmental point of view, and with respect to other modes, catering for traffic growth simply won't work. The resulting increase in carbon emissions and pollution (we anticipate only slow conversion to low emission vehicles, and think that HGVs are unlikely to be non-polluting\n) ,\n with more danger, noise and severance, will mean a worsening environment for cyclists and pedestrians. Many roads use to get to the trunk and motorway network will become inhospitable. This will have repercussions on other modes as explained, including buses and cycle lanes, let alone pedestrians.\nImpacts on landscape, also on wildlife are not easy to mitigate for; sometimes impossible and always expensive. This is important especially for local road building in places which are currently open countryside near towns, where local people value the amenity of recreational areas and where wildlife is already under pressure of development.\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSection 5.1 of the Action for Roads paper says that: \nWhile the strategic road network plays a crucial role in national travel and for the economy, it is only one part of the picture. The rest of the road network is not as intensively used as the strategic road network, but nevertheless carries the majority of non-freight traffic. It also forms the start and end of almost every journey, meaning that any plan for world-class roads has to include the local road network. New links, better junctions and improved access are an integral part of supporting local development.\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis section of the paper misses the true extent of the general congestion on local urban and suburban roads. New links, better junctions and improved may produce slightly better journey times for specific journeys on strategic routes in the short term, but the overall network of roads remains as before, jammed.\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMuch of the congestion on our roads is already non-strategic. Google maps have a facility to turn congestion 'on' so that you can see what the road system is doing. The map of Greater Bristol shows the story clearly: at rush hour (increasingly long) a high proportion of roads are at capacity or nearing capacity in the city and in the suburbs. Even relatively unimportant B roads have blockages, and non-trunk \nA\n roads tail backs of a kilometre or more in length in the urban area and on the fringes of it.\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe travelling public do not want to sit in traffic but there is certainly little alternative in this part of the country for many commuters. In the Bristol area for example, the underinvestment in the local rail network is so bad that some major suburbs and satellite towns have a frequency of only one train an hour, and some with a thirty minute service have services so crowded that people fail to get on. If £15 billion is available for transport investment then it is unclear to us why local rail, light rail, trams and other elements of urban transit common in Europe are not better targets. The Local Transport Boards (West of England and Swindon and Wiltshire) want new stations and better services, but the barriers to these in terms of satisfying 'value for money', going through the very slow GRIP \nprocess  and\n a series of bureaucratic hurdles make progress difficult.\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe rush hour map of Hanover, Bristol's twin city and of a similar population, shows that with proper investment in a modern multi-\nlayred\n and integrated public transport system, there \nis  congestion\n. Google maps reveals that Bristol's congestion goes on much of the morning with peak congestion spread out as people try to avoid the worse. Local and regional rail would take traffic off the roads, this linked with trams/light rail and \nte\n bus network, as is the case in Hanover and many other European cities. Investment in local public transport rather than adding capacity to the strategic road network is good for business, and good for people. However in the Bristol area, the only local public transport mode that the government sees as appropriate to invest is bus infrastructure. This cannot deliverer alone.\n3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIs road construction really good value for money? The Action for Roads Command Paper does not analyse this but takes for granted that the construction of new roads is worth it. s. But what is the evidence in a modern country in the 21st century that this is really so? The use of Web Tag/TUBA/COBA to assess 'value for money' for road construction assesses worth' using methods dating from the 1980s or before. Road improvements are tested on the basis of minute  'time savings' over the next 60 years, to the extent that even a short 4 km stretch of dual carriage bypass such as the South Devon Link Road is apparently worth £1 billion for a short boost of a minute or two for the motorist. The fact that the traffic jam accumulates at the next roundabout of at other junctions on the road network, is not factored into the 'value for money' calculations. Society \nmonetises the benefits of road schemes almost entirely on the basis of how many seconds are save by such and such a bypass. The trouble is that resulting congestion in years to come as traffic is induced, fails to be properly examined, and \na  s\nolid\n social-economic analysis led by public policy to reduce traffic is not part of the calculation\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf the \nDfT\n wishes to model and improve transport then \nnetwork \nbenefits and inter-modal benefits need to be understood and brought into the equation. For example in Bristol, Bus Based Rapid Transit has been failed to be integrated properly with the with existing railway network it stops for example, not in forecourt of Bristol Temple Meads  but some 400 metres away.\n&#xa0;\nScreen shot Bristol area \nGooglel\n Maps 4th October 2013 at 0816\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nScreen-shot Google maps Hannover 4th October 0814\n3.8 \n              \nOver 100,000 people in the Bristol area live in an Air Quality Management Area (see DEFRA map below). In many parts of the south west, new AQMAs have been recently been declared. Rising traffic \neverywhere\n is having a detrimental effect on the environment in terms of air pollution. EEA executive director Hans \nBruyninckx\n said recently that road transport is one of the main sources of fine particulate matter pollution and that: \"Air pollution is causing damage to human health and ecosystems. Large parts of the population do not live in a healthy environment, according to current standards.  Although the Command Paper hopes that investment in ultra-low emission vehicles will improve on air quality in the next decades, we would want to see more information to be convinced. How will HGVs be low emission? Will legislation bring about the shift to low emissions? Surely with so many more cars on the roads, emissions risk going up, not down, certainly in the shorter term?  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur concern is that it reduces the demand and therefore the commercial viability for other modes, and also takes funds from other modes which need finance. We are a small and crowded country and follow the Netherlands and Belgium when it comes to population density. It is with this in mind that we believe the need for transport investment in our city regions to provide European-style local rail, tram, light rail and bus integrated networks now to be \nthe\n top priority, rather than faster strategic connections.\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe map below, showing European population density, demonstrates just how dense a population we have in the context of Europe. If the traffic growth figures provided alongside the Command Paper are to be believed, then it all the more important to bring about the step change in public transport provision that other populous European countries have done.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPopulation density in Europe.\n \nsource\n: \nhttp://www.indexmundi.com\n.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
