[[[Quality Education For All Falls Short If Children With Disabilities Are Excluded]]]

[[[Introduction]]]Africa Network Campaign on Education For All (ANCEFA) is a voluntary, non-partisan and not-for profit network of national civil society organizations in Africa championing the cause of quality education for all (EFA). The membership currently stands at 35 national education coalitions, each of them constituting diverse membership including NGOs, Teachers Unions, Human Rights, Child Rights and Education Rights Activists, Media Practitioners, Researchers, Academia, Community Based Organisations and sub-thematic networks.&#xa0;ANCEFA envisions a Literate and Empowered Africa where Quality Education For All is a reality enjoyed by all children, youth and adults, without any hindrances whatsoever. In order to realize its dream, ANCEFA’s mandate is to enhance the capacity of African Civil Society to push efficiently and effectively  for universal access to quality education and development through campaigning, advocacy, networking, research and resource mobilization.&#xa0;ANCEFA strives to support the emergence of vibrant civil society networks, coalitions and alliances that critically engage in EFA processes at the local, national, regional and international levels, among other core objectives; and deploys such strategies as coalition building and strengthening, capacity development  in campaigning, lobbying, advocacy, research, networking, and policy analysis, information management, facilitating local, national, regional and international policy dialogues, partnership building, and elections and budget advocacy, among others.&#xa0;

[[[Strategic Campaign Focus of ANCEFA]]]In its current strategic plan, ANCEFA focuses on education financing and inclusion (working with parliamentarians and political parties and building EFA champions), national and local accountability via public expenditure tracking surveys and participatory school governance, promoting quality/learning outcomes with teachers, youth and volunteers, parents, and the media as strategic partners; strategic policy engagement for meaningful change in policy and practice around early childhood care and development, universal primary education, out of school youth, girls’ access, retention and completion, and adult and continuing learning; EFA monitoring through Education Watch; and Overseas Development Aid agenda tracking.&#xa0;

[[[ and donor aid should target this]]]For the period  2009 – 2012, ANCEFA, with the support of Save the Children UK, undertook an action-oriented survey in the Economic Community Of West African States (ECOWAS) region of Africa to underscore the significance of  inclusive education, and how it would accelerate  access to quality education by children with disabilities. Many children, of whom most are psychologically or physically disabled, are prevented from going to school simply because no one thought about integrating adapted learning, teaching and construction facilities to accommodate them. Not less that 5% of the total children population in the countries of the region have been projected to have one disability or another (ANCEFA Report ECOWAS, 2013)The first shocking revelation is that there is absolutely no reliable disaggregated data  showing  statistics on the number of  disabled children, less  still on the nature of their disability. ANCEFA and partners thus heavily rooted for an inclusive education process that would ensure that EVERY child is in school, and LEARNING. Development partners have thus been called upon to support the process, with governments being asked to take the lead, since delivery of inclusive education  should be the top priority of every government.&#xa0;Further, disabled children and girls in rural areas do not go to school and in urban areas, special schools are insufficient. Consequently, most disabled children are totally excluded from the educational system.&#xa0;Inclusive education relates to all children accessing and meaningfully participating in quality education in ways that are responsive to their individual needs. Inclusive education is therefore expected to meet EVERYONE’s rights to Education.&#xa0;It is universally agreed that every child has a fundamental right to education and that every child CAN Learn. Further every stakeholder, and every lead agency,  including governments and donor aid agencies, should acknowledge and respect differences in children. Education structures, systems and methodologies must meet the needs of all  children, and where historically disabled children have been discriminated against, schools have to accommodate children with special educational needs and redress the past imbalance.&#xa0;Increasing awareness and vigilance among communities, enhancing capacity building of MPs and journalists on inclusive education, budget tracking and child rights, advocacy on inclusive education and increased budget allocations, popularization of instruments and texts on childrens’ rights, and sensitization and lobbying using diverse means should help address the problem.&#xa0;National and international partnerships need to be enhanced to tackle the perennial exclusion of the children with disability from education. A call to all international aid agencies to promote this would be a welcome move.&#xa0;12 December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;              &#xa0; International instruments governing Education e.g.UDHR, UNCRC, African Charter on the Rights and Wellbeing of the Child&#xa0;
