[[[Allan Levine [FBB0052]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Summary:&#xa0;The following is my personal view based on observations and scrutiny of BBC output and actions over the last decade. &#xa0;Not only failing to meet the requirements of its charter, but its unethical greedy self-serving agenda is a clear negative force undermining the values of our society.  &#xa0;The cloak of respectability and impartiality which the licence fee gives it must be removed for it not to do further damage to this nation. &#xa0;At present, the charter does not guarantee independence in any publicly desirable sense, but enabled more what has become a totalitarian propaganda power, beyond real public control, and must be terminated for the benefit of real democracy, social cohesion and stability based on long established human values, and education.&#xa0;Some of the evidence supporting my view, particularly from more recent times, is as follows:&#xa0;

[[[Scandals]]]&#xa0;Revealed: Tape that shows BBC chief 'did know of Savile probe'             Lord Patten must find out the truth about Jimmy Savile, Mark Thompson and the Pollard Review            Why Nick Pollard's report on Jimmy Savile just doesn't make senseJames Harding’s right: the BBC must do some ‘accountability journalism’, but on the Savile scandal report&#xa0;
