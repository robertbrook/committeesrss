"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by UK Association for Science and Discovery Centres (CLC0069)I write in response to the discussion during the oral evidence session on 9 October 2013 within the \ninquiry \n‘Climate: Public understanding and policy implications’. My points relate to the Members’ discussion around the need for trusted mechanisms (a porta\nl) to engage the public with climate science, and if such a mechanism existed. I believe it does, and I outline below the nature of this \ntrusted portal which currently engages 20 million people every year in both cities and rural locations across the UK.\n-\n---------------------------------------------------------\nThe \nUK Association for Science and Discovery Centres\n brings together over 60 of the UK’s \nmajor \nscience engagement organisations, including science and disc\novery centres, national \nscience \nmuseums, en\nvironment centres \nand \nlearned societies. Together, these trusted centres \nattract over 20\n million \nvisitors each year who \ntake time to explore and delve into science in a hands-on, intriguing and personal way. \nThe Association’s c\nentres span all regions and c\nountries of the UK and reach into a huge number\n of ‘hard to reach’ communities. They \ncollectively\n \nengage over 2\n million\n \nschool students from a range of socio-economic \nbackgrounds\n,\n who take part in science workshops, \ndiscussions, \nlabs and \nscience \nevents.\nTh\ne subjects\n covered by the science and discovery centres \nrange from climate \nscience to\n \nspace science\n and \nfrom \nnanoscience to brain science. However, it is clear to all \nprofessionals working within \nthe \nfield of science engagement\n that there is no greater \nimmediate need, nor indeed any greater challenge,\n than to engage people effectively\n and widely\n on the subject of climate science - and to do this very soon.\nThe UK Association for Science and Discovery Centres, with its vibrant and trusted national infrastructure and thousands of professional science engagement specialists could play a major role in helping people in all parts of the UK to engage with the latest climate science, and get people talking about the UK’s policy response. \nThese \nlively \nscience \nce\nntres \nalready operate \nsuccessfully \nand sustainably \nin this \nengagement \nsphere; they are embedded in their local communities with excellent \nrelationships with university science, industrial partners\n, schools, teachers and families.\n Indeed, the work they curr\nently do is \nvalued highly enough by\n \nfamilies, schools, teachers and the wider public \nthat in most \ncities\n, \npeople\n \npay to \nvisit\n, \nand visit repeatedly.\n \nScience and Discovery Centres \nare experts in \nboth \nengagement, \nand in science. \nIndeed, it\n is their raison d’être and their charitable mission. They are staffed by talented creative individuals with \nconsiderable \nexpertise in all areas of \nthe \nscience\ns\n, \n as well as\n \ncommunications\n, design, \neducation\n, marketing, the arts and \nmore.\n \nThe majority of \nASDC member centres (from At-Bristol to the Eden Project, and from W5 in Belfast to the Science Museum in London) have already invested significantly in programmes and exhibitions to engage their publics with climate science. These range from lively evenin\ng events\n \nfor adults, workshops for schools, family shows and \ncarbon \ncompetitions right through to full hands-on climate exhibitions and formal dialogue events \nin partnership with\n ASDC and Sciencewise. They include content in all areas of climate science fr\nom earth observation to the latest low carbon innovations\n and engineering\n. \nThe following gives some examples of the poten\ntial\n science centres \nhave \nto reach people in all parts of the UK and what could be achieved if these were focussed on climate science.\n  Glasgow Science Centre attracts \n280,000 people each year of whom 90,000 (32%) are school students brought by their teachers\n \nto take part in targeted curriculum-linked science workshops and activities\n. Thinktank, Birmingham’s Science Centre attracts \n260,0\n00 people\n annually\n, \nof whom \n78,000 \nare \nschool students\n taking part in science workshops and discussions. Family and \nleisure visitors\n at Thinktank take part\n in \nscience shows, sleepovers, story-telling, \nmeet the scientist \nand \nlab\n-based\n workshops\n. This patter\nn is replicated up and down the country\n - 385,000 people visit ASDC member centres every week of the year.\nThe key to what science and discovery centres \ndo\n is to start where their public is, and to take them on a journey rather than to impose upon them wha\nt someone feels they should know. Science centres \noffer \nfamilies, \nadults\n and school children\n unusual \nand exciting \nopportunities \nto explore, discover, question\n, test and experiment\n on the world around them. \nThe aim is not simply to fill people with facts, b\nut to take them on a journey to spark their curiosity\n and\n to encourage them to continue asking questions about\n the\n world\n \nlong after they leave our centres. \nIt is clear \nthat \nthe network of UK science and discovery centres and museums could mobilise in a \nnational way to get people across the UK interested and involved in climate science\n and to start asking questions about what we collectively should be doing about it\n. Indeed ASDC already runs national programmes in this way, for example the current ‘Explor\ne Your Universe’ Programme in partnership with the Science and Technologies \nFacilities C\nouncil (STFC). Ho\nwever to make a national climate change \nprogramme \nhighly \neffective it needs to be carefully \nmore carefully \nconstructed\n than any other\n. \nClimate change \ncreates a specific issue in that most people in the UK have considered it at some level, and many have an entrenched position on it. That makes the issues of trust key, and that is in part why I write. Science and discovery centres and museums are trusted \nvoices and environments. They are not arms of Government, they are local, and are always on the side of the visitors. \nOur approach would be to \nwork with the fields of behavioural psychology, health and social psychology and environmental psychology all \nof\n \nwho\nm\n have expertise \nthat would shape what we did. In addition we would want to bring together all we collectively and internationally know about behaviour change and \ngame theory, cognitive dissonance and delayed gratification\n, all of which have a bearing \non \nwhy people do and do not \nchoose\n to change\n. Much too is to be learned from all the \nacademic and grey literature \n(formal published non-academic reports) \non\n \nbehaviour change in \nseat belts, drink-driving, \nsmoking, pensions and healthy \nliving. All of \nthis ne\neds to be applied to any future discussions on climate change.\n Likewise, \nwe would see it important for people to explore\n the process of science and how \nwe get to a point where most scientists agree\n, as well as \nopening up the \nthe mistaken assumption that \nmo\nst of us have that \nhumans act rationally\n.\nWe would \nalso \nwant to look at innovative and experimental programmes\n and what \nhas worked\n. F\nor example ‘global conversations’ run by W5, the \nBelfast science centre\n, wh\nere \npupils and teachers from Northern Ireland an\nd Republic of Ireland formed cluster groups with students in Ghana and Ethiopia and shared information on their views on climate change and sustainability \nand how it affects them\n.\n We would also look at the myriad of successful examples from Bristol, a European leader in sustainability and green innovation and communications. Indeed Bristol is the first UK city to win the title of ‘Green Capital of Europe’ which it will host in 2015\n because of its leadership in this area\n and because it has very high city wide rates of indicators such as cycling behaviours.\nAs a note, The \nUK Association for Science and Discovery Centres\n \nalso sees it as vital that people in all parts of the UK have open access to the very latest climate information and evidence. \nSir Mark Walport, Chief Science Advisor \nis therefore visiting a number of UK science and discovery centres \nto \nshare the latest\n cl\nimate science evidence and policy with\n \nthe public and school students\n so they can hear it first hand.\n \nAs a nation\n and as a global society we have some \nmajor\n challenges ahead. \nAddressing these challenges will require both scientific entrepreneurship and fu\nndamental societal engagement and change\n and we feel we can help in this\n. \nWe need our young people t\no be confident to experiment and innovate\n \nwith science, technology and engineering and\n \nto become trail-blazers \nfor a lower carbon future. \nWe need our adult \npopulation to\n better understand the sciences, encouraging them to examine evidence and\n lobby for the policy changes needed for a \nbright \nlow carbon future.\n \nWe need to \nhelp people to find the \n delight of \nexploring\n the world around us\n \nwhilst\n \nreducing our foot\nprint on it\n. \n&#xa0;\nDr Penny Fidler is the CEO of The UK Association for Science and Discovery Centres. \nShe\n has a PhD in neuroscience from Cambridge University and has fourteen years experience working in the field of science engagement, including setting up a millennium science centre, running an Exhibitions and Neuroscience Consultancy and speaking in Parliam\nent on the importance of informal science learning.
