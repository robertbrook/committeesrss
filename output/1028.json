The other is that the right to vote, as a bulwark of genuine democracy\n, is\n essential both in \nrespecting\n the full humanity o\nf\n the prisoner and in encouraging each prisoner to achieve \nfull\n r\neintegration into\n society\n.\n \n \nBecause t\nhese two incompatible positions\n are held strongly by many of their adherents, and because the history of cases in the European Court of Human Rights, which in historical terms is driving the present discussions, has centred on whether a ‘blanket ban’ is just, the debate has become polarised.  \nIt is helpful, therefore, t\nhat the draft Bill, like government consultation\ns\n which preceded it, presents a range of views rather than a binary choice. \n&#xa0;\nThe whole range of views is represented among \nmembers\n of the Church of England, \nand the starting-point of this submission is the suggestion that the choice is not about deciding \nwhether all or no prisoners \nshould\n vote, but about balancing, without caricature, the \narguments\n \ntending\n towards either end of the spectrum of views.\n \nChristians\n believe in justice, and \nt\nhat it is \nthe duty\n of the \nstate\n to maintain justice by, among other \nthings\n, punishing offender\ns\n \nj\nustly\n (1Peter 2:14).  They also believe that e\nv\nery \nindividual\n is made in the image of God and loved unconditionally by God, and is for those reasons worthy of the respect of their fellow-citizens; and that no one is beyond hope, beyond redemption\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe debate, as framed in the draft Bill, is not between those for and against an artificial threshold which measures severity of offence by the nature of the sentence, and those against such a threshold.  \nThe \nchoices\n given are \nsimply\n three thresholds: imprisonment, \nimprisonment\n for six \nmonths\n, and imprisonment for four years.  It \nremains\n possible to reject these terms of debate, and argue \nagainst\n any general threshold.\n&#xa0;\nIn this submission we briefly consider the context of the current debate, especially the European dimension; the\nn\n go on to consider and assess the arguments for and against a blanket ban on \nprisoners\n voting, before\n considering the case for each of the intermediate options presented in the draft Bill, and \nfinally \ndrawing our conclusion\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe present \ndiscussion has\n been brought about by the \nneed\n to react to judgments in the European Court of Human Rights. \nIt is not our view that the discussion should be shaped by a desire to react on the basis of any general view of the actions of that court, still less to subsume it under the  heading of ‘European institutions’ and base the response on a generalised attitude to those institutions.  \nRather, the court’s judgments are to be taken as the spur for us in the UK to \ndiscuss\n the substantive issue in terms of what we \nas\n a nation believe to be right. If we emerge convinced that a blanket ban is right, we are very unlikely to be decisively swayed even by the undoubted weight of the European Court’s authority.\n&#xa0;\nNevertheless\n, we do not believe it right to dismiss the various \njudgments\n of the European \ncourt\n as of no \nrelevance\n.  \nThis debate is undoubtedly about the extent of human rights, and the many aspects of human rights are inseparably connected with one another.  \nIn signing up to the ECHR, the UK Parliament\n agreed to secure to everyone within its jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined therein, and to comply with all the judgments of the ECtHR.  To derogate on this matter could risk weakening the authority of the EC\nt\nHR, and could provide cover for other nations wishing to justify non-compliance with other human rights requirements laid on them by European institutions.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMore specifically, the \nquestion\n in relation to the \nEuropean\n court turns on the \nextent\n of the ‘margin of appreciation’ allowable to individual states  - what arrangement might be sufficiently far from a blanket ban to \nremove the perception that it is ‘general and \nautomatic\n’ in such a away as to be \narbitrary\n \nand disproportionate\n in its effects.  \nThe successive judgments in the European Court – especially Hirst, Frodl and Scoppola – have left a measure of uncertainty about where the boundaries of the margin lie.  \nScoppola, at least, has \nremoved the bar on setting any threshold in terms of sentence length alone.\n  \nAlthough some in the Church of England believe that disenfranchisement should only follow from a decision by a judge in the individual case (as envisaged in the Hirst judgment), this view is not widespread in view of the difficulties both of principle – this seems to enact the view, criticised by the UN Human Rights Committee, that disenfranchisement ‘amounts to an additional punishment’ – and of practice, in laying an additional and perplexing burden on the judge in every sentencing decision.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere is a rich variety of practice among different \ncountries\n – \nincluding European\n states – as to which, if any, \nprisoners\n can vote.  About 18 \nEuropean\n \nstates\n have no ban on \nprisoners\n voting, while others \ndebar\n \nsome\n \nprisoners\n on the basis of \nsentence\n length, or type of offence, or both. \nThere are no clear patterns, no critical mass, no obvious overall direction of travel from which we might draw any \nlessons\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNo prisoner is able to vote except those imprisoned for contempt, default or on remand\n, and this has been the case for almost all of the last 140 years since the \nquestion\n was \nfirst\n made \nexplicit\n in law.\n  \nThe weight of public opinion in the UK seems to tend towards retention\n of this ban - in a November 2012 YouGov of 1812 British adults, 63% of respondents said that 'no prisoners should be allowed to vote at elections', versus only 8% saying that 'all prisoners should be allowed to vote', 9% who said 'prisoners serving sentences of less than 4 years should be allowed to vote', and 15% saying 'prisoners serving sentences of less than 6 months should be allowed to vote'.\n&#xa0;\nThere are no significant practical issues in enabling prisoners to vote – it already happens for those on remand.   It is generally accepted that each prisoner would vote in the constituency in which they were last resident.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe current draft Bill gives a succinct reason for denying the vote to prisoners\n:\n&#xa0;\n‘Successive Governments have maintained the position that when an individual breaks their contract with society by committing an offence that leads to imprisonment, they should lose the right to vote while they are incarcerated.’ (Introduction, para 9).\nThis argues that the right to vote is not absolute, but presupposes a degree of compliance with the law, as the citizen’s side of the unwritten contract.  The key phrase is ‘an offence that leads to imprisonment’; - i.e. the operative criterion is not the imprisonment per se but the offence.  The threshold of the seriousness of the offence is defined as that which attracts a prison sentence.  ‘Seriousness’ is a judicial category which is defined in official terms in a document \nof the Sentencing Council\n.\n&#xa0;\n‘Contract’ has a metaphorical sense here, since there is no suggestion that the grant of citizenship is legally conditional on full compliance with the law\n.\n \nA power does exist for someone to be stripped of citizenship: under section 40 of the British Nationality Act\n 1981, as amended in 2006, the Home S\necretary may make an order depriving a person of citizenship status if they are \"satisfied that deprivation is conducive to the public good\". This has only been used in a small number of terrorism-related cases.  Being metaphorical, the ‘contract’ \nstatement describes rather than explains or justifies the established position.  But it \ndescribes it helpfully:\n many people see prisons as a sort of ‘sin bin’, such that anyone consigned to it \ncannot\n take any part in the action on the field of play until they return.\n The difficulty is that society treats prisoners as still on the field of play for taxation of earnings and savings, and there is always some force in ‘no taxation without representation’\n (see below).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe draft Bill further says: ‘The ban on prisoner voting pursues the legitimate aims of preventing crime by punishing offenders, and enhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law’.  (Explanatory Note 92).  \n&#xa0;\n‘P\nreventing crime by punishing offenders’ is naturally read as implyin\ng a deterrent effect.  \nHowever\n, n\no one has argued that the threat of losing their vote is likely to deter anyone from criminal action.\n  ‘P\nreventing crime by punishing offenders’ is \nalso \nnaturally read as stating that the withdrawal of suffrage is itself a punishment.  This risks playing into one argument of ECtHR in the Hirst judgment, that disenfranchisement is a further punishment, and should be specified as such by the \nsentencing judge\n in each case. \nThis question would hinge on whether disenfranchisement is an ‘additional punishment’, or so closely linked to imprisonment (as a natural implication or corollary of it) that it simply adds a further resonance to the shame and incapacitation constituted by the imprisonment itself.  \nIt is difficult, in the face of the wide variety of practice in\n different countries as to disenfranchisement\n of \nthose\n in prison, to assert as intuitively evident the \nproposition that losing one’s freedom naturally involves losing one’s vote.\n&#xa0;\n‘E\nnhancing civic responsibility and re\nspect for the rule of law’\n implies that the removal of the franchise from prisoners will add solemnity and weight to the significance of the vote for those who do p\nossess it.  \nThis is quite a high-level proposition, not easily susceptible of proof or disproof.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is notable that the UK debate has been confined entirely to the question of prison.  There has been no call to disenfranchise permanently, as in some countries, those who commit certain very serious crimes, so that even when released from prison they cannot vote.  This illustrates the close association in the public mind between prison and exclusion from voting.  We trust the judges to sentence correctly; and if during the prison sentence, even a short one, an election happens to occur, then it is the luck of the draw that the person serving perhaps a couple of months at that very time is not able to cast their vote.\n&#xa0;\nOpposed to this is the view that prisoners remain citizens while in prison, and imprisonment cannot by itself be grounds for removing the vote.  This implies that a judge should decide in each case, quite separately from the question of imprisonment.  It is possible in principle that someone convicted of an electoral fraud offence, for example, but not imprisoned, could be disenfranchised for a period while most prisoners were not. \n&#xa0;\nThe ECtHR can no longer insist on this individualised approach (which the Hirst judgment backed) because of the Scoppola judgment which legitimised thresholds based on sentence length alone.  It is unreasonable to expect that in every case, the judge in fixing a custodial sentence should also have to consider the question of disenfranchisement.  In legal terms disenfranchisement would have to become a separate penalty; in practical terms the criteria for disenfranchisement would have to be defined clearly.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPrison is seen by many as a place of removal from society and from participation in society.  In this light, disenfranchisement is a corollary\n or \nimplication\n of incarceration, not a punishment additional to it.  Prison is often defended partly on the simple ground that it takes people out of society so that they cannot commit crime.  \nP\nrisoners can hold bank accounts and driving licences, get married and pay taxes – but all of these under carefully controlled conditions.  Possession of a vote would be a much more unconditional denial that the\n prisoner has been definitively \nexcluded from society.\n  It would add to what is sometimes called the ‘declaratory’ \nfunction\n of imprisonment: expressing in action the \nseverity\n of society’s disapproval of crime.\n&#xa0;\nSome campaigners, including some within the Church of England, have argued that this status quo and consensus are alike based on an obsolete notion of ‘civic death’, dating back to the days of Edward III. ‘Lock them up and throw away the key’ does not usually mean ‘throw away the key’, but it does imply as absolute as possible a removal from society.\n \n \nBishop Peter Selby has put his objection to this\n forcefully:\n&#xa0;\n ‘Denying prisoners the right to vote serves no purpose of deterrence or reform.  What it does is to state in the clearest terms society’s belief that once convicted you are a non-person, one who should have no say in how our society is to develop, whose opinion is to count for nothing.  It is making someone an ‘outlaw’, and as such has no place in expressing a civilised attitude towards those in prison’.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe ECtHR’s objection is that the ban is ‘general, automatic and indiscriminate’, and this may reflect the experience of prisoners – all lumped together in a category of outcasts.  In that case the example and teaching of Jesus comes strongly into focus, in terms of not rejecting, pillorying and stigmatising any individual.  \nThe Bible contains insistence on proportionality in punishment – the limits \nof the\n lex talionis are set at ‘an eye for an eye’, \netc.\n - Exodus 21:23-4\n.\n  It also contains warnings against excessive punishment – e.g. Deuteronomy 25:3 ‘He must not give him more than 40 lashes.  If he is flogged more than that, your brother will be degraded in your eyes’ (NIV).  \n&#xa0;\nThis view \nthat\n \nautomatic\n \ndisenfranchisement\n is an unnecessary humiliation of the convicted person is not universal among church \nmembers\n; some would share the view that is a proportionate corollary of the exclusion that prison signifies.  \nHowever, the Mission and Public Affairs Division in\ndicated the viewpoint of many others\n within the church in its report to the General Synod of the Church of England in 2007, ‘Taking Responsibility for Crime’, which included a pointer in favour of giving at least some prisoners the vote:\n&#xa0;\nClassical criminology and penology, often backed by Christian beliefs about human freedom and dignity, treated the offender primarily as a rational agent who could be influenced by the prospect of punishment or helped and encouraged to change his – mostly “his” – attitudes and behaviour.  An excessive concentration on the protective function threatens both justice and the principle that the offender or potential offender remains a citizen and is not deprived of all civil rights.  The current argument over the restoration to prisoners of the right to vote is a litmus test of the application of this principle. (p.8)\n&#xa0;\nFor those in favour of a blanket ban, \ndisenfranchisement\n of \nprisoners\n enhances democracy.  The argument would be that the fact that one’s vote can be forfeited is likely to raise the value placed on the franchise by the community in general, whereas the possession of the vote by hardened criminals in prison might cheapen it in public estimation.  \nA responsible democracy will thus benefit from the exclusion of those who have committed imprisonable offences, for the duration of their custody, with the safeguard that the vast majority will \nin due\n course reassume their civic rights when they leave prison\n.\n&#xa0;\nFor those against, prisoners are a minority in society who need to be heard.  If those standing for election have to give attention to the votes of prisoners (although a tiny minority of any constituency electorate), that will raise the profile of prisons in democratic debate, as well as perhaps taking some candidates into prisons to experience the reality. The Canadian Supreme Court has said that ‘A government that restricts the franchise to a select portion of citizens is a government that weakens its ability to function as the legitimate representative of the excluded citizens, jeopardises its claim to representative democracy and erodes the basis of its right to convict and punish law-breakers.’\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThose who advocate a blanket ban do not, in \ngeneral\n, regard\n rehabilitation as a factor in deciding on the franchise.  \nRather\n, the restoration of the right to vote on \nrelease\n is a sign of the person returning to society, since the \nsentencers\n and/or Parole \nBoard\n have decided that this is the proper time to do so.\n&#xa0;\nFor \nothers\n, however, rehabilitation is the key to \nunderstanding\n why the issue of voting is important.\n&#xa0;\nFor them, to\n take away the right to vote of every prisoner weakens their ties to civic society, and conveys a message of rejection which is unlikely to support their rehabilitation.  The purpose of rehab\nilitation, to which \nalmost\n everyone is\n committed as an integral aim of imprisonment, is that people should leave prison with better resources for living as law-\nabiding citizens.  There is a strong emphasis now on ‘through-the-gate’ approaches to rehabilitation, i.e. a continuity of service and support in and out of pri\nson.  Imprisonment at its best  creates\n conditions where people can, within the restrictions of a secure institution, learn and practise habits of responsibility and mutuality.  In that way prisons might become colleges of citizenship rather than universities of crime.  \nAccording to this view, t\no tell all prisoners that they are not citizens, by stripping them of their vote, hardly reinforces that message. \nThe Catholic Bishops’ Conference 2004 repo\nrt, A Place of Redemption, came\n out very clearly in favour of giving the vote to prisoners ‘except in the most serious of cases’.(paras 107-111). ‘It would restore to prisoners some sense that they have to become the author of their own transformation’ (p.66). ‘Prison regimes should treat prisoners less as objects, done to by others, and more as subjects who can become authors of their own reform and redemption.  In that spirit, the right to vote should be restored to sentenced prisoners’ (ibid).\n  Lord Mackay of Clashfern once suggested that \nprisoners\n in the last six months of \ntheir\n sentence \nshould\n be given the vote, as a way of easing them \nback into\n full membership of the community\n, though this would, no doubt, be too complex in practice to administer\n.\n&#xa0;\nThere is no knock-down argument showing that \nthose\n in prison should have their vote taken away.  \nEqually\n, the weight and \nconsistency\n over time of \npublic\n \nopinion\n in favour of denying prisoners the vote has to be taken seriously\n. \nThose campaigning for votes for prisoners frequently assert that voting is ‘a right, not a privilege’, and they have international law o\nn their side in that respect.  Certainly, t\no take away that right is a serious matter.  But then imprisonment is a serious matter, and should be reserved for serious offences – as is in \nprinciple\n the case, although the \nnumbers\n in \nprison\n raise \nquestions\n \nabout\n it.\n&#xa0;\nThere are relatively few who have argued that all prisoners should have a vote; one area of virtual consensus seems to be that there are\n some people \nwho have committed crimes so wicked, or sustained, or both, that they have forfeited the right to be considered as full voting members of the state.   \nIt would be possible to hold that \ndisenfranchisement\n \nshould\n be reserved as an \nadditional\n sanction in the \nsentencer’s\n toolbox, to give extra weight to the condemnation of those most serious crimes.  This has not\n, however,\n been \nadvocated\n to any s\nignificant extent, and we would not advocate a further complicating of the responsibilities laid on the sentencer.\n&#xa0;\nA partial ban on allowing those in prison to vote is, \ntherefore\n, the position taken by many who are unhappy with the \nblanket\n ban.  Th\nis is \na way of \nholding\n together on the one hand a perception \nof prison\n as exclusion fro\nm society, and on the other hand a wish to \navoid\n cutting off the possibilities \nfor\n reintegration \nimplicit in treating \nprisoners\n as citizens.\n \n \nIn any\n event, there are no \narguments\n for a \npartial\n ban that can carry the absolutist rhetorical weight of the other two positions, since compromise is inevitably involved.  To define a \nthreshold\n in \nterms\n of sentence length is the only \npracticable\n option, but any such criterion is \na net\n which will catch \nboth\n the deserving and the undeserving in the \neyes\n of some beholders.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe principle underlying this option is most \nlikely\n \nto be\n that t\nhose who have taken or wrecked the life of one or more other people should not be allowed an equal place with their \nfellow-citizens.  Almost all of these, of course, will regain their vote on release, even if they are on a life sentence.  \nThe four\n-year-sentence option in the current proposals approximately meets this point, since those with a sentence of four years or more are likely to have done some serious damage.\n  \nIt is \nreasonably \nclear that the four-year option would fall within the ‘margin of appreciation’ allowed by the ECtHR, since the Italian three-year option has passed the test of examination in the Grand Chamber\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is widely accepted that short-term sentences offer almost no opportunity for rehabilitative work, but on the contrary tend to disrupt the person’s life – especially in terms of employment, housing, college courses and family ties – so as to make it if anything more likely that they will re-offend.  \nTo lose one’s vote, should an election fall during the custodial period, seems a minor but still an additional element of alienation of the offender from society, to no particular purpose since, on the basis of so short a sentence, it is unlikely that they pose a high risk of harm.  \nThis option is a minimal \nresponse\n to E\nCtHR, in that it enables the UK\n to argue that there is no longer a blanket ban, while \ngiving as little ground as possible on the government’s part (it enfranchises \nabout \n6% of the prison population at any one time).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe \nweight\n of \npublic opinion\n tells\n in favour of a blanket ban, while\n the weight of the \njudgements\n of the European Court of Human Rights tells against it\n; it would be a serious matter to ignore that court, since that would weaken any claim by the UK to exercise moral leadersh\nip in the context of \nvarying standards of respect for human rights, within Europe and beyond it.\n.   \nThere is no clear reason to suppose that a prison sentence naturally entails loss of one’s vote; the variety of practice in European and other states illustrates the lack of an international consensus.  There is a range of views on whether the element of exclusion from society which is inherent in imprisonment should extend to suspension of the franchise; on the impact of prisoner franchise on the integrity of our democracy; and on the relevance of rehabilitative considerations.\n&#xa0;\nA member of our MPA Council\n reflects the \nview\n of \nseveral\n colleagues in saying that\n they are not convinced of the argum\nents for a blanket ban, but going\n on to observe:  ‘However,  introducing enfranchisement for those who have caused great harm to society and individuals will I think be genuinely distressing for victims (and others). I would therefore be in favour of the four year rule and encourage the Government to use the opportunity of prisoner voting to strengthen its efforts to encourage reform and promote citizenship within the prisoner population.’\n&#xa0;\nNevertheless, t\nhere is no ‘Church of England view’ as between the options presented in the Bill.\n \nWhat is shared among the Church’s members is a refusal to dismiss anyone as a pariah, as less than human; a commitment to universal suffrage as broadly defined as possible, since all are created in the image of God and none is beyond his love; a recognition of the calling to ‘administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another’ (Zechariah 7:9); and an acknowledgement that to balance the punitive and rehabilitative purposes of \nimprisonment will men striking difficult balances on many issues, not least the issue of votes for prisoners.\n&#xa0;\nJune 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
