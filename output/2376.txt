[[[P Negal – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;My wife and I are regular visitors to the Yorkshire Dales  National Park and have  witnessed both  the damage that motorbikes and four-wheel drive vehicles are doing to the  Green Lanes and the  noisy  disturbance that they  create in an area that is supposed to be protected for quiet enjoyment. It is quite wrong for walkers to have  to move to one side  while  these vehicles roar past, churning up  the  surface as they  go.&#xa0;We support the submissions by-The Green Lanes Environmental Action  Group (GLEAM),The Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG),The  Peak  District Green Lanes Alliance  (PDGLA) andThe Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance  (YDGLA)&#xa0;who have  proposed that -&#xa0;1.              All unsealed Byways Open  to All Traffic  (BOATS), and  all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs)  should be recognised as not  being part of the  ordinary roads network and  should be re­ classified as Restricted Byways.&#xa0;2. When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order  that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right  of appeal, either to an  independent inspector or a magistrate.&#xa0;&#xa0;September 20132 of 1&#xa0;
