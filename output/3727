defaultAs a viewer/listener I have serious concerns about the content of some BBC output, especially drama, but also comedy, featuring 
defaultincreasing examples of 
defaultviolence, sexual material and bad language. The fact that some programmes make excellent viewing cannot be 
defaultexcused as
default ‘balanc
defaulting
default’ the negative viewing material. 
defaultEntertainment that can be safely enjoyed by all the family is sadly lacking, and despite some e
defaultxcellent programmes on CBBC, the soap operas that children want to watch with their parents, despite being broadcast before the watershed, feature violent attitudes and a negative view of the family.
defaultBias on BBC News and political programmes is also a prob
defaultlem, with the minority ‘Guardian’ view presented as majority views and the majority view presented as being held by a deranged minority; issues of concern in this respect are assisted suicide, Climate Change, the EU and Israel. Where religion is discussed,
default the level of understanding can be embarrassingly poor.

defaultn view of these problems I
default would like

defaultto see 
defaultthe BBC Trust 
defaultas

defaultho can adequately represent the interests and concerns of licence fee payers. The complaints process should be simplified, and there should be realistic sanctions for broadcasting transgressions. There should be proper age verification of those accessing 1
