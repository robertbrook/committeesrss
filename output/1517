defaultRMP 05default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultWritten evidence submitted by the Communication Workers’ Union (defaultCWU)default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultThe Communication Workers’ Union (CWU) is the largest union in the communications sector in the UK, representing over 200,000 employees in the postal, telecoms and related industries. It is the recognised union in the Royal Mail Group for all non-managemen
defaultt grades. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) published a report “Royal Mail: Sale of Shares”
default on 10 July 2013 formally announcing t
defaulthe government
default’s
default intention to sell Royal Mail through an IPO before 31 March 2014.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe case for priva
defaulttisation is confused and driven by a determination to see through an unpopular policy whatever the cost. Royal Mail
default is not a company in crisis and
default privatisation is not the 
defaultway to secure the future of UK postal service
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultRoyal Mail is not a company in crisdefaultisdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe government has framed the arguments for privatisation in such a way as to suggest that Royal Mail faces imminent danger and privatisation is the only answer. This is simply not the case
default. T
defaulthe urgency in the government’s case for privatisation is dri
defaultven solely by its own political timetable and at the expense of Royal Mail and the interests of the public.
default&#xa0;
defaultRoyal Mail is doing well in the public sector. The company has faced huge challenges in recent years, but modernisation, action on the pension deficit and changes to regulation 
defaulthave done much to turn
default the company around
default. 
defaultThere is still work to be done, but 
defaultRoyal Mail
default is better placed to compete and is enjoying the benefits of 
defaultemployees’ 
defaultcommitment
default to deliver
defaulting
default its modernisation programme.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhy defaultstill defaultinsist on privatisationdefault?default&#xa0;defaultThe 
defaultarguments for privatisation have shifted over time to suit the 
defaultgovernment’s 
defaultposition
default. 
defaultPreviously the government argued that privatisation was the only way Royal Mail could modernise and make money. Now that this no longer appears credible, the government says that 
defaultit is the only way that 
defaultRoyal Mail can access 
defaultprivate
default sector
default capital
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
default2008 the Hooper report argued
default that Royal Mail needed to 
defaultbe 
defaultpart sold to a strategic partner to bring in management expertise
default and claimed that an IPO would not raise the required capital
default. However, once these management issues were thought to be resolved, th
defaulte 2010 Hooper report, produced for the coalition government, 
defaultshifted its position and introduced a new recommendation of an IPO, this time on the basis of access to capital. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAccess to capital
default&#xa0;
defaultLike any business, Royal Mail will need access to capital at 
defaultsome point in the future.
default Also, like any business it should be able to borrow this privately. 
defaultIt does not need public investment and i
defaultt does not need to compete 
default-
default as the government 
defaulthas suggested
default in emotive terms - 
defaultwith 
defaulthospitals and schools for scarce pub
defaultlic resources
default. As a viable company
default,
default in the public just as much as in the private sector
default,
default 
defaultit should be able to 
defaultraise private
default sector
default capital on the strength of 
defaultits
default business and 
defaultits 
defaultability to repay.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government argues that this is impossible as it would count as government borrowing. This need not be the case; policy here is being driven by an artificial accounting convention rather that the interests of the company. 
defaultThe government has already show
defaultn that when it wants to 
defaultit
default can find
default ways for
default public bodies to borrow privately
default without 
defaultadding to
default government debt
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNetwork Rail is to all intents and purposes a public body. It has borrowed over £30bn from private markets and, despite 
defaultthe borrowing 
defaultbeing 
defaultunderwritten by the government, 
defaultit
default does not count as government debt. The level of borrowing required by Royal M
defaultail is negligible by comparison
default 
defaulta
defaultnd it would not need to be underwritten by government. Yet still the government claims that it is impossible fo
defaultr Royal Mail to borrow privately while remaining in the publ
defaultic sector. It is not impossible -
default it is a question of government will. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDebt vs
default.
default equity capital
default&#xa0;
defaultAfter much time spent arguing that privatisation was essential in order for Royal Mail to 
defaultaccess 
defaultprivate sector capital
default, the government and Royal Mail’s CEO have 
defaultagain
default shifted the argument to say that access to debt capital is not sufficient, only equity capital will do.
default&#xa0;
defaultBut Royal Mail will not be getting equity capital from a sale. Every indication 
defaultfrom the government has been that the proceeds of the sale will go to the Treasury. The alternative is 
defaultthat public funds will be used to 
defaultsweeten a privatisation deal by providing a subsidy to
default the company’s private owners.
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe 2011 EU 
defaultstate aid approval
default, a
defaultlong with pension deficit relief, 
defaultallowed the government to give
default write off 
defaultup to £1.1bn 
defaultof Royal Mail’s debt, 
defaultto restructure its balance sheet (this was on top of the transfer of the pension scheme). Earlier this year Royal Mail indicated that they had onl
defaulty so far received £150m. This means the government has the scope to provide up to £950m to support the owners of a privatised Royal Mail. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBut
default 
defaultthe European Commission did not grant this state aid to support privatisation; it was granted so that the 
defaultcompan
defaulty would be put on a sustainable footing
default.
default 
defaultState aid 
defaultapproval, crucially, did not require a commitment to a future change of ownership
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf such support goes ahead, it is not privatisation that is providing equity to Royal Mail, but the taxpayer. This might 
defaultbe appropriate if it means the retention of a valuable public service, but not if it means further subsidising the profits of a future 
defaultprivate
default owner.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhy is the government rushing?default&#xa0;
defaultThe government has said that it intends to proceed with 
defaultan IPO
default, though th
defaultere remain doubts as to whether that can be achieved in the artificially short time frame of the next seven months.
default Business and energy minister, Michael Fallon
default MP
default, took the unusual step in May 2013 of warning that Royal Mail may be sold to a foreign 
defaultbuyer
default if the progress of an IPO is threatened by opposition to privatisation
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a danger that the government’s rushed timeframe will mean that an 
defaultIPO would need to be priced low to
default ensure
default institutional investors
default 
defaultare attracted
default. If it fails then Royal 
defaultMail
default faces being sold at an even lower price to a private equity buyer who would be 
defaulteven 
defaultmore likely to cut services
default.
default The £1billion 
defaultit has been suggested 
defaultthe government 
defaultmight
default raise from the sale will do little to compensate for the upheaval and damage to s
defaultervices that will follow.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government has framed the arguments for privatisation in such a way as to suggest that Royal Mail faces imminent danger and privatisation is the only answer. This is simply not the case. Not only are there credibl
defaulte alternativ
defaultes to privatisation
default, but 
defaultthere is no 
defaultcrisis
default to solve. Yes, Royal Mail will need access to capital, but the urgency in the government’s case for privatisation is driven solely by its own political timetable and at the expense of Royal Mail and the interests
default of the public.
default&#xa0;
defaultPrivatisation is deeply unpopulardefault&#xa0;defaultPrivatisation 
defaultis deeply unpopular with the public and with Royal Mail’s employees.
default Royal M
defaultail needs its employees to continue to 
defaultengage
default in the modernisation and development of the company. A 
default10% employee 
defaultshare sc
defaultheme
default,
default whose purpose is supposed 
defaultto 
default“drive stronger staff engagement”
default in
default the company
default, 
defaultwill
default accompany 
defaultan IPO
default. But employees have spoken 
defaultloudly and clearly about their views on 
defaultthe future of 
defaultRoyal Mail – 96% are opposed to privatisation.
default&#xa0;
defaultRoyal Mail
default managers are also overwhelmingly opposed to privatisation. In a ballot of 6,000 Royal Mail managers, 71% voted in opposition to privatisation.
default&#xa0;
defaultDissatisfaction with the direction that Royal Mail is taking is evident in the business’s own employee 
defaultsurveys. Of 110,000 employees surveyed for Royal Mail by Ipsos Mori, only 28% have confidence in the decisions taken by senior management.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe universal service is under threatdefault&#xa0;defaultBe in no doubt, the universal service as we know it is under threat. The aff
defaultordable six-days-a-week universal service that is so valued in the UK is expensive to provide. 
defaultIt
default is under threat from competition and would be less secure in the hands of a privatised Royal Mail. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government claims that the universal service is enshr
defaultined in law, but this only covers 
defaultthe bare minimum
default; many aspects of the universal service are set by Ofcom and could easily be changed. And the government has only committed to leave the law unchanged for the duration of this 
defaultP
defaultarliament. In 
defaultless than
default two y
defaultears the government’s commitment runs out.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe legal minimum requirements of the universal service are for one collection and delivery of letters Monday to Saturday and one collection and delivery of packets every Monday to Friday at 
defaulta uniform and
default afforda
defaultble tariff.
default Almost
default 
defaulta
defaultll other aspects are open to change by Ofcom and do not require the agreement of Parliament. This means there is significant scope for the USO to be reduced while still remaining legally compliant; for example, as long as there is one p
defaultroduct (this could be a service slower than Second Class mail) priced at an affordable uniform tariff and that daily collections and deliveries continue, the legal requirements of the USO would be met. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe regulator has recently consulted on user needs f
defaultrom the universal service. It looked at ways the universal service could be changed to make it cheaper to run. These included getting rid of First Class mail (and therefore the next-day service), reducing quality of service standards and cutting delivery d
defaulta
defaultys from six to five a week. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDowngrading the universal service in such a way would disproportionately affect consumers in rural and hard
default-to-
defaultreach areas. Services outside the universal service would not be commercially justifiable and would either become 
defaultvery expensive or not be sustained. Equally if quality of service targets were loosened or removed for what remained of the universal service, this would disproportionately affect certain geographical areas
default;
default if fewer 
defaultletters are required to get to their destination within a certain time, it will inevitably be harder-to-reach locations that are affected.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn its recent review of user needs, Ofcom considered what would happen if quality of service standards for
default first class mail were reduced from the current 93% to 85% (the effect of removing Royal Mail’s air network) and said the following:
default&#xa0;
default“Removing the air network would primarily affect long distance mail, while local mail could continue to receive a high qua
defaultlity next-day service. As such, it would have a disproportionate impact on some parts of the country. While many areas in central England would still receive a service where over 90% of letters are delivered the next day, Scotland, Northern Ireland, South 
defaultWales and more parts of England could see First Class quality of service fall to just 50 to 75%.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe regulator recently stepped back from recommending any changes – possibly due to their politically sensitive nature – but it is very likely that we will see these issues revisited in the near future. A privately owned Royal Mail, under pressure to gener
defaultate a return for shareholders, 
defaultwill want
default to cut the burden of the universal service and
default will
default lobby for such changes.
default The
default privately 
defaultrun Post NL in the Netherlands has put pressure on both the regulator and the government regarding their univer
defaultsal service ob
defaultligations
default with the result that there are now plans to drop Monday deliveries.
default&#xa0;
defaultCutting pensions to boost privatizationdefault&#xa0;
defaultIn a further 
defaultmove to prepare Royal Mail for sale, the company is 
defaultproposing
default to 
defaultmake 
defaultnew
default 
defaultcut
defaults to
default 
defaultmembers’ 
defaultpension benefits. Following the
default transfer of the majority of the assets and liabilities in the Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) to government last year, a smaller scheme was left with Royal Mail with £2bn in assets to fund future benefit accrual. Now, just one year later, the company is ar
defaultguing that the cost of funding the scheme is higher than it anticipated and plans to cut the final salary link for pensionable service up to April 200
default8. 
defaultInstead 
defaultof
default increasing pension payments to meet its obligations it intends to use the assets left in the
default scheme to 
defaultsubsidise
default its pension contributions rather than paying for the salary link for which 
defaultthe funds were
default intended.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe CWU has rejected Royal Mail’s proposals and is exploring the legality of the compan
defaulty’s
default proposals. The union intends
default to approach th
defaulte European Commission to seek its view on the legality of the move, given the link to its approval of state aid. The union further believes the issue should be raised in Parliament and be subject to an appropriate inquiry.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCompetition in deliveries default&#xa0;defaultThe 
defaultCWU is challenging the model of competition in the postal market. 
defaultThe union wants
default to see a healthy postal market but 
defaultdoes
default not want to see competition at the expense of decent jobs.
default&#xa0;defaultRoyal Mail’s business model is now under threat from TNT’s entry into the 
defaultdirect delivery (end-to-end) market. TNT has se
defaultt up a delivery service in west, 
defaultcentral
default and now south west
default London
default.
default It is 
defaultable to win business because it can choose where, when and what to deliver, without any quality of service or performance standards and
default by undercutting the jobs, pay and conditions of postal workers across the UK.
default 
defaultThis model of competition means
default cherry picking the most profitable parts of Royal Mail’s business and
default cutting costs at the expense of decent jobs. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTNT employs workers on “zero
default-hours” contracts
default, which mean
default workers are not guaranteed any hours. One journalist who went undercover in a TNT depot reports how workers are forced to “hustle” each day to get a day’s work. Bosses over-hire staff to ensure that there will be more than eno
defaultugh people available for a shift, meaning 
defaultworkers get
default turned away. Workers never know whether they will get enough hours a week to make ends meet. Pay is only £7.10 ph in London, £1.45ph below the living wage.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultOfcom has stated that it is monitoring TNT’
defaults entry into the postal delivery market, but despite having powers to act conferred through the Postal Services Act 2011, it is choosing not to regulate to prevent TNT from cherry picking.
default&#xa0;
defaultRoyal Mail workers have voted overwhelmingly in favour of a boycot
defaultt of competitors’ mail in protest at the effect of competition on Royal Mail’s future ability to provide the universal service and
default in protest against
default a competitive model which is predicated on 
defaultlow
default wages and 
defaultpoor 
defaultterms and conditions across the postal indus
defaulttry.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is defaultan alternativedefault: A new model for Royal Maildefault&#xa0;defaultThere is a positive future for a strong Royal Mail which properly engages its employees. This will only happen through an approach to business operations which reflects 
defaultstrong values of public serv
defaultice
default and 
defaultwhich empowers
default employees to have a 
defaultgenuine
default say in the running of the company.
default&#xa0;
defaultSmall but important changes in the way Royal Mail operates can bring a strong sense of purpose to the company.
default 
defaultA new business model for Royal Mail should set out in clear terms the vision, values and operating model of the 
defaultbusiness
default, through a
default legally binding charter. This should include a
default commitment to public service, social obliga
defaulttions and the universal service.
default I
defaultt 
defaultsh
defaultould establish Royal Mail as a not-for-dividend
default company
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultA charter
default for Royal Mail
default should incorporate a new system of governance which ensure
defaults
default employees, customers and the public have a meaningful sa
defaulty in the way the company is run,
default 
defaultprovid
defaulting
default Royal Mail
default with the independence and the freedom from political interference to which the government aspires. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRoyal Mail’s results for 2012/13 show that it can raise investment capital through its own profits; this is a step towards becoming a self-financing, not-for-dividend company. Without changing ownership, Royal Mail could borrow from money markets, at a che
defaultaper rate, in line with companies like Network Rail. Such methods of investment operate throughout the 
defaultEU for government related entities such as Royal Mail.
default&#xa0;
defaultA new model for Royal Mail
default should 
defaultbe based on the following
