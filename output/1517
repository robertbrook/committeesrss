[normal]RMP 05[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by the Communication Workers’ Union ([bold]CWU)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Communication Workers’ Union (CWU) is the largest union in the communications sector in the UK, representing over 200,000 employees in the postal, telecoms and related industries. It is the recognised union in the Royal Mail Group for all non-managemen
[normal]t grades. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) published a report “Royal Mail: Sale of Shares”
[normal] on 10 July 2013 formally announcing t
[normal]he government
[normal]’s
[normal] intention to sell Royal Mail through an IPO before 31 March 2014.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The case for priva
[normal]tisation is confused and driven by a determination to see through an unpopular policy whatever the cost. Royal Mail
[normal] is not a company in crisis and
[normal] privatisation is not the 
[normal]way to secure the future of UK postal service
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Royal Mail is not a company in cris[bold]is[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The government has framed the arguments for privatisation in such a way as to suggest that Royal Mail faces imminent danger and privatisation is the only answer. This is simply not the case
[normal]. T
[normal]he urgency in the government’s case for privatisation is dri
[normal]ven solely by its own political timetable and at the expense of Royal Mail and the interests of the public.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Royal Mail is doing well in the public sector. The company has faced huge challenges in recent years, but modernisation, action on the pension deficit and changes to regulation 
[normal]have done much to turn
[normal] the company around
[normal]. 
[normal]There is still work to be done, but 
[normal]Royal Mail
[normal] is better placed to compete and is enjoying the benefits of 
[normal]employees’ 
[normal]commitment
[normal] to deliver
[normal]ing
[normal] its modernisation programme.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Why [bold]still [bold]insist on privatisation[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The 
[normal]arguments for privatisation have shifted over time to suit the 
[normal]government’s 
[normal]position
[normal]. 
[normal]Previously the government argued that privatisation was the only way Royal Mail could modernise and make money. Now that this no longer appears credible, the government says that 
[normal]it is the only way that 
[normal]Royal Mail can access 
[normal]private
[normal] sector
[normal] capital
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In 
[normal]2008 the Hooper report argued
[normal] that Royal Mail needed to 
[normal]be 
[normal]part sold to a strategic partner to bring in management expertise
[normal] and claimed that an IPO would not raise the required capital
[normal]. However, once these management issues were thought to be resolved, th
[normal]e 2010 Hooper report, produced for the coalition government, 
[normal]shifted its position and introduced a new recommendation of an IPO, this time on the basis of access to capital. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Access to capital
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Like any business, Royal Mail will need access to capital at 
[normal]some point in the future.
[normal] Also, like any business it should be able to borrow this privately. 
[normal]It does not need public investment and i
[normal]t does not need to compete 
[normal]-
[normal] as the government 
[normal]has suggested
[normal] in emotive terms - 
[normal]with 
[normal]hospitals and schools for scarce pub
[normal]lic resources
[normal]. As a viable company
[normal],
[normal] in the public just as much as in the private sector
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]it should be able to 
[normal]raise private
[normal] sector
[normal] capital on the strength of 
[normal]its
[normal] business and 
[normal]its 
[normal]ability to repay.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The government argues that this is impossible as it would count as government borrowing. This need not be the case; policy here is being driven by an artificial accounting convention rather that the interests of the company. 
[normal]The government has already show
[normal]n that when it wants to 
[normal]it
[normal] can find
[normal] ways for
[normal] public bodies to borrow privately
[normal] without 
[normal]adding to
[normal] government debt
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Network Rail is to all intents and purposes a public body. It has borrowed over £30bn from private markets and, despite 
[normal]the borrowing 
[normal]being 
[normal]underwritten by the government, 
[normal]it
[normal] does not count as government debt. The level of borrowing required by Royal M
[normal]ail is negligible by comparison
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal]nd it would not need to be underwritten by government. Yet still the government claims that it is impossible fo
[normal]r Royal Mail to borrow privately while remaining in the publ
[normal]ic sector. It is not impossible -
[normal] it is a question of government will. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Debt vs
[normal].
[normal] equity capital
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]After much time spent arguing that privatisation was essential in order for Royal Mail to 
[normal]access 
[normal]private sector capital
[normal], the government and Royal Mail’s CEO have 
[normal]again
[normal] shifted the argument to say that access to debt capital is not sufficient, only equity capital will do.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]But Royal Mail will not be getting equity capital from a sale. Every indication 
[normal]from the government has been that the proceeds of the sale will go to the Treasury. The alternative is 
[normal]that public funds will be used to 
[normal]sweeten a privatisation deal by providing a subsidy to
[normal] the company’s private owners.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he 2011 EU 
[normal]state aid approval
[normal], a
[normal]long with pension deficit relief, 
[normal]allowed the government to give
[normal] write off 
[normal]up to £1.1bn 
[normal]of Royal Mail’s debt, 
[normal]to restructure its balance sheet (this was on top of the transfer of the pension scheme). Earlier this year Royal Mail indicated that they had onl
[normal]y so far received £150m. This means the government has the scope to provide up to £950m to support the owners of a privatised Royal Mail. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]But
[normal] 
[normal]the European Commission did not grant this state aid to support privatisation; it was granted so that the 
[normal]compan
[normal]y would be put on a sustainable footing
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]State aid 
[normal]approval, crucially, did not require a commitment to a future change of ownership
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If such support goes ahead, it is not privatisation that is providing equity to Royal Mail, but the taxpayer. This might 
[normal]be appropriate if it means the retention of a valuable public service, but not if it means further subsidising the profits of a future 
[normal]private
[normal] owner.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Why is the government rushing?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The government has said that it intends to proceed with 
[normal]an IPO
[normal], though th
[normal]ere remain doubts as to whether that can be achieved in the artificially short time frame of the next seven months.
[normal] Business and energy minister, Michael Fallon
[normal] MP
[normal], took the unusual step in May 2013 of warning that Royal Mail may be sold to a foreign 
[normal]buyer
[normal] if the progress of an IPO is threatened by opposition to privatisation
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is a danger that the government’s rushed timeframe will mean that an 
[normal]IPO would need to be priced low to
[normal] ensure
[normal] institutional investors
[normal] 
[normal]are attracted
[normal]. If it fails then Royal 
[normal]Mail
[normal] faces being sold at an even lower price to a private equity buyer who would be 
[normal]even 
[normal]more likely to cut services
[normal].
[normal] The £1billion 
[normal]it has been suggested 
[normal]the government 
[normal]might
[normal] raise from the sale will do little to compensate for the upheaval and damage to s
[normal]ervices that will follow.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The government has framed the arguments for privatisation in such a way as to suggest that Royal Mail faces imminent danger and privatisation is the only answer. This is simply not the case. Not only are there credibl
[normal]e alternativ
[normal]es to privatisation
[normal], but 
[normal]there is no 
[normal]crisis
[normal] to solve. Yes, Royal Mail will need access to capital, but the urgency in the government’s case for privatisation is driven solely by its own political timetable and at the expense of Royal Mail and the interests
[normal] of the public.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Privatisation is deeply unpopular[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Privatisation 
[normal]is deeply unpopular with the public and with Royal Mail’s employees.
[normal] Royal M
[normal]ail needs its employees to continue to 
[normal]engage
[normal] in the modernisation and development of the company. A 
[normal]10% employee 
[normal]share sc
[normal]heme
[normal],
[normal] whose purpose is supposed 
[normal]to 
[normal]“drive stronger staff engagement”
[normal] in
[normal] the company
[normal], 
[normal]will
[normal] accompany 
[normal]an IPO
[normal]. But employees have spoken 
[normal]loudly and clearly about their views on 
[normal]the future of 
[normal]Royal Mail – 96% are opposed to privatisation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Royal Mail
[normal] managers are also overwhelmingly opposed to privatisation. In a ballot of 6,000 Royal Mail managers, 71% voted in opposition to privatisation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Dissatisfaction with the direction that Royal Mail is taking is evident in the business’s own employee 
[normal]surveys. Of 110,000 employees surveyed for Royal Mail by Ipsos Mori, only 28% have confidence in the decisions taken by senior management.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The universal service is under threat[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Be in no doubt, the universal service as we know it is under threat. The aff
[normal]ordable six-days-a-week universal service that is so valued in the UK is expensive to provide. 
[normal]It
[normal] is under threat from competition and would be less secure in the hands of a privatised Royal Mail. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The government claims that the universal service is enshr
[normal]ined in law, but this only covers 
[normal]the bare minimum
[normal]; many aspects of the universal service are set by Ofcom and could easily be changed. And the government has only committed to leave the law unchanged for the duration of this 
[normal]P
[normal]arliament. In 
[normal]less than
[normal] two y
[normal]ears the government’s commitment runs out.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The legal minimum requirements of the universal service are for one collection and delivery of letters Monday to Saturday and one collection and delivery of packets every Monday to Friday at 
[normal]a uniform and
[normal] afforda
[normal]ble tariff.
[normal] Almost
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal]ll other aspects are open to change by Ofcom and do not require the agreement of Parliament. This means there is significant scope for the USO to be reduced while still remaining legally compliant; for example, as long as there is one p
[normal]roduct (this could be a service slower than Second Class mail) priced at an affordable uniform tariff and that daily collections and deliveries continue, the legal requirements of the USO would be met. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The regulator has recently consulted on user needs f
[normal]rom the universal service. It looked at ways the universal service could be changed to make it cheaper to run. These included getting rid of First Class mail (and therefore the next-day service), reducing quality of service standards and cutting delivery d
[normal]a
[normal]ys from six to five a week. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Downgrading the universal service in such a way would disproportionately affect consumers in rural and hard
[normal]-to-
[normal]reach areas. Services outside the universal service would not be commercially justifiable and would either become 
[normal]very expensive or not be sustained. Equally if quality of service targets were loosened or removed for what remained of the universal service, this would disproportionately affect certain geographical areas
[normal];
[normal] if fewer 
[normal]letters are required to get to their destination within a certain time, it will inevitably be harder-to-reach locations that are affected.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In its recent review of user needs, Ofcom considered what would happen if quality of service standards for
[normal] first class mail were reduced from the current 93% to 85% (the effect of removing Royal Mail’s air network) and said the following:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Removing the air network would primarily affect long distance mail, while local mail could continue to receive a high qua
[normal]lity next-day service. As such, it would have a disproportionate impact on some parts of the country. While many areas in central England would still receive a service where over 90% of letters are delivered the next day, Scotland, Northern Ireland, South 
[normal]Wales and more parts of England could see First Class quality of service fall to just 50 to 75%.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The regulator recently stepped back from recommending any changes – possibly due to their politically sensitive nature – but it is very likely that we will see these issues revisited in the near future. A privately owned Royal Mail, under pressure to gener
[normal]ate a return for shareholders, 
[normal]will want
[normal] to cut the burden of the universal service and
[normal] will
[normal] lobby for such changes.
[normal] The
[normal] privately 
[normal]run Post NL in the Netherlands has put pressure on both the regulator and the government regarding their univer
[normal]sal service ob
[normal]ligations
[normal] with the result that there are now plans to drop Monday deliveries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cutting pensions to boost privatization[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In a further 
[normal]move to prepare Royal Mail for sale, the company is 
[normal]proposing
[normal] to 
[normal]make 
[normal]new
[normal] 
[normal]cut
[normal]s to
[normal] 
[normal]members’ 
[normal]pension benefits. Following the
[normal] transfer of the majority of the assets and liabilities in the Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) to government last year, a smaller scheme was left with Royal Mail with £2bn in assets to fund future benefit accrual. Now, just one year later, the company is ar
[normal]guing that the cost of funding the scheme is higher than it anticipated and plans to cut the final salary link for pensionable service up to April 200
[normal]8. 
[normal]Instead 
[normal]of
[normal] increasing pension payments to meet its obligations it intends to use the assets left in the
[normal] scheme to 
[normal]subsidise
[normal] its pension contributions rather than paying for the salary link for which 
[normal]the funds were
[normal] intended.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The CWU has rejected Royal Mail’s proposals and is exploring the legality of the compan
[normal]y’s
[normal] proposals. The union intends
[normal] to approach th
[normal]e European Commission to seek its view on the legality of the move, given the link to its approval of state aid. The union further believes the issue should be raised in Parliament and be subject to an appropriate inquiry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Competition in deliveries [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The 
[normal]CWU is challenging the model of competition in the postal market. 
[normal]The union wants
[normal] to see a healthy postal market but 
[normal]does
[normal] not want to see competition at the expense of decent jobs.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Royal Mail’s business model is now under threat from TNT’s entry into the 
[normal]direct delivery (end-to-end) market. TNT has se
[normal]t up a delivery service in west, 
[normal]central
[normal] and now south west
[normal] London
[normal].
[normal] It is 
[normal]able to win business because it can choose where, when and what to deliver, without any quality of service or performance standards and
[normal] by undercutting the jobs, pay and conditions of postal workers across the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]This model of competition means
[normal] cherry picking the most profitable parts of Royal Mail’s business and
[normal] cutting costs at the expense of decent jobs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]TNT employs workers on “zero
[normal]-hours” contracts
[normal], which mean
[normal] workers are not guaranteed any hours. One journalist who went undercover in a TNT depot reports how workers are forced to “hustle” each day to get a day’s work. Bosses over-hire staff to ensure that there will be more than eno
[normal]ugh people available for a shift, meaning 
[normal]workers get
[normal] turned away. Workers never know whether they will get enough hours a week to make ends meet. Pay is only £7.10 ph in London, £1.45ph below the living wage.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ofcom has stated that it is monitoring TNT’
[normal]s entry into the postal delivery market, but despite having powers to act conferred through the Postal Services Act 2011, it is choosing not to regulate to prevent TNT from cherry picking.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Royal Mail workers have voted overwhelmingly in favour of a boycot
[normal]t of competitors’ mail in protest at the effect of competition on Royal Mail’s future ability to provide the universal service and
[normal] in protest against
[normal] a competitive model which is predicated on 
[normal]low
[normal] wages and 
[normal]poor 
[normal]terms and conditions across the postal indus
[normal]try.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is [bold]an alternative[bold]: A new model for Royal Mail[bold]&#xa0;[bold]There is a positive future for a strong Royal Mail which properly engages its employees. This will only happen through an approach to business operations which reflects 
[normal]strong values of public serv
[normal]ice
[normal] and 
[normal]which empowers
[normal] employees to have a 
[normal]genuine
[normal] say in the running of the company.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Small but important changes in the way Royal Mail operates can bring a strong sense of purpose to the company.
[normal] 
[normal]A new business model for Royal Mail should set out in clear terms the vision, values and operating model of the 
[normal]business
[normal], through a
[normal] legally binding charter. This should include a
[normal] commitment to public service, social obliga
[normal]tions and the universal service.
[normal] I
[normal]t 
[normal]sh
[normal]ould establish Royal Mail as a not-for-dividend
[normal] company
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A charter
[normal] for Royal Mail
[normal] should incorporate a new system of governance which ensure
[normal]s
[normal] employees, customers and the public have a meaningful sa
[normal]y in the way the company is run,
[normal] 
[normal]provid
[normal]ing
[normal] Royal Mail
[normal] with the independence and the freedom from political interference to which the government aspires. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Royal Mail’s results for 2012/13 show that it can raise investment capital through its own profits; this is a step towards becoming a self-financing, not-for-dividend company. Without changing ownership, Royal Mail could borrow from money markets, at a che
[normal]aper rate, in line with companies like Network Rail. Such methods of investment operate throughout the 
[normal]EU for government related entities such as Royal Mail.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A new model for Royal Mail
[normal] should 
[normal]be based on the following
[normal]:

[normal] N
[normal]either the government nor Royal Mail has specified how much 
[normal]capital is needed, when it is needed or what it is needed for
[normal]. Also, there is no 
[normal]indication that selling Royal Mail will result in any additional capital for the company. Any revenue from a sale will go to the Treasury not the company.
