[normal]Written evidence from 
[normal]Alan Hardwick
[normal], 
[normal]Police and Crime Commissioner for Lincolnshire
[normal] [PCC Progress 31]
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.[bold]              [bold]The e[bold]ffectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area[bold]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]Through my 
[normal]Police and Crime P
[normal]lan, I have provided the Chief Constable with a clear statement of my priorities.  This has steered resource allocation and delivery of policing services.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he Chief Constable 
[normal]responded to the Police and Crime Plan by developing 
[normal]an Operational Policing Delivery Plan, which states
[normal],
[normal] “
[normal]This plan sets out how Lincolnshire Police, led by the Chief Constable, will use its resources to focus on those areas that you, through the PCC, have told us are the most important.”
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]No matter how effective a C
[normal]ommissioner
[normal] might be
[normal], the effectiveness of polic
[normal]ing
[normal] stands or falls by the abilities of the Chief Constable.  I have, on the whole, welcomed many of the reforms proposed by the Winsor Review.  Direct entry to the service is one of those.  However, it does not address the serious challenges of 
[normal]labour market 
[normal]supply we face at the senior levels of the service.  A sizeable proportion of recent Chief Constable recruitment
[normal] exercises
[normal] have elicited just a single candidate.  This is not only surprising for one of the most important and powerful roles in public service, but it is also unhealthy.  No matter what the calibre of candidates, any selection process benefits from choice.  
[normal]More importantly,
[normal] greater competition from highly skilled individuals would drive up standards. 
[normal] The service
[normal] need
[normal]s
[normal] to do more to develop 
[normal]its current and future senior leaders.  That will be achieved, in part, by bringing 
[normal]skills from outside 
[normal]through direct entry, although actual numbers of recruits through this route are, I suspect, likely to be minimal.  High flying executives, regardless of their public sector ethos are likely to feel their skills are significantly undervalued by a Superintendent’s salary.  We must therefore ensure 
[normal]that 
[normal]talented 
[normal]officer
[normal]s who spend their entire career
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]in the service receive the necessary development 
[normal]needed to 
[normal]lead large diverse organisations
[normal] through the challenging years ahead
[normal]. 
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]There is a significant choice here for the service and for politicians.  The skills and expertise police officers develop as they rise through the ranks are largely and inevitably focussed on the business of operational policing.  Wider business leadership skills in finance, ICT or asset management have not been an essential part of the operational toolkit for the career of a police Officer.  The strategic command course seeks to add these skills to aspiring Chief Officers.  The service must recognise that although there have been some very able Chief Officers who have good business skills that, by and large, the track record of organisational management has not been strong in policing.  Poor procurement, unfocussed management of ICT and assets and unsophisticated financial management have all been evident in some forces.  The challenge of austerity is such that we need leaders who can manage the ‘business’ of policing.  This is a big opportunity for Commissioners. In 
[normal]Lincolnshire
[normal] I have inherited a contract with a private sector partner overseen by my office and the force that delivers a range of skills to support operational policing. As a country we need to consider how we ensure police forces have access to good business skills and leadership.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold]              [bold]The role of commissioners in holding their chief constables to account[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]The Police and Crime Plan and Operational Policing Delivery Plan provide the basis for a robust performance management framework enabling me to exercise my duty to hold to account.  I have developed a hierarchy of key performance indicators against which I track performance.  These are not targets but do indicate my expectations about the performance of 
[normal]Lincolnshire
[normal] police.  I find the political rhetoric around target setting unhelpful and it belies the fact that one cannot hold someone to account without clearly setting expectations.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]I have monthly meetings with the Chief Officer team, specifically dedicated to reviewing performance data.  This enables me to have a firm grasp on those areas of performance where the most recent data or an emerging trend indicates action needs to be taken.  As an example, this approach led a rising trend in shop-lifting to be visible to me, enabled me to discuss with senior officers their plans for addressing it and monitor and challenge the impact their actions were having.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold]              [bold]The role of police and crime panels in holding[bold] their commissioners to account[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]I believe that a strong and effective Police and Crime Panel is an essential check and balance on the powers vested in the Police and Crime Commissioner but to be strong and effective Police and Crime Panels need to focus on their role of supporting and scrutinising the Commissioner’s decisions. 
[normal]The focus of the Lincolnshire
[normal] Police and Crime P
[normal]anel has been predominantly on areas which fall into the domain of operational policing. I do not believe this experience is unique to 
[normal]Lincolnshire
[normal].  It is understandable that local councillors want to hold someone to account over the delivery of policing services at a local
[normal] level
[normal], but the Police and Crime Panel is not the correct venue for that.  
[normal]Scrutiny, when properly conducted, should be a constructive exercise and in the case of Commissioners it should be focussed on those decisions a commissioner makes, rather than those made by his or her Chief Constable.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold]              [bold]The division of functions and staff between commissioners and chief constables following the Stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform and[bold] Social Responsibility Act 2011[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]I remain supportive of the legislative intent 
[normal]that chief constables manage the day to day operations of their Force and must have access to the resources needed to do so.  But I
[normal] must place on record the perhaps unintended consequence of 
[normal]Stage 2 
[normal]transfer; 
[normal]i.e. 
[normal]the additional financial burden this will place o
[normal]n the taxpayer.  Both I and my Chief C
[normal]onstable remain of the view that the intent of the legislation could have been met without a transfer of staff.  However, I was informed by the Policing Minister that a proposal which did not involve a transfer of staff was unlikely to be approved by the Home Secretary.  As a result, we amended our jointly agreed proposal to one in which the majority of staff will transfer to the Chief Constable.  We estimate that, in our case, the employment of staff by both the Chief Constable and Police and Crime Commissioner will incur one-off costs of approximately £150,000 and similar annual recurring costs
[normal] for little or no benefit.  This is not a good result for the taxpayer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.[bold]              [bold]The role of commissioner[bold]s in budget and precept setting[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]It is essential that 
[normal]P
[normal]olice and 
[normal]C
[normal]rime 
[normal]C
[normal]ommissioners have an unfettered ability to propose 
[normal]a
[normal] level of precept which they believe 
[normal]is necessary to
[normal] deliver the commitments they have made to their communities.  It is absolutely right that the Police and Crime Panel’s power of veto is available as a check and balance
[normal] and, of course, the ultimate check and balance is the ballot box
[normal].  However it is a failure of localism when Government sets a 
[normal]precept increase 
[normal]threshold 
[normal]which
[normal], if exceeded, triggers a referendum.   
[normal]Parliament has 
[normal]a very clear view about the concept of referenda in respect of decisions that are rightly those for Parliament to make.  Why is it deemed right to take a differing approach in police governance?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]A commitment I have made to the people of 
[normal]Lincolnshire
[normal] is to secure fairer funding for the County’s police service.  The inequity in the current arrangements cannot continue.  There is significant variation across the Country in the proportion of their budget that Commissioners have to raise from the Council Tax; and the police grant formula is no longer, and some would argue never was, fit for purpose. There is no doubt that it discriminates against sparsely populated rural areas like 
[normal]Lincolnshire
[normal] for the very reasons it should be supporting them.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]The great success of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 is the advent of democracy in a hugely important part of public service.  As a Commissioner I spend much of my week talking and corresponding with the people of 
[normal]Lincolnshire
[normal].  I am therefore in a position where I can promote local policing priorities because, unlike police authorities, I know what they are.  The ability to impact on the work of partners across the criminal justice sector, and do so with a democratic mandate, is also hugely impactful on service areas which have not always bathed in the light of public accountability.  It is disappointing therefore when HM Government has not engaged as fully as it might have done with Commissioners on areas such as the transforming rehabilitation agenda. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.1
[normal]              
[normal]Our recently commissioned inspection of the 
[normal]East Midlands
[normal] collaboration arrangements by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) has confirmed we remain at the forefront of police collaboration.  There is still much more for us to do, but that leaves others with even more ground to make up.  HMIC are right in placing an emphasis on collaboration in terms of the financial savings it can generate, but for me there is a much bigger prize in terms of resilience  and I am convinced that it can deliver more efficient and effective services and make a difference to our communities.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]              
[normal]In its final year, Lincolnshire Police Authority entered into our strategic partnership with the private sector.  Our contract with G4S continues to deliver for the County, not only financial savings in excess of those anticipated, but also improved levels of service in areas such as 999 answering and response times.  We are now building on our success by looking to better utilise technology to free up police officer time; understanding and increasing police officer productivity remains key to the public obtaining best value from their police service.  Our strategic partner is currently trialling a range of mobile devices and I have personally approved a trial of mobile fingerprinting technology which, in a County such as Lincolnshire, has the potential to save thousands of police officer hours by allowing verification of fingerprints against the national database “on-the-road” without the need for an officer to return to a police station.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]8.[bold]              [bold]Transparency of and report[bold]ing by commissioners to date[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1
[normal]              
[normal]For me transparency goes far beyond the publication of expenses and expenditure or the visibility of decision making.  For those of us in public service, all that we do should be clear and unambiguous to the public whom we serve.  In particular our standards of behaviour and our rationale for our conduct should be in public view, not least because most people in the 
[normal]United Kingdom
[normal] have a very clear view about what they believe to be right and wrong and draw a very definite distinction between the two.  
[normal]I 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]welcome
[normal]d
[normal] the Committee’s work last year on Leadership and Standards.  The work of the 
[normal]College
[normal] of 
[normal]Policing
[normal] on a Code of Ethics is also to be 
[normal]viewed positively
[normal], althoug
[normal]h I question how effectively the C
[normal]ode will be embedded in the service when there remains an overreliance on outdated and ineffectual police regulations.  The Committee’s investigation into “plebgate” demonstrated that despite the existence of regulations, 
[normal]certain 
[normal]police officers still conduct th
[normal]emselves in a manner which 
[normal]the public found incompatible with their office
[normal],
[normal] and it would appear because of those regulations, inappropriate conduct has gone unchallenged.  
[normal]This has to change if confidence is to be retained in a police service founded on the principle of consent.
