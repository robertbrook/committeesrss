"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Oil &amp; Gas UK (CCS21)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;IntroductionOil &amp; Gas UK is the principal trade association for the offshore oil and gas exploration and production industry in the United \nKingdom, with more than 370 member companies, comprising oil and gas operators and investors and a broad spectrum of the supply chain: contractors, suppliers, law firms and consultants.  We have pleasure in submitting our evidence to the Energy and Climate\n Change Committee’s inquiry into heat.\n&#xa0;\nIn world-wide terms, the use of coal for power generation purposes provides the largest source of CO\n2\n and other\n \natmospheric\n emissions.  Almost 50% of the rise in energy consumption during the past 10 years has been o\nf coal; electricity is the fastest growing end use of energy.  This growth is continuing, especially in such countries as China and India.  Therefore, in climate change terms, a solution to \nemissions from \ncoal-fired power station\ns\n is required more than any\nthing else.\n  \nIn the first instance, using gas instead of coal for power generation has substantial advantages (see below on p. 2).  Furthermore, i\nf CCS can be made to work at power station scale with coal, the same can be done with gas and almost certainly\n at a lower cost per unit of electricity generated.\n&#xa0;\nThe graph below\n, from ExxonMobil’s \n2013 O\nutlook for Energy: a view to 2040\n,\n shows the difference between \nactual and \nforecast energy demand of OECD countries and that of non-OECD countries, illustrating t\nhe \nneed for CCS or equivalent technologies\n vividly.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCarbon Capture and StorageCarbon capture and storage \n(CCS) \nis a technology which is already working at modest industrial scale in several locations, but not yet \nwith\n \nlarge \npower station\ns\n.  It needs \nto be proven at power station scale.\n  \nThere are \ntwo \nmain forms of CCS, pre- and post-combustion.  It is not within our expertise to judge the relative merits of these two, but, given the number of large coal fired power plants \nthat already exist around\n the\n world, it seems to us that post-combustion CCS technology should be an \nimperative.  \nAs mentioned above\n, if CCS can be made to work with coal at a reasonable cost, it \ncan be done with gas and almost certainly\n \nat a lower cost per unit of electricity generat\ned.\n&#xa0;\nTherefore, we welcome the government’s \ncontinued \ncommitment to its CCS competition and sincerely hope that this second one proves more successful than the first.  In addition, we are pleased that a gas-fired power station\n, Peterhead in N.E. Scotland,\n \nis one of the two short listed projects.\n  Modern gas-fired power plants have \nconsiderable\n advantages over coal:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGiv\nen the extent of closures of oil-, coal- and early gas-fired and nuclear power stations durin\ng the next 10 years (\na substantial proportion of base-load power), w\ne believe that large scale, \ngas-fired generation is going to be needed in the UK for longer than is generally envisaged, in order to maintain secure supplies of electricity.  Therefore, proving CCS with gas has strategic benefits for this country.\n&#xa0;\nTerms of ReferenceWith respect to \nthe various questions posed in the Committee’s terms of reference, we offer the following information and comments:\ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccording to the developers, \nSSE and Shell, \nthe project at Peterhead is expected to reduce CO\n2\n emissions by up to 90%, depending on the operating conditions.  Given that the power generation sector of the economy is the largest source of emissions, \nas it is in world-wide terms, \nthe potential\n of CCS seems obvious.\nii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn its \nWorld Energy Outlook\n publish\ned each November, the IEA has repeatedly pointed to the need for CCS and the extra cost of tackling climate change without such technology.\niii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is likely that CCS will be required to be developed for both new applications and for retro-fitting to existing p\nower plants.\n  Given the number of coal fired power stations world-wide, arguably retro-fitting is the more urgent.\niv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf proven with power stations at reasonable cost, it would be logical then to apply CCS to major industrial plants.\nv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrently, the cost of CC\nS is unknown\n at power station scale\n.  There have been various studies, so an important part of any demonstration project arising from the government’s current competition would be to establish the costs and how these might be reduced through subsequent sta\nges of development.\nvi)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn our opinion, following this first, demonstration stage, there will need to be at least one more development/pre-production stage before the technology would be available for \nmore \nwidespread implementation.\nvii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRefining the technology and\n reducing the costs so that they are manageable will be crucial to the success of CCS.  However, there will inevitably be a considerable degree of learning by doing.\nviii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn advantage of using CCS with a gas-fired power plant is that the volume of CO\n2\n is much l\ness than with coal and so \nthe storage requirements and \nall related infrastructure can be smaller.\nix)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur member companies are well placed to undertake the storage part of CCS, with their knowledge of submarine reservoirs and offshore operations.\n&#xa0;\nNonetheless,\n in the next 10-15 years, the most effective and affordable way to reduce emissions from power generation is to switch from coal to gas, as has happened in the USA in recent years where emissions have fallen more than anywhere else.  In this regard, a tonn\ne of CO\n2\n not emitted today is a tonne not emitted for ever.\n&#xa0;\nWe trust that this submission is helpful to the Committee’s inquiry.  If there are any queries relating to our submission, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n  NOx and SOx: oxides of nitrogen and sulphur respectively.\n"
