"&#xa0;\nOAR0014&#xa0;Written Evidence submitted by Robert Loe, Education Research DirectorRelational Schools Project, Relational Research &#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1. Introduction&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0; \nRelational Research is just beginning a three year project seeking to understand \nschool academic \nsuccess\n by focusing on \nstakeholder relationships\n. \nSchools involve a wide \nrange of internal and external stakeholders and there is a matrix of relationships in any school (and from school to school): these include students, teachers, support staff, educational specialists, administrators, governors, parents, local communities, f\naith communities (in some instances), local and central government and society at large.\n \nRelational Research\n and Relationships Foundation \nendeavour\n \nto influence public policy and organisational pr\nactice with a relational agenda\n.\n \nThe aim is to build ‘relati\nonal capital’ in the lives of families and communities through the way organisations and structures are\n \narranged\n, and through the\n goals they set for themselves.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0; \nWe want \nto understand the means by which relational practice can be fostered in schools. \nWe wish to \ndetermine ways in which schools and students can be assessed for their relational understanding and competence.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0; \nWe are interested in the ways in which the interconnection of key stakeholders intersect at critical stages in a student’s school ca\nreer, establishing ways of evaluating how such impact is manifested, with a view to transferring emergent understanding to other students, and to thus support successful outcomes.\n We provide practical help to schools to intervene and encourage greater prox\nimity between the key stakeholders in education and thus improve student outcomes. We have worked \nsuccessfully i\nn \nvarious\n \npublic service settings such as primary health care and \nprisons\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0; \nThe Chief Inspector of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, makes several recommendations in response to issues and concerns raised in the Annual Report relating \nto the performance of schools; w\ne would like to highlight a neglected element. \nIn a recent session \nof \nth\ne \ncommittee\n the chair, Graham Stuart MP, highlighted this fundamental neglected element with Sir Michael Wi\nl\nshaw asking specific questions on the subject of “\nquality relationships\n” which in his words need addressing. He stated, “\nEvery time we look at chi\nldren struggling in this country, it’s the quality of relationships with adults which comes back again and again as the thing they’re craving. What is there around organisations and fermenting and supporting these organisations which could lead to the comm\nunity coming back again?\n” Mr Stuart’s \ninterest\n is one we share: wishing for people to be good citizens it is not enough; \n“\nwe are going to have to find some kind of policy approach to facilitate more high quality relationships between adults and children\n.”\n&#xa0;2. Strengthening relationships in the home and school&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0; \nThe most critical need \nis the problems\n created by poor or dysfunctional relationships which leads to low levels of motivation and achievement of pupils in schools, and conflict and/or loneliness among communities, families and individuals across society (which we refer to as ‘relational povert\ny’). The correlation between relational breakdown in the home and poor educational outcomes is well documented. Parents from such backgrounds are often\n, \nbut not exclusively\n,\n in housing and community contexts which make it hard for positive relationships to\n be sustained\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0; \nE\nvidence from Feinstein and Symons suggests that parental involvement with education \n(which is defined here as the amount of time and quality of an interaction with a child rather than traditional measures of engagement such as attendance a\nt parent/consultation evenings or participation in committees) is\n the, ‘\nsingle greatest predictor of achievement\n’\n; \nand most importantly\n,\n factors such as the educational experience of a parent or the socio-economic context of the home \ncan be\n counterbalanced by strong productive relationships. True parental engagement is \n(perhaps) \nnot with the school but with the child. Supporting and intervening in this relationship is considered vital.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0; \nEvidence from those like Bergin and Bergin \n(2009) \ndemon\nstrate that students\n who develop positive relationships with teachers \nachieve stronger academic outcomes.\n Where strong relationships are fostered between teachers and students, evidence suggests that poor or dysfunctional relationships in the home can be p\nartially compensated for\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0; \nConversely, r\nesearch by the Centre for Social Justice \n(2000) \nsuggests that over two-thirds of all those who truanted did so in order to avoid a particular lesson, with ‘\nrelationship with the teacher\n’ cited as one of the principal\n grounds for relational breakdown.\n Where relationships are strong in the classroom, they can \nsurmount \nsocial inequality; where they are poor or dysfunctional, evidence suggests they reinforce educational disadvantage.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0; \nPositive peer to peer relationships a\nlso impact on student’s academic and non-academic functioning in secondary education. Positive peer interaction correlates well with \nstudent\n motivation (Furrer and Skinner, 2003), \nstudent\n engagement (Keefe and Berndt, 1996) and academic \noutcomes\n (Keefe and\n Berndt, 1995).\n&#xa0;\n3. Policy Recommendations&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nSchools should be supported to provide more robust assessment of the relationships that sustain their performance.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nOfsted should review the extent to which schools are able to effectively evaluate \nrelationships and identify means of improving them.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nGiven the importance of relationships for the provision of schooling (and other policy outcomes) the Department for Education should report on the extent to which it sees relationships as a limiting \nfactor in school improvement and how such relationships might be improved.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n Feinstein, L. &amp; Symons, J.
