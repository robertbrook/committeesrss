[normal]In the 
[normal]2012 
[normal]study published in the Marine Pollution Bulletin
[normal]  
[normal]“Occurrence of micro-plastics in
[normal] gastrointestinal tracts of pelagic and demersal fish from the English Channel” it was shown that the majority of pl
[normal]astic particles consumed by the fish
[normal] were rayon (57.8%) and polyester fibres. These are derived from clothes, hygiene products and nappies. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Micro-plastics are not therefore necessarily derived from plastic bags 
[normal]n
[normal]or even from packaging of all types
[normal]- which normally use polyethylene and polypropylene.  Nor have they
[normal] been 
[normal]shown 
[normal]to absorb toxins to any greater extent than other particles in the 
[normal]sea
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Oxo-biodegradable plastics do not contribute to pollution - on the contrary, they are bioassimilated into the bio-background.  This is because the material descends to 
[normal]low molecular-
[normal]weight materials much more quickly than normal plastic.  At that sta
[normal]ge they are no longer plastics and have become biodegradable in the same way as a leaf
[normal] or seaweed
[normal]. They do not therefore float around in the sea for decades absorbing other materials.

[normal]O
[normal]xo-biodegradable plastics are not intended to deal with
[normal] litter in 
[normal]homes and 
[normal]offices.  They are designed to biodegrade in the open environment when exposed to natural phenomena such as wind, rain, sunlight, etc and to do so in a synergistic relationship to micro-organisms naturally occurring in the open environ
[normal]ment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The theory of absorption of toxins by micro-plastics is still a theory. At the University of Washington Tacoma seminar (Autumn 2008)
[normal] Prof. Thompson was reported as using the language of opinion rather than fact;-
[normal]“Thompson’s research and various st
[normal]udies have 
[normal]suggested
[normal] that plastic specks in the water column and sediment 
[normal]appear
[normal] to absorb highly toxic and pervasive pollutants, such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and pesticides such as DDT (once commonly used to eradicate agricultural and forest p
[normal]ests, and now banned in the United States and other countries). As one 
[normal]theory
[normal] goes, if the oceans’ smallest organisms are dining on plastics dosed up with toxins, then highly concentrated chemicals 
[normal]could possibly
[normal] accumulate up the food chain.”
[normal]Discussion[bold]1-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) had been widely used globally up until the early 1970’s as additives in many product groups such as plastics, lubricating oils, greases and electrical installations. Their properties of low conductivity, high heat resistance
[normal] and chemical stability has meant that they had been known to persist in the environment, but they have now been banned in many countries. One reason for the ban was the persistence of such toxins in the sea surface micro layer of the marine environment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The following
[normal] summary review demonstrates that it is highly improbable for oxo-
[normal]bio
[normal]degradable plastic materials to adsorb and accumulate these toxins in the marine environment. 
[normal]Review[bold]3-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Several studies have been 
[normal]done
[normal], including those by Pascall 
[normal]et al,
[normal] Takad
[normal]a 
[normal]et al
[normal], Mato 
[normal]et al
[normal] and Teuten 
[normal]et al
[normal], which demonstrate that 
[normal]conventional 
[normal]polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene will readily adsorb PCB and other toxins. 
[normal]This is because the polymers are inherently non-
[normal]polar and hydrophobic in nature, 
[normal]and
[normal] with a 
[normal]low Tg (glass transition temperature), their rubbery nature allows for greater segmental mobility, pore-size, free volume, diffusion and partition coefficients. This means that hydrophobic organic toxins such as PCB 
[normal]can
[normal] 
[normal]in theory 
[normal]adsorb to the polymers (th
[normal]rough Van Der Waals attractive forces) from the aqueous environment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The increased pore-size and free volume also means that 
[normal]if
[normal] the toxin is adsorbed to the polymer, it will not readily desorb, 
[normal]and 
[normal]thus over 
[normal]long 
[normal]periods of time the polymer will  break
[normal] 
[normal]d
[normal]own by shear, friction and weathering, 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]potential for the plastic material to adsorb 
[normal]toxins is present
[normal]. Takada 
[normal]et al
[normal] demonstrated that in
[normal] a field experiment in Tokyo Bay 
[normal]conventional 
[normal]plastic fragments collected from the bay had 
[normal]adsorbed up to 892 
[normal]ng
[normal]/g. This 
[normal]suggest
[normal]ed
[normal] that t
[normal]he plastic had persisted in that
[normal] area for at least 
[normal]twenty-
[normal]seven years (assuming a linear uptake profile).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Pascall
[normal] et al included polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene in their study. The results from their field experiments demonstrated a significantly lower adsorption uptake of PCB toxin. The difference in chemical structure resulting in differing polarity of the polym
[normal]er, more rigid packing (demonstrated by higher Tg) resulting in restricted segmental mobility, and restricted pore size explains the reduced adsorption observed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This information helps to build a picture of what would be expected for oxo-
[normal]bio
[normal]degradable pol
[normal]ymer materials. Under the action of oxygen, UV light, and 
[normal]moderate 
[normal]heat, polyethylene and polypropylene containing oxo-
[normal]bio
[normal]degradable additives will change their 
[normal]molecular structure 
[normal]and break down by a mechanism analogous to that shown in Figure 1.

[normal]7-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Figure 1 demonstrates how hydroperoxy intermediates are readily formed in the initial phase of degradation, 
[normal]and 
[normal]immediately there is a change in chemica
[normal]l structure and increase in polarity. The formation of these oxygenated species already makes the polymer 
[normal]less attractive to adsorption of
[normal] PCB and related hydrophobic toxins. Lower diffusion and partition coefficients result from increased cohesive forces,
[normal] reducing segmental mobility and pore-size. The highly polar functional groups that are formed
[normal] will not interact with the non-
[normal]polar toxins either through chemical reaction or intermolecular interaction.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The second stage of degradation is the molecular-wei
[normal]ght reduction of the hydroperoxy intermediates (with the vicinal form proceeding more rap
[normal]idly) to 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]intermediate and short-
[normal]chain aldehydes, ketones, esters, and hydroxyl and hydrocarbon radicals. These will proceed further to carboxylic acids which will be
[normal] readily bioassimilated by 
[normal]micro-
[normal]organisms. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10-
[normal] 
[normal]In summary the constantly 
[normal]progressing
[normal] chemical breakdown of the polymer results in species with increased hydrophilic character that will readily solubilise and emulsify in the ocean environment. It would, ther
[normal]efore, not be possible for hydrophobic toxins such as PCB to accumulate on oxo-degradable plastic materials
[normal]Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;[bold]11-
[normal] 
[normal]It is 
[normal]sometimes suggested 
[normal]that plastic materials, in particular polyethylene and polypropylene, will adsorb and accumulate hydrophobic toxins that can be found in the sea surface micro layer. 
[normal]However i
[normal]n this 
[normal]review 
[normal]it has been 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12-
[normal] 
[normal]shown
[normal] that such plastics when treated with additives 
[normal]such as d
[normal]2
[normal]w will change their chemical and physical properties during degradation and that hydrophobic toxins will not be readily 
[normal]ad
[normal]sorbed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13-
[normal] 
[normal]There is, therefore, no reason why oxo-
[normal]bio
[normal]degradable plastic materials would provide a route for hydrophobic toxin
[normal] accumulation and the potential to harm marine life
[normal]-
[normal]forms, or provide an entry route for these chemicals into the human food chain. No experimental evidence has been published that links oxo-
[normal]bio
[normal]degradable plastic materials with the accumulation of persiste
[normal]nt hydrophobic toxins in the 
[normal]oceans.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14-
[normal] 
[normal]Oxo-biodegradable plastics can therefore play a useful role in reducing plastic pollution of the oceans. Indeed if all the plastic had been made with oxo-biodegradable technology there would be no ocean garbage patches

[normal]Mr. Martin Schulz MEP,
[normal]President,
[normal]European Parliament,
[normal]Rue Wiertz,
[normal]Bruxelles
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18
[normal]th
[normal] December 2013 
[normal]president@ep.europa.eu
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Dear Mr. Schulz,
[normal]We are very concerned by the assertions in para 5, of the Motion proposed by Mr. Prodi, 
[normal]on a 
[normal]European strategy on plastic waste in the environment (2013/2113(INI))
[normal] 
[normal]which was accepted on 27
[normal]th
[normal] November in the Environment Committee of the Parliament, and is expected to be voted in Plenary on 13
[normal]th
[normal] January.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Paragraph 5 is defamatory of our members and
[normal] their products, and is an unjustified attack on a whole industry which employs very many people.  Members of the Parliament should not be allowed to use their parliamentary protection from legal action to 
[normal]commit defamation, and it is for that reason that 
[normal]we are bringing this to your attention as President.
[normal]  I trust that Members will have the opportunity to reconsider this ill-advised paragraph in Plenary, and to consider a motion to amend it which I understand will be made.
[normal]There is no evidence that oxo-bi
[normal]odegradable plastic is ‘dangerous’ nor that it is ‘disruptive to human health’ or the environment, nor that it contains heavy metals. 
[normal]T
[normal]he scientific evidence
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] that oxo-biodegradable plastic 
[normal](as distinct from bio-based plastic) 
[normal]does not
[normal] make recycling pr
[normal]ocesses more difficult
[normal]. 
[normal]These claims, which are central to the Motion, are false and seriously misleading.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is no evidence in the Commission’s Green Paper on plastic waste in the environment to support these allegations
[normal]In 
[normal]February 2011 a Life Cycle
[normal] Assessment
[normal] by Intertek was published by the UK Environment Agency which shows that oxo-biodegradable plastic bags have a better LCA than paper bags or compostable plastic bags.  In May 2012 a further LCA by Intertek
[normal] included the litter metric and compar
[normal]ed oxo-biodegradable plastic with bio-based plastic and conventional plastic.  It put oxo ahead in its potential to reduce the plastic waste problem and its less harmful impact on the environment and on global warming.    In its ability to reduce plastic l
[normal]itter, oxo-bio scored 75% better than conventional plastic, and bio-based plastics were worse than oxo in all 11 environmental impact categories.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Oxo-biodegradation causes the plastic to convert at the end of its useful life in the presence of oxygen into
[normal] a biodegradable material.  
[normal]This process has been studied in depth at the Technical Research Institute of Sweden and the Swedish University of Agricultural Scienc
[normal]es, and a
[normal] peer-reviewed report of the work was published in Vol
[normal].
[normal] 96 of the journal of Polymer 
[normal]Degradation &amp; Stability (2011) at page 919-928.  It shows 91% biodegradation in a soil environment within 24 months, in accordance with ISO 17556
[normal] and it does NOT therefore leave fragments of plastic in the environment. The fragments found in the oceans, an
[normal]d those found to have been ingested by birds and fish are fragments of ordinary plastic.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Oxo-biodegradable plastic does NOT contain heavy metals.  It is designed so that it will NOT degrade in anaerobic conditions and will NOT therefore generate methane.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is no justification for the claim that ox
[normal]o-biodegradable plastics should 
[normal]be phased out of the market or banned outright, as soon as possible before 2020 or at all.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yours sincerely,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
