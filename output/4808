defaultIn the 
default2012 
defaultstudy published in the Marine Pollution Bulletin
default  
default“Occurrence of micro-plastics in
default gastrointestinal tracts of pelagic and demersal fish from the English Channel” it was shown that the majority of pl
defaultastic particles consumed by the fish
default were rayon (57.8%) and polyester fibres. These are derived from clothes, hygiene products and nappies. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMicro-plastics are not therefore necessarily derived from plastic bags 
defaultn
defaultor even from packaging of all types
default- which normally use polyethylene and polypropylene.  Nor have they
default been 
defaultshown 
defaultto absorb toxins to any greater extent than other particles in the 
defaultsea
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultOxo-biodegradable plastics do not contribute to pollution - on the contrary, they are bioassimilated into the bio-background.  This is because the material descends to 
defaultlow molecular-
defaultweight materials much more quickly than normal plastic.  At that sta
defaultge they are no longer plastics and have become biodegradable in the same way as a leaf
default or seaweed
default. They do not therefore float around in the sea for decades absorbing other materials.

defaultO
defaultxo-biodegradable plastics are not intended to deal with
default litter in 
defaulthomes and 
defaultoffices.  They are designed to biodegrade in the open environment when exposed to natural phenomena such as wind, rain, sunlight, etc and to do so in a synergistic relationship to micro-organisms naturally occurring in the open environ
defaultment.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe theory of absorption of toxins by micro-plastics is still a theory. At the University of Washington Tacoma seminar (Autumn 2008)
default Prof. Thompson was reported as using the language of opinion rather than fact;-
default“Thompson’s research and various st
defaultudies have 
defaultsuggested
default that plastic specks in the water column and sediment 
defaultappear
default to absorb highly toxic and pervasive pollutants, such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and pesticides such as DDT (once commonly used to eradicate agricultural and forest p
defaultests, and now banned in the United States and other countries). As one 
defaulttheory
default goes, if the oceans’ smallest organisms are dining on plastics dosed up with toxins, then highly concentrated chemicals 
defaultcould possibly
default accumulate up the food chain.”
defaultDiscussiondefault1-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) had been widely used globally up until the early 1970’s as additives in many product groups such as plastics, lubricating oils, greases and electrical installations. Their properties of low conductivity, high heat resistance
default and chemical stability has meant that they had been known to persist in the environment, but they have now been banned in many countries. One reason for the ban was the persistence of such toxins in the sea surface micro layer of the marine environment. 
default&#xa0;
default2-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe following
default summary review demonstrates that it is highly improbable for oxo-
defaultbio
defaultdegradable plastic materials to adsorb and accumulate these toxins in the marine environment. 
defaultReviewdefault3-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSeveral studies have been 
defaultdone
default, including those by Pascall 
defaultet al,
default Takad
defaulta 
defaultet al
default, Mato 
defaultet al
default and Teuten 
defaultet al
default, which demonstrate that 
defaultconventional 
defaultpolymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene will readily adsorb PCB and other toxins. 
defaultThis is because the polymers are inherently non-
defaultpolar and hydrophobic in nature, 
defaultand
default with a 
defaultlow Tg (glass transition temperature), their rubbery nature allows for greater segmental mobility, pore-size, free volume, diffusion and partition coefficients. This means that hydrophobic organic toxins such as PCB 
defaultcan
default 
defaultin theory 
defaultadsorb to the polymers (th
defaultrough Van Der Waals attractive forces) from the aqueous environment. 
default&#xa0;
default4-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe increased pore-size and free volume also means that 
defaultif
default the toxin is adsorbed to the polymer, it will not readily desorb, 
defaultand 
defaultthus over 
defaultlong 
defaultperiods of time the polymer will  break
default 
defaultd
defaultown by shear, friction and weathering, 
defaultand
default 
defaultthe 
defaultpotential for the plastic material to adsorb 
defaulttoxins is present
default. Takada 
defaultet al
default demonstrated that in
default a field experiment in Tokyo Bay 
defaultconventional 
defaultplastic fragments collected from the bay had 
defaultadsorbed up to 892 
defaultng
default/g. This 
defaultsuggest
defaulted
default that t
defaulthe plastic had persisted in that
default area for at least 
defaulttwenty-
defaultseven years (assuming a linear uptake profile).
default&#xa0;
default5-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPascall
default et al included polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene in their study. The results from their field experiments demonstrated a significantly lower adsorption uptake of PCB toxin. The difference in chemical structure resulting in differing polarity of the polym
defaulter, more rigid packing (demonstrated by higher Tg) resulting in restricted segmental mobility, and restricted pore size explains the reduced adsorption observed.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis information helps to build a picture of what would be expected for oxo-
defaultbio
defaultdegradable pol
defaultymer materials. Under the action of oxygen, UV light, and 
defaultmoderate 
defaultheat, polyethylene and polypropylene containing oxo-
defaultbio
defaultdegradable additives will change their 
defaultmolecular structure 
defaultand break down by a mechanism analogous to that shown in Figure 1.

defaultFigure 1 demonstrates how hydroperoxy intermediates are readily formed in the initial phase of degradation, 
defaultand 
defaultimmediately there is a change in chemica
defaultl structure and increase in polarity. The formation of these oxygenated species already makes the polymer 
defaultless attractive to adsorption of
default PCB and related hydrophobic toxins. Lower diffusion and partition coefficients result from increased cohesive forces,
default reducing segmental mobility and pore-size. The highly polar functional groups that are formed
default will not interact with the non-
defaultpolar toxins either through chemical reaction or intermolecular interaction.
default&#xa0;
default8-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe second stage of degradation is the molecular-wei
defaultght reduction of the hydroperoxy intermediates (with the vicinal form proceeding more rap
defaultidly) to 
default&#xa0;
default9-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultintermediate and short-
defaultchain aldehydes, ketones, esters, and hydroxyl and hydrocarbon radicals. These will proceed further to carboxylic acids which will be
default readily bioassimilated by 
defaultmicro-
defaultorganisms. 
default&#xa0;
default10-
default 
defaultIn summary the constantly 
defaultprogressing
default chemical breakdown of the polymer results in species with increased hydrophilic character that will readily solubilise and emulsify in the ocean environment. It would, ther
defaultefore, not be possible for hydrophobic toxins such as PCB to accumulate on oxo-degradable plastic materials
defaultConclusiondefault&#xa0;default11-
default 
defaultIt is 
defaultsometimes suggested 
defaultthat plastic materials, in particular polyethylene and polypropylene, will adsorb and accumulate hydrophobic toxins that can be found in the sea surface micro layer. 
defaultHowever i
defaultn this 
defaultreview 
defaultit has been 
default&#xa0;
default12-
default 
defaultshown
default that such plastics when treated with additives 
defaultsuch as d
default2
defaultw will change their chemical and physical properties during degradation and that hydrophobic toxins will not be readily 
defaultad
defaultsorbed. 
default&#xa0;
default13-
default 
defaultThere is, therefore, no reason why oxo-
defaultbio
defaultdegradable plastic materials would provide a route for hydrophobic toxin
default accumulation and the potential to harm marine life
default-
defaultforms, or provide an entry route for these chemicals into the human food chain. No experimental evidence has been published that links oxo-
defaultbio
defaultdegradable plastic materials with the accumulation of persiste
defaultnt hydrophobic toxins in the 
defaultoceans.
default&#xa0;
default14-
default 
defaultOxo-biodegradable plastics can therefore play a useful role in reducing plastic pollution of the oceans. Indeed if all the plastic had been made with oxo-biodegradable technology there would be no ocean garbage patches

default&#xa0;
defaultDear Mr. Schulz,
defaultWe are very concerned by the assertions in para 5, of the Motion proposed by Mr. Prodi, 
defaulton a 
defaultEuropean strategy on plastic waste in the environment (2013/2113(INI))
default 
defaultwhich was accepted on 27
defaultth
default November in the Environment Committee of the Parliament, and is expected to be voted in Plenary on 13
defaultth
default January.
default&#xa0;
defaultParagraph 5 is defamatory of our members and
default their products, and is an unjustified attack on a whole industry which employs very many people.  Members of the Parliament should not be allowed to use their parliamentary protection from legal action to 
defaultcommit defamation, and it is for that reason that 
defaultwe are bringing this to your attention as President.
default  I trust that Members will have the opportunity to reconsider this ill-advised paragraph in Plenary, and to consider a motion to amend it which I understand will be made.
defaultThere is no evidence that oxo-bi
defaultodegradable plastic is ‘dangerous’ nor that it is ‘disruptive to human health’ or the environment, nor that it contains heavy metals. 
defaultT
defaulthe scientific evidence
default 
defaultis
default that oxo-biodegradable plastic 
default(as distinct from bio-based plastic) 
defaultdoes not
default make recycling pr
defaultocesses more difficult
default. 
defaultThese claims, which are central to the Motion, are false and seriously misleading.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is no evidence in the Commission’s Green Paper on plastic waste in the environment to support these allegations
defaultIn 
defaultFebruary 2011 a Life Cycle
default Assessment
default by Intertek was published by the UK Environment Agency which shows that oxo-biodegradable plastic bags have a better LCA than paper bags or compostable plastic bags.  In May 2012 a further LCA by Intertek
default included the litter metric and compar
defaulted oxo-biodegradable plastic with bio-based plastic and conventional plastic.  It put oxo ahead in its potential to reduce the plastic waste problem and its less harmful impact on the environment and on global warming.    In its ability to reduce plastic l
defaultitter, oxo-bio scored 75% better than conventional plastic, and bio-based plastics were worse than oxo in all 11 environmental impact categories.
default&#xa0;
defaultOxo-biodegradation causes the plastic to convert at the end of its useful life in the presence of oxygen into
default a biodegradable material.  
defaultThis process has been studied in depth at the Technical Research Institute of Sweden and the Swedish University of Agricultural Scienc
defaultes, and a
default peer-reviewed report of the work was published in Vol
default.
default 96 of the journal of Polymer 
defaultDegradation &amp; Stability (2011) at page 919-928.  It shows 91% biodegradation in a soil environment within 24 months, in accordance with ISO 17556
default and it does NOT therefore leave fragments of plastic in the environment. The fragments found in the oceans, an
defaultd those found to have been ingested by birds and fish are fragments of ordinary plastic.
default&#xa0;
defaultOxo-biodegradable plastic does NOT contain heavy metals.  It is designed so that it will NOT degrade in anaerobic conditions and will NOT therefore generate methane.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is no justification for the claim that ox
defaulto-biodegradable plastics should 
defaultbe phased out of the market or banned outright, as soon as possible before 2020 or at all.
default&#xa0;
