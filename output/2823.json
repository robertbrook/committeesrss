"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by The Wildlife Trusts\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Executive Summary \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1 Whether the UK’s implementation of CAP might put English farmers at a competitive disadvantage to their regional and European counterparts.&#xa0;\n1.1 \nA focus on short term competitive advantage\n/disadvantage\n \nmasks the issu\ne\n of the long term\n health of the environment and the extent to which th\nis \ndetermines the viability and\n future \nof farming, and thus the incomes that farmers derive from \nland management. \nWe want to see the concept of environmental land management  ‘mainstreamed’, with\n management of the environment no longer culturally divided into activities described as ‘farming’ and those attributed to 'conservation’. \nFor example, \nwildflower grasslands perform \nimportant functions \nacross the agricultural landscape. The insects they sup\nport are crucial for the pollination of crops and this habitat provides food for all stages of their life cycle\n. \n Invertebrates in wildflower grasslands play an important role in dung removal and soil creation. Wildflower meadows provide food and breeding \nareas for predator species such as beetles, spiders and parasitic wasps, which carry out natural pest control of insects in arable crops. Grassland soils are a major carbon sink and many wildflower species sustainably fix atmospheric nitrogen. These grassl\nands perform all of those functions AND provide \nhigh quality \nfood which is produced with low inputs – an economic and environmental benefit. \n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nThe \nway in which CAP is implemen\nted must help farmers build ecological \nresilience and restore the environmen\ntal performance of the land – ensuring that it continues to provide food\n, but also that it delivers \nenvironmental public goods other than food. If farmers are adequately rewarded for the delivery \nof environmental public goods \nthen this should help \nensure t\nhat \nthey \nare not placed at com\npetitive \ndisadvantage in the future.\n Indeed it will ensure that th\nose farmers who \ncurrently \ndo most to protect \nenvironmental public goods \nwill \nnot be disadvantaged. A\n research project \nthat \nforms part of the UK National \nEcosystem Assessment has concluded\n that spending CAP funds on improving access to attractive countryside, protecting wildlife and cutting greenhouse gases could produce annual benefits of over £18bn, for a loss of less than £0.5bn in UK agricultural produc\ntion.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n \nAn approach that takes account of the full range of goods and services farmers can provide, \nrequire\ns\n \neffective\n \nPillar I G\nreening measures \nand a well funded Rural Development P\nro\ngramme that prioritises environmental land\n management schemes\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n Embedding a value for \nenvironmental \npublic goods\n in farm management via greening measures linked to direct payments, provides a justification for public money to be given to farmers. It provides to society and businesses a clear message about the important role that farmers play in protecting and enhanci\nng the ecosystems that provide us with these goods and services.   \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n It is \nalso \nin the long term interest of the farming industry to have healthy soils, areas that support pollinating insects and predatory insects, and so on. The value of having nature\n side by side with farming are clear and in the longer term we believe can bring competitive advantage.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n \nWe recommend that Government\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.7\n \nWe believe that the public want healthy \nfood that is good value for money, the production of which does not damage the natural environment\n.\n Against this background, \nit is hard to argue against the value of \nspending taxpayers\n’\n money on programmes w\nhose outcomes will benefit \nnature\n, \nthe long term \nviability of farming\n, \nEnglish farmers and the public\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.8\n \nNew Environmental Land Management Schemes \nAgri environment schemes \nare a \nkey mechanism for Government delivery of policy objectives\n. \nThe added value that \nthey can bring \nfor society, the economy \nand rural communities is under\n-\nappreciated. We refer the committee to a series of ‘Farming for A Living Landscape’ case studies which we have produced\n \nhttp://www.wildlifetrusts.org/living-\nlandscape/farming\n. \nT\nhese show how farmers’ entry into agri environment schemes, when supported by e\nffective advice, \ncan bring wider benefits. \nFor example, \nAvon Wildlife Trust \nh\nelp\ns farmers \nto get into Higher Level Ste\nwardship \nschemes, enabling \nthem to \nm\nanage their fields with low inputs.  The lower input costs provide an economic benefit to the landowner as well as a positive benefit for ecosystem services. Combining gains for wildlife with potential commercial benefits for landowners is a high priority \nfor this \nproject\n. \nMore generally, work undertaken by the Countryside and Community Research Institute (2010) has shown that \nevery £1 of Environmental Stewardship money generates a total output in the local economy of £1.42.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.\n9\n \nAs mentioned above, \nappropriate advice and facilitation (which can for example bring farmers together to develop collaborative agreements across wider areas) \nis a key element in successful land management schemes. We welcome current discussions around the \nmerits of a ‘facilit\nation fund’, \nwhich would ensure that farmers would have access to appropriate advice and help\n,\n and that the opportunities for added value were fully realised. \n&#xa0;\n1.1\n0\n The movement of 15% monies  from Pillar I to Pillar II can  ensure that maximum benefit is  derived from measures across the whole rural development programme\n. The\n strategic \nand SMART \napplication  of \nall \nmeasures \nwithin Pillar II when \n \ne\nmployed\n  according\nly (including NELMS)\n \n can if \n effected \nproperly secure the progress of RDP in delivering its objectives for farm competition across the EU.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2. The steps the Government might take in implementing CAP to help tenant farmers in upland areas, and to take account of issues pertaining to common land.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1 \nF\ninancial support for \ntenant farmers in upland areas should better reflect the scale of the ecosystem service benefits and the quality of the benefits upland farming can provide\n. The new CAP should be used to support farmers and tenant farmers who protect and enhance the value of upland catchments in \nretaining and slowing down water flow to reduce flooding impacts, providing clean drinking water, storing and sequestering carbon a\nnd providing special habitats for declining species. \n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nFarmers in these areas can derive bene\nfits from \nrecrea\ntion and tourism or potentially cou\nl\nd be paid directly by businesses such as water companies. But there is currently not a clear model \nor mecha\nnism \nfor \nthe \nprovision of income to farmers for ecosystem services other than food\n, especially in the more marginal farming systems. We must therefore \nlook to the direct payments system\n, including via the Greening payment,\n and \nto the \nNew Environmental Land\n Management Schemes \nof Pillar II \nto \nprovide support \nfor those marginal but environmentally valuable farms and farming systems –in upland areas and elsewhere. \n&#xa0;\n2.3 The value of extensive grazing systems, where the level of grazing animals provides protecti\non for important ecosystem services, but where income from livestock is relatively poor, must be r\necognised, with support provided\n for these farmers to market and sell what are often high quality products. We think tha\nt much can be learnt f\nr\no\nm \nexisting \ngoo\nd practice\n. \nFor example \nin Worcestershire\n, The Wildlife Trust has teamed up with Old Yarr Estates, promoting the sale of beef from cattle that have been grazing on the Trust’s nature reserves. \nhttp://www.worcswildlifetrust.co.uk/wildlife-friendly-beef-boxes\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. The steps Government needs to take to ensure the reformed CAP will be less bureaucratic than its predecessor and what might prevent this ambition from being achieved&#xa0;\n3.1 \nWhile it is recognised there are key principles such as simplicity of design and a desire not to ‘gold plate’\n \nschemes, these should not constrain thinking on how to achieve potential gains.  Simple delivery should not mean partial delivery and effecti\nve environmental benefits need not amount to “gold \nplating”.\n The\n key principle should be focused around SMART design identifying where and how a number effective environmental outcomes can be deli\nvered in combination with \nagricultural outcomes.\n There should be no confusion between simplicity of design and ineffective delivery.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.2 We believe that the importance of appropriate advice and facilitation is key to reducing time spent on paperwork and that a flexible and nuanced approach is needed t\no both this and inspection regimes. The delivery of Greening through a \nNational Certification Scheme (NCS) \nwo\nuld certainly provide a clearer\n and more straightforward process, and a single but tiered Environmental Land Management Scheme should introduce som\ne further simplicity. \n&#xa0;\n4. How the Government might define the minimum activity required for qualification as an ‘active farmer’&#xa0;\n4.1 \nAs mentioned above\n,\n low stocking densities are vital for maintaining and enhancing the health of many ecosystem services, \nfor example grassland systems that can slow down or store water, such as the culm grasslands of Devon or the maintenance of upland or lowland heath vegetation. It is vital that the minimum activity required does not penalise those \nlow intensity \nmanagement \nsystems and inadvertently lead to damage to habitats that are the source of farm incomes in themselves for example through tourism incomes.   \nThe level of minimum activity should\n th\ner\ne\nfore  be able to refl\nect the\n \nfarming system that is \napp\nropriate \n \nto maintaining  such \n habitats\n and other services provided by them\n. A\n ‘one size fits \nall’ method\n of\n defining appropriate levels  of minimum activity \nshould \nthus be avoided\n. If implemented \nproperly \n‘minimum activity’ could \n confer its own sense of value to \nthose habitats, farming  systems and other services provided by such activity.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5 How Government can ensure that CAP delivers the best environmental benefits while supporting food production&#xa0;\n5.1 \nWe believe that \nCAP payments \nshould \naddress areas where there are \ncurrently \nmarket failures – specifically,\n provide farmers with payments for the ecosystem goods and services they provide to the public\n. \nWe are very concerned that marginal farm systems that provide society with \nhigh quality \np\nublic goods will remain on the verge of, or will be tipped into, bankruptcy, whilst \nsome \nfarming systems that continue to damage the natural environment will \ncontinue to \nbe rewarded with public money\n.   \n&#xa0;\n5.2 \nI\nt is essential that the public perceive the ou\ntcomes from the money they provide to farmers. \nT\nhere must be a transparent way of the public seeing that the payments they make to farmers both via Pillar I and Pillar II deliver outcomes \nin addition to food\n.  The \n30% \nGreening payment of approximately £495\n million per year to English farmers, must be made to work effectively to deliver perceptible environmental benefit. It should also be clear to the public that the bulk of the direct payment money (70%) should not be linked to damaging activities, with a r\nobustly enforced cross compliance system. \n&#xa0;\n5.3 \nWe believe that the key ambitions for Greening should be to: \n&#xa0;\nWe have set out our key tests for Greening as follows: &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.4 \nT\nhe movement of the maximum 15% of Pillar I monies into Pillar II to support Rural Development measures and the high prioritisation of \nnew environme\nntal land management schemes are \nessential to ensure that CAP delivers the best environmental benefits. \nNew Land M\nanagement\n S\nchemes that foster collaborative workin\ng by farmers across landscapes \ncould, with the right facilitation and advice, d\neliver excellent environmental benefits \na\nnd lead to opportunities to \npromote produ\ncts derived from\n special local landscapes. A more transparen\nt and public face to CAP paymen\nts \nwhich articulates how this public money helps to enhance local landscapes and pr\noduction of quality local food which results in reduced transport costs, potentially reduced prices and reduced carbon emissions, would be helpful.\n&#xa0;5.5\n The success or otherwise of implementation of this round of CAP reform for the environment will be dete\nrmined by the sum of \nall\n of the parts: cross compliance, Pillar I greening, additional voluntary measures and Pillar II land management schemes. \n&#xa0;6. The principal lessons the Government should learn from the implementation of the previous CAP&#xa0;\nWe would \nhighlight the following key lessons\n at this stage, but may wish to expand on this section in our oral evidence\n: \n&#xa0;\n10 October 2013 \n6\n&#xa0;\n Bateman I.
