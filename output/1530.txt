[[[Royal Mail Privatisation and the threat to postal services]]]&#xa0;“For the longer term, the universal service is just impractical…I would suggest in 3-5 years there will be only three maximum deliveries per week and that will be more than enough because most of what’s delivered now more and more is what’s called junk mail.”As someone who knows more about postal economics than most, Mr Senior was even more downbeat about the long term future of the USO:“Within 15 years there will be no Royal Mail or no traditional letters service at all.”Along with postal academics, many businesses leaders in the carrier sector are equally convinced that the universal postal service will change fundamentally. James Greenbury, Chief Executive of carrier Parcel2Go said recently that the six day delivery will be outdated and redundant in ten years time. Mr Greenbury also suggests the privatisation will herald an era of price rises as well.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
