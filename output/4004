defaultIn an article in the British Medical Journal dated 29.5.2012 entitled “
defaultDavid Southall: Anatomy of a Wrecked Career” defaultit says “
defaultThe courts are starting to look more critically at the GMC: in two cases in March this year – those of Walker-Smith and a psychiatrist, Robin Lawrence – judges made devastating criticisms of the quality of the panels' decision making before quashing their findings”. defaultThe patient's notes prove that the Panel's decision making in my case was completely flawed since the notes prove I should never have been struck off. The Panel were so biased in favour of the GMC's expert that in their Determination they have rejected the report and oral evidence of Dr. Adrianne 
defaultReveley
default, Consultant Psychiatrist on the patient's allegations which was completely in my favour by saying that Dr. 
defaultReveley
default was biased in my favour. I think the transcripts and patient's notes prove that conversely the Panel were biased in favour of the GMC's white expert, the white patient and the white Barrister of the GMC and in favour of the patient's current white Psychotherapist.

default10.In an article published in the Solicitors Journal dated 20.3.2012 entitled “
defaultGeneral Medical Council wrong to Strike Off Professor – Fitness to Practice Panel made 'numerous and significant' errors” defaultit says “
defaultIn no individual case in which the panel made a finding adverse to Professor Walker-Smith did it address the expert evidence led for him except to misstate it”. defaultThe transcripts of my case show that the Panel in my case too failed to take proper notice of the expert evidence of Dr. Adrianne 
defaultReveley
default which was strongly in my favour both in her written report and in her oral evidence. Instead they unconditionally took the word of the GMC's expert who mislead them by saying numerous things which were highly instrumental in me being struck off but which the patient's notes prove are not true. 
default&#xa0;
default11.The Information Commissioner has said in an 
defaulte.mail
default that the patient's notes can be used as long as she cannot be identified and indeed her name has been redacted in every patient note and she cannot be identified and so I have quoted some of the notes that prove the GMC should in fairness to me investigate their own expert for saying things in his report and oral evidence which the patient's notes prove are completely untrue. In his report the GMC's expert said the patient has never held false beliefs but in the notes of the patient's female Psychotherapist she has referred in 3 different notes to the patient's belief that she was born a witch who is powerful and can influence people with her thoughts and in addition she has said that the patient thought her mother had been trying to poison her which proves she has held false beliefs. A patient note says the patient “often thinks she can fly” which is a false belief and a patient note says the patient has the deluded belief that her mother is in her 
defaultstomach. In a letter written by the patient's male Psychotherapist he said the patient said he “might not be who he says he is” which again shows she has held false beliefs. 
default&#xa0;
default12.The GMC's expert said in his report that the patient has never been out of touch with reality but patient notes prove this is not true and one says she is “still having difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality”. Another patient note says (“Patient) reports that she doubts what truth and reality are at times”. Another patient note says “these experiences challenge her hold on reality” and another says of the patient “spoke about her efforts to understand the disturbing feeling of dissociation that leaves her unsure as to what is true and what isn't”. It is typical of people who have Borderline Personality Disorder/Dissociative Identity Disorder as the patient has that they may not know what is true and what is not and that is why the Dissociative Experiences Scale used to decide if patient's have Dissociative Identity Disorder asks the patient if they ever think something has happened that has not really happened at all because they can get it into their head that something has happened that has not happened and the patient's notes prove that on 2 occasions she told hospital staff both that she feared she may have made up all her allegations of abuse and that she had so much going on in her head she couldn't be sure that what she thought had happened really had happened and so admitted she was not sure if her allegations a doctor had touched her were true. In addition she herself wrote in a letter in which she said “Today is one of those days when I feel it's all a lie and I made it up”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultClearly she was referring to one or other of her 6 allegations that various other men had abused her and doubted whether her allegations were true and indeed there is nothing to prove that any of her allegations about them or about me are true and  in regard to her allegations about me they are completely false. Dr. Richard Hall in his paper entitled “Patients Who Make False Allegations” says that “angry borderline patients” are known to be much more likely to make false allegations that their Psychiatrist has abused them. He gives an instance of a patient with Borderline Personality Disorder who falsely accused her Psychiatrist of abusing her simply because she was angry at him for not giving her the time and attention she wanted. The patient has a high scoring for Borderline Personality Disorder and she may have been angry at me for saying that I thought it was preferable she be seen by a female therapist rather than by me to discuss all her allegations of abuse about the 6 other men she alleges have abused her. Dr. Hall says the higher the number of allegations the more suspicious one should be about whether they are true. Including me the patient has accused 7 men of abusing her but none of her allegations about the other 6 have ever been proved to be true and indeed the Police refused to prosecute a man she accused of abusing and raping her because, according to the patient's GMC Statement, they said there was insufficient evidence she was telling the truth and that she was very (psychiatrically) ill at the time. Despite this the GMC/MPTS in their racism decided that her allegations about me are true and have ignored vital patient notes that prove I did not even work at the hospital at some of the times the patient said a doctor had touched her and ignored the notes that prove the patient herself doubts her allegations and fears she may have made them all up. The patient's notes show the patient was having difficulty in distinguishing her female Psychotherapist from her own mother whom she hates and so show that the patient may have had difficulty in distinguishing me from her own father whom she alleges abused her in childhood although the notes show that her mother and friend do not believe he abused her and that her mother does not believe a man whom the patient accused of abusing and raping her, who was a friend of her mother, actually did abuse and rape her.
default&#xa0;
defaultA patient note says no-one is willing to give a Witness Statement to the Police supporting the patient's allegations of abuse and gives the reason for this as being “because of her illness”. This shows other people had the common sense to know that because of her psychiatric illness she is not a reliable witness and so it can only be racism that the GMC/MPTS have believed the patient. The notes prove that 
defaultafter defaultthe Police refused to prosecute a friend of the patient's mother whom she accused of abusing and raping her did the patient admit to a member of hospital staff that she had got pleasure from having sex with that man. The Police seem to have taken into account the patient's psychiatric illness because in her GMC Statement she says the Police refused to prosecute this man because there was insufficient evidence she was telling the truth and also apparently said she was very ill at the time. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI can only conclude that I have been treated in an immensely unfair way by the GMC and MPTS because of racism and feel that there should have been someone of ethnic minority origin on the Panel to ensure that I was treated fairly and that vital evidence from the patient's notes was not just completely ignored in the way that it was.
