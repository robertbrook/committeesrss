[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](ICE
[normal] is a UK-based international organisation with 
[normal]over
[normal] 80,000 members ranging from students to professional civil engineers. It is an educational and qualifying body and has charitable status under UK law. Founded in 1818, ICE has become recognised worldwide for its excellence as a centre of learning, as a qu
[normal]alifying body and as a public voice for the profession.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ICE has access to a vast wealth of transport experience through its membership and draws on this to assist governments. This is delivered in many ways, including for example:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have set out our responses to the Committee’s questions below and would be pleased to provide further insight at 
[normal]subsequent
[normal] stages in the inquiry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What is the 
[normal]rationale?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We understand changes to 
[normal]local transport expenditure to be part of Government’s delivery of its localism
[normal] agenda. This is particularly manifest in:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What are the 
[normal]advantages[bold]? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Devolution can 
[normal]mean that transport expenditure decisions are made closer and more accountable to those local communities most affected by them. Local authorities are particularly accountable
[normal] -
[normal] although LEPs and LTBs, whilst local, are less directly accountable to local r
[normal]esidents
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local organisations should better-understand the needs of their areas, and be better-able to identify and promote transport investment in pursuit of local ends 
[normal]than a national transport department can. In particular, local organisations should b
[normal]e able to deploy
[normal] transport investment in pursuit of wider social, economic and environmental goals
[normal] – transport is a means to an end, after all
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The reduction in the number of separate funding pots and streams for local transport is to be welcomed, as are 
[normal]multi-year funding settlements. These should provide local bodies with more flexibility and certainty as a basis on which to plan to meet local needs and opportunities – instead of responding to central government’s often-changing priorities and criteria
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Reducing central government’s role may lead to investments being identified, appraised, approved and delivered more quickly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What are the 
[normal]disadvantages[bold]? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]ICE has long called for a comprehensive national transport strategy for England. The 
[normal]current l
[normal]ack of national 
[normal](and now also
[normal] regional
[normal])
[normal] strategy means that decisions and schemes may exist without much regard for broader context, and the total of local schemes may not 
[normal]sum to a commensurate contribution to broader goals (e.g. 
[normal]national connectivity
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]emi
[normal]ssions reduction
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local area boundaries (whether local authority, LEP or LTB) can be quite small and organisations not well-equipped to understand or deal with some important travel patterns and corridors which have a larger-than-local focus. It may also
[normal] be that the optimum transport interventions may actually be outside the local area(s) which stand to benefit most, or span more than one area – a very local approach may be less well-suited to dealing with these
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In six of England’s largest metropolitan 
[normal]areas (outside London)
[normal] Integrated Transport Authorities 
[normal](ITAs) 
[normal](supported by Passenger Transport Executives
[normal] (PTEs)
[normal]) exist to address public transport issues across boundaries. While the boundaries of LEPs and LTBs are 
[normal]coterminous with some of these
[normal], it is
[normal] not the case in all and there may be scope for confusion and conflict between bodies with overlapping powers, boundaries and objectives
[normal].
[normal] More generally, the overlapping boundaries of many LEPs (LTB boundaries do not overlap) may give rise to added confusi
[normal]on
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The skills and resources available to smaller local bodies are sometimes limited, meaning that specialist knowledge and economies of scale may not be available. In addition, preparation of local major transport schemes requires considerable input of ti
[normal]me and effort. In competitive bidding situations (as opposed to the situation with formulaic allocations) considerable resources may be expended for no reward.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It may be difficult for national transport bodies (such as the Highways Agency and Network 
[normal]Rail) to engage effectively with a large number of disparate and competing interests
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It is unclear how that the funding periods for local transport allocations will align with those of Network Rail and the reformed Highways Agency – this may hinder co-ord
[normal]ination
[normal] of activity for maximum effect.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The relatively modest funding available means that each transport body will only be able to promote 
[normal]one or two
[normal] medium-sized projects in each funding period. CENTRO, the West Midlands PTE, estimate that a £20 million
[normal] scheme is now the largest which could be funded through their major scheme allocations for 2015-19.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Are there 
[normal]better models[bold]?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]ICE believes it is not yet possible to assess the effectiveness of the new arrangements yet – they have not had enough time to 
[normal]mature
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We do not believe that there is an optimum ‘one size fits all’ model but for larger metropolitan areas, ICE favours 
[normal]an 
[normal]approach similar to 
[normal]TfL. This offers a
[normal] comprehensive, integrated 
[normal]organisation 
[normal]with assured funding and 
[normal]– experience in London su
[normal]ggests – can be 
[normal]particularly effective where there are multiple modes and choices and less reliance on private cars
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Combined Authorities (CAs) are a step in the right direction, particularly in linking transport with land use and economic development pla
[normal]nning but may not be appropriate for all 
[normal]locations and still lack some of the important powers and accountability of the London model
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The pooling of large amounts of transport funding in the SLGF (into which LEPs bid) makes the potential contribution of 
[normal]LTBs less clear.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In all discussions of changes to funding criteria and streams, the total sum of funds available for local transport must be taken into account. Expenditure available for local transport, particularly capital, has been greatly reduced.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Also important when considering the merits of changing from one model to another are the costs associated with institutional and policy change. The disruption, uncertainty and delay incurred as a result of (all) governments
[normal]’
[normal] re-organisation
[normal]s
[normal] can be conside
[normal]rable – this argument
[normal], and the benefits of stability and certainty,
[normal] seems to have been long-accepted in rail policy,
[normal] and
[normal] now also for the Strategic Road Network – but not 
[normal]yet 
[normal]for 
[normal]local transport.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Capacity[bold] to assess
[normal], prioritise and deliver
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]ICE’s experience is that capacity levels are v
[normal]ery
[normal], and perhaps increasingly,
[normal] variable
[normal]. L
[normal]arger local authorities 
[normal](particularly counties and larger unitaries) 
[normal]and 
[normal]ITAs/
[normal]PTEs
[normal] will generally have sufficient skilled staff for most transport-related tasks – although this is increasingly uncertain
[normal] as local funding is squeezed
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]S
[normal]maller local authorities 
[normal]are less to have sufficient capacity. ICE’s consultations around the country (
[normal]as part of our ‘State of the Nation’ project) suggests that pressure on local authority budgets leading to headcount reductions threatens the capacity of smaller authorities to manage transport projects and programmes
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The capacity of 
[normal]LEPs 
[normal]and
[normal] LTBs 
[normal]is 
[normal]heavily influenced by their local authority and ITA/PTE partners. Few of the new bodies employ transport specialists, or have delivery responsibility or capability themselves.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What would the 
[normal]optimum delivery body[bold] look like?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As noted, we do not believe 
[normal]there is a
[normal] single best model but 
[normal]the TfL 
[normal]integrated model 
[normal]is 
[normal]well-suited to larger urban areas with multiple modes. Combined Authorities go some way towards this model but still fall short
[normal], lacking such clear democratic oversight and control over some 
[normal]impo
[normal]rtant subjects
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Very local bodies 
[normal]are 
[normal]unlikely to have the strategic view or depth and breadth of skills required – an ideal model is likely to be “larger-than-local” at least
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We consider that - in view of the diverse nature of the England’s local 
[normal]geographies - it may be
[normal] more useful to think in terms of an optimum skillset 
[normal]and range of attributes 
[normal]rather than 
[normal]a single model
[normal]. It is our experience, for example, that skills 
[normal]in programme management
[normal] are in short supply across a range of organisation types
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Major transport schemes can often
[normal] span local authority
[normal] boundaries and the wider sub-region, at least, needs to be considered.  Even this can be too small scale – cross-region issues frequently arise in the Midlands, 
[normal]for example
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensuring co-operation among bodies can be difficult. The temptation to parochialism 
[normal]may be strong and some areas - and perhaps particularly their 
[normal]LEPs 
[normal]- 
[normal]may see themselves as being in competition
[normal] (indeed the Growth Fund encourages this)
[normal]. It shouldn’t be a 
[normal]‘zero sum game’ but it is a considerable risk
[normal] that it will be seen as such
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A mechanism akin to the 
[normal]‘Duty to Co-operate’
[normal] which compels local planning authorities to work with their neighbours may be worth considering for 
[normal]transport organisation
[normal]s. 
[normal]Alternatively, some kind of regional process could also work, although any ‘top down’ or regional structure is unlikely to find favour with the current government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As previously noted, the ITA/PTE and TfL models exist to deal with schemes across metropoli
[normal]tan borough boundaries
[normal] – a sensible approach in our view.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The feedback we have received suggests a mixed picture, reflecting the varied
[normal] maturity of local arrangements, the diverse nature of the areas, and - invariably - the personalities involved.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are aware of some tensions between local organisations and national ones - the Highways Agency and Network Rail. 
[normal]T
[normal]his may be inevitable
[normal] to 
[normal]some extent
[normal] as there are often likely to be more local demands than can be met by national agencies. Loss of the regional tier of governance has removed one level of mediation 
[normal]and sifting of bids 
[normal]between local and national organisations (although there cou
[normal]ld be friction between local and regional too, of course).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Reform of the Highways Agency provides two important relevant opportunities in this context:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local authorities often feel that the relationship with the Department for Transport is unnecessarily top-down and micro-managed. 
[normal]Recent changes may see a reduction day-to-day micro-management (such as competitive funding bids requiring very rapid
[normal] responses) but will also see a confusing
[normal] superstructure of LEPs and LTBs centrally-imposed.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have major concerns that the reduced scale of funds available for all local transport is insufficient. In our recent engagem
[normal]ent around England as part of our 2014 ‘State of the Nation’ development process, the level and certainty of future funding for local transport (roads and public transport, capital and revenue) has repeatedly featured as one of the greatest concerns across
[normal] all infrastructure issues
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We welcome the intention to simplify funding streams, and reduce the 
[normal]number of separate competitions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]ICE broadly welcomed decision
[normal]s
[normal] in recent years to replace the competitive bidding process for “Integrated Transport and Main
[normal]tenance” with – firstly, in December 2010 – an indicative allocation, and then – in September 2012 – the decision to devolve the decision-making process for local major transport schemes. ICE believes that decisions should be made close to those most affec
[normal]ted by them. We also believe that competitive bidding does not always lead to the desired outcomes (it can favours those best at bidding, rather than the greatest need, and may militate against balanced programmes of expenditure (including maintenance))
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The more recent decision to allocate large amounts of funding to the SLGF causes us concerns over whether transport needs will be adequately resource
[normal]d
[normal], and causes us (and others) some confusion as to the future role of the LTBs
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are unclear how 
[normal]effectively the proposed allocation schedules will fit with Network Rail’s and the Highways Agency’s current and proposed funding and programming arrangements
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Taking a broad view of local transport expenditure, we are concerned that the ring-fencing of 
[normal]concessionary fares budgets may be distorting local public transport support spending.  ADEPT recently reported
[normal] that councils are spending 65%-75% of their public transport budgets on concessionary fares.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]ICE believes that 
[normal]it makes sense for transport issues to be considered alongside the many other issues that impact on economic growth in local areas, and 
[normal]for 
[normal]funding t
[normal]o be prioritised accordingly
[normal]. However, as with other questions, it is 
[normal]too early to say 
[normal]with certainty how the new arrangements will work in practice.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is 
[normal]essential that the full impact of transport investment or disinvestment on economic growth is 
[normal]properly considered when local decisions are being taken
[normal]. This requires that 
[normal]partnerships must have access to the appropriate skills and knowledge, and it isn’t clear whether this will be the case
[normal] with regard to transport investment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A 44% top slicing of 
[normal]Integrated Transport Block funding into the 
[normal]SGLF
[normal] seems disproportionate relative to other contribution sources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]From our engagement with members and partner organisations, there seems to be widespread uncertainty as to the future role of the LTBs.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local transport has traditionally relied heavily on
[normal] straightforward public sector grant funding. With the reduction in such resources available for local transport (in contrast to rail and the Strategic Road Network), local organisations have much incentive to seek alternative sources
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Some alternative so
[normal]urces are well-established; others are only emerging, or have yet to be adopted. It is unclear to us that alternative sources could compensate for reductions in public funding in the short-medium term – although they will be important for specific purposes
[normal] and in specific locations
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local planning authorities have long been able to secure developer contributions for infrastructure improvements through Section 106 of the Planning Act (and its predecessors). Such contributions are a well-established principl
[normal]e but only available in specific circumstances. Recent tightening of the criteria, their application and the ability and willingness of developers to contribute in a difficult economic climate mean that Section 106 is unlikely to assume much greater import
[normal]ance in future.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Also planning-related, the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) offers opportunities to use developer contributions more flexibly than Section 106. Introduction of CIL (as with Section 106) appears to favour economically stronger locations 
[normal]where there is more development interest and value
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Crossrail
[normal] is an excellent example of how private funding can be secured for transport investment – it uses CIL, business rate supplements and other developer contributions to provide a large share of the project’s funds. It is unlikely that many projects not servin
[normal]g high-value locations in London could put together such a package, however
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Government has, and seeks to continue to, broaden the uses to which CIL might be put. For example, the new National Infrastructure Plan suggests that CIL might be used to fund 
[normal]di
[normal]rect compensation to individuals affected by development. While this may be a worthwhile use, it does dilute CIL’s original purpose
[normal] by reducing the sums available for new infrastructure
[normal]. The ICE warned in 2011, during the passage of the Localism Bill, that
[normal] CIL might simply become a tax on development – this appears to be coming to pass
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]City Deals have included a number of mechanisms for securing private sector funding for local infrastructure investment. Greater Manchester’s ‘Earn Back’ scheme is of parti
[normal]cular interest, allowing the area to capture the increases in tax contributions generated by infrastructure investment
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Tax Increment Financing (TIF) models, which have some similarities with ‘Earn Back’ are being investigated for use in England. 
[normal]In the U
[normal]K, 
[normal]Scotland has pioneered this approach, although not without some difficulty
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Some areas, notably West Yorkshire, have pursued infrastructure funds using small Council Tax levies or combinations of other incomes (such as CIL or S106) to lever additional 
[normal]private finance. However, this source may be at risk with recent announcements from the Department for Communities and Loca
[normal]l Government on limits to annual
[normal] increases in local taxation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A clear income stream is important to attract private sector investors
[normal]. This may be more difficult to demonstrate in local transport – typically roads – than is the case for most utilities. Attempts to introduce road user charging or tolls (such as in Manchester and Edinburgh) have failed. Workplace parking levies have been 
[normal]introduced in Nottingham but Bristol shelved plans for its own scheme
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The above examples are merely a selection. It is clear that there are an increasing number of alternative funding options open to local authorities. These are valuable and should be pu
[normal]rsued but it remains unclear how widely applicable they are, and the extent to which they can compensate for reductions in mainstream public funding.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]8.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Accountability is becoming less clear. With the abolition of the RDAs, local authorities were generally responsible for local transport – notwithstanding that they have modest influence over the rail network or commercial (de-regulated) bus services. Large
[normal] metropolitan areas dealt with public transport issues through ITAs/PTEs, although local roads remained the concern of individual councils
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The introduction of CAs, while welcome from a strategic policy perspective, has given rise to some uncertainties ab
[normal]out accountability – these might already have existed around ITAs/PTEs to some extent but the broader focus of the CAs widens this question
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
