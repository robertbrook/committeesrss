"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from UNISON [PUB0018]                                                                                                                    UNISON voices from the frontline                                                                                                                                          \n              \nMore than 60,000 UNISON members work in the community and voluntary sector. UNISON works hard to ensure that good terms and working conditions of workers in this sector are promoted and \nare \nrecognised as an important part of providing qualit\ny voluntary and community services. UNISON believes that by working together with UNISON, employers, providers and community and voluntary workers \nwe \ncan achieve more\n in our Community sector\n.\n                                                               \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                                   \n                                                     In November UN\nISON held a parliamentary round\ntable event with organisations from the voluntary and community sector\n,\n hosted by \nthe new Shadow Minister \nfor charities, \nLisa Nandy MP\n. \nThe roundtable event focused\n on the launch of UNISON\n’\ns recent\n \nreport\n based on a ‘speak out’ survey of over 3,000 community, voluntary and housing workers across the UK.  \nReport findingsThe report exposed services to our most vulnerable people in society as \n“hanging by a thread”\n by uncovering dangerously underfunded services leading to hardship and exposing children and the disabled to risk.\nThe \nsurvey and \nreport in full can be downloaded\n in here:\nhttps://www.unison.org.uk/upload/sharepoint/On%20line%20Catalogue/21929.pdf\n&#xa0;\nUNISON, along with other organisations at the roundtable called,\n on the Gover\nnment to have a major rethink \non\n its\n attitude to the third sector. \nIts sink or swim philosophy is leading to a struggle for survival. Almost unnoticed by the public, many charities have become increasingly financially dependent on winning con\ntracts from th\ne public sector. Charities increasingly now rely on winning public sector contracts just to survive\n along with increased marketisation\n.\nAs austerity has bitten, funding for these contracts has been squeezed to breaking point and UNISON is warning that \nwhilst charities are reputable and trusted by the public they do not have a magic wand, so cuts are putting vulnerable people at risk\n.\nPrivate companies use them as ‘bid candy’ in an effort to improve their chances of winning more public sector business. The whole contracting-out process means that accountability for public services is increasingly at arm’s-length, and this has led to pub\nlic fears and damaging reports over the quality of services to children and the disabled\n.\nThe voluntary sector attracts many thousands \nof dedicated, hardworking staff\n who know that they won’t be paid big \nsalaries or bonuses\n but who have a right to expect a\n fair deal for their clients and themselves. Instead many workers are bearing the brunt of the austerity drive, through damaging cuts to their pay and conditions.\n&#xa0;\n                                                                                            \n                                                          Staff morale has dipped and low pay is endemic, leading to rising levels of personal debt and long-term financial hardship for many in the sector.\n&#xa0;\nA \nworker\n providing respite services for children w\nith autism, challenging behavior and profound disabilities, said\n“Due to financial pressures we have to combine more vulnerable children with children with challenging behavior. It creates an unsafe environment for both the child and the staff. There have been medication and other errors due to time pressure.”&#xa0;\nA disability worker in the East Midlands reported:\n“Users have less chance to go out, have to wear second hand clothes, have no transport, and blind people now have to buy their own white sticks when they lose them.”&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA housing worker from the West Midlands revealed that: \n“Fewer aids and adaptations are being installed, leaving people at risk in their homes and communities due to budget cuts.”&#xa0;\nUNISON\n is blaming the Government’s austerity drive \nfor pushing people out of the sector, as it is increasingly difficult to provide even \nthe basic help and support that client\ns\n need.\nKEY SURVEY RESULTS                                                                                                                                                                         Services for children&#xa0;\n72%&#xa0;\nare concerned that children may be slipping through the saf\nety net\nHigh risk areas:&#xa0;\n15%&#xa0;\ndo not have enough time to monitor children and follow up concerns of neglect or abuse\n14%&#xa0;\nreport an increasing risk in administering medications.\n&#xa0;\n36%&#xa0;\ndo not have enough time to prepare risk assessments and support plans.\n&#xa0;\n55%&#xa0;\ncan now provide fewer resources (such as toys)\n52%&#xa0;\nprovide fewer outside activities (such as visits)\n&#xa0;\nServices for disabled people&#xa0;\n67%&#xa0;\nsay clients are being left at risk because their care package has been reduced\n&#xa0;\n46%&#xa0;\nare \nseeing more clients moved \ninto ‘\nthe co\nmmunity’\n without proper support\n&#xa0;\n59%&#xa0;\nreport that service users are becoming more socially isolated                                                       \n67% of these are concerned that this results in self-harm and depression\n&#xa0;\n48%&#xa0;\nof staff repo\nrt less time with each service user\n41%&#xa0;\nare not able to provide clients with all the help they need\n43%&#xa0;\nbelieve that less frequent care reviews are leading to inadequate support\n41%&#xa0;\nreport delays in replacing faulty equipment\n57%&#xa0;\nare concerned about high s\ntaff turnover\nRights and advocacy&#xa0;\nservices80%&#xa0;\nsay it is getting harder for clients to get representation and advocacy, as well as basic advice\n77%&#xa0;\nsay clients are forced to phone up or go online rather than get help face-to-face\n&#xa0;\n57%&#xa0;\nsay services being\n centralised, so clients have to travel further to get help\n77%&#xa0;\nidentified specific groups that are losing out – the main ones being disabled, elderly and black and minority ethnic people\n38%&#xa0;\nof staff said their employers were prioritising services on cont\nracts to public bodies over campaigning and \nadvocacy\n&#xa0;\nHousing&#xa0;\nservicesUNISON has tens of thousands of members employed by housing associations, providing social housing to those in need and often providing social care to the tenants as well. \nAusterity \nhas reduced house building with a\n&#xa0;\n63%&#xa0;\ncut in capital financing available for new social housing\n73%&#xa0;\nreport more tenants are falling behind with their rent\n&#xa0;\n35%&#xa0;\nsaid the top reason was the bedroom tax.
