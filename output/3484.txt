[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Q1. How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Q2. What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Q3. Is there sufficient research to invest in new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection?  If not, how could this be rectified?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Q4. What measures (including behavioural change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens? &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Q5. What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial   resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Q6. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-18 strategy for tacking antimicrobial resistance?  What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?&#xa0;(a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The involvement of the human and veterinary disciplines in a one-health   approach is a strength.&#xa0;(b) The difficulty of cause and effect attribution and absence of models to predict outcome if no action is taken is a weakness which will make it difficult to measure outcome success and to identify which actions are most productive. Nevertheless, this should not prevent us from taking common sense actions. Equally this should not push policy-makers towards an extreme precautionary approach.&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;              &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
