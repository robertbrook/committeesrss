"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from West Sussex Cycle Forum (LTD0003)&#xa0;\nIn the guidance for those submitting evidence - it is \nadvised to b\negin with a short summary in bullet point form\n.   I think that our responses \nto the points you raise are short and to the point, and speak for themselves.   However, here is a short summary in bullet point format.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestion number\nQuestion posed by \nThe Transport \nCommittee\nAnswers submitted by the West Sussex Cycle Forum\n1\nWhat is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure? \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s \napproach? Are there better models?\nThere are a number of disadvantages \nassociated with\n devolved decision-making in West Sussex:\n&#xa0;\nExpectations\n have been raised that local decision-making would direct money more effectively to the needs of cyclists, but as the rest of this response demonstrates, the \nimplementation in West Sussex has largely dashed those expectations.\n&#xa0;\nDevolving transport decision\ns makes it almost impossible to plan and deliver non-local transport infrastructure, even on the scale of inter-urban \ncycleways\n between \nneighbouring\n towns [\nsee \n1].\n&#xa0;\n Transport is by its nature a very network-oriented issue, so changes in one location can ha\nve big impacts on another location: but \nlocalised\n transport spending doesn't allow this to be taken into account at all [\nsee \n2]. Transport-specific planning and design knowledge is lost, as local councils do not have the expertise and experience in transpo\nrt planning matters [\nsee \n3].\n&#xa0;\nExamples - \n[1] A county \ncouncillor\n from Lancing would like to build a \ncycleway\n between Lancing and \nWorthing\n, to benefit Lancing residents. However most of the \ncycleway\n will be within \nWorthing's\n boundary, so he has to persuade \na \nWorthing\n \ncouncillor\n to promote his \ncycleway\n, even though it has much less value to \nWorthing\n residents. This means that it's unlikely to ever happen; even though there is local community need and desire.\n&gt; [2] The A27 through \nWorthing\n is likely to become \nsignificantly more congested when the improvements at \nHandcross\n Hill on the A23 are completed, making it much easier to drive to the south coast from Gatwick and further north. If the Arundel bypass \nwere ever to be\n built, \nit\n would lead to significant incre\nases in congestion in \nWorthing\n from traffic finding it easier to drive along the A27 to and from the west. The A27 at Southampton is significantly more congested since the M3 \nTwyford\n Down cutting opened.\n&gt; [3] Local officials recently placed a sharp-edged \ndark-blue sculpture in the middle of National Cycle Network Route 2 \ncycleway\n in Lancing. The local officers involved were unaware of the importance of this route, or the number of people on bicycles using it daily to commute to and from work. One officer w\nas even unaware that the cycle route was continuous to \nWorthing\n, even though it had been so for some years!\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2\n·\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nDo local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport \nauthorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, \nprioritise\n and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?\nI take local to mean exactly that - within a locality such as a town or borough, or a disti\nnct and separate rural area.   The great weakness of the current system is that local government at the County level has been subjected to cutbacks and seemingly constant \nrationalisations\n (i.e. redundancies and \nreorganisations\n).   This has created disconti\nnuity and a certain amount of corporate paralysis.   There seems to be no overarching coherent policy that requires urgency to deliver it.   For example - there is evidence that S106 money is held up by bureaucracy.   There are no longer budgets allocated \nto specific means of transport which means that - for example, cycle schemes that might deliver real benefit don't get \nrecognised\n as part of a core transport policy - more as a fringe and \nmarginalised\n form of transport; although the talk in public is diffe\nrent.   The CLC process is incapable of dealing with the volume that should go through its hands.   Consequently, those schemes that are easy to understand and \nquickly \ndecide on - get the vote.\n&#xa0;\nApart from benefitting from some isolated serendipitous schem\nes, West Sussex County Council has not made any serious attempt to implement its \nLocal Plan Transport Plan 3\n (LTP3) \nand has, similarly, made no attempt to replace it with anything else.\n&#xa0;\n This, therefore, poses the question ‘what is the point of all of the \neffort put in to these plans if the Council has no mechanism to support it or implementing it?’\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTo answer the question - \nlocal bodies do not have the capacity to assess, \nprioritise\n and deliver local transport schemes.\n&#xa0;\nThe optimum delivery body is one th\nat considers and values the economic, health and \nsocial benefits of sustainable transport, and incorporates those benefits into an integrated policy with a 'golden thread' running through transport, health, social and economic development policies.   It sh\nould consult with, and take 'on the ground' information from, those who know the locality.   Those consulted should be involved in the roll out of schemes.  \n&#xa0;\nLocal bodies (district and borough councils) are inconsistent in their approach to sustainable tr\nansport. Decisions made by the county council in allocating funding to sustainable transport are not backed-up by, and are even contradicted by, decisions of Council Local Committees. The co-ordination of cycle schemes at county council level has been aban\ndoned with the abolition of the West Sussex County Council Cycling Officer and although there is someone doing his best to work with local cycle and sustainable transport groups, the fact is that he has another full time job that takes all his time.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3\n·\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nWhat is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?\nHave a scheme-by-scheme project led team that is charged with delivering on time and on budget and takes in all \neconomic, health and social benefits of sustainable transport.  Its members are the stakeholders in the geographical area as well as those intimately involved with the various modes of transport being considered.\n4\n·\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nHow effectively do local bodie\ns work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?\nNo knowledge of this.\n&#xa0;\nFunding streams for cycling projects are more diverse than ever and are acquired and managed by different bodies. Opportunities have been missed where combining money from different funding streams (such as the Highways Agency, National Park, county and bo\nrough councils) could have delivered greater benefits.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5\n·\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nDo the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?\nNo knowledge\n of this.\n&#xa0;\nAlmost all funding streams for cycling in West Sussex have restrictive criteria and date limitations. (No funding is allocated to cycling from the Highways budget.) Because the funding might otherwise be lost, there are examples of funding being\n allocated to schemes that are not the top priority locally and which have questionable benefits.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6\n·\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nWhat impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?\nIt will wipe out any consideration of sustainable transport schemes \nboth \nbig and small.   That is because it is designed to promote jobs\n supported by road building\n.  \n&#xa0;\nHowever, the \npurpose\n of creating employment is to increase the wealth and \nwell being\n of \nthose in an area.  The cost \n/\n benefit ratio of sustainable transport can bring significant economic benefits if factors, such as quality of life, well-being and basic health are admissible \nas equals in the discussion. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7\n·\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nHow can local \nauthorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?\nNo knowledge of this.\n&#xa0;\nExisting funding streams need to be pr\notected as well as finding additional sources of funding. We have one example of a County Local Committee passing a motion to reallocate developer contributions away from sustainable transport.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8\n·\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nHow clear are the lines of accountability for\n local decision making on transport expenditure?\nThe answer is that they are unclear to most.  But you must be more precise about what is meant by 'clear'.  It's an absolute term and when you factor in the implied 'clear to whom', then it's obvious that it\n might be 100% clear to some \n- \nbut \nunhelpfully \nopaque to others.  \nSo - please be \nless ambiguous\n.   But \n- \nof greater importance is whether local decision making is \nappropriate, relevant and worthwhile\n.   For example, it could be crystal clear but hopeless\n,\n \ninappropriate, irrelevant and worthless. \n&#xa0;\nIt is \nabsolutely \nnot clear where accountability sits for the cycling elements of the West Sussex \nCounty Council \nLocal Transport Plan 3 \n(LTP3) - \nand more specifically for cycling safety. \n  \nIs it still a central res\nponsibility of the county council as the Highways Authority, or the County Local Committees, who control the key funding streams\n; funding streams\n that could be used to implement cycle schemes and improve cycling safety?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSubmitted by \nGeoff Farrell, Chair of \nt\nhe West Sussex Cycle Forum (WSCF).   \n&#xa0;\nThe WSCF was established to \nrepresent and support\n the views of the various local cycling forums around the county. Whereas local cycle forums act locally and practically, the WSCF is a strateg\nic partner for the local forums and is recognised by West Sussex County Council as a \nconsultee\n.\n&#xa0;\nIts aim - as in its constitution is:\nTo work towards the creation of conditions in West Sussex so that cycling is perceived as a valid and reasonable choice of transport for both utility and leisure purposes.   &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n6\n&#xa0;\n"
