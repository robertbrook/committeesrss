"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Torbay Rail Users Group (TIC 100)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Torbay Line Rail Users Group is a cross-party group who have been working for more than ten years to improve rail services to and from To\nrbay for long distance, regional and local travel.  Torbay is a unitary authority of three towns, Torquay, Paignton and Brixham.  It is\n the second largest conurbation\n west of Bristol, \nwith a resident\n and increasing \n population of 135,000,  \nsecond only to P\nlym\nouth and larger than Exeter.  It is one o\nf\n the most important tourist resorts in Britain with outstanding cultural resources.  It has\n well over \none million staying visitors and \nthree\n million day visitors each year.    The most important industry is tour\nism.  For a conurbation\n of \n this size, the inadequacy of its rail services make it an isolated community, isolated from neighbouring towns and areas;  the \nlack\n of \n many \nevening and Sunday bus services make most areas of the conurbation isolated.\n&#xa0;\nimprove access to White Rock/Long Park area where residential and b\nusiness accommodation is being developed and  the South Devon College and its pioneering Energy Centre are located\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTorbay’s Industries, Businesses and Services\n              \n 1. Tourism is Torbay’s biggest industry contributing roug\nh\nly one third of the income and one third of the employment in the area.  This industry depends \non \ngood rail services.   Existing services are not adequate for the number of passengers and there are not enough direct trains.\n  Passengers do not like changing trains as the results of surveys both by Passenger Focus and by\n the\n Torbay Line Rail \nUsers Group\n \n(TLRUG) have shown.     Services should run daily, Mondays to Sundays, throughout the year\n.\n  \nS\nhort breaks whether mid-week or at weekends are increasing and services need to \nm\nee\nt\n this development.\n2\n.\n  Torbay Council is developing \n \nfurther  its marine attra\nctions and is establishing a velodrome to provide year-round facilities.  A group is working on developing package holiday\ns\n (rail, hotel and guided  tours)\n \nto \nexploit Torbay’s geological, \narchaeological, historical, literary\n and cultura\nl \n heritage\n:\n  \nurban Geopark recognised by UNESCO, \nGrade 1 listed building of national importance, \nrare wildlife, \narchaeological sites, \nassociation with many\n histor\nical and\n literary \nevents and personalities\n,\n particular architecture,\n  good museums and art gallery.\n3\n.  \n So\nme 13% of employment in Torbay is based on \nbanking, \nfina\nnce and \n insurance\n.\n AstraZeneca’s Brixham Environmental Laboratory has an international reputation for the excellence of its work;  it generates some 1,500 journeys annually.\n  It also runs visits for \nmembers of the public.\n4\n.\n  \nPublic services, education and health services take up nearly half  the employment.  \nThe \ng\nramm\nar schools regular\nly\n figure in lists\n of excellent schools.  South Devon College, recognised as outstanding by OFSTED\n, on the west side \nof Paignton \nhas some 17,000 students including \n \n500 working for degrees\n.\n \nTorbay \nHospital serves a resident population of some 300,000, \n \nspecialises in treating strokes and ranks well in the Dr Foster reports.\n \n   \n5.   The College\n  has won grants of £2.4million \nf\nrom\n national and EU funds \nfor developing further  work at its Energy Centre on conservation of energy and green technology .\n \nThis will involve co-operation with international companies throughout Britain and will be a base \nfor educating and training those working on green energy throughout the South West.\n \n6\n. \n \nHousing\n developments at White Rock, Great Parks , Yalberton and Sharpham  are in progress or approved on the west side of\n \n Paignton, \ninvolving \ns\no\nme\n \n4\n00 or more houses\n \nannually for 20 years for som\ne16,000\n \n-20,000\n people.   There is no rail connection for these activities or these people – a serious lack.\n7\n.  Torbay is a large urban area\n where there is much activity and much more planned, some of which is already \npartially implemented\n.   The urban area is however effectively isolated by the inadequacy the existing public transport on which visitors as well as residents depend\n.\n&#xa0;\nR\nail Services\n \n              \n8\n.  \nTrain timetables for services\n \nbetween\n Torbay \nand\n Newton Abbot\n, Plymo\nuth, Gunnislake, Exeter St Davids, Exeter Central, Exmouth, Crediton\n, \nBarnstaple and Tiverton  have been examined.  All these places, except Barnstaple, are within a 30-mile radius of Torbay and therefore within commuting distance  or  practicable for \nday\n \nor evening visits – in short for\n education, employment, \nbusiness, leisure \nand a wide range of cultural and other activities\n. \n \nIn practice, only visits to Newton Abbot and to some extent Exeter fall within this category.  \n9.  This is not the result of a sh\nortage of trains, but of their timing, the lack of direct trains, good connections and of frequent trains in the evenings, al\nthough there are often more trains on summer Saturdays. \n   \nTorbay\n is\n isolated from \nother areas\n and they are isolated from Torbay\n, a\n serious disadvantage for Torbay’s tourist trade.\n10.\n  \nAll trains from Paignton, the end of the line in Torbay, must pass through Newton Abbot, whatever their further destination.  Of the 30 trains that depart from Paignton on Mondays to Fridays, two leave\n at 15 minutes past the hour, eight leave at 15\n \nminutes past plus or minus five minutes; another four leave plus or minus ten minutes – which could involve a wait of 20 minutes.  The gaps between trains are very erratic: eight are of 50 to 59 minutes, and \nanother six of 40 to 49 minutes.  These big gaps are unpredictable.  The timetable is so erratic that would-be passengers are effectively discouraged from using the trains.\n              \n11\n.  Long distance trains \nto\n London Paddington\n and to Manchester, \nthe Midlands and North of England are slotted erratically in between the erratic local trains.  \nP\nassengers to \nor from \nsuch destinations \nare likely to check train times in advance.\n12\n.  Trains \nbetween\n Torbay \nand\n Plymouth are wanted and needed.  Sixty four p\ner cent of respondents to a\n small survey or poll run by\n TLRUG gave this as their most desired improvement.  There are no direct trains between Torbay and Plymouth and connections are few.\n  A\nny journey between Torbay and Plymouth \ntakes 15 minutes between Pa\nignton and  Newton Abbot and 40 minutes between  Newton Abbot and Plymouth\n.  \nT\nhe timetable\ns\n for Mondays to Fridays\n show that ‘\nc\nonnections’  between -3 or -1 minute (the onward train departs 3 minutes or one minute before the train from Torbay arrive\ns\n)  or\n one minute (catch-it-if-you-run-fast)  and a wait of up to 44 minutes.  \nNine\n connections involve waits of \n10 minutes or less\n and eight waits of 1\n1\n - 2\n0\n minutes\n;  waits of 20 minutes can add 40 minutes to a return journey, a considerable addition to a \ndaily commute\n.  All the rest are longer.   Woe betide  the commuter who takes the 8.23 from Paignton arriving at Newton Abbot at 8.39; the next train to Plymouth arrives at 9.57, a wait of  1 hour and 18 minutes, the more galling because the previous train\n leaves Newton Abbot at 8.35, four minutes earlier.   There are other gaps in the timetable\n when there are no sensible connections.  Connections between Plymouth and Torbay\n \nand on Saturdays and Sundays show similar patterns and are of  very limited value t\no those making either regular or occasional journeys.\n1\n3\n.  \nThere are \n30 trains \nbetween \n Torbay/Paignton \nand \n Newton Abbot, \nand\n \n42 between Newton Abbot and  Plymouth\n on Mondays to Fridays\n.  Similar difficulties exist on Saturdays and Sundays.  Surely someth\ning better can be arranged.  This capricious timetable drives would-be passengers of\nf\n \n \nthe trains.    A first step\n c\nould \nbe to issue a pocket  timetable showing what reasonable connections were available.  This would show up the gaps and\n \n assist the develo\npment of a regular half-hourly service throug\nhout the day in  \neach\n direc\ntion\n.\n1\n4\n.\n  In  view of these difficulties, it is hardly surprising that of the 658 Torbay residents who commute to Plymouth\n for their work\n, only 23 do so by train\n;  518 travel by car,\n 27 as passengers in a car\n and 26 by bus;\n the bus takes two hours, as against a possible 55 minutes by train if only there were a direct train.\n  \nOf the 487 who commute from Plymouth to Torbay, only three do so by train; \n \n376 commute by car, 23 as passenger\ns,  six by bus and \neight\n by motorcycle.\n15.  Trains to Gunnislake\n (the Tamar Valley line)\n depart from Plymouth every two hours usually at 54 minutes past the hour.  In view of the increase\n of 45% \n in the \nnumber of passengers since 2006, \n a more frequent se\nrvice \nsh\nould be considered.  \n  \n 1\n6\n.\n  Of the 30 trains from Paignton, 29 go to\n Newton Abbot,\n then\n Exeter St Davids, the\n \n station for c\nhanging\n for other destinations \n \nand  \n for \nthe\n University\n.  The 16  local trains stop at every station between Paignton and\n Exmouth and take about one hour to go from Paignton to Exeter St Davids.  Eight long distance trains go from Paignton to Exeter St Davids and then to London\n or \nManchester, \nthe Midlands \nor the\n North\n.\n  Only the local trains go to Exeter Central,\n  the neares\nt for offices,  shopping and the many cultural resources of the city.\n              \n17\n.\n  Exmouth enjoys a half-hourly service to Exeter Central and Exeter St Davids.  This is made up of the roughly hourly service from Paignton \n to Exmouth \nand the hourly direct service \nfrom Barnstaple (the Tarka line)\n to  Exmouth\n.  \nTorbay\n has twice the population of Exmouth and Barnstaple put together.  Surely Paignton should have at least a h\nalf-hourly local service to the centre of Exeter.  Both the Exmouth and the Barnstaple lines are\n \nvery successful and extremely well used.  Figures given by First Great Western\n showed that journeys on the Exmouth (Avocet) line numbered 1.4million in 2012 and had increased by 10% and on the Barnstaple line by 78% since 2006.  A more frequent service f\nrom Barnstaple could help fill the gaps in the timetable between Paignton  and Exeter St Davids and between Torbay and Plymouth.\n1\n8\n. \n  If additional trains from Barnstaple ran to Paignton, they could give \na half-hourly service between Paignton and  Exeter \nSt Davids, filling gaps in the timetable,  give \nconnectivity \nand direct services between Torbay and Crediton and the other stations on the Barnstaple line\n.  \n1\n9\n.  Passenger\ns\n \n to Honiton and \n the \n stations\n on the way\n – Exeter Central, Pinhoe, Whimple, Feniton -\n from Exeter St Davids \n must\n \nchange  platforms for the hourly service, alternately fast trains, journey time  24 minutes, or slow train\n,\n 31 minutes stopping at every station.  This \nis part of the line\n to London \nWaterloo and needs doubling  \nthroughout\n \nits\n length.  This service \nused to run\n to Paignton\n, but was stopped at Exeter St Davids in December 2009\n.  \n  It should \nbe re-instated\n to Paignton\n.  \nIf it were, more gaps in the services to Torbay would be filled\n.\n20\n. \n \nThere are three direct trains from London Paddington.  The DfT helpfully suggested at one stage in the preparation for the cancelled bid for the Great Western franchise that a lunch-time IEP should be extended \nto Paignton.  This should certainly be implem\nented and would provide four trains conveniently spaced through the day.\n21\n.  \nT\nhe \nonly\n direct train from the north of England to Paignton\n runs on Saturdays \n.  This is a serious disadvantage for business travellers and tourists.  We wish to suggest that on \nMonday\ns\n to Friday\ns and Sundays\n,\n the\n \n0\n6.06 from Edinburgh \nshould be diverted from \nPlymouth\n to Paignton.  \nT\nhe 06.06\n.\n makes several \ncalls\n before arriving\n \nat Exeter at 13.44, Newton Abbot at 14.04, Totnes at 14.14\n and Plymouth at 14.46\n \n.  \nPassengers\n \nfor Torbay\n change at Newton Abbot and arrive \nin \nPaignton at 15.00\n.  \nIf this train w\nere\n diverted to Paignton passengers would arrive Paignton at about 14.24\n,\n \n 35 minutes earlier.  \nPassengers for Plymouth could change at Exeter\n on Newton Abbot \nfor a First Great Wester\nn service \narriving at\n Plymouth at 15.00\n,\n 14 minutes later than they otherwise would have done.  \nOn the return , the \ntrain departs\n from \n Plymouth at 15.24\n,\n calling at Newton Abbot at 16.01,\n  \nA\n local service leav\nes \n Plymouth at 15.08 arriving \nat \nNewton Abbot\n at 15.52\n.  \n \nIf the\n Crosscountry\n train w\nere\n diverted to Paignton it could leave Paignton about 15.40\n/15.45 \n arriving\n at\n Newton Abbot at 16.01. \nand continuing \n as\n currently\n scheduled to Leeds.\n  \nDiverting this train would provide a conveniently timed train providing direct service between the North East, Yorkshire and Torbay. \n  This change would provide a service comparable to that on Saturdays.\n22.  Coaches between Torbay and London run daily but\n take six hours, nearly twice the time taken by the train\n.  There is also one coach daily \nbetween\n Paignton \nand\n Newcastle, Bradford/Leeds and Rugby respectively.\n23\n.  \nIf t\nhe line \nwer\ne extended from Paignton to Goodrington\n it would\n serve developments at Long Park/White Rock on the western side of Paignton.  These include housing\n  (16,000-20,000 people)\n, the development and work of the South Devon College and its Energy Centre, business developments and also better connectivity with \nBrixham.  Access to this side of Paignton is difficult along congested roads with heavy traffic and many pedestrians.\n24.  \nThe \nH\neritage \nline \nruns \nfrom Paignton to Kingswear and the ferry to Dartmouth, another outstanding\n  \ntown attract\ning\n \n many visitors, wi\nth stations serving residential areas along its line.  The company runs excellent heritage trips for leisure visitors chiefly in the spring, summer and early autumn months and a few at bank holidays. \n              \n2\n5\n.  We believe \nthat\n \n if commuter trai\nns could run on \ntheir tracks\n,\n \n students\n would be able\n to reach the South Devon College easily and commuters get to their jobs.  Commuting journeys outside the times used by the \nH\neritage railway would not interfere with the latter’s use of the tracks, but would provide a v\nery valuable service to many people.  Such a development could provide better connectivity to Kingsbridge\n,\n Salcom\nb\ne\n and the South Hams\n, which are without stations and tracks.\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n……/\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBus Services\n2\n6\n .    \nO\nne good bus service run\ns\n \n between Newton A\nbbot and\n Brixham with\n a ten-minute frequency from 7.20 to 18.37, then every 20 minutes until 23.37. \n   \nBetween\n Newton Abbot \nand\n Paignton, the train takes 15 minutes, the bus 40 to 50 minutes.\n   \nFour\n \nservice\ns \n run every 15 \n or 20 \nminutes during the day Mondays to Saturdays and half-hourly in the evenings and on Sundays. \n27.  \nO\nther services\n run \nless frequently\n and\n rarely or  \nnot at all in the evenings or on Sundays.  This means that for those living in \nmost of Torbay\n,  no public tr\nansport is available for evening or Sunda\ny activities;  these residents \nand visitors are \nisolated and \ndependent on paying for taxis or cadging lifts\n - \n which can be embarrassing for both parties.\n28.  \nAccess to and from other parts of the county are diffic\nult and normally depend on making connections at Exeter, Plymouth\n, or another town.    Some services do not run every day, for example from a village to a town for a shopping expedition, so of no use to someone wishing to visit a village or a friend or rel\native there.  Some services run only one to four trips daily,\n excluding evenings and Sundays,\n so making possible difficulties in making return trips for whatever purpose, whether work, education, for hospital visits \nor similar reasons or\n \n visit\ns to\n friends\n or relatives.  These difficulties arise both for those coming to Torbay and for those going from Torbay.\n  It can be impossible to make a daytime return visit, still more to make an evening visit. \n&#xa0;\nResilience\n              \n29.  \nFor\n resilience, not only is the Teign Valley line or an equivalent required, but also the re-establishment of the former rout\ne via Okehampton – Tavistock – Plymouth.  A first stage would be the re-establishment of a regular daily service between Exeter and Ok\nehampton, particularly useful as a result of the recent closure of  several businesses and consequent increase in unemployment in Okehampton.  The line from Tavistock to Bere Alston and Plymouth is already \nwell advanced\n.  This leaves only the gap between O\nkehampton and Tavistock to be re-established.  \n              \n30.  In view of the increasing number of rail passengers and of older people who are less likely to drive, and of the need to reduce emissions from vehicles \nto meet the Government’s targets for climate chang\ne,\n  provision should be made by regulation, or if necessary by legislation, to safeguard \nthe track of \nformer rail lines, so that they remain avail\nable \nto be brought back into use.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n   \nNo.31, 18 May - 8 September  2013\n \n  ONS, UK travel flows, journey
