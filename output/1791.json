"&#xa0;\nVeronica Boulton â€“ Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRe: the Draft Deregulation Bill:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate. &#xa0;\nI spent 4 years on the Yorkshire Dales Access Forum and it increased my knowledge of a number of issues. Whilst YDNPA with input from YDNP \nLAF\n has now imposed permanent \nTRO\n's on the green lanes perceived, following detailed research, to be most in danger the same is not true of neighbouring authorities.\n&#xa0;\nI had long been aware of comments about the route over Deadman's Hill which being in Nidderdale falls outside the NP boundary. An improvement to the summer Sunday bus service enabled me to visit it about 2 years ago. I was horrified at the enormous depth of the ruts going up the hillside and forming a wide ribbon of erosion. Pressures were being put on North Yorkshire CC to place a permanent \nTRO\n on the route. However, despite considerable public pressure, they decided to place only a temporary \nTRO\n which runs out shortly. The current lack of any right of appeal frustrates users of the route. The inclusion of the modification suggested above would be a big help.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
