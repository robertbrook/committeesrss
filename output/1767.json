"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nWooler\n Parish Council (TIC 082)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n          1) Northumberland is the northern most county and unitary district in North East England.It borders Cumbria to the west,the Scottish Border Council area to the north and Tyne and Wear and County Durham to the south covering 1936 sq.miles.\n&#xa0;\n           2) The area to the north and west is predominantly rural comprising of a number of small towns and many villages and to the south and south east larger towns and urbanisation.\n&#xa0;\n           3) Public transport has enjoyed a renaissance in many urb\nan areas in recent years but outside of larger towns and cities its quality and quantity is,to say the least,patchy.Many rural communities have public transport services that are infrequent,finish early in the evening,and do not run at all on some weekends\n.It causes significant hardship,with evidence suggesting low income rural households in our region are often forced into buying and running a car when they cannot really afford to do so.\n&#xa0;\n           4) Without a doubt lack of a decent transport service und\nermines the economy of rural areas since it is more difficult for people to access services and jobs.\n&#xa0;\n           5) Life in rural Northumberland is very tough for many people and too many are stranded at home,lonely and isolated,struggling to shops where \nprices for food,fuel and other necessary purchases are typically higher than in urban areas.\n&#xa0;\n           6) It has often been suggested that taxi services could be a more cost effective alternative to bus services in deep rural areas however even costings \nto our nearest General Hospital for routine appointments are very expensive(Their is no bus service and the return taxi fare is approx.£100) and in the main unaffordable.Limited Community and voluntary services are available at a cost and many of our resid\nents rely on friends and neighbours to assist.\n&#xa0;\n           7) It is appreciated,by all members of our Parish Council,that the brief of the Transport Select Committee is not to consider individual cases,of which their will be many,but to consider overall me\nans of support and improvement to rural transport services.\n&#xa0;\n          8) As a Parish Council our responsibilities are to maintain links with and provide,where appropriate,support for our community.\n&#xa0;\n          9) A recent indication by our County Council h\nas suggested,due to financial restraints,a withdrawal of a subsidy funding to a local bus transport service(710),reducing the service from two to one PER WEEK.This service travels from Kelso,in the Scottish Borders Region,through many villages and small to\nwns on route to enable our communities to carry out visits to relatives and pursue limited leisure and shopping facilities on the major part of the journey which ends in the commercial district of Tyne and Wear.\n&#xa0;\n        10) The aim of Northumberland Count\ny Council would appear to withdraw the subsidy for the Saturday service,approx£7,200.per year,but to allow the Wednesday service to remain.\n&#xa0;\n        11) A public meeting was held by over 200 members of our community to show the level of concern to this pro\nposal.The Transport Support Manager of Northumberland C.C. also attended and as a result of intense,but sensible,discussion on the subject the subsidy will continue until April 2014 when a further review will be held.\n&#xa0;\n        12) It is hoped the subsidy w\nill continue and support and recommendations by the Transport Select Committee to the Government and Local County Councils will enable,not only our concerns,but our entire rural communities,to have a worthwhile and sustainable bus transport service.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
