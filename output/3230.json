"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by John Martin [FBB0007]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn my view the BBC’s daily news reporting and other political programmes (\ne.g\n \nNewsnight\n) are heavily biased in favour of the left.  It is clearly evident that the BBC is operating from a left wing agenda which is having the affect of continually brainwashi\nng the public and undermining our democratic process.  \n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe reports are extremely biased and have been for at least the last decade.  In my view it is more like a party political broadcast, knocking the right and promoting the left at EVERY opportunity.  \nIt is a sickening disgrace and whoever is pulling the strings should be shown up and bought to book.  We are supposedly living in a democracy but the BBC has changed the status quo with its continual pro left wing stance.  The fact that I have to pay for t\nhis daily barrage of propaganda is diabolical and wrong.  The damage that the BBC’s abuse of power has caused this country is beyond comprehension.\n&#xa0;\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn view of the dire and far reaching consequences of the BB\nC\n’s actions that continue to tear this country a\npart, there should be an immediate full and in depth public inquiry.  It is mind boggling to note how long the organization has got away with this an\nti\n democratic process which in my view is as bad, if not worse than the recent \n‘paedophile’\n \nrevelations bec\nause of the untold damage to our nation.\n    \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
