[normal]Additional [bold]written [bold]evidence [bold]from the Open Data User Group[bold] (ODUG)[bold] [OD 29][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction
[normal]The Open Data User Group
[normal] (ODUG)
[normal] welcomes this opportunity to provide additional evidence to the 
[normal]i
[normal]nquiry 
[normal]on statistics and open data 
[normal]and to clarify certain points in the light of 
[normal]the ora
[normal]l evidence
[normal] given to-date
[normal], 
[normal]in particular that provided by M
[normal]inisters from BIS
[normal] and 
[normal]the Cabinet Office and the National Statistician
[normal].
[normal]ODUG is impressed by the breadth and d
[normal]epth of the 
[normal]inquiry
[normal]. Informed questioning from the committee is bringing to light a range of 
[normal]contradictions in government policy which need to 
[normal]be 
[normal]resolved if open d
[normal]ata is to contribute fully to the accountability, choice and growth agendas as laid out in t
[normal]he Open Data White Paper
[normal].
[normal]In this additional evidence we will outline a number of principles that have been raised by and with the committee. We will also provide short case studies that illustrate these 
[normal]principles
[normal] and other relevant documents as appendic
[normal]es to this evidence.
[normal]Issues raised as a result of evidence given to the committee
[normal]A number of witnesses 
[normal]referred to the National Information Infrastructure
[normal] (NII)
[normal] as proposed in the Shakespeare Review
[normal]. ODUG welcomes the strong encouragement for government departments to choose their “most important” datasets and to ensure that those are made available under the Open Government Licence (OGL) as open data.
[normal]However, 
[normal]it is our view that 
[normal]the 
[normal]currently selected 
[normal]department data sets will not necessarily provide a coherent “infrastructure”.
[normal] Also, w
[normal]hil
[normal]st
[normal] the number of data sets released by particular departments may be a useful indicator of that department’s commitment to t
[normal]he open data agenda, data sets that have been held back, for reasons other than the protection of personal data, may be a better indicator of a lack of commitment, for whatever reason, to open data.
[normal]ODUG also believes that not all data sets are of equal im
[normal]portance. In our view the term “
[normal]core 
[normal]reference
[normal] data
[normal]” should be reserved for data sets which are the primary source of an identifier such as a VAT number, a Company Number, a Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN), a Postcode or a code used to identify a s
[normal]tatistical or administrative area.
[normal]Such 
[normal]core 
[normal]reference 
[normal]data is essential to allow 
[normal]other 
[normal]data sets to be linked and to check the quality of data. This point was well made by Jil Matheson, the National Statistician, in relation to the National Address Regist
[normal]er. Th
[normal]is is a particularly important 
[normal]core reference data 
[normal]set
[normal] which we discuss
[normal], as a case study, in Appendix 1
[normal]. Its 
[normal]special
[normal] importance was also noted in the Open Data White Paper
[normal]1
[normal] which included
[normal] a commitment to resolve the issue of national address data.
[normal]Th
[normal]e Office for National Statistics has a very good reco
[normal]rd of releasing core reference data
[normal] relating to statistical or administrative areas as open data. These include the ONS Standard Names And Codes (SNAC) database and the ONS Postcode Directory 
[normal](
[normal]s
[normal]ee Append
[normal]ix 3) 
[normal]which has only relatively recently 
[normal]become available as Open Data because it was previously kept closed under the commercial GridLink agreement between ONS, Royal Mail and Ordnance Survey
[normal] (OS)
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he ONS Postcode 
[normal]directory, while very useful
[normal],
[normal] only prov
[normal]ides Postcode
[normal]s
[normal] to administrative and statistical area conversions 
[normal]and 
[normal]does not list individual addresses (postcodes on average refer to about 14 addresses).
[normal]Where core reference data is not made available this may prevent the release of other data sets as 
[normal]open data in a usable form
[normal] or the ability to derive the maximum benefit from datasets which are made open
[normal]. Many of the requests for open data on data.gov.uk are for addressed lists of particular types of facilities, such as schools or libraries, or for dat
[normal]a about properties such as Energy Performance Certificate Data. An 
[normal]O
[normal]pen National Address 
[normal]R
[normal]egister would ensure that all such data sets could be referenced using a Unique Property Reference Number from which a correct administrative or postal address could 
[normal]be established. Without access to an 
[normal]O
[normal]pen National Address Register either such data isn’t published, or it is published with non-standard addresses making it difficult to match to 
[normal]and combine with 
[normal]other data sets.
[normal]ODUG notes that the term Nati
[normal]onal 
[normal]Information Infrastructure
[normal] 
[normal]might imply that a new “infrastructure” needs to be built. We believe that much of the infrastructure and much of the data that could and should be released as open data already exist
[normal]s
[normal]. We concur with APPSI (the Advisory Panel on
[normal] Public Sector Information
[normal])
[normal], who raised many of the issues associated with making the National Information Infrastructure work in their October 2012 Discussion Paper on a National Information Framework
[normal].
[normal]ODUG believes that the data.gov.uk data request form
[normal]s submitted by the public provide an equal, or more valid measure of what should constitute either “core data”, or “core 
[normal]reference
[normal] data” in a National Information Infrastructure
[normal], rather
[normal] than the data sets offered by departments.
[normal] We also question the criter
[normal]ia by which departments have been asked to identify their data inventories for the NII, and suspect that there are many useful datasets which are not, as yet, part of the NII.
[normal]However, g
[normal]iven that departments are 
[normal]now 
[normal]strongly encouraged to provide an invent
[normal]ory of unpublished data sets we believe that 
[normal]immediate 
[normal]effort is best expended on releasing that data which has been requested, 
[normal]or identified in the NII, with a focus on the data requested as this 
[normal]can be expected to be put to immediate beneficial use, 
[normal]rath
[normal]er than trying to release all data particularly where data has to be documented or refined for release. ODUG can, and does, assist in the assessment and interpretation of open data 
[normal]requests and the prioritisation of further datasets identified in the NII.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Despite 
[normal]a government commitment to open policy making ODUG has noticed a marked disparity between the openness of 
[normal]the 
[normal]decisions
[normal] made
[normal] to open datasets 
[normal]with 
[normal]the requirement to make business cases for 
[normal]releasing
[normal] data
[normal] and the closed
[normal], often
[normal] unaccountable
[normal],
[normal] process
[normal] associated with decisions not to release data, or
[normal] only
[normal] to make data 
[normal]available under a commercial license.
[normal]Several 
[normal]examples characterise the problem. One was the decision to privatise the Royal Mail Postcod
[normal]e Address File
[normal] (PAF)
[normal] (see Appendix 2)
[normal]. 
[normal]The case for opening PAF was made publicly, while the advice that led to the decision to sell PAF with 
[normal]the 
[normal]Royal Mail was largely opaque or incomplete. For 
[normal]example Ofcom’s 
[normal]2013 
[normal]consultation on PAF was redacted to the 
[normal]point of being quite useless in assessing whether the price charged for PAF is ‘reasonable’, as required by the Posta
[normal]l
[normal] Services Acts (
[normal]an example of 
[normal]the
[normal] redaction
[normal] in the Ofcom consultation 
[normal]is provided in 
[normal]Appendix 
[normal]6).
[normal]Equally, d
[normal]espite substantial lobbying fr
[normal]om many sources
[normal], over many years,
[normal] to establish an 
[normal]O
[normal]pen National Address Register the Government’s decision
[normal], in 
[normal]2010 
[normal]to set up GeoPlace LLP a limited liability partnership between Ordnance Survey
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]the Local G
[normal]overnment Association
[normal] (LGA) 
[normal]was presented as a
[normal] simple unjustified announcement. GeoPlace
[normal]’
[normal]s corporate structure is one chosen by many Private Equity companies because it allows the financial dealings of the company to be priva
[normal]te. The annual statement of GeoP
[normal]lace LLP
[normal] 
[normal]contains no financial information o
[normal]ther than the three main sources of revenue
[normal] and the anticipation that GeoP
[normal]lace will produce a surplus which will be returned to OS and the LGA.
[normal]A final example of closed policy making, which is still under consideration, concerns the obstruction of Her Maj
[normal]esty’s Land Registry open data programme. HMLR are obliged, under the European INSPIRE legislation
[normal],
[normal] as transposed into UK law, to make a cadastral (property ownership parcel) dataset publicly available. HMLR 
[normal]are
[normal] inclined, in line with their exemplary open 
[normal]data policies on house price data, to make the outlines of the land parcels openly available for general re-use
[normal], and have released this data
[normal] as open data. However the
[normal] open use of the data 
[normal]is 
[normal]being 
[normal]impeded by 
[normal]the 
[normal]Ordnance Survey who claim that the land parc
[normal]els are 
[normal]OS 
[normal]‘derived data’ and any commercial re-use 
[normal]will involve a d
[normal]ata royalty 
[normal]paid directly 
[normal]to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Ordnance Survey, despite the fact that OS neither 
[normal]owns, maintains 
[normal]or delivers this data
[normal] (Appendix 4)
[normal].
[normal]The 
[normal]rationale for the Ordnance Survey’s stance and th
[normal]e level of royalty payments has
[normal] been extraordinarily hard to ascertain and, as a result, the HMLR data is still not available for 
[normal]open 
[normal]re-use. A publicly owned company KentGIS, 
[normal]which should have access to the 
[normal]INSPIRE cadastral 
[normal]data under the Public Sector 
[normal]Mapping Agreement (PSMA)
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]funded by the government
[normal], 
[normal]recently 
[normal]created a useful display service for the data which
[normal] 
[normal]allowed the public to view Land Parcels
[normal] nationally, for free. However this service has recently been
[normal] closed down following a protest from Ordna
[normal]nce Survey.
[normal] So, despite the best efforts of HMLR, the INSPIRE data is not open for either public or private sector use and re-use.
[normal]There are many more examples where a government department or agency decides not to make publicly funded data openly availabl
[normal]e for viewing and re-use
[normal]. 
[normal]ODUG, on behalf of data consumers, is working to make the case that certain individual datasets of high potential value to the wider economy should be made open. However, despite the presumption that public data should be made ope
[normal]n
[normal], as the c
[normal]ommittee has noted, there is no-
[normal]one in government, outside the Cabinet Office, to ensure that open data policies 
[normal]are enforced and
[normal] littl
[normal]e consistency across government around the decision-making process for opening up data.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Normally 
[normal]government open data is public sector information which is necessary in order to perform a specific public task. Such data has been fully funded by the budget for that task and can be released as open 
[normal]data
[normal] at a marginal cost which in an Internet environment is likely to be close to zero.
[normal] The cost 
[normal]of the
[normal] release of such data can usually be absorbed into the public task budget that led to the data being created and maintained. 
[normal]More problematic is data wh
[normal]ich is not associated with any one specific public task but is used widely across government. Such data includes statistical information and geospatial information. Following the Rayner review which started in 1979 and reported in 1982 an internal market w
[normal]as created for statistical and geospatial information. 
[normal]Government departments were expected to pay for such information and to act as intelligent customers. In the case of statistical information, the job of re-selling the information, in particular Censu
[normal]s information
[normal],
[normal] was given to private, for
[normal]-
[normal]profit census agencies, which paid an annual lice
[normal]nce fee for the privilege of 
[normal]selling census data. This led to a situation where some government agencies found Census data too expensive to use. Ordnance Survey also 
[normal]moved, more successfully, into cost recovery trading and successfully recovered a larger proportion of its costs than the statistical service.
[normal]Around 2000 a review of Crown Copyright data was carried out 
[normal]which found
[normal] that the statistical service was recover
[normal]ing a 
[normal]very 
[normal]low proportion of its costs, while government departments were being deprived of access to necessary statistical information. Statistical information 
[normal]then 
[normal]came out of the cost recovery / tradable information regime and effectively became open da
[normal]ta. Since that time the usage, the variety and the quality of statistical information has increased markedly.
[normal]At about the same time the Ordnance Survey was confirmed as a trading fund and was expected to move towards 100% cost recovery and now returns a s
[normal]ignificant surplus to the 
[normal]Treasury. However much of this cost recovery and surplus
[normal] is illusory because Ordnance Survey earns a relatively low proportion of its revenue from the private sector. The bulk of its revenue comes from 
[normal]government 
[normal]payments for the 
[normal]Public Sector Mapping Agreement 
[normal](PSMA) 
[normal]and for Ordnance Survey Open Data.
[normal]In the same way that some Government departments could not afford to buy statistical information when the cost recovery regime was in place, prior to the Public Sector Mapping Agreem
[normal]ent, departments, including ONS, could not afford access to all the Ordnance Survey Data that they could, or should have used.
[normal]A
[normal] significant amount of 
[normal]Ordnance Survey’s 
[normal]supposedly private sector revenue is actually derived from quasi-private bodies such as
[normal] not
[normal]-
[normal]for
[normal]-
[normal]profit Housing Associations, the utilities and from the sale of maps for planning applications for which there is little or no competition and which generate disproportionately large revenues for Ordnance Survey and their re-seller partners. All o
[normal]f these 
[normal]supposed trading revenues are high surplus monopoly rents, which are effectively a tax on data use 
[normal]rather 
[normal]than no
[normal]rmal competitive market profits. It is important also, to put th
[normal]e surplus OS returns to the treasury
[normal] into the context of the very subst
[normal]antial market for geospatial information in which 
[normal]it
[normal] operates which is estimated to be worth £bns a year. Despite their monopoly position OS captures very little 
[normal]value from the overall 
[normal]market. ODUG believes that
[normal] this is a growth opportunity for the UK and
[normal],
[normal] were OS to open up its data, there would be substantial opportunities for private companies in this sector
[normal]. We believe that the OS should be funded by government to perform its important public task, as the National Mapping Agency, but that the commercial
[normal]isation of this data, and the many derivative products and services it can drive is best left to the private sector. 
[normal]An alternat
[normal]e regime for recovering
[normal] the costs of
[normal] currently charged for government information, mainly from the trading funds
[normal],
[normal] could be base
[normal]d on charging those who cause core reference information to change, rather than those who seek to use it. This is the model that allows Land Registry and Companies House to release significant and increasing parts of their data holdings as open data.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Open data is justified in the Open Data White Paper because of the impact it has on Transparency, Efficiency, Accountability, Citizen 
[normal]C
[normal]hoice and Economic Growth. Yet much of the argument and most of the business cases demanded for open data 
[normal]have to be centred on evidenced economic growth. This is difficult to prove as projections are inevitably conjectural
[normal] and it is very difficult
[normal], if not impossible, to
[normal] identify the enterprises that will grow as a result of 
[normal]an 
[normal]open data release.
[normal]However a rec
[normal]ent article in the Financial Pages of the New Yorker has been widely acclaimed as explaining why crude attempts to measure the impact of open data on GDP may be incorrect (Appendix 7 – Gross Domestic Freebie). 
[normal]Witnesses and some members of the committee a
[normal]ppeared to believe that an important reason for not releasing open data is that it gives large multinational corporations (such as Google and Microsoft for example) a free ride and that they should not be let off from paying a fair price for the informatio
[normal]n infrastructure that they use. However this ignores the fact that most of them are choosing not to licence or pay for government information at present. The effect of charging for data doesn’t impact on the multinationals at all, 
[normal]as the amounts they are c
[normal]harged have no material impact on their bottom line. However, charging for the data
[normal] prevent
[normal]s
[normal] the societal benefits that would accrue to all citizen
[normal]s
[normal] from easier free access to data as well as the Small and Medium businesses that would generate new products
[normal] and services on the back of open data
[normal], unencumbered by complex and costly licensing regimes.
[normal]Charging for data, rather than bringing in addition revenue from large wealthy corporations, limits use of the data to medium sized companies. What is worse is th
[normal]at the revenue isn’t being used to maintain the data itself, which is a relatively inexpensive process. It is being used to maintain the bloated sales, marketing, and administrative structures necessary to protect the intellectual property rights of the or
[normal]ganisations that are keeping the data closed.
[normal]In his evidence to the inquiry the Minister of State for Business and Energy stated that the he was seeking ways to differentiate the costs of charged for public data for small businesses. ODUG does not think i
[normal]t is possible to implement a differentiated pricing regime as suggested under the existing Information Fair Trader Scheme
[normal] and EU State Aid rules
[normal]. Equally the burden of putting in place such complex licensing regimes has already been noted as an inefficie
[normal]ncy in itself and as significant burden on small businesses. 
[normal]We believe that current levels of government expenditure on government produced public sector information, are 
[normal]already 
[normal]sufficient to release that information as open data. Charging regimes 
[normal]fund 
[normal]an
[normal] army of data use preventers creating jobs inventing pricing and licensing schemes which are unnecessary. As an example we illustrate this effect for the Royal Mail Postcode Address File (PAF)  in Appendix 2, though we are limited in the extent to which 
[normal]we can do so because of the secrecy that has surrounded the real cost of the PAF.
[normal]Societal benefit
[normal] accrues when data is used. T
[normal]he New Yorker article 
[normal]reports
[normal] massive, though unmeasured, societal benefits accrue to all of those consuming ‘Free’
[normal] services from
[normal] c
[normal]orporations such as Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Yahoo and Apple.  Of course each of these 
[normal]businesses 
[normal]has alternative sources of revenue which fund their ‘free’ data and ‘free’ services. However, as this business model now dominates and consumers/citizen
[normal]s
[normal] are used to consuming and using data at no 
[normal]cost, but paying for the services in another way, it is counter-productive for a small number of government, or recently privatised
[normal],
[normal] agencies to swim against this tide
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion[bold]A number of previous select com
[normal]mittees, and government advisers such as Sir Michael Scholar then Chair of the Statistics Authorities (see letter in Appendix 5) who have consistently called for an open data mechanism to maximise the beneficial use of public sector data.
[normal]These requests pr
[normal]oposals and comments have consistently been ignored in order to chase the illusory revenues, which have never been delivered
[normal] to their full potential
[normal], from closed data regimes.
[normal]The UK
[normal]’
[normal]s leading role in the Open Government Partnership and the rapid move towa
[normal]rds open public data in Europe and the US, which in turn is leading to massively greater data re-use, with associated societal benefits and economic growth potential, should lead the committee to recommend a rethink in government over the remaining closed 
[normal]data regimes. 
[normal]We would also welcome an endorsement by the committee 
[normal]for
[normal] more open policy making in this area so that, at the very least, closed data decisions are as openly
[normal] and transparently
[normal] 
[normal]justified as
[normal] is the case for open data.
[normal] We would hope that
[normal],
[normal] in t
[normal]he light of such transparency, open data would prevail more often.
