"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from Virgin Trains (WRT 008)&#xa0;INTRODUCTION&#xa0;Virgin Trains operates services on the West Coast Mainline, serving London England’s West Midlands and North West, Scotland and North Wales.\n In 2012-13 we carried 30 million passengers.\n&#xa0;SUMMARY&#xa0;Our core aim is to maintain services as close to the advertised services as possible, rather than making an early switch to emergency timetables. This may have an adverse impact on our performance \nstatistics\n.\n However, we firmly believe our approach gives our \ncustomers\n confidence about making journeys and reduces conflicting information appearing in different channels.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nVirgin Trains is a learning organisation, and our plans for snow and icy condit\nions are re-visited regularly to take account of experience. Our winterisation plan for trains and stations is reviewed annually and re briefed to front line teams (usually in late summer as we start to stock up on our de icing supplies).\n&#xa0;\nSocial media pla\nys an increasing part in keeping customers up-to-date during disruption and we will shortly be able to provide social media coverage for the entire period of train operation. \n&#xa0;\nVIRGIN TRAINS APPROACH DURING SEVERE WEATHER \n&#xa0;\nMaintaining the advertised timetable&#xa0;\nAs a long-distance operator \nwe have a distinct customer profile, with over half in possession of a seat reservation for a specific train \nfor their journey. These reservations are either made automatically \nthough purchase of an Advance ticket or through making \na seat reservation to \naccompany\n a flexible ticket. \n&#xa0;\nTh\ne high proportion of reservations \nis a key factor on operational decisions taken during periods of severe weather.\n Our approach is to maintain as \nfar as possible \nour advertised services so that customers know that their reservations will remain in place. Maintaining advertised services is also important as many local services run by \nTransPennine\n Express, Northern, London Midland and \nScotRail\n  and\n ar\ne planned around our timetable.\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe industry standard \njudges\n \npunctuality\n against an emergency timetable once it is introduced rather \nthen\n the standard timetable it replaces.\n There is therefore an incentive to introduce emergency timetables earlier than op\nerational conditions would demand. \nFor the reasons outlined above w\ne remain committed to\n only introducing an emergency timetable if there is no alternative\n, \ndespite the negative effect this may have on the Public Performance Measures released\n \neach period \nt\no\n much media scrutiny.\n&#xa0;\n \nCurrent preparations   \n   \nAs a result of\n learning from pr\ne\nvious years’ experience\n we have made a number of changes to our preparations, including:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSocial media         &#xa0;Virgin Trains \nhas a combined \nFacebook\n and Twitter following of 160,000.\n Twitter tends to be the favoured option for customers to receive updates during disruption. As well as providing factual journey information Twitter can have a profound effect on custo\nmer insight into the underlying problems causing disruption to their journeys. A single photograph of a lightning strike in Manchester - which caused signal failure and extensive disruption \n–\n \nreduced the level of irritation felt by customers on twitter.\n&#xa0;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;INSERT E\nXTENT OF TWITTER USE DURING DIS\nR\nUPTION\n&#xa0;\nOur \nT\nwitter feed is maintained by \ninformation controllers \nlocated within our operational control centre\n. \n These roles were specifically created to improve the provision of passenger information during disr\nuption through a variety of channels. \n \nImmediate access to current information on performance allows them to provide a key link with customers.\n&#xa0;\nAt the moment \nwe offer a Twitter service from 0800 to 2000\n. We plan to move to full first train-last train cove\nrage\n \nwithin a matter of weeks.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
