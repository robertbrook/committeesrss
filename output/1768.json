"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by The Institute of Marine Engineering, Science &amp; Technology (IMarEST) (WSC080)1. Executive Summary\n1.1 The losses known as the ‘leaky \npipeline’ are not usua\nlly the result of women choosing\n no\nt to progress their careers. Those who wish to succeed will do so. However, this requi\nres a supportive employer and the \nwillingness for an employer to offer women the opportunity to progress.\n1. 2 Th\ne issues facing women in STEM careers are not necessarily specific to STEM. Many of the issues apply to women across all careers and are related to work life balance and the consequences of having a family.\n1.3 There are specificities in a career in marine\n STEM that make it even harder for women to succeed compared to ot\nher STEM careers. These include\n disproportionately low numbers of women in all roles and the additional challenges of working offshore or at sea.\n1.4 Role models in STEM are vital. These rol\ne models must be carefully selected. There is a perception that many of the role models in Marine STEM have got to high level positions by compromising; by not having a family or by becoming “one of the boys” having the opposite effect.\n2. Introduction\n2. 1 \nThe \nIMarEST is the international professional body and learned society for all marine professionals, a registered charity and the first Institute to bring together marine engineers, scientists and technologists into one international multi-disciplinar\ny professional body.\n2.2 \nIMarEST is the largest marine organisation of its kind with a worldwide membership based in over 100 countries and provides grades of membership for everyone, from those seeking to become \nchartered\n or gain other Professional Recogn\nition, to those just starting out in their careers or studying in education.\n2.3 \nThe IMarEST is submitting this response to the select committee on behalf of its membership, in particular its female members. The IMarEST specifically requested input from fe\nmale members by a direct email request but also welcomed comments from m\nale members with \nthe opportunity to contribute \nmade \nthrough the IMarEST website.\n  Members were specifically asked to answer the questions from a Marine \nSTEM perspective addressing the\n \nadditional challenges facing\n women in the workplace \nassociated wi\nth working offshore and at sea.\n2.4 \nThe IMarEST currently has \n427 female members\n comprising\n just over 3% of the tota\nl membership. Only 1.5% of members\n registered as Chartered Engineer\n (CEng)\n \nthrough the IMarEST are women. However, around 35% of those re\ngistered as Chartered Scientist\n (CSci) \nthrough the IMarEST are women\n \n(\nconsistent with \nother Science Council licenced\n bodies\n)\n.\n This implies the issues facing women in \nmarine e\nngineering are even \nmore pronounced than in\n marine science and t\nechnology.\n  \n \n2.5 A\nlthough they are no figures available on the total numbers of women working in the UK in marine STEM the numbers\n are\n assumed \nto be low \n(particularly at \nmiddle to senior management \nlevels\n)\n given\n global trends\n.  According\n to the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) \nw\nomen make up only an estimated 2%\n (23,000 individuals)\n o\nf\n the world's maritime workforce. Women seafarers work mainly in the cruise and ferries sector, often for Flags of \nConvenience (FOC) \nvessels\n which means they are subject to the labour laws (or lack of) of the country to which the ship is registered\n. \nThe ITF report that t\nhese are among the worst paid and least protected of \nall \njobs at sea. Women also tend to be younger,\n and fewer are officers than their male crew mates.\n The ITF report that \nthe low number of women employed means that it is inevitable that discrimination and harassment will occur.\n2.6 I\nn Marine Science the Intergover\nn\nmental Oceanographic Commission of \nUNESCO (IOC of UNESCO) reported that around 25% of representatives\n (comprised of senior figures in Ocean Sciences in the UN member states)\n at its recent G\neneral Assembly were women. The commission itself\n have a femal\ne Executive Secretary\n and a secretariat \nof 30% female. However, this number drops to 9% if only the technical secretariat staff are considered (\ni.e.\n those actively working in STEM roles)\n2.7 P\nrofessional membership\n bodies, particularly those in e\nngineering have long been seen \nas Gentleme\nn’s club\ns. In accordance with guidelines being issued \nby organisations such as Women i\nn Science and Engineering (WISE) and th\ne Royal Society of Edinburgh i\nns\nt\nitutes such as the IMarEST are examining the way they recruit and retain female members and support them t\nhrough their careers. This is being done in hand with other initiatives such as the International Maritime Organizations “Women at the Helm” and the IOC’s proposed “Network of Women”.\n2.8 \nIMarEST members who responded to the call for evidence are at differ\nent stages in their careers from students through to managing direc\ntors. They are employed across marine engineering, s\ncie\nnce and t\nechnology in the public, private and academic sectors. Most are based in the UK but some are based overseas or have experienc\ne in working overseas. There was an equal split in response between those members who have children and those who do not.\n The evidence provided is largely anecdotal as no formal studies have been carried out.\n3. Why do numbers of women in STEM academic car\neers decline further up the career ladder?\n3.1 \nBalancing a family with a work life is seen as the\n biggest cause of this decline.\n \n \nS\nome women \nhave no choice but\n to permanently leave to bring up their families.\n  T\nhere are often fewer opportunities for STEM \njobs to be carried out as part-time roles and/or to allow flexible working arrangement for those women who want to return after maternity leave.\n This was perceived to be more of a factor in academia than in the public of private sector where the metrics us\ned to judge success in academia are challenging.  Being less able to travel for work because of family commitments can seri\nously hamper career progression. This is particularly relevant in\n marine science when scientific research cruises may be days, weeks \nor even months in duration.  Presenting at conferences\n (normally overseas)\n and working in collaborative projects are near impossible \nfor women with young children \nand opportunities for informal networking with peers are missed. Senior academics and manager\ns want to be able to send their staff to events to raise their organisation’s profile and will be reluctant to employ women who can’t travel for extended periods. \n In addition, the \ntemporary/short term funding model for research gives very little security,\n which is, again, non-conducive to starting a family. \nWith the focus on high output of high-quality journal papers as the measure of success (of individuals and universities) this also puts extra pressure on women who take time out for family commitments.\n3.2 \nThe culture of academia was questioned and those members who worked in academia, particularly overseas, reported that most senior academics are seen to work evenings and weekends and most would not take anywhere near their annual leave allowance.  For \nwoman who have, or are wanting to have a family\n, \nthis culture makes it extremely difficult to stay in academia. \n \n3.3 \nMembers commented that \nthe academic environment is often aggressive, without offering compensation in terms of job satisfaction. There is \na general belief that individuals are working against one another and constructive criticism can be harsh and a demonstration of ‘one-upmanship’. This contributes to a feeling that part time working and parental leave is frowned upon and will compromise a \nwoman’s career.\n3.4 \nThe hierarchy is very male dominated and perceived as unsympathetic to young females entering academia.  There is a lack of female role models. On the occasions when female supervisors were experienced, it did not seem that these women \nwere particularly interested in supporting other women in STEM, giving the i\nmpression that incoming female students and post-docs were a threat, and treating them with hostility\n. In many cases men were seen as better role models within academia. However, t\nhere is a lack of mentoring \nlevel\n for women\n that men typically receive, both formally and informally. This may be because there is some stigma against senior men associating with junior women (either real or perceived).\n3.5 \nS\ntatistically, successful women \nare more like to be in a dual career couple, and the challenges inherent within this are more likely to result in the woman rather than the man tailoring back their work\n with mothers normally the primary care giver\n. Correspondence in Nature (\nhttp://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n4/pdf/ngeo1113.pdf\n) supports this \nwithin the field of \nphysical oceanography, where the women to men ratio \nis decreased\n higher up the academic ladder\n in the U\nS\n. What is most worrying is that the \nwomen/male ratio\n has decrease\nd\n in the last\n 20/30 years or so and the report concludes that\n&#xa0;\n“First, family relationships affect women’s academic careers more than men’s. Academic women typically have a spouse employed fu\nll time, and women with children are less likely to enter the tenure track than men\n”\n \n3.6 A\ncademic careers frequently require people to move across countries or continents, and women, who are more likely to be in dual career couples, are therefore more lik\nely to be penalised by this, as they are statistically more likely to be earning less than their male counterpart and may also have additional childcare responsibilities. If couples wish to stay together geographically, it is statistically more likely that\n the women’s career will suffer, rather than the man’s.\n3.7 \nThere is evidence in an u\nnconscious bias in job promotion/hiring. A study in PNAS (Moss Racusin et al., 2012, \nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/14/1211286109#aff-1\n) showed that both men and women research scientists showed bias in favouring male applications over female \nones (only name changed). The sexism exhibited was unconscious, as scientists would \ngive other reasoning for their decision. We need more awareness of this, so that a conscious effort can be made to overcome any such bias; obviously there are academics who would want to change this, if only they knew they were doing it!\n3.8 \nWomen often un\ndervalue their ability and their academic potential.  It is common to hear from women with an academic background that they didn’t feel they were ‘good’ at it.\n3.9 \nAcademia still suffers from an image problem – young, female graduates do not perceive acade\nmia as a profession.  It continues to be seen as a continuation of the student lifestyle, descending into the wearing of knitted tank tops and an ever diminishing range of focus.\n \n3.10 \nFinally, there were those members who simply chose to leave academia fo\nr\n reasons unrelated to gender. T\nhey simply did not wish to\n follow an academic career and \nwished to take a \njob in industry where the knowledge was applied more directly\n. Additionally, \nacademic \ncareers are\n unlikely to offer the same financial rewards as working in industry at a senior level. Depending on the industry you work in,\n&#xa0;\nbenefits such as promotion, bonuses, recognition from your client(s), opportunities \nfor CPD \nmay happen in faster timelines than i\nn \nacademia. \nWomen \nin particular \nmay feel they want this faster route especially if they are planning to have a break to have a family.\n4. \nWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained w\nomen applying their skills in different employment sectors?\n4.1 \nAll those responding to the call for evidence were still employed in STEM careers within\n the marine sector\n \n(\noil \nand gas majors, RN\n, shipping companies and consultancies for example\n)\n.  Many rep\norted they found\n resistance to women doing engineering and \nproviding \nscientific advice \nin the maritime sector and \noffshore where it is still a male dominated society.\n&#xa0;\n Going into \nmanagerial aspects of work and became a project manager rather than a scienti\nfic specialist\n was seen as an only option for career progression.\n4.2 \nThe consequences of employing women in different, \ni.e.\n \"non-typical\" sectors e\n.\ng\n.\n shipyards is positive in all directions. It is good for the traditional men to meet intelligent women. I\nt is character building for the intelligent women to meet traditional men. It is beneficial for the industry to draw employees from a wider pool of humanity.\n4.3 \nThe same problem occurs for women p\nrogressing up the career ladder\n in industry as in academia \nin that \nit tends to happen at the same time\n as they will wish to start a \nfamily. Most higher-\ntier j\nobs require full time working particularly if it involves managing junior staff\n.  \nEven if a part time, flexible working pattern can be established this often\n mean\ns women simply work longer, non-\ncontracted h\nours in order to \ncomplete what is l\nikely to be a similar workload \nto someone working full time. If not already employed\n by a supportive employer when starting a family\n, part time, flexible opportunities are \ndifficult to find.\n4.4 \nMost engineers work in the private sector, where there is very \nstill very \nlittle precedence of part time working patterns, particularly in the higher tiers. Public sector employers (\ne.g.\n the NHS and Education Boards) are more able to\n cope with part time working patterns, hence \none of the reasons why \nfemale doctors and senior teachers are much more prevalent than female engineers.\n&#xa0;\n4.5 \nThe perception is that i\nf a woman takes time out of her job when her children are young she will find\n it difficult to progress to a higher grade when she returns. She will find it easier and more \"flexible\" to remain at that gr\nade. M\nanagement are happy to have a talented woman in a medium grade position and will accommodate her needs for occasional sports\n \nday / parent teacher meeting and for non-standard hours \nso long as she stays in that position. They will not, \ntypically, \nhowever, consider her for boardroom positions. The industry therefore loses the benefits of that woman's scientific training, experien\nce and ability when recruiting to its top positions. Eventually the woman will get tired of remaining at the same grade and will be lost to the industry completely.\n4.6 \nSome of the more senior members who responded to the consultation commented that \nbetwee\nn 20 and 30 years ago t\nhere was a lot more discrimination. \nAlthough positive steps have been made there is a legacy \nthat far less women in their 50s have spent the past 30 years working\n their way up the career ladder as men,\n so \nthere are not many available\n in senior positions\n. Although there may be many more young women around now at lower levels, they do not tend to have any women in the chain of command above them. When they look upwards, what do they see – an all-male line. Many have no female role model\ns in their company. They get discouraged, and leave to join a company with a better track record for promoting women.\n4.7 \nWithin the maritime and offshore sector there are perceived excuses for\n discrimination. For example, on offshore platforms t\nhere are o\nften no female toilets and \noften only \ncommunal showers\n. Men regard offshore platforms as a male preserve where they \ncan carry out activities that are not acceptable in mixed g\nender employment. In addition, \nmany \noffshore\n platforms do \nnot have single rooms\n. \nAccommodation is very tight and beds cannot afford to be left\n empty. Some \ncompanies \nget \naround it by only employing women in even numbers. (There are often female catering and cleaning staff, \nwhich\n the female engineers can be paired with). Others pair a wo\nman with a man who is on a different shift, so that they are never in the cabin at the same time. Others use it as an excuse not to take women at all. \n4.8 \nIn the \nm\naritime sector there are very few females in the senior positions, both on board ship and as\nhore.\n O\nne of the better shipping companies, who offer opportunities to young female cadets, still only have 1 female chief engineer on their fleet of ships and no female captains. Ashore there are very few\n female Superintendents and wome\nn appear mostly in \npersonnel and human resources roles.\n4.9 \nThe maritime sector differs hugely to most other industries in that it requires workers to work away from home for extended periods which does not lend itself kindly to raising children. There is not a lot that ship\nping companies can do about this\n. H\nowever\n,\n they should offer other opportunities within the company so that while a woman raises her family she may be able to work in a shore based role and should be given \nevery\n opportunity to do so, such as relocation, \net\nc.\n - which is not uncommon in other shore based industries.\n&#xa0;\n4.10 \nAll seafarers, not just women have been impacted by Government policy for example the removal of\n \nseafarer’s\n tax to name the most obvious.\n4.11 \nThe seagoing commitment of all RN personnel was\n also raised as an issue and there was no desire to see a return to when women were on a separate 'non sea going' tier.\n However\n, what\n is needed \nare\n more options.\n&#xa0;\n A\n \ncredible alternative to 'stay and go to sea' or 'have a child and leave'\n choice that currently exists\n.\n&#xa0;\n Thi\ns choice \nis the clearest and most obvious reason for the\n \nstark\n \npaucity of\n \nfemales in senior positions in the RN. Additionally,\n if STEM qualified RN personnel \nleave to find more family friendly employment there are\n \nfew, if\n any,\n \nopportunities to start a second career in the STEM employment sector that are\n \nwilling or open to either part time or sufficiently flexible working patterns.\n&#xa0;\n It is too easy for employers to find similarly\n \nqualified men without the working time restri\nction.\n4.12 \nFinally, there was comment that \nwomen are in a similar po\nsition to men in this instance. W\nith the current economic situation, many graduates choose careers based on whatever they can get rather than what they might prefer. More females appear t\no go into teaching roles \nalthough many \nhave been forced to leave the science sector due to a lack of jobs. The jobs available often require previous experience which is difficult to obtain when no one is willing to employ you in the first place. \nBecause of\n this, some women may end up in the r\netail or care industry which is\n more female dominated.\n&#xa0;\n5. What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?\n5.1 \nUniversities need to demonstrate that they do not discriminate against women who want both a career and a family.  The men in these professions tend to have both, so women should be afforded the same opportunity.  \nA zero tolerance policy of sexism \nshould be instigated and well publicised within academic centres.\n5.2 \nAnti-sexism training/guidance should be conducted/issued amongst the (predominantly male) professors in the position of supervising female students. \nAwareness of promotion/hiring bias sh\nould also be considered. \nFemale professors should be encouraged to act as role models for women entering academia, and actively support other women.\n5.3 \nInstitutions should give greater precedence to the work of women academics, championing contributions f\nrom the early phases of academia, and providing the opportunity for female academics to discuss and raise issues they face on an annual basis with the board of directors.\n Women should be directly encouraged to apply for more senior roles within institution\ns.  Institutions should ensure that women are directly targeted for internal vacancies.\n5.4 \nA team oriented approach should be encouraged in order to eliminate aggressive competition amongst research staff.\n5.5 \nGood mentoring through the PhD (in addition t\no academic supervision) would be a key way to improve retention of women, as whether an individual has a mentor dictates likelihood of success in science\n.\n \nThis helps su\npport young women in the field and helps to give incentive to their own research. One ma\njor incentive is for people to understand the job prospects in their chosen field, and having good mentoring is very important in this.\n5.6 \nProvision of cost-effective childcare for PhD students and scientists, as well as enforcing provision of flexible wo\nrking. Currently it seems to be that a student or early scientist’s working arrangements are dictated mostly by their direct supervisor. If a supervisor is not understanding with regards to the extra commitments that family brings, this may well discourage\n w\nomen from staying in the field.\n \n&#xa0;\n6. What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?\n6.1 \nSpecific events to attract women into the governmental research sectors can help, where women can talk and netwo\nrk with other women (and men) to gain insight into working in government STEM departments. \n6.2 \nProvision of facilities for cost-effective childcare and flexible working are key to enabling women to co-manage a career with family commitments. Government can play a role in helping to change attitudes towards those who have family commitments, as lack \nof understanding helps force out women from the sector. \n6.3 \nTo boost women numbers into the sector initially, financial incentives to have certain percentages of women at each level could be offered to STEM sectors that perform poorly currently\n6.4 \nMen\n ha\nve no idea about the type of prejudice and difficulties women in STEM\n (and other industries) face. O\nften men just don’t know about the issues women face having never experienced them\n and awareness raising is crucial.\n6.5 \nPromote more women into positions o\nf power and responsibility.  Seeing role models encourages women to actively advance their own careers\n. C\nompulsory targets of the percentage of women in senior management and on Boards (e.g. 40%)\n should be set and there needs to be recognition\n and reward \no\nf \nwomen in successful STEM careers, e.g. Honours List\n6.6 \nTrain science &amp; technology teachers (especially male teachers) in high schools to be consciously gender-equal in lessons, in the way opportunities are given for girls to give oral answers to whole-c\nlass questions and in opportunities for girls to lead in practical sessions\n6.7 \nLegislation is required to ensure that women taking time out of work for child-bearing have their careers protected – we should not see childbirth as detrimental to a woman’s c\nareer but be thankful \nthat well-educated women are willing to pursue motherhood in a society that tends to deride their choices.\n6.8 \nFree, universal childcare should be reinstated.\n6.9 \nIn recruitment, where many male applicants are received and few women \nper vacancy, there should be a legal obligation on the employer to offer appropriate support (such as additional training) that would bring a female candidate to the required level of competence, in order to avoid female candidates dropping out of the proc\ness where levels of experience resulting from career breaks for family reasons look reduced in comparison with male applicants. Similarly, women who reach the shortlist for a vacancy should be entitled to a trial period in the role, rather than ejected on \nthe grounds that experience is reduced in comparison to male applicants.\n6.10 \nRetention of women in STEM careers, both academic and industrial, will fall as a result of increased university fees at BSc level.  Women may not see a return on their investment in university education if they choose to pursue a career in academic STEM an\nd a family, or re-enter academic STEM after a period in industry or the public sector. A reduction in fees, or a bonus/tax break in future for women who return to STEM careers, should therefore be considered as a form of repatriation for women entering STE\nM and taking on this amount risk. \nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
