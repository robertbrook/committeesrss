"&#xa0;\nHealth \nCommittee\nOral evidence:\n \nPublic expenditure on health\n and social care\n, \nHC \n793\nWednes\nday \n20\n November 2013\nOrdered by the House of Commons to be published on \n20 November 2013\nWritten evidence from witnesses:\n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe King’s Fund\n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNuffield Trust\n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNHS Confederation\n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal Government Association\nWatch the meeting\nMembers present: Mr Stephen \nDorrell\n (Chair); Rosie Cooper; Andrew George; Barbara \nKeeley\n; Andrew Percy; Mr Virendra Sharma; Valerie \nVaz\n; Dr Sarah Wollaston\nQuestions \n159-238\nWitnesses: \nJohn Appleby, Chief Economist, the King’s Fund, and\n \nAnita Charlesworth, Chief Economist, Nuffield Trust, \ngave evidence.  \nQ159 &#xa0; \nChair: We are\n under a little bit of time pressure this afternoon, so we will go straight into it, if we may, but first \nI \nmake you \nwelcome\n. I quite often ask people to introduce themselves. I am not certain that is necessary in this case. You \nare\n familiar faces to us. \nI would like to go straight in, if I may, to the core question that we are seeking to address in this inquiry, which is, looking backwards\n—\nthis is the less important part of the question, in a sense\n—\nwhere has the health service got to in response to the Nicholson challenge as we get into the second half of 20\n13\n&#x2011;\n14?  H\now much real sustainable change do you think has taken place? That is the first question. \nThe second question\n is\n, more importantly, looking forward, either to the end of 2015 or, indeed, to the second half of the decade as well, what evidence do you think there is that necessary change is either being planned for or, better still, executed within the service? Who would like to go first?\nJohn Appleby: \nThank you for inviting the King\n’\ns Fund and me to give evidence. On the so\n&#x2011;\ncalled £20 billion challenge\n,\n we have to rely on NHS England in terms of evidence for that. The other evidence I could quote is a survey we do of finance directors in foundation \ntrusts and CCGs. It is not a statistically valid sample but it gives us some indication about things like this. You heard the evidence from \nSir \nDavid Nicholson himself that, looking back, it looks\n as if\n, at a big aggregate level, the NHS has been making its £4 billion to £4.5 billion savings each year\n,\n and \nit looks as if\n it is on track\n this year.\n I would supplement that with the evidence we get \nfrom\n talking to finance directors\n, and t\nhey would confirm that, I th\nink. \nI \nwould \npoint out that there is an issue around hospitals and what we are talking about here. If you talk to a trust and ask them about their productivity gains, they will not use those words\n: t\nhey will use \n“\ncost improvement programmes\n”. \nEssentially, they will look at what their projected income is and what their costs are\n,\n and whatever the gap is becomes their cost improvement programme. That is the way, down on the ground, they look at this challenge.\nHow do you fill that gap? You may make s\nome cost savings and \nyou may try and get some more income. One of the issues, it seems to me, with the whole QIPP Nicholson challenge is, \n“\nWhat is just extra income for people? What can roll forward and, in a sense, be counted not just as a one\n&#x2011;\noff saving?\n”\n That\n,\n I think\n,\n we are a bit less clear about.\nAnita Charlesworth: \nIt is important to emphasise how significant the pay policy has been in enabling the NHS to fill the gap and also there have been big reductions in administrative costs over the last two years, but administrative costs are \nnow \nexpected to start rising a bit again. In terms of the sustainability, they have done well over the last two years in aggregate, although there are over 40 hospital NHS trusts\n, mainly acute,\n that either were or would have been in deficit if t\nhey had not had central support. T\nhat is heading for a third of acute trusts\n, which\n are already struggling despite the help of a pay freeze and reductions in central management costs. \nThe pay freeze cannot go on \nfor ever\n. The management costs are a one\n&#x2011;\noff. Although \nit now looks like \nthe NHS over the last 15 years\n \ndid increase productivity, this requires a massive\n step increase in productivity. \nI think NHS England said it was about 12% of the gains so far \nthat \ncame from labour productivity and a quarter from the pay. So the sustainability looks really challenging as you start to get pay pressures emerging. But also the system at the moment, both this year and next, has almost nothing in it in terms of hospitals\n—\nthe tariff\n—\nfor service improvements\n. Y\net\n,\n if you look at Monitor\n’\ns analysis of 2013\n&#x2011;\n14 plans\n,\n they are \nstating\n that trusts are saying that to address Keogh, the Francis r\neview and the A and E pressures,\n they need significantly \nto \nincrease their clinical staffing. \nI\nt does feel \nas if\n we are hitting an imbalance. \nPeople have made t\nhe easy savings and \nthey \nare running out. By NHS England\n’\ns admission, we are not seeing very much progress with transformative s\navings,\n and quality pressures are really starting to bite\n.\nQ160 &#xa0; \nChair: \nBefore we get into that in detail\n,\n can I ask a reasonably limited question around instances that you have seen\n? T\nhe question is how prevalent are instances of, say\n, \nthings \nthat are plainly one\n&#x2011;\noff—\nand the \nmost obvious one is a land sale—so \nmaking the books balance by something that produces cash in year but does not change anything for future years?\nAnita Charlesworth: \nThe central\n evidence is that these sort of—\nin the jargon\n— \nnon\n&#x2011;\nrecurrent\n \nsavings look to be growing as a proportion of people\n’\ns savings. The big one that people seem to use is holdin\ng vacancies for a longer period, b\nut\n while\n you are increasingly concern\ned about your clinical staffing\n that becomes a very difficult thing to do and is certainly not a sustainable productivity gain.\nQ161 &#xa0; \nChair: \nIs it something that is clearly visible in the NHS England numbers or any numbers that either you or the King\n’\ns Fund \ngenerate\n?\nJohn Appleby: \nI am not sure they are clear in the overall numbers\n,\n and\n the reporting of these savings\n is an issue. There was a huge spreadsheet that NHS England us\ned to compile from PCTs on this and i\nt was almost totally impenetrable. I am used to looking at spreadsheets virtually every day and I \njust \ngot completely lost in that. \nT\nhere is a significant issue about \nthe reporting of these numbers—what lies behind the numbers, as you are pointing out.\n Is it recurrent? Is it non\n&#x2011;\nrecurrent\n? How sustainable are these things?\n Clearly, \nthere have b\neen big cuts in central budgets, b\nut you can only do that once. Whether you count that then as a saving for ever is almost philosophical. \nQ162 &#xa0; \nChair: \nIt does not \nsound\n like a saving for ever if Anita \nCharlesworth\n is saying that the cuts in admin costs are about to reverse.\nAnita Charlesworth: \nNot fully. They were just over £5 billion in 2010\n&#x2011;\n11\n,\n down to £3\n.5 billion, I think, last year and \ngoing back up to about £4.2 billion. \nW\ne will end this spending review spending less on admin than when we started, but it is clear that we cannot go on making those savings. Even if you eliminated admin costs completely, you would not deal with it all and \nyou \nwould still have a problem.\nJohn Appleby: T\no \nadd \nquickly to that, the real is\nsue is not about saving money—t\nhat is the \n“\nhalf\n&#x2011;\nway\n there,\n” as it were—but \nwhat you spend that money on. Presumably\n,\n we are saving admin costs not because we like to save admin costs but because we face the need to provide more hips and do more. \nI\nt is about spending that money on something else. \nMy point about the reporting, \nin a sense, \nis that \nwe do not quite know where the money has gone.\nQ163 &#xa0; \nChair: \nI will ask a further question and then pass it over\n. T\no look at it from\n the other end of the telescope, i\nf you look at the way services are currently delivered within the health and care system, where \ndo you think the commissioners and \nthe managers\n—\nthe management teams\n—\nshould be looking for opportunities to use resources more efficiently?\nAnita Charlesworth: \nThere are two pieces of work that shine a light on this. One is \nthat \nMonitor published last month a piece of work \nthat \nI think \nit \ncommissioned from McKinsey\n,\n looking at where the productivity potential \nis \nagainst the £\n30 billion—the call for action\n that NHS Engla\nnd issued or said is the longer-\nterm challenge. The first thing to say is that they could find potential productivity savings of between £10 billion and £18 billion. \nT\nhey were saying that you could not get there without one\n&#x2011;\noff savings, both \nin \npay and big land sales, as to both of which there are questions about feasibility. \nWithin the productivity estimates, their analysis was that most\n, or a bit more than half, \nof the potential\n \ncame from doing what we currently d\no more efficiently—if you like,\n the Olympic cycling team type\n of analysis that says it is about shaving off a second, \nor in their case fractions of a second\n, from \nevery little thing that you do rather than a big bang. There were opportunities, for example, from shifting care into the right settings and integration, but there is still a significant productivity prize in acute hospitals around things like average length of stay \nand\n also a big productivity potential in community \nhealth services and mental health as well. \nThe international evidence—and \nI was just looking at\n EU15—of similar countries\n is that we do not have a very big acute sector by international comparisons. \nO\nur bed numb\ners per head \nare relatively low. \nI think there are two countries below us, one of which is \nSweden\n,\n which spends much more on social care\n.\n \nA\ngain\n,\n the point is that you may save money in one bit but y\nou have to spend it elsewhere. We run our system quite hot; \nwe have high bed o\nccupancy rates and so on. T\nhere is also a need to be realistic. We can almost certainly get better. The McKinsey work points to the fact that we can get better, but it would be a very brave person who thought that you could get better to t\nhe scale that we are demanding—\n4% a year on a sustained basis. The lived experience of the NHS this year, when it is starting to get really difficult for quite a lot of people, is that we are probably getting close to the point where 4% is undoable.\nJohn Appleby: \nI agree wit\nh what Anita was saying there. As to t\nhese list\ns of what organisations can do—and we produce one as well—of doing more for less\n an\nd not more of the same, \nMcKinsey have\n, \nand the Audit Commission used to do tha\nt in terms of local authorities.\n If only the bottom 25% could perform at the level of the average, or whatever and\n—\n \nChair: \nWe have made our own modest contribution to that.\nJohn Appleby: \nYou can generate the numbers. \nL\nength of stay is an interesting \npoint\n. All health systems have been reducing the time people spend in hospital on average\n—\ndifferent sorts of medicine and techniques have enabled that\n—\nand you can then cost that up a\ns a saving in a way. \nWhat is a day in hospital? We know how much that costs and \ncan\n multiply \ni\nt by \nall \nthe thousands of patients who would be staying less. But\n,\n again\n, that is not really getting at what we\n are \ndoing with that saving.\n It is only a productivity gain if we then do something useful with that. \nA\nll of these lists of things to \ndo are depressing in two ways: first\n, they do not really cost it out in a productivity way; and, second\nly\n, my experience is that you can identify these things on paper\n,\n but, in reality, there are lots of barriers\n, local circumstances and so on\n that make it difficult to hit the target. As Anita was saying, in fact McKinsey cannot identify, even on paper, the full closing of the £30 billion gap that NHS England now talk\ns\n about to 2020. \nQ164 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: I\ns it a published report that McKinsey have\n produced?\nAnita Charlesworth: \n Yes.\nQ165 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nI was taken by your comment that no one seems to know where the money is, so I wondered if you could say whether it is falling within NHS England or the Department of Health\n.\n \nA\nre you really saying that no one knows where all the money is and how they can trace it?\nJohn Appleby: \nI am sure there are people who know where it all is. I \ndid not quite mean it like that.\n I meant the reporting\n of it. F\nor example, I think the planned saving last year was about £4 billion, so what do we mean by £4 billion? We know \nthat \na bit of\n it is counted as pay, in fact—a pay saving—because we have a pay freeze, s\no we sort of know where it is, as it were. What is less clear, i\nn a sense, is where it has gone:\n \nthat is,\n for instance, \nw\nhat did we use that saving for? There was not a lump of money that was then distributed across the NHS and so on. It is that sort of question \nthat\n does not seem to be asked so well\n,\n and the focus has been on the \n“Shoot first, ask questions later”-\ntype approach whe\nreby we simply do not give the health s\nervice the money. \nAs to\n cutting the tariff for hospitals, they have had a real price cut now of getting on for\n, I think, \n8%, or will do next year. \nI\nt is a real cut in the prices that hospitals get for supplying health\n \ncare to commissioners. In a sense, where has the money gone? I suppose it\n is with the commissioners, but\n \nthe question I would ask is: w\nhat have they done with it?\nQ166 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: Y\nou talked about administration costs going up again. Is that because there has been a cut in the number of staff \nand they\n now hav\ne \nto be rehired? Was it part of the reorganisation? \nAnita Charlesworth: \nThere may well be a bit of that. \nIt \nis quite difficult fully \nto \nbottom \nw\nhat is going on with staff at the moment because all the changes to the NHS are making getting a clear picture of what is going on quite difficult. Some staff have been transferred out of the remit of the work\n \nforce numbers more. But, yes, it does lo\nok like there is some rehiring—\nwhether \nit is \nrehiring of individuals or filling of other posts. \nAn\nother thing that is happening significantly is people substantially overspen\nding on agency and bank staff. T\nhere is a problem in the system at the moment \nin\n that there are two forms of inefficiency that are being driven by the system. One is the way at the moment \nthat \npeople are holding back lots of money. \nA\nt the beginning of the year\n,\n commissioners are telling acute providers that they are going to reduce demand and so they will not be spending the money with them. Providers have to plan on the basis of what their commissio\nners are telling them, and then \nactivity is turning out to be higher than planned \nand \nso they have to fill \nthat \nwith agency staff. That is an inefficient way of delivering services. When year on year that happens to you, you need to look at that and say, \n“\nThat is not good patient care and not a sensible way of running the system.\n”\n \nThe other thing is th\ne way that we do the pricing—t\nhe way we set prices\n. W\ne have deficits turning up in certain types of providers at the moment. We do not really know wh\nether those types of providers—\nsm\nall market town \nacutes\n—\nare fundamentally inefficient or whether the way we pay for care is inefficient. Everyone in the NHS says you lose money on normal maternity. Women have to have babies and it costs mon\ney to deliver those, so it can’\nt be sensible to price the system where everyone loses money on maternity. \nI\nf you are a big teaching hospital\n,\n you make money on certain types of, say, cancer care\n,\n and so you can cross\n&#x2011;\nsubsidise\n. I\nf you do not offer that other service\n,\n then you are just left picking up the pieces\n, but\n you have to deliver the care. \nW\nhen we had quite high growth rates you could cope; these sorts of things were not ideal but they did not really bite. We need to get much better at making sure that we understand cost and that we price according to that.\nQ167 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nI have a question about \nthe \nintegration of services. I do not know if it is possible to link back to\n what you have just been saying, but w\nhat progress has been made in integration and what needs to happen to encourage it at a faster pace? If there are issues whereby funding of social care is either a barrier or a help, if you like, it would be worth mentioning those two\n,\n because, clearly, there are issues there that are not helping\n,\n probably.\nJohn Appleby: \nCan I \njust \nclarify what you mean by integration?\n Integrating what with what?\nBarbara Keeley: \nHealth and social care.\nJohn Appleby: \nIt was a genuine question because it is one of those words that is used a lot now in health\n \ncare\n.\n \nA\nre we talking about primary or secondary care, for example?\nChair: \nDavid \nTredinnick\n is not here.\nJohn Appleby: \nOkay, health and social care. I think everybody has recognised for a long time that closer working between health and social care is a must\n,\n and it does happen to an extent\n.\nQ168 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: The \nquestion\n is to what extent.\nJohn Appleby: \nI cannot put a number on it, as it were. We know, for example, that hospitals and local authorities do talk to each other. They \nhave joint committees on things\n \nand \njoint professional working and various other things. That is what I meant by \n“to an extent”.\n The extent to which it is not integrated is a big joint budget\n,\n out of which comes health and social care. \nNorthern Ireland\n has gone down that route\n,\n but, looking closely at \nNorthern Ireland\n, I would say that just having a joint budget does not guarantee professional working\n.\n \nIf\n we really want to go for integrated health and social care servi\nces, which I think we should on quality grounds—\nwhether it is saving or more efficient\n,\n I th\nink we are not sure about that, to be honest—\nit has to be a combination of almost bottom\n&#x2011;\nup\n professiona\nl working with some top\n&#x2011;\ndown\n. I \ndo not think you can legislate for this simply by creating a bud\nget. NHS England, the Department\n and the Local Government Association will be grappling with this big pooled budget in 2015\n&#x2011;\n16\n—\nnearly £4 billion\n—\nand that i\ns meant to give a bit of a kick-\nstart to integration. \nW\ne have to wait and see what sort of plans the system comes up with then.\nQ169 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nI will \ncome\n back to that in a minute, but it is my view that it is not anything like £4 billion. It is not even the £3.8 billion. We had a question that stated it as £3.8 billion\n, but i\nt is only £1.9 billion of new money\n,\n because the rest of it already exists, does it not\n? \nI will \ncome back to that point.\nAnita Charlesworth: \nYes. Despite all the pressures, delayed discharges have not gone up, so that is a bit of good news from the joint working. Average length of stay, which is one of the things where\n,\n in NHS numbers\n,\n you see some of the impact of joint working, also is improving. At the moment the big disappointment is that, whatever is happening across the system, however good local initiatives are and \ndespite \nall the goodwill, as to avoiding emergency \nadmissions\n we are not seeing that impacting at scale. \nO\nne of the reasons why the system is beginning to see so much of the pressure is that people\n’\ns plans were very much that they would shift services from acute into out\n&#x2011;\nof\n&#x2011;\nhospital\n settings and that the out\n&#x2011;\nof\n&#x2011;\nhospital\n services would be \na \npartnership between the NHS and social care. We are not seeing that activity coming down\n;\n so the acute are really struggling with that. We are also seeing disinvestment in real terms in primary care. One of the things, I imagine, \nis that \nfor health and social care to work together effectively you need hospitals and social care\n, but, \nto send someone home or to avoid the admission\n,\n you need the NHS out\n&#x2011;\nof\n&#x2011;\nhospital\n services to work well together and to work well with social care. As people start to plan, that will be really important as well.\nQ170 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nYou talk abou\nt disinvestment in primary care. Is there any evidence\n that specific things\n were abolished or slimmed down and that that\n has had an impact? I only \nmainly \nknow my own local area, but it did not seem sensible to me that the PCT, when we had one, closed down two walk\n&#x2011;\nin centres and a pilot of active case management\n,\n when active case management seemed to me to be the best way to try to keep people with long\n&#x2011;\nterm conditions out of hospital. It seemed to be an insane way to go about efficiency savings, but that is what happened. Is there evidence that that happened more widely?\nAnita Charlesworth: \nMonitor has just done its study on walk\n&#x2011;\nin cen\ntres and we have\n seen quite a lot of those come to an end. \nIts \nanalysis, if I remember correctly, was that the client group for that tended to be an under\n&#x2011;\nserved\n client g\nroup—a lot of low\n&#x2011;\nincome women and so on\n, who probably are not high users of other services so much at the moment, but less the sort of people \nwho \nyou would expect to be impacted\n, such as\n \nthe \nfrail elderly. You hear people talking about initiatives such as the locally enhanced services and directly enhanced services going\n,\n and some of that money was what people were using to support, in primary care, some of the innovation. \nA\ngain\n,\n it is an area where\n there is so little good data and i\nt is quite difficult, beyond organised anecdote, \nif I can call it that, to turn i\nt into hard numbers.\nQ171 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nThe \nnext question is about the integration transformation\n fund, to come back to the point with John Appleby, and not £4 billion but probably only\n the \n£1.9 billion of new funding\n.\n \nT\nhe rest of it, I have from the note\n, is \nthe existing transfer between NHS and social care and things like \nthe disabled f\nacil\nities grant, \nreablement\n and carers’ breaks,\n which already exist\n. S\no, yes, it is a pooled budget of that size\n,\n but it is not new money. \nT\nhe question is about that amount of money\n, i\ns that going to help\n,\n and\n—\nit is almost a leading question\n—is it enough? \nWhat impact is it going to make?\nJohn Appleby: \nIn some sense, none of it is new money. The NHS has been tr\nansferring, as you say, up to \n£1 billion or so to local government anyway. That has just gone. There have been various other budgets \nthat\n the NHS \nor the Department has\n managed\n,\n and then they have been reclassified and they are now over w\nith the local authorities and so on.\n \nO\nnce you add all these\n up—\nand there is \nagain \nan extra £2 billion or so in 2015 of money \nthat has been allocated to the NHS\n which will go into this pooled budget\n—\nit is \n£\n3.8 billion\n, b\nut you are right to say, in a sense, that none of it is new money. \nIs it enough? It depends what you want to do with it. We do not know yet what the plans are. CCGs, health and wellbeing boards and \nso on\n have to come up with some plans by next April. I think it is going to vary tremendously around the country. \nT\nhere will be some areas \nthat\n will d\no great things with this money and o\nthers \nthat \nwill not.\nQ172 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nI am \ninterested\n to hear you say that. Is that not rather depressing because is that not where we are just now with integration?\nJohn Appleby: \nYes, of course.\nQ173 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nShould there not be more of a blueprint?\nJohn Appleby: \nI have to say that there is a big fear on the part of the NHS that they have just waved goodbye to some of this money. There is a worry. I say it depends, crucially, on what is done with the money, but there will be an opportunity cost. It is money that, as I\n say, was allocated to the NHS, which \nis now going to be spent, in a sense by central direction, on something else and we are not quite sure what that something else is. Presumably\n,\n it is not what it is being spe\nnt on now. My question would be,\n what is the opportunity cost of this fund? \nAnita Charlesworth: \nMy anxiety is that planning is happening too late for this and it is happening too late to co\n&#x2011;\nordinate with the acute sector\n. This means that a\ncute hospitals will need to deliver an efficiency saving in 2015\n&#x2011;\n16 o\nf something in the region of 6%.\n \nI\nf I look at \nlast year’s cost improvement plans of \nfoundation trusts\n, I think it was\n 3.4%\n,\n and they are declining. Let us assume that this fund is a fantastic success and in \nyear\n pretty much \neverywhere they implement plans \nthat\n are completely effective\n,\n they save significant numbers of hospital admissions and lead to a big reduction in average length of stay. What you have to do to make the money add up in year is then take all th\nat cost out of the acute sector. Hospital costs are lumpy. T\nhey are people on fixed employment contracts\n—\nprofessional people in the main\n—\nand buildings. Taking money out is quite difficult. \nIf this is going to work, \nfirst,\n we need to be sure, especially in areas where the acute sector is very fragile, that the plans are robust, and if you are going to hit the ground running at that speed you need to have planned very early; and then\n, secondly,\n there nee\nd \nto be well co\n&#x2011;\nordinated plans with the acute sector\n,\n because, essentially, you need to know now broadly how far you are coming down and be planning in a very tightly co\n&#x2011;\nordinated way to bring that capacity down. I do not see that. So I think we are at real risk of a very big crisis in the acute sector in that year.\nJohn Appleby: \nJust to localise this in a way, the £2 billion is about £10 million per CCG, roughly. If you want to divide up the £4 billion, you nearly double it, so it is a lot of money locally. \nT\nhat is very significant, ju\nst to reinforce what Anita said\n about what it means on the ground to local hospitals as well. \nQ174 &#xa0; \nMr Sharma: \nWe heard \nthe\n terms recently on the reconfigurations. In order to provide funds for integrated services, \nservice \nreconfigurations will be required. We all accept that. Reconfigurations \nthat\n lead to the closure of hospitals or remove services from hospitals\n—such as\n Ealing hospital in my constituency\n—\nare notoriously controversial with local communities and can take years to complete. \nThe question is in two phases. \nFirst\n, how can reconfigurations \nthat\n local health economies consider are necessary to preserve and improve the quality and breadth of services in a given area be implemented in a timely way? Second\nly\n, will the recommendations of the Keogh review on urgent care, published last week, help to speed up the reconfiguration process more widely? They are lengthy question\ns\n and I can come back and repeat them.\nJohn Appleby: \nYou are right\n,\n and this links back to where we \nare \nwith productivity\n. T\nhe NHS does not serve biscuits at meetings any more\n,\n has low\n&#x2011;\nenergy\n light\n bulbs\n and has done all these things. It has done that stuff and has been doing it for years\n,\n and you run out of doing that\n. Y\nou then start to look around at how services are provided. There is an area\n—\nI will not name it, but you could almost pick any area of the country\n, where—\nMr Sharma: \nPick Ealing.\nJohn Appleby: I won’t pick Ealing, but \nthere are hospitals \nthat deliver\n \nfewer \nthan 100 births a year. That simply should not be \ngoing on,\n \nfrom the evidence, on\n safety grounds\n, so s\nomething has to happen there\n. B\nut these are whole hospitals and the co\n&#x2011;\nordination of managing th\ne\n change\n,\n from that hospital either closing down or doing something different and so on\n,\n has always been \ndifficult, a\nnd I am not sure that the NHS has always explained itself and the evidence properly to the public, for example. \nI\nt is difficult, I think, and has become more difficult. \nOne of the reasons for that is that in many areas we do not have a co\n&#x2011;\nordinating body to oversee some of this stuff. We got rid of strategic health authorities. There may have been some very good reasons to get rid of SHAs, but one of the things they help\ned\n \nwith\n was \nto \nco\n&#x2011;\nordinate across an area. \nW\ne \nnow \nhave \na more \nfragmented system, in a sense. It is, in a way, \ntypified by the letter that went round the system about the integration transformation fund \nthat was \nsigned by four different bodies. In a way it was good th\nat it was signed by \nfour, but it also illustrates what has happened to the system. \nD\noing these things quickly, it seems to me, is still difficult and perhaps more difficult.\nAnita Charlesworth: \nTher\ne are a couple of things I would say\n. We need to be very clear \nas well \nthat reconfiguration is not the same as merger. There is very little evidence \nthat, if we have organisations that \nare in trouble\n,\n grouping them together does anything other than make the problem bigger and more difficult to fix. There is quite a tradition of that being a solution\n, s\no we need to be very c\nlear that it is reconfiguration and underlying service change—\nnot just restructuring the provider side\n,\n having restruc\ntured the commissioning side. \nS\necond\nly,\n we do face some quite difficult tensions as well, don\n’\nt we? I should declare that I am a non\n&#x2011;\nexecutive\n director on the board of the Whittington in north \nLondon\n and \nfind that, \nwhen you go out and talk to the public\n,\n the trade\n&#x2011;\noff between access and quality is quite difficult\n.\n \nE\nspecially as more of our population has chronic disease, access really does matter to people, for com\npletely understandable reasons. So it is about sorting out system-\nwide\n, which\n I think plays to John\n’\ns point\n. O\nne of the things that is so good about the Keogh review is \nthat \nit looks at this issue systemically\n,\n rather than dealing with it when it is at crisis point \nin\n an individual hospital\n,\n because there are some quite difficult challenges. \nThe third thing is, of course, that we now have the Bournemouth and \nPoole\n decision from the Competition Commission, so\n,\n even if we all willed it\n,\n we may not legally be able to do it.\nChair: \nThat leads you neatly into your \nnext \nquestion.\nQ175 &#xa0; \nMr Sharma: \nI wa\ns \ntempted\n to put something else\n but will resist that. Sir David Nicholson has told the Committee\n that \naspects of the competition framework applied to the NHS were hindering developments intended to improve patient care, and that changes in the law might be needed to make the regime work as intended.  Do you agree with that \nassessment\n?\nAnita Charlesworth: \nI have not read all the detail of the Bournemouth and \nPoole\n decision\n,\n so I could not say whether I think the Competition Commission made the right or the wrong decision. It is quite difficult to comment on that case\n,\n and that is the big one to date where competition policy has had a big impact. It is interesting that Monitor is calling in quite a lot of commissioner behaviour\n,\n and, again, it would be \nquite \nimportant to have a good look at what is coming out of that. \nThere are some benefits to the improved rigour. On the point I just made about an awful lot of mergers not delivering, one of the things the Competition Commission in this process has said is, “You need to demonstrate benefit. You need to be very clear about where that benefit is coming from and you need to demonstrate that.” Given that all these reconfigurations cost in money terms and in opportunity costs—the management focus they bring—part of this process is a helpful discipline, but it will mean that the NHS will need to think about what on earth is the alternative if it is not able to do this. I am not a lawyer, but the Competition Commission in its judgment took the case under the Enterprise Act, not the Health and Social Care Act, and it took the case before the Health and Social Care Act was implemented. So there is an interesting issue about whether or not we could change it, because that is an enactment of EU competition law, and whether the genie is out of the bottle now, I don’t know, but certainly on that we cannot go back.\n \nQ176 &#xa0; \nChair: \nOne of the \nthings\n elected politicians have the power to do, if they choose to use it, is to change the law\n. I guess \nthe question for us is whether the application of the law, wherever it originates\n from \nin \nthis case, delivers good policy.\nAnita Charlesworth: \nIndeed. \nJohn Appleby: \nThe crucial thing, I think, \nis that \nit is the Enterprise Act, not the Health and Social Care Act. It points the finger more at foundation trus\nts and their basis as being considered as\n enterprises\n, so \nthat is whe\nre you have to look for this. \nThe other thing I would say is it is what the Competition Commission\n—\n  \nQ177 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: So\n \na\nre the two Acts in conflict?\nJohn Appleby: \nIn conflict, no, I do not think so. What I meant was that that is\n—\nQ178 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nSo in future they could have taken it under either.\nAnita Charlesworth:\n Yes, I think so.\nJohn Appleby: \nFTs are considered as enterprises and \nthey \ncome under the Enterprise Act, according to EU procurement law\n \nand competition law\n, so that is the issue\n. That is where the real issue lies. I do not think we should necessarily accept that \nthe OFT, CC and, or soon to become, the—\nwhat is it called\n?—\nCMA\n—\n \nAnita Charlesworth: \nThe merger of the two.\nJohn Appleby: \nYes\n; \nI do not know wh\no is looking into that merger! \nThey have to learn their job as well, by the way, so it is not something that is committed in stone from right at the beginning. If you talk to the Competition Commission and OFT, they have to get to grips with an industry\n,\n and they are learning, I think, with the health\n \ncare industry. \nD\necisions will change over time as they learn how, in a sense, to do their job\n, b\nut essentially their task is, for example, \n“\nDo the benefits of a merger\n,\n which reduces competition\n,\n outweigh the loss of competition?\n”\n They do not have to prove that competition is a benefit, by the way; that is simply a given. I would agree with Anita that it is pushing the NHS to think more deeply and harder about the cases it has to make to the public, \nthe Competition Commission\n and so on, for why we should have mergers, a reconfiguration or a significant change in the way a service is provided. Frankly, it has not \nalways \nbeen that good in the past at doing that. From that point of view, there is a benefit.\nQ179 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: We \nsay\n it has all been useful\n and the case builds, but I have two questions \non this reconfiguration issue\n. One, what is your assessment of the politics of all this and the political debate? We hear politicians on all sides saying, \n“\nTo respond to the incredible challenge there is in the NHS we are going to have to have reconfigurations,\n”\n but the moment the reconfiguration drops on the ground, particularly if it is in a marginal constituency, it becomes incredibly political and\n it will not happen, or it may\n happen but it becomes impossible for politicians to support it. \nW\nhat \nis \nyour assessment \nas to\n the damage that this kind of politicisation of ev\nery change in the NHS is having?\n \nSecond\nly\n, we all understand, as Virendra said, about the need for reconfigurations\n,\n but it makes me nervous\n because the \nconstituency \nI represent \nis 257 square miles\n,\n spread across two different counties\n,\n and if they reconfigure services in my trust that means that people where I live have to \ntravel 60 miles to \nGrimsby\n to access some of those services. That is not a local hospital and \nit then \nhas a huge impact on access. \nW\nhen we talk about reconfiguration, the examples \nthat\n are ofte\nn presented are urban examples—o\nkay, you may have to go from one bit of London to another or from the north of Leic\nester to the south of Leicester—and \nI am \nreally \nconcerned about where all this is going to end up for those of us in rural communities. I can see a situation where clinicians turn up, tell the local community that this is thoroughly the right and best thing for them do\n,\n and their services disappear 60 miles away, which then make them completely and utterly inaccessible.\n W\nhen we talk about this, I have not heard anybody saying, \n“\nWhat is the answer for people living in those rural and very isolated communities?\n”\nJohn Appleby: \nThe first thing to say is that we should not assume that reconfig\nuration is about centralisation; it sometimes is, \nbut it sometimes is not. In fact, \nI thought \nLord \nAra\n \nDarzi\n’\ns\n review \nHealthcare for London\n \ntoo\nk a very interesting line. The\n strap\n&#x2011;\nline\n was something like\n,\n \n“Localise \nwhere \npossible, \ncentralise where \nnecessary.”\n \nT\nhe view it was taking was a sort of \nsubsidiar\nit\ny\n view, if I can draw that analogy.\nAndrew Percy: \nThat has hardly been successful.\nChair: \nYou are not winning the argument with Mr Percy.\nJohn Appleby: Maybe scratch that analogy. \nSome services are much better provided face to face in people\n’s homes; o\nther services are better provided at a GP\n’s surgery\n and so on. That is the approach that all medical health\n \ncare systems have gone through and it is about trying to get that balance right. My first po\nint would be,\n \non reconfiguration, \ndo not necessarily assume it is about centralisation. There is a trade\n&#x2011;\nof\nf in bigger rural areas—\nof course. In a sense, for good reason, we do not have MRI scanners on the \nIsle of Skye\n, I don’t think, \nbecause we recognise that the expense of doing that is just too great, but in another sense it is also unfair because people who live there have to travel a long way. My father lives in Devon and has to travel a long way to get \nto hospital; \nI live in \nLondon\n where there is one on every corner virtually. \nT\nhere are these trade\n&#x2011;\noffs\n,\n and I do not think the NHS could completely resolve thos\ne. It has to do the best it can\n given \nthe \npattern of services.\nAnita Charlesworth: \nThe \nAra\n \nDarzi\n London experience i\ns quite important because “L\nocalise where possible,\n centralise where necessary” is a really important message,\n but\n,\n once you say that\n,\n what people see is the \n“\ncentralise\n”; what they don’t see is the\n \n“\nlocalise\n”\n. When I look at the numbers, in terms of where the spending has gone, certainly if primary care is part of the \n“\nlocalise\n”\n, the money is not getting there\n.\n \nU\nnderstandably, if you are a member of the public\n, you would ask,\n \n“W\nhat does this localised better service look like? How do I judge it? How do I even see and feel \nthat \nit is still there and you have \nnot cut it from underneath me?” \nWe have put comparatively little eff\nort, I would argue, as a system,\n into describing, modelling and then showing people what the \n“\nlocalise\n”\n is\n,\n and then working out a way \nthat\n communities can judge whether it is being delivered and hold\ning\n people to account for it. In that environment, it is logical for local communities to feel great nervousness about what they are losing\n,\n when what they are supposedly gaining is so amorph\no\nus. \nT\no my mind\n,\n the thing that would make the biggest difference would be to work out what the \n“\nlocal\n”\n means and to provide good transparency and accountability so that people could have some confidence in that before they let go of what they feel is a loss.\nQ180 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: \nThat is important. At my local hospital we lost all acute admissions because of safety concerns\n,\n and, in terms of that, we have had various diagnostics bought\n—MRI scanners, \neye c\nlinics and all the rest of that—but people do not see that, \nand the NHS is dreadful at making the case around it. I still come back to the point that that is fine, but when your stroke service\n goes—\nthey might say\n,\n \n“\nOnce you are out of the acute phase, we will take \nyou back to your local hospital”—and you need \nthrombolysing\n \nand all the rest of it\n,\n and that \nhappens \n40 or 50 miles away\n but \nit used to happen at your local hospital, it is a massive loss of service.  \nChair: \nIt did not\n happen\n.\nAndrew Percy: \nIt did in my case, but it has gone\n—or, rather, i\nt has come to mine\n,\n but has gone from somebody else\n’\ns.\nJohn Appleby: \nThere is not an easy answer to this, and I was trying to make the point that \never \nsince the NHS came into existence it has been struggling with a historic\nal\n pattern of services\n,\n and it is, on cost terms, unreasonable to provide the sort of access that somebody would get in the capital of the country. \nT\nhat is just how it is.\nQ181 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: Y\nou have \nboth\n neatly avoided my invitation to condemn politicians for their role in this reconfiguration.\nJohn Appleby: \nWe are economists.  \nQ182 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: \nThis is my concern about \nover\n \nthe next 18 months. Some of this stuff probably needs to happen\n,\n but we are going to see one hell of a political fight over the ne\nxt few months on the ground when\never there is any proposal to reconfigure a service, so I do not know how it is possibly going to be delivered.\nAnita Charlesworth: \nI come back to my point that these are the services that rea\nlly matter to local communities.\n I do not buy the argument that you could take the politics out of this. They \nreally \nmatter to people. \nT\nhere has to be more of a sort of deal or an informal contract. The NHS has to give politicians a better case to defend\n—\na better\n&#x2011;\nmade\n case and a better overall case\n—\nand then, in exchange for that, people have to be prepared to support \ni\nt where possible. \nT\nhere are examples where that is happening\n,\n but it has to be a really good\n,\n strong case, has it not, which has to focus as much on the \n“\nlocalise\n”\n as the \n“\ncentralise\n”\n to be a credible offer for most people\n?\nJohn Appleby: \nIt is difficult to comment on the politics, but you have to recognise that \nthere are going to be losers, or that people will feel some loss\n in some of these dec\nisions, \nand there will be gains. That is a very hard thing to present to people, especially the losers. In a sens\ne, how do you compensate them? \nMaybe you cannot, but you can point out that maybe their safety will improve because the sy\nstem has been centralised a bit. B\nut I recognise the dilemma\n and i\nt is difficult.\nQ183 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: \nBut \nexplaining\n to Mrs Smith how she would be better treated 60 miles away \nrather \nthan \na\nround the corner is an argument we cannot win often.\nJohn Appleby: \nAnother solution is to put more money into the system and then you simply say, \n“\nWe will pay for that access.\n”\n \nQ184 &#xa0; \nChair: \nBut before we go too far \ndown\n that road, just putting more money into a system does not make it possible to have efficient stroke units with proper staffing on every street corner, does it?\nJohn Appleby: \nNo. You would have to put a hell of a lot of money in to do that. I do recognise that, but that is a potential\n—\n  \nChair: You would have a lot of\n stroke specialists on the bea\nch for quite a lot of the time.\nQ185 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: Have\n you made any assessment of the total cost of all the legal challenges and how much that has increased \nsince\n the Health and Social Care Act, although I am interested that you say it\n is actually the Enterprise Act?\n Has there been a remorseless rise in the cost of litigation around these challenges?\nJohn Appleby: \nIn Bournemouth and \nPoole\n,\n they quote themselves \nhow much they have spent, and it is\n something like £5 million to £6 million.\nAnita Charlesworth: \nOn advisers.\nQ186 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: That is \nBournemouth\n and \nPoole\n between them.\nJohn Appleby: \nJust Bournemouth and \nPoole\n have spent\n £5 million to £6 million in terms of preparing thei\nr case, advisers, legal advice and \neconomic competition advice.\nValerie Vaz: \nThat is a lot of doctors. \nQ187 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: \nHas \nanyone\n made an assessment nationally as to how much is being spent on legal advice for these reconfigurations?\nAnita Charlesworth: \nNo.\nJohn Appleby: \nI am not aware\n of that\n.\nAnita Charlesworth: \nThat data is not routinely collected so, at the moment\n,\n you would have to ask everybody, I guess with \na freedom of i\nnformation\n request\n, to tell you. \nY\nou cannot see that in people\n’\ns accounts.\nQ188 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: Y\nou would \nhave\n to send an FOI to every single foundation trust that was thinking\n—\n \nAnita Charlesworth: T\nhat is the only way I could get it. There\n may be other avenues but, for me to get it, \nthat is what I would have to do, yes.\nJohn Appleby: \nPerhaps I could also say that it is not simply\n \nmoney out the door to consultants. It is also the opportunity costs of managers\n’ time \nand commissioners\n’\n time spent in meetings and so on\n,\n which does not, in a sense, appear in the accounts as\n,\n \n“This is what it cost us.”\n \nI\nt is \nsometimes quite \ndifficult \neven \nfor organisations \nthemselves\n to know quite how much they have spent on this sort of thing.\nQ189 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: \nOn a slightly \nlinked\n issue, we have had evidence from Monitor saying that too many CCGs are putting things out to tender when in fact they could be making a judgment around integration trumping competition in patients\n’\n best interests and avoiding that route. Have \nyou made any assessment of the costs of these unnecessary tendering operations\n? I\ns \nit your view\n that it is a waste of money\n,\n and is there any financial evidence that we can use to persuade CCGs not to do this quite so often?\nAnita Charlesworth: \nThe cost of the tendering process should be part of the decision making. It is not the only one. The issue that Monitor\n’\ns point\ns highlight\n is that the\nse are really complex decisions, such as, “\nIs this a service? How do we configure this service?\n”\n \nF\nirst of all\n,\n you have \nto have \na really good understanding of your needs, how your service is doing at the moment, what the different options are for that service, \nwhat the marketplace looks like and\n the capacity of your current providers versus alternative providers\n. T\nhen you need to run a procurement\n process\n. \nT\nhat first bit is the sort of thing that I think good commissioners\n would do. I\nt is commissioning, is it not? In essence, it is the point of commissioning. If you do that well\n,\n you decide whether \nto\n run a tendering process or not and whether the potential benefits from the tendering process outweigh the costs of going through that process. \nThe problem is the immaturity of the commissioning environment so, in essence, \nit is \nthe clash between a se\nnse that they have legally \nto do all \nthis tendering to be compliant, \nyet, in very many cases, all \nt\nhat prior good deep commissioning work around these services is probably not there. If you tender a service where you have not done the prior work\n,\n you are almost certainly not going to have an effective tendering process. \nT\nhere is a real issue about whether there should be something of a moratorium while they say, across the system\n, that \npeople\n ought to be spending this year and maybe next year\n \nestablishin\ng the core building blocks of being a good commissioner\n.\n \nA\nt the end of that they \nwould\n probably \nbe \nin a position to tender. There will be some exceptions to that where there are particular local imperatives, but that is the real issue. \nAt the moment w\ne have a system that\n,\n if it were going to work\n,\n requires immense sophistication of commissioning at a point where the commissioning system is just trying to work out whether it \nhas the data in the right place and \nknows what bills it is and \nit \nis not responsible for. It is focused on sorting out the transactional stuff. The strategic stuff feels a long way away.\n \nJohn Appleby: \nI have one\n—\n \nChair: \n \nYes, q\nuickly\n,\n \nbecause\n I have one eye on the clock.\nJohn Appleby: \nVery quickly, looking at Monitor and what \nit \ncan do\n,\n I agree that people are learning their roles here and I feel that Monitor could be provi\nding more advice, for example. \nCCGs are quite fragile organisations in many respects in terms of their capabilities, skills and so on. It is easy to see how they may react to things\n by saying\n, \n“\nWe must do this,\n”\n when in fact they do not quite know. \nM\ny recommendation would be that Monitor could perhaps take on more of an advisory role here\n,\n and\n in fact it has done. The Co\noperation and Competition Panel, which it has absorbed, used to try and advertise, \n“\nCome to us first. If you think of a merger, come to us first and we can talk about it and give you some advice.\n”\n \nQ190 &#xa0; \nChair: We are going to be \nseeing\n Dr Bennett next week, so we might \ntake that advice up with him. \nCan I move us on\n,\n because one of the things Anita \nCharlesworth\n just said was that maybe we should t\nake two years to get the system \nmoving\n?\n One of the problems that increasingly seems \nto be\n coming to the fore is the danger of developing \nburning platforms,\n particular\nly\n on the provider side, and\n increasing numbers of trusts—\nfoundation \nand non\n&#x2011;\nfoundation\n trusts—\nreporting \ndeficits. The Committee would be interested to know your perception of where that process has got to and what the one to two\n&#x2011;\nyear term looks like \nregarding \nthe emerging deficits in trusts.\nAnita Charlesworth: My view on this is that w\ne have a fair degree of stability, if you look at the underlying numbers\n—\nthe NAO strips out all this support that was floating around the system\n—with\n slightly \nover \n40 trusts that were in deficit by the end of 2012\n&#x2011;\n13, \nwhich is \nfairly similar to the 2011\n&#x2011;\n12 position. Despite all the focus on some of those\n,\n we are finding it \nvery \ndifficult to resolve those issues\n,\n and progress is much slower on resolution than \nwe had\n thought. \nT\nhe big risk now is \nthat \nit looks like we are going from a minority position, albeit quite a big number, to something that looks much more systemic. Monitor looked at the impact assessment of \nthe \npayment system. If pay and prices turn out as \nit \nexpect\ns\n next year and\n the NHS delivers 3% efficiency\n rather than 4%, with no extra cost pressures from things like Franc\nis and Keogh, 45% of acute trusts\n would be in deficit\n.\n \nThat is the\n estimate. So we have a system now that feels \nas if\n, for an awful lot of providers, they are \nat \na tipping point. \nT\nhere was a strategy development that said \nthat \ndeficit would be a rare thing and what we would do is send in \na\n team, work out \na\n local solution, put a huge amount of effort in and bring \nyou\n out as a sustainable organisation. It looks like it is going to be a very common thing\n—we do not really know—and \nthere is not a plan, I think, for it being a very common thing.\nJohn Appleby: \nFor quarter 1 this year\n,\n I think Monitor report\ns\n \nthat 48—\nmainly acute\n—\ntrusts are in deficit compared \nwith\n 36 in quarter 1 last year, so the numbers are creeping up. The \nTrust Development A\nuthority\n \nreport\ns\n 31 trusts planning a deficit by the end of this year, and that is up by \nfive \nsince the beginning of the year. \nT\nhese are still a minority\n,\n but they are a significant group. I would emphasise \nthat \nthis large group of foundation trusts is what\n Monitor will call the S\n&#x2011;\ncurve\n. What is the surplus? What is the deficit?\n \nY\nou have a small group making quite big surpluses and a smallish group making deficits or losses. You have a big group \nthat is \nhovering by fractions of a per cent\n—\nin many cases\n,\n just above 0%. It \nwould\n \nnot take much pressure on them—\nfor example a reduction in the prices that they get for thei\nr goods and services and so on—and you could \nexpect\n that,\n \nfor \nquite a lot to tip over into deficit. \nT\nhe short term at the moment does look quite grim. \nMonitor would say that it is not a crisis\n,\n but \nit would leave \nthat \n“\nyet\n”\n sort of hanging in the air. It is very difficult. Again, talk to trusts and they will say they are feeling very big pressures\n,\n and come 2015\n&#x2011;\n16, \nwhich is not that far away now—a year and a bit—it could be, picking \nvarious\n metaphors, a \nturning point, watershed\n or\n cliff edge\n,\n \nbecause the money is not \ncompl\netely coming out of the system, but \nthe pressure on the hospital sector, in particular\n, \ncould be such as to tip a lot of trusts over into deficit. \nQ191 &#xa0; \nChair: \nRelated\n to the ITF.\nJohn Appleby: \nYes.\nQ192 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nCould\n I, because of time\n,\n wrap up a number of questions in one? To what extent is that pattern of increased numbers of deficits \nin \nfoundation and other trusts the result\n of the alleged cherry-\npicking that has been going on of many procedures by private hospitals or private providers, particularly for elective procedures? To what extent \nare \nthose substantial private alternative providers of elective surgeries\n and \nelective procedures themselves facing deficits, or are there none? \nT\nhe chief financial officer of the trust and its main competitor\n,\n which \nsits on its doorstep, got together in my own area and looked\n through the very complex\n tariff system. \nI do not know whether either of the two of you have looked at \nit,\n \nbut \nyou certainly need a long time in a darkened room with a wet towel\n,\n and \nyou \nprobably need your head tested at the end of it a\ns it is the most complex system.\n I am not sure that many follow the tariff system and claim for every ele\nment that is available to them. T\no what extent do you think that\n it is\n \nnot \nthe tariff system \nthat\n is causing the difficulty for a lot of acute trusts\n, but \nthe winter pressures\n?\n \nAlso,\n is the Government\n’\ns £250 million additional fund going to be sufficient to help those trusts that are u\nnder this financial pressure? I am s\norry to have lumped that al\nl \ntogether, but I am aware of time.\nJohn Appleby: \nI can give one\n&#x2011;\nword\n answers if you like. \nT\nhe first one \nis\n no. \nAs to\n the second one, I cannot quite remember \nwhat \nthe question\n was\n. The tariff was the third question, I think.\nQ193 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nOkay. It \nwas\n about the private providers, so your answer to that is that\n you are not aware of it.\nJohn Appleby: \nI do not think \nso; I do not think \nthat is a major issue in this.\n Is the tariff too complicated? \nYes, it is quite complicated. The real issue with the tariff and some of the othe\nr \nwagglings\n of the price lever—\nfor example, hospitals being paid \nonly \n30% of the tariff for emergency ad\nmissions above a certain level—is \nthat \nit \nhas hit nearly all hospitals\n,\n because we have seen a rise in emergency admi\nssions. That has contributed. \nAs to the £250 million, \nit is now \n£150 million on top of that apparently going in, so \nit is \n£400 million. It is probably too little too late. There is a colleague of mine\n—\n \nQ194 &#xa0; \nChair: \nI am sorry, \nbut \nthe\n additional £150 million had escaped me.\nJohn Appleby: \nI saw it announced in the \nHealth Service Journal\n today that on top of the £250 million there is another £150 million. I have no idea where that money is coming from, by the way, but I think it is as a result o\nf complaints by a lot of trusts, which\n said, \n“\nWhy are you rewarding failure?\n”\n That is one way of looking at it, I guess. Anyway, that money, it seems to me, is too little too late. As a colleague of mine, Nigel Edwards, would say, \n“\nYou have to start planning for winter in February.\n”\n You have to have a really long view on these things. I should point out that this is what the N\nHS has done for a lot of years: it has found\n a few hundred million at this time of \nthe \nyear in winter to keep things going. \nI\nt is not an uncommon thing, but it does seem to go against the general thrust of what the Health and Social Care \nAct \nis about\n—\nthe general movement\n, independence and \nso on\n—to say, “\nHere is a bit of extra cash to keep you going.\n”\n But I think it is too little too late.\nQ195 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nDo you \nthink\n that the current review of the tariff\n&#x2011;\nbased\n system can ever get the satisfactory equilibrium to drive \ncherry-picking out of the system—or, rather, \nthe \nallegation that there is cherry-\npi\ncking going on\n out of the system?\nAnita Charlesworth: Within the cherry-\npicking there are two things. One is that \nnon\n&#x2011;\nNHS providers—\nthe voluntar\ny sector and private providers—\nhave become a much bigger part of the delivery of care over the \np\nast five years. \nW\ne have doubled the amount of the NHS budget spent with them. If they are delivering that efficiently and delivering high quality, in one sense, does tha\nt matter? In terms of cherry-\npicking, if it is priced \nrightly\n so that they are efficient and high quality, does it matter? I guess it might still matt\ner if you have what is called \nstranded capacity—if you have capacity in the NHS\n \nthat\n you are paying for\n,\n but are struggling to afford that higher level of activity. It is becoming quite a significant amount of money. \nAs to the tariff system—\nthe Committee, I think you said, \nhas \nseen last year\n’\ns rep\nort and it is really important—it \ndoes not deliver efficiency. It does not change any of the financials of the NHS. \nIt\n says whose job it is to drive out that efficiency. Where the tariff matters, I think, is that we set it correctly so that we price things properly \nto\n reflect the cost\n,\n but not too much. My concern at the moment is this. People spend a lot of time worrying about whether we should bundle more things up into the tariff and things like that, but we should worry a lot about whether we are setting the prices right. If we do things \nsuch as\n systematically \nunderprice\n maternity, we will lead \nto \npeople be\ning\n in difficulty who \nmight \nbe perfectly efficient. Equally, if we overprice some bits of complex surgery\n,\n we will make people look very good financially \nwhen\n actually they could be very inefficient. That does not help the system overall\n; i\nt means that where the problems emerge may not reflect what is underlying\n them\n. So I would like much more focus on getting the prices right.\nChair: \nCan we move on?\n \nQ196 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: As to the \nextra\n amount of money, was it £150 million? \nJohn Appleby: \nApparently. I saw it in\n a news story reported in the \nHealth Service Journal\n today.\nQ197 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nIs this \non\n top of the £250 million that the Secretary of State announced\n—\n \nJohn Appleby: \nApparently, yes.\nQ198 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nAs \nfor \nthe \nwinter\n crises that you mentioned\n \nover the past two years\n, do you\n think this £250 million\n has anything to do with\n them being \nin crisis because of what is happening with the NHS funding?\nJohn Appleby: \nI think it is extreme worry about what is going to happ\nen in A and E over the winter t\nhat has prompted this.\nQ199 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nThis extra £150 \nmillion\n on top of the £250 million.\nJohn Appleby: \nYes. The £250 million is about A and E\n,\n and this is also about A and E\n, \nso it is a barometer of worry.\nQ200 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: Some\n \ntrusts\n were not allocated any\n money.\nJohn Appleby: \nYes, exactly, and there have been quite a lot of complaints from trusts next door to each other\n where\n one got some money and another did not\n,\n and there was an argu\nment about that.\n \nQ201 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nSo \nwherever\n this money is coming from, do you think this is as a result, over the last two years, of the difficulties that there have been in NHS funding generally that they face?\nJohn Appleby: I\nt has happened\n,\n in my experience\n,\n in the NHS virtually every year since its existence in some sense. There has always been somebo\ndy who has a back pocket somewhere—good finance people always do, \nas it were, and\n—\n \nQ202 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: But as \nmuch\n as this—£250 million?\nJohn Appleby: \nIt is around this sort of figure, yes, and it happened\n,\n I think\n, the year before and \nthe year before last. It is announced in different ways. Sometimes i\nt is announced as an initiative;\n sometimes it is simply \njust \ndistributed throughout the system.\nChair: \nSometimes it is not announced. We have a quick question from Andrew on allocations and then we need to move on to the second panel.\nQ203 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nThe allocation of resources currently is a hot debating issue. Are you satisfied that the balance is right in relation to areas with deprivation against those with an older age profile\n,\n bearing in mind that the actual allocation\ns themselves have always lagged, or, \nrather\n,\n the pace of change \nhas always been incredibly slow?\n Do you think this is a rather pointless exercise anyway because they are not going to be moving at any great pace towards their target, are they? Or are they not?\nJohn Appleby: \nThey are not. What you are referring to is the way we allocate money centrally to areas across the country. We do have the most sophisticated formula for allocating public money in the world, I think. The number of econometrician person hours that has gone into developing this very complex formula is almost unbelievable.\nQ204 &#xa0; \nChair: \nIs \n“\nsophisticated\n”\n a synonym for complex?\nJohn Appleby: I\nt is complex\n,\n but it is also sophisticated \naccording to \nthe meaning of the word \n“\nsophisticated\n”\n. I am not just using it as a synonym. There have been arguments going back to the mid\n&#x2011;\n1970s in local areas. When I worked in the health service\n,\n we had a standing committee \nin \nthe region \nthat\n would deal with arguments locally about who got how much according to the formula. It is a sort of no\n&#x2011;\nwin situation, I think, and at the moment there is no real extra money to reallocate\n,\n so everything has ground to a halt in terms of any change. \nThere are quite big differences. Is it \nManchester\n that gets about 1.6 or 1.8 times more money than \nOxford\n, for example? That is what the formula produces, if you like. There have been arguments \nabout making\n it much simpler\n,\n and \nthat \nthe sophistication is a sort of over\n&#x2011;\nsophistication\n and it is just over\n-\ncomplex. \nSo, y\nes, \nit is \na bit of deprivation, mainly driven by age and population size. In fact, the extra that the sort of deprivation and other factors add over and above taking just the population and the age structure is not that much. It is \na \nvery small amount of difference. \nQ205 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: \nCan I come back \non\n this? The other issue for rural areas, of course, is the cost of delivering services \nthere\n. \nSparsity\n is not factored in at all\n,\n and yet you can have a population of very high need because they have such an elderly health profile\n, which\n makes it very difficult for them to provide resources. Just looking at the issue of section 136s and places of safety, there is \njust \nno provision\n,\n effectively\n,\n in some rural areas\n,\n which is why they have such high use of police cells. Is that an issue that you think needs to be addressed? \nJohn Appleby: \nIt is partly an empirical matter about what the differences \nare \nin cost. For example, there is a so\n&#x2011;\ncalled market forces factor\n,\n which tries to take account of the different costs of labour employing people in different parts of the country. \nS\nalaries in \nLondon\n are higher, \nbecause it is \nLondon\n, \nand the\nre is some compensation for the\n south\n&#x2011;\neast. Similarly\n,\n there may well be a case for a sort of \nrurality\n or \nsparsity\n&#x2011;\ntype\n payment. All you would be \ndoing is taking a bit more money out of \nLondon\n to do that, I would suggest, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. It is an empirical matter, I think.\nAnita Charlesworth: \nCan I add one thing? \nA\nn awful lot of work and energy goes into the formula\n,\n but I think, especially now, when resources are so constrained, \nthere has been \nmuch less focus \non how you implement the formula and\n how you make change happen. There are two things there. One of the things that happened routinely was that you got your allocation and\n,\n if you were a growth area\n,\n you were then set something called a control total\n,\n which was what bit of your allocation you were allowed to spend, which was agreed. By and large\n,\n that meant \nthat, \nif you were a growth area\n,\n you had most of that differential growth taken away because someone else might need to be bailed out. \nT\nhen you think\n,\n \n“W\nhat was the point of the allocations process?\n”\n \nW\ne need to decide how we are going to do resource allocation\n, which\n is informed by good empirical work but is significantly a policy question\n. B\nut then\n,\n if you do not align the rest of the system to it and work out how you are going to move out around real r\nesources, people, buildings and so on\n, you end up back where we were\n,\n where people have a theoretical allocation and then the reality of their control total\n,\n which just undermines all the credibility and discipline in the system and is counter\n-\nproductive.\nJohn Appleby: \nThere has been some work\n done by two economists, Professor \nMatt Sutton \nat \nManchester\n \nand Professor Nigel Rice\n \nat \nYork\n, looking at the impact of the weighted capitation system going back to 1970. Their conclusion, in\n a nutshell, is that it\n has done almost nothing in terms of the central objective, which is equal opportunity of access for those in equal need, which was the starting point for the original working party\n, RAWP\n. \nW\ne have had over 30 years of moving billions of pounds around t\nhe country, but, as Anita points\n out\n, you give with one hand and take with another. There is no\n real\n—\n \nQ206 &#xa0; \nChair: \nWe \nhave\n had 30 years when we have talked about it\n,\n but we have not actually moved the cash. That is the key point, is it not?\nAnita Charlesworth: Y\nes.\nChair: Okay. \nOn that note, thank you very much for coming once again. I suspect you will be back on anot\nher occasion. Thank you.\nWitnesses:\n \nMatt Tee, Chief Operating Officer, NHS Confederation, \nCouncillor Katie Hall, Chair, Community Wellbeing Board, and \nAndrew Webster, Associate Director of Health and Care Integration, Local Government Association, gave evidence.\nQ207 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThank you \nvery\n much. Thank you for waiting patiently during the previous session. I think I am right in saying that Andrew Webster has been before but Katie Hall \nhas \nnot\n.\n Could I ask you very briefly to introduce yourselves in your current roles?\nMatt Tee: \nI am Matt Tee and I am the chief operating officer of the NHS Confederation.\nCouncillor Hall: \nI am Katie Hall, chair of the Local Government Association\n’\ns Community Wellbeing Board.\nAndrew Webster: \nI am Andrew Webster, director for integrated care at the Local Government Association. \nQ208 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThank you very much. I would like to begin, if I may, by going straight into the same basic question that I asked the previous panel of witnesses. In the NHS context, it tends to be referred to as the Nicholson challenge, partly because that is what we in this Committee have called it\n, but the efficiency challenge—\nthe requirement to deliver care from a budget that is, at best, frozen in real terms in the NHS\n,\n and reducing in \nmany parts of local government—\nis the core challenge across the health and care system\n.\n I would like to hear each of your views as to how we ar\ne getting on with that process—\nboth where we have got to but, more importantly, what it \nwill feel\n like over the next two years and looking forward int\no the second half of the decade.\nMatt Tee: \nIt feels tough. \nI would say that 20%\n of our members say this is the worst financial situation they have seen in their time in the health service, and we have\n some very long\n&#x2011;\nserving\n people. So far, it feels to me\n \nthat\n what the health service has done is the relatively easier parts of taking money out. \nT\nhe health service has unquestionably been helped by the effective pay freeze for the last couple of years. Experience tells us that after a pay freeze finishes\n,\n pay bounces back again to a degree. \nAs to t\nhe changes that we have heard about already in terms of estate a\nnd one\n&#x2011;\noff money coming from that, and\n \nthe \nslimming down of management costs, we are getting to the end point\n of those.\n It was quite telling for me that in our annual survey \nof our members \nthere has been a real shift from where they think they are getting \nthe money from in future. W\ne have shifted from the things we have just mentioned into need\ning\n to change the way we provide services\n,\n and there is a significant shift happening in thinking around where the money will come from in the future.\nQ209 &#xa0; \nChair: \nIs there \nany\n evidence of that happening on the ground?\nMatt Tee: \nNo. \nW\nhere we are at is people realising that they have reached the end of the road on the easier changes\n and \nthe easier ways of taking out money\n,\n and that they now need to start d\noing the very difficult stuff. \nThat would be where I would put it, I guess. You asked about the next two years and it feels very tough \nfor\n me. There is a degree to which the NHS has always said, \n“\nThis year is just about manageable\n, \nnext year looks very tough and the year after is impossible.\n”\n \nF\nor our members in hospitals, particularly in district general hospitals that do not provide community services, 2015\n&#x2011;\n16 looks \nreally\n tough indeed. The effect of the ITF, which I am sure we will come \non to \ntalk about more, \nis being taken as\n \nbeing \na very difficult period. We heard that it will require efficiencies, on average, of 6% in hospitals. For the DGHs that will be probably more than 6%\n,\n and it looks very tough indeed.\nCouncillor Hall: \nFrom the local government point of view, when we presented evidence to this Committee a year ago we had a picture of real pressures and inevitable future service reductions\n.\n \nA\n year on, things are worse than they were. From our point of view, in very challenging times, we have maintained service delivery\n,\n but we really have reached the limit of the efficiencies that we can take in the services that we provide.\nQ210 &#xa0; \nChair: \nDo you want to add to that?\nAndrew Webster: I\nt is worth dwelling a little on what the membership are saying as well. E\nvery year the A\nssociation of Directors of Adult Social Services does a survey of the budgetary position as perceived by their members\n,\n and, up to date, they are reporting that\n,\n of the £2.68 billion that has come out of the budget over the last three years\n,\n three quarters has come from efficiency, 7% from increasing charges and the remainder from service changes. \nT\nhe vast majority of the savings thus far have been delivered by being more efficient, holding \ndown prices and restructuring the way in which the services are organised without having a substantial impact. But they are overwhelmingly saying that they see in future that they are going to have \nto\n change the model of service quite dramatically in order both to continue to m\neet the equivalent-and-a-bit-\nmore saving require\nment over the next three years, \nand the ongoing demographic pressure of about 3% per annum\n,\n which they always have to cope with. \nT\nhe position is that\n,\n while it has been very tough, it has been weathered, but people\n’\ns confidence that that can continue is reducing. \nWe are also seeing public anxiety about that increasing. Three years ago the MORI surveys were showing that most people felt that older people\n’\ns care was not something that was very high on their worry list\n;\n now it is at the top of their worry list because they perceived that the systems that support those people to remain independent are under huge financial pressure and they do not see how that is going to be squared.\nCouncillor Hall: \nThat\n 3% a year pressure\n translates to £400 million a year needed just to stand still\n while\n, in fact, obviously there have been substantial cuts to the local government budget.\nQ211 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: W\ne have\n \ntouched\n already on social care.\n \nW\nhat do you think the prospects for social care are now in the current year? The LGA has mentioned increasing levels of legal challenge about service provision. How great do you think is the risk that local authorities will not be able to meet statutory obligations in connection with social care?\nAndrew Webster: \nThe first thing to say is that legal challenge to social care entitlement is not new. It has always been in the system\n,\n and one of the reasons why lots of people in the social care sector \nwelcome the current C\nare Bill and the process that led to it is that it provides a much clearer statutory footing for entitlement and for distribution of services. That \nbeing \nsaid, without the detail of that new framework being clear, whether it is deliverable or sustainable is a question that in fact nobody can answer\n,\n because we know that the current arrangements are under significant pressure and our interpretation of the legislation is that those pressures are likely to be increased by \nit, \nrather than red\nuced. But we have not heard yet—and we could not yet have heard—\nthe Government\n’\ns response to that in terms of the detailed regulation a\nnd the funding of those burdens, \nonce they are placed on the system by that new legislative requirement. \nT\nhe current system has \nbeen sustainable with a degree—and slightly increasing degree—\nof challenge, but how it will work in future once the Act comes into force in 2015\n&#x2011;\n16 we cannot yet predict.\nQ212 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nSarah Wollaston \nand\n I were both \non the \nJoin\nt Committee that scrutinised the draft version of the Care Bill, and i\nt is fair to say that the people we heard from mi\nght have welcomed the framework, \nbut wanted an eligibility criteria of \n“\nmoderate\n”.\n I think we heard that again and again\n,\n and\n,\n if that is not likely\n,\n that reduces support for the framework\n,\n because a framework that alters everybody on to \n“\nsubstantial\n”\n is a different thing.\nCouncillor Hall: \nWe obviously do not know the detail of that framework yet\n.\n \nI\nt is something that we wait to see and we cannot see what challenges there will be until we implement it.\nQ213 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: Of \nwhat\n you already know, disregarding any new burdens\n—\nbecause if there are new burdens they ought to be funded\n—\nfrom what you know of the\n—\n  \nChair: \nThat is a new doctrine.\nBarbara Keeley: \nIndeed. I mean from what you already know about funding coming up for the current year and the following year.\nCouncillor Hall: T\nhere are certain areas\n,\n on which Andrew could give more detail\n,\n where we would say we are still arguing that certain burdens are new burdens and need to be funded as such. There is not always recognition that all the things are additional new burdens that need funding because we simply cannot fund them all out of our existing budgets.\nQ214 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: W\ne \nare\n moving now on to integration as well as reconfiguration\n,\n and I think you have heard some of the questions and the discussion we h\nad \nearlier. Could you give us your view o\nn how you fit the two together—\nthe integration and the \nreconfiguration—\nand make sure that that all happens, taking the local communities along with you? \nMatt Tee: \nCan I kick off on that? It is a point well made and I thought the \nsession \nearlier was very interesting. It seems to me that we have to be carefu\nl that by “reconfiguration” we don’\nt just mean closing hospitals. For me\n,\n what we have is a health service \nthat\n is largely structured for dealing with the episodic care needs of the 1960s and 1970s\n,\n and what we need now is a care service \nthat\n extends beyond health\n,\n which looks after \nthe \nfrail elderly with complex needs, people with multiple chronic con\nditions and so on. We know that, \nfor a\n lot of those people, \na hospital is not the best place for them to receive care. \nF\nor me\n,\n when we talk about reconfiguration and integration, I start with the needs that we are facing in society and ask, \n“\nHow do we best work with these needs?\n”\n If you are an elderly person with complex needs and you are frail, you have a range of needs that you will not personally probably recognise\n,\n \nas to whether \nit is a health need\n,\n a social care need or indeed a mental health need. For me, that is the starting point for integration. That is where we start saying we need to deal with the care needs of individuals, not with the way the system is structured at the moment and doing it for our convenience. \nWhen I talk about reconfiguration, it is part of a journey that gets us to providing care in different settings in different ways. Part of the consequence of that may be that we do not need all the hospitals we have to do all the things that they currently do\n. W\nhen we start the discussion from that point of view\n,\n about people\n’\ns care needs\n,\n rather than starting it from a position that says\n,\n \n“W\ne have too many A and E departments and we should close some,\n”\n we \nstart \nto have a better conversation about how we begin to do some of that. It is painfully difficult. If it was easy, we \nwould have done it 30 years ago—\nand we have not\n.\n \nT\nhe Department of Health, I think laudably, has launched some pioneers in integrated care\n, which is a great thing.\n \nW\ne have been trying this for 30 years\n,\n and to have some pioneers now is a great thing\n,\n but it shows how difficult it is. \nOne of our worries would be that people begin to come up with what they think are easy solutions or quick fixes to get us to that point. \nH\naving more integrated commissioning may be part of the answer to that\n, but, if\n having all the money in one place was the answer to integration\n,\n we would have integrated physical and mental health\n \ncare at the moment and we do not. \nI\nt may be part of the answer, but there are more things. \nF\nor me\n,\n it is really important when \nwe are having the conversation—\nwhether it is between health and social care\n,\n health and politics\n, or health and the public—\nthat we start off with the care needs of individual people. \nQ215 &#xa0; \nValerie Vaz: \nDo you think the current structure helps or hinders that conversation?\nMatt Tee: \nIf it did not hinder it to the extent it did, we would not be having this conversation\n. It is not just the structures;\n it is almost everything about it. \nW\ne have separate providers for mental health\n \ncare, physical care and social care. The economies that fund those care systems are different. About half of social care is provided by the public sector, sometimes through private providers, \nand \nsome of it is person\nally funded or insurance \nfunded. Most of the care that takes place in a health\n \ncare setting is publicly funded through an NHS Engl\nand commissioning route. All \nthose things have arisen for good historical reasons. Some of those things are no longer fit for the purpose we need them to be.\nCouncillor Hall: \nFrom our point of view, the profile of integration has grown enormously over the past year\n. T\nhe enthusiasm for it across the country can be seen from the fact that there were more than 100 areas bidding to be pioneers and we now have the 14 that are taking place. Of course, in addition to that\n,\n there are also areas such as my own \nin Bath and north\n&#x2011;\neast Somerset—\nand I have a couple of examples I could share with you here\n—\nwhere there already is a certain amount of integrated work\n,\n which was happening due to individuals in \nthe area building relationships and\n \ntalking to each other over time.\n \nA\ns Matt has said\n,\n you cannot just put \nin a\n pot of money and \nassume \neverything will follow. It can be a huge trigger to helping people rewire their services and develop them in a way \nthat\n is geared \na\nround the person\n,\n rather than around the existing provision, but on its own it is not enough. \nHealth and wellbeing boards are established in all localities now\n,\n and I think the opportunities are there to develop their capabilities so that they can really be the leaders in driving this change where you have people from local government, soci\nal services, the hospitals and\n from the CCGs. Everybody is talking to each other now in a far greater way than they have done\n,\n and that is happening everywhere to a different degree, obviously, but the relationships are better and in more depth than they have been.\nQ216 &#xa0; \nChair: \nCan we push a little bit on this? We hear that and that is a very clear positive message, if we are going to deliver more joined\n&#x2011;\nup\n services. Sir David Nicholson\n said the ITF is a game changer and\n it requires people to work together. But, equally, we still hear health service managers looking at ITF money as \n“\nour \nmoney”.\n It is quite a culture shift for an NHS manager or NHS clinicians to enjoy exchanges with local government throug\nh a health and wellbeing board—\nI wonder how far down I can ever get these fou\nr words in the right order—“forming, \nnorming\n and storming”,\n and I am not sure what the fourth o\nne is, but you know what I mean. H\now far down that spectrum have we \ngot\n?\nCouncillor Hall: \nI know what you mean and I never get them in the right order either. There is a variety of different experience in different areas and we have\n—\nand I am going to forget our own words\n now—a series of \nway\ns\n in which we are supporting health and wellbeing boards to develop these capabilities\n,\n and we are setting out different models of where you will be as you move from being a nascent health and wellbeing board, which is not the word we use, for which apologies, to a mature and exemplar one. Different places are at a different stage with all of this\n,\n and we recognise that there are still some areas where there are tensions. But overall, I think\n—\n \nAndrew Webster: \nCan I add three things to that? \nF\nirst\n,\n I think that the creation of clinical commissioning gr\noups has changed that landscape \nconsiderably in that the engagement of general practitioners is now much higher in those conversations. Councillors and general practitioners are the two groups of people who persistently have to confront the people the \nsystem has failed\n,\n and they bring that drive into the system in the way that previous arrangements betwe\nen managers of systems did not.\nS\necond\nly,\n there is a strong clinical recognition, as Matt \nwas saying, \nthat the existing model does not work for the people it most needs to benefit. Therefore, the lead clinicians in the hospitals and in the communities are driving change. \nT\nhird\nly\n, while it brings huge challenges, the era of austerity means that the option of spending a little more money at the margin is not available to anybody\n.\n \nT\nherefore\n,\n if there is going to be some significant ch\nange,\n it involves re\n&#x2011;\nengineering\n what we already have and what we are already spending\n,\n and that is a different type of conversation and can be a game changer. The evidence that we have is very early evidence from talking to people who are trying to implement the integration transformation fund, and that is not straightforward because all the rules are not yet clear, but people are obviously getting on with it because they want it to succeed. The evidence is that those conversations are happening in a very positive way in many parts of the country and that, given the right framework and rules, people will get to a place where they feel that they can create a genuine integrated plan.\nCouncillor Hall: \nI have recently heard a story where a CCG is considering spending some money on gritting\n,\n because local authorities have strict criteria about where they g\nrit—whether it is a steep hill,\n busy or whatever\n—\nand they are going at it \nwith\n one particular approach. The CCG is thinking, \n“W\nhere is it that the frail elderly have slipped in the past and \nthe council \nhas not \ncovered those\n areas\n? S\nhall we work together and spend some of this integrated money on gritting?\n”\n It does not cost very much money to do it, but they are pushing at a different angle to try and reduce the number of people\n who end up with a fractured hip.\n \nSo, \nby spending a very tiny amount of money\n,\n you reduce \nthe number of\n people getting injured.\nQ217 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nThat\n is horrific. \nI understand the principles behind what you are saying, but the health service needs to do health stuff and local government needs to do that which it \ndoes\n. As with everything else, they are lovely warm words. We all believe in \n“\nintegration\n”—\nmotherhood an\nd apple pie—\nbut\n,\n when it comes to it, \nwhat would the reaction of the \ngeneral public \nbe if you were to \nsay\n to them\n, \n“\nWe are going to cut the budgets of local authoriti\nes to the bone, so they cannot do x, y and z\n, but \nthat \nis okay because while we are taking \nmoney out of the health service, \nwe w\nill use that to grit your roads”?\n A public health professional who sat in the seat you are sitting in when we were doing another inquiry \nresponded\n, \n“\nSome pe\nople may think that filling pot\nholes is a public health duty.\n”\n \nW\nhy do\nn’t\n \nwe \njust dump all the money in a pot and everybody grab a bit? I am quite sure that people who are sitting listening \nwould not be happy with \nthe idea that they cannot get an operat\nion or the drugs that they need, but mean\nwhile\n \nhealth service money that they are paying via their taxes into the health serv\nice is being used to grit roads.\nChair: Rosie, \nthat is a fair challenge. Could Matt Tee have a say on this question and then we will move to Barbara?\nMatt Tee: \nI think, in terms of the integration, \nand \nparticularly the conversation between local government and health, we have a paradox here. The paradox for me is that the conversation is quite difficult because we\n are both financially pressured.\n I am not wishing to have a competition about who is most financially pressured\n,\n but we \nare very financially pressured, \nwhich makes the conversation difficult. \nI\nn many ways\n,\n if we were not financially pressured\n,\n we would not be having the conversation and it is making best use of a crisis, I guess. \nFor me\n,\n the nature of that conversation has changed materially over the last five years. We now see a vested interest in speaking to each other and in co\n&#x2011;\noperating across boundaries. \nF\nive years ago\n,\n if you had \nhad a hospital chief exec\n sitting here\n,\n they would be saying\n,\n \n“\nMy only interest in l\nocal authorities is why they don’\nt take the people I want to discharge,\n”\n and it is now a much better conversation a\nbout a system. It is not there; there is still a way to go.\nY\nou talked about ownership and about the ITF. \nW\ne see difficulties in that relationship where people have a perception of ownership, either of money or services, and do not have a focus on the citizen and the service they require\n,\n and how we best join it up for their needs. \nF\nor me\n,\n some of the best health and wellbeing boards are where, although they may sit within the council, they are not perceived as being owned by the local authority\n but \nare perceived as being owned by the system.\nQ218 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: Hang on. You\n are still not addressing the real question. We are talking about all these nice warm words, but the reality is \nabout \nhow you think that taxpayers in general will feel when they see their local doctors paying to have their roads gritted? How do y\nou think that plays when I can’\nt get my drugs \nand I can’t\n get my operation?\nAndrew Percy: \nYou would \nhave \neven less chance of getting your drugs or operation if five old people \nwho h\nad \nbroken \ntheir \nhips \nwere \nfilling up the beds.\nRosie Cooper: Hang on. \nBut the priority is\n—\n  \nChair: \nT\nhis is not an exchange between m\nembers of the Committee.\nAndrew Percy: \nBut it is about \nreducing admissions to hospital, \nand they can do whatever things they think are most effective locally.\nMatt Tee: \nWhen we talk about pressure on the system, \nit \nhappens in two ways and that is why it shows up in A and E departments. We have too many people coming in and we cannot discharge them fast enough. One of the ways we need to work to relieve pressure on the system is to have fewer people coming in. The gritting may be an extreme example, but that the health service has a responsibility for prevention seems to me to be absolutely true.\nQ219 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nI \nabsolutely\n do agree with the principle, but the problem I have is \nthat \nwe have had Councillor Hall and a public health professional both use examples where saving the health servic\ne money actually means that a \njob that would have been done by \na \nlocal authority is going to continue to be done\n,\n \nbut \nusing health service money. That is the problem.\nAndrew Webster: \nThere is an element in which that is the essence of the integration transformation fund\n,\n because the purpose of it is to protect social care and community services in a way that reduces pressure on hospitals. Clearly\n,\n that is not an easy thing to do and it involves the kinds of conversations that Matt Tee has been referring to\n,\n but there are two underlying principles that are very important to local government in it. One is that, by working together, the health service and local government will get a better deal.\nQ220 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nSo combine \nthe\n budgets now.\nAndrew Webster: \nYes, I was coming on to that. That should lead, over time, to a system in which the budgets are combined and more locally accountable\n,\n because that way local people would be able to hold all their local services to account for the deliver\ny\n of a better service.\nQ221 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nJust to close \nthat\n off, there is a danger \nwith that\n \nbecause, \nif you start on gritting in winter\n, you have to start on potholes and\n pavements\n,\n and then there is swimming. My local authority had free school swimming. Are you going to bring that ba\nck? Are you going to fund the school sport p\nartnership\ns\n? Some of these things, in terms of obesity and those aspects of health, may be things you should do\n,\n but you cannot make this health money totally elastic. \nThe question I wanted to get into was how effective the health and wellbeing boards are proving to be in engaging those across health and social care in planning local services. You talked about conversations and good relationships, but we need more than that. I do not know if you were here earlier when our Nuffield Trust panel member talked about the need for really robust plans, \nbut, \nif we are talking about £1.9 billion extra funding coming across from the NH\nS out of £3.8 billion funding—\nthe other £1.9 billion is \nthe \nalready existing amounts\n—\nthat needs more than good relationships and talking to each other, does \nit \nnot? At what point do you see you getting into much more robust planning and much more concrete ways of moving forward\n?\n \nR\nelationships and talking is nice\n,\n but it is not really shifting anything, is it?\nCouncillor Hall: \nAbsolutely. You need to look at the whole system. How do you start with prevention and stopping somebody coming into hospital\n? I\nf somebody comes into hospital\n,\n why do they spend longer than they need to \nbe \nin hospital\n?\n \nT\nhen\n,\n how do you get people out \nof hospital? How do you do \nre\nablement\n services to get people out\n?\n \nY\nou need to look at it throughout the whole process.\nQ222 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nStop at that point, \nbecause\n \nyou were talking about back-\nfilling council funding in terms of gritting, \nso \ndo you then just use all the money that is meant to be us\ned on integration in back-filling? S\nay, for instance, the local authority is moving its eligibility on to \n“\nsubstantial\n”\n or to \n“\ncritical\n”\n, do you then say, \n“\nOkay, the way to keep people out of hospital is to go back to the service \nwe had three years ago, so let’\ns just spend it all on care packages\n,”\n and not move\n \non with true integration at all? \nThe worry is \nthat the money will just get eaten up like other transfers have been \nby \ndoing things that the local authority was able to fund a couple of years a\ngo and is not able to fund now.\n That is the logic of what you said, but that is not integration. Integration is not just looking at how we can keep people out of hospital, is it?\nCouncillor Hall: No.\n \nWe\n \nneed to \nlook at the whole system of where people are coming into the different services from and what happens to an individual person\n. \nI do not know if you have seen the excellent King\n’\ns Fund animation about jo\nining the services up for a man\n call\ned\n Sam\n, but\n \nin it \nthey \nsay that\n \nthe services seem\n \nto come from all over the place for that individual\n \nand \nthat he has\n to tell \nhis\n story again and again to get the services that\n he\n want\ns\n. \nW\nhat we are trying to achieve by this approach\n—\nby pooling the funds \nand \ndoing things together\n—is to end up with having \nfe\nwer different people and \nser\nvices, and more shared information. \nAndrew can maybe talk in some detail about the i\nmportance of transferring data and sharing information\n based on national health numbers and stuff like that\n,\n which, at the moment, or in many places, have been blocks to that information. Somebody could be discharged from hospital, for example, and the care record does not follow them for a week or two or longer\n,\n or maybe not at all. We are trying to make sure that this information stays with the person. Perhaps you could exp\nlain how that could work.\nAndrew Webster: \nTo answer directly the question about health and wellbeing boards, they are the leaders of this system, are they not? They are not themselves going to do the things that Councillor Hall was just describing to you. They are there to require that \nthey are\n done and to set the framework in which \nthey\n can be\n done\n.\nQ223 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nBut at the moment they are the only point where all these bodies come together.\nAndrew Webster: \nIn\ndeed. T\nhe way in which they hold each other to account in that process is very important and I think is reinforced by the introduction of the integration transformation fund\n.\n \nA\ns Councillor Hall was saying, some of the requirements that introduces aro\nund jointly signing off a plan—\nprotecting the social care service, sharing information, adopting common procedures,\n understanding the whole system\n \nand \nworking out how they will manage risk if\n things do not go as they plan—\nare a step above where health and wellbeing boards have been working in their early months and \nare a challenge to them.  W\ne are putting a considerable amount of support into enabling them to do \nthat \nand other parts of the system are also supporting their contributors \nto \ndo\n it\n. \nW\ne cannot sit here today and say, \n“\nYes, there is a health and wellbeing board that has done it and here is the model,\n”\n but we can identify the places that are doing well and \nthose\n that are facing challenges\n,\n and support them to learn from one another. The solutions and the leadership will be different in different places. A single national prescription would be wrong for most of the 153 localities.\nMatt Tee: \nWe are quite worried about this. We support the principle of the integration transformation fund. Our worry is \nthat \nthe time when it is going t\no happen is coming very quickly\n and we do not see enough planning taking place in enough places for us to be sure of the effect that this money will have. If I can give you an example, I was in a quite challenged hospital in the home counties yesterday speaking to the d\nirector of operations there.  \nI said, \n“\nSo talk to me about the integration transformation fund,\n”\n and he said, \n“\nI am relatively optimistic. They have at least started talking to us about it.\n”\n It feels to me \nas if\n there is the potential for a good conversation and for some good deals to be done there\n,\n but there is a real urgency about involving the right people in those conversations \nso \nthat health plays the part it should play in integrated treatment\n,\n but also so that health understands what it can legitimately expect in terms of reduction in demand on the health system.\nQ224 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nBut if you have an \nexample\n of a challenged trust, how difficult \nis it \nfor them to prioritise doing more than just having nice conversations\n,\n when they have other challenges and a little bit of time lapse\n because there is a tendency to think—\n \nMatt Tee: \nPart of the reason I think the ITF incentivises some go\nod behaviours is that that\n trust knows that it is not getting that chunk of money when the ITF comes along\n,\n so it has a \nreal \nvested interest in being involved in the conversation about what that money is spent on. That, I think, is good in the system\n,\n and trusts and providers broadly are giving time in order to be part of those\n conversations. I feel, \nas Andrew said earlier\n,\n \nthat they\n think it is not yet clear what the rules are\n,\n so it is not clear how the deal happens. \nW\ne need a bit more urgency in that.\nQ225 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nWhat \nhappens\n if\n \nthe trusts are not invited to that conversation\n? T\nhere are three or four trusts in their area and one or two are \nexcluded from that conversation.\nMatt Tee: I\nt would go completely against the spirit of the ITF.\nAndrew Webster: \nThe expectation is that they are.\nQ226 &#xa0; \nChair: \nFrom a local \ngovernment\n perspective, what Matt Tee has just said chimes a little bit with what you said a moment ago\n,\n because one of the questions in my mind, listening to you talk, was, \n“\nCoul\nd you point us in the direction”—\nacc\nepting that there is a variety—“\nof a health and wellbeing board where you feel this is a process that is working\n and \nthat is delivering change on the ground\n?” Y\nou have said, \n“\nWell, not yet, but I can point you to one or two where t\nhere are some encouraging signs,”\n and in one part of the country an encouraging sign is that they have exchanged telephone numbers.\nCouncillor Hall: \nThere certain\nly\n are some localities where working together is already happening and is happening well. We have an example of some interesting work in \nGreenwich\n through their community health services\n, the \nOxleas\n NHS Foundation T\nrust and the council\n’\ns adult social care services. There\n,\n the users and the staff access the integrated care service via a single point of contact, which is obviously much easier for the individual person concerned, and this incorporates referral pathways\n,\n which can immediately address an individual\n’\ns needs\n.\n \nT\nhe integrated health and social care teams provide the whole\n&#x2011;\nsystem\n re\nsponse to the intermediate care and\n the hospital discharge\n,\n and the social care teams provide rehabilitation. \nI\nt is yielding a number of positive results. We have had a reduction there in A and E admissions, \nin hospital admissions and\n care home admissions, which obviously \nis\n very important, and fewer people entering full social care.\nQ227 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThose things, where you finished up, are the tests. That is the answer to Barbara\n’\ns point, is it not? There is no value in spending this money in hospitals if they do not need to be there. That is the whole point. The point is to remodel the system in order to reduce demand for hospital space. If you can demonstrate health economies where closer working is delivering reduced hospital admissions and quicker hospital discharges, \nand \ntherefore \nreducing \nthe demand for bed space, we are getting somewhere\n,\n but it does not feel as though that is happening anywhere very quickly at the moment.\nCouncillor Hall: \nWe have a number of value case\ns\n \nthat\n we could share with the Committee of places that \nalready \nhave this.\nQ228 &#xa0; \nChair: \nIt would be useful to see \nevidence\n on the ground of real declining admissions or real accelerated discharges.\nCouncillor Hall: \nWhat we really want is \nto \nkeep people out of hospital who do not need to be there\n,\n because we all know that\n,\n if a frail elderly \nperson \ngoes to hospital, is admitted and stays there for longer, their outlook is less good. \nW\ne need to do what we can to reduce the number of people going to hospital. I will ask the team to send you these value cases that we have drawn up. I think we have eight from different areas around the country where we can show that this is really effective.  \nChair: It would be good to see a time\nline showing trends in an inner local economy and also comparing that economy with other equivalent economies elsewhere in the country. Okay, thank you. \nQ229 &#xa0; \nAndrew Percy: \nStaying\n on integration—\nthis is probably a question more for Matt\n—\ndo you think we will need to see mergers of hospital trusts or CCGs\n? E\nveryone talks about integration\n,\n and in my area I am very lucky that the local council \nhas \nmaintained social care at moderate intervention levels\n and\n \nis \nbuilding a new intermediate care centre with 30 beds, which \nis brilliant, \nwith \na lot of money going in because \nit has \nmade some tough political choices\n. B\nut the rest of our services have been reconfi\ngured. We have one health trust and\n one hospital trust,\n so there is the hospital trust and\n two different CCGs\n,\n bu\nt one of the CCGs is really two \nthirds in another hospital trust, so \nit has \nto decide w\nhat they want from one hospital, and t\nhe other CCG has to decide what it wants from the other two hospitals. \nThey are all going through their own se\nparate processes a\nt the very moment when everybody is talking about integration\n,\n but one is doing \nits “\nhealthy lives, healthy future\n”\n thing and the trust is reconfiguring services already within it\n.\n \nT\nhen we\n have one council, fortunately, \ndoing very \ngood things for my constituents, \nbecause we\n are seeing new services coming, but \nit is still all a bit of a mess. \nSo long as we have different bodies, d\no you think we are going to see mergers of either CCGs or acute trusts?\nMatt Tee: \nI do, but perhaps not for the reasons that you may think\n, and we can see it already.\n One of the\n \nresponses that providers are making to the financial challenges is to look to merge places because they can reduce some of the costs that are involved in providing treatment. \nIt is quite likely that \nwe will begin to see more mergers driven by a need to be more efficient\n.\n In terms of CCGs, it is a\nn\n interesting question and I do not think we know the an\nswer yet. Certainly the variance\n in the populations that CCGs cover \nis\n quite large\n,\n and I think we do not know yet whether that is okay or whether we need to be more consistent about the size of population that CCGs cover. \nThe one point I would make is that I do not think that merging organisations \nnecessarily \ngives you better joined\n&#x2011;\nup\n services. I can think of hospitals that I know that have merged where they are still essentially providing different services on different sites\n,\n and other places where a collaboration between hospitals that has not required an organisational merger has led to much more joined\n&#x2011;\nup\n working, the ability to do different sorts of surgery on different sites and those sorts of \nthings. It is part of an answer, \nbut it is not \n“\nthe\n”\n answer.\nQ230 &#xa0; \nChair: \nI want to \nask\n about the way in which the local government world experiences trusts that are getting themselves into financial difficulty. We asked the previous panel about \nthe \ngrowing numbers of trusts that are running deficits. Does that lead to a more focused, urgent and fundamental conversation with local authority partners\n,\n or does it lead \nto \ndrawing up the blinds and\n saying\n, \n“\nWe have got a crisis and\n we are too busy to talk to you”?\nCouncillor Hall: \nI do not have \na\n specific knowledge of that.\nAndrew Webster: \nWe have not asked that question directly of our members\n, s\no\n I hope \nyou will bear with an impressionistic answer from me\n.  H\naving talked to some of them \nand \nbeen to areas where those pressures exist, I would say \nthat \nit depends entirely on how the relationships were before the problem emerged. \nFor p\nlaces that have known that they have to deal with those sorts of issues and have worked together on them, the exacerbation of that pressure leads to them drawing together and seeking more radical decisions. In places where that issue has itself been a divider, it makes it worse. We have \nseen both \nexamples around the country. One of the helpful things in the current guidance on the fund is that the activity has to be aggregated at the level of a health and wellbeing board so \nthat \nthe council can see the overall picture\n,\n and it has to say what the impact of the plan is on the acute sector\n. So w\nhether it is resolving those pressures or not will be evident to the counci\nl and to all the other partners,\n and it has to go through a process of, \n“\nIs it a credible plan\n?”\n through a peer review by other people in local government and by the NHS.\nQ231 &#xa0; \nChair: \nJust to \ninterrupt\n you for a second, that throws local government in\n at the deep end, does it not? Suppose y\nou have a hospital in deficit\n.  The \nmajority of local government has not, until very recently, shown anything but a relatively superficial interest in the local health economy, \nbut \nif \na local authority \nis dealing with a trust \nthat has \ndeveloping financial pressures, how well equipped \nis it \nto pl\nay the role that it should play?\n The thought behind the question i\ns not that this is undesirable—I think it is very desirable—\nbut I wonder how well equipped the local authority is t\no play its part in that process.\nCouncillor Hall: B\necause we have not asked that specific question of our members\n, we cannot answer\n.\nMatt Tee: \nWe should not be surprised if the answer is\n,\n \n“\nNot very well.\n”\n This is very new stuff we are talking about. If we were to go back three or four years, most trusts and local authorities would not have thought that a hospital trust running a deficit was anything to do with the local authority. We are at least now in a place where we would recognise that\n,\n if you have financial difficulties in one part of the care system\n,\n it is going to impact on the other parts of the care system\n, \nand that is a much mo\nre mature conversation, I think\n almost everywhere\n,\n than we used to have. \nW\ne \nwere \ntalking earlier about pooled budgets and so on\n, but we will, I am sure, get to a point where \nwe have things like public sector risk pools across localities and so on\n,\n where that will be \na \nr\noutine part\n of what we do and we will not consider financial pressure in one part of the system to be owned by that part of the system\n. B\nut we are still on that journey to maturity. \nI\nt will be better than it would have been, but I do not think we are anywhere near there. \nQ232 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nI am \nalmost\n a mutant in the sense\n that I was chair of a hospital, \nbut a councillor for all those years\n,\n and the reality is that \ncouncillors \nare interested in the broad\n&#x2011;\nbrush political aspects of health, but would not have a clue about the real detail ever. I put that very question to Sir David Nicholson and talked about the maturity of health and wellbeing boards. They are great at talking and there is dynamic analysis and all that\n—\nwhatever you want to do\n—\nbut the reality is that you do not have power to make it happen and it has to be by consensus. \nMy original question\n—I am sorry Andrew is not \nhere now\n—was almost based o\nn that in that I want to see some real change. The difficulty councillors are going to have is when \nthe hospital is in real trouble. I\nt is not just about \nthe social care element of it and, therefore,\n not just the transformational bit, but\n,\n when the hospital is perhaps going to merge or close\n,\n or departments c\nlose, with local politicians\n being very close to the fact that their people do not want this to happen, it will be a very difficult conversation. I am not sure you have the strength or the detailed knowledge to handle the actual mechanics of the hospital end of it. Nor do I want to see, which is the point I was really trying to make before, the transformational fund or anything like it being used, for example, to empty bins\n, because i\nt is a public health hazard if the local authority cannot afford to do it. \nI\n put \nit \nto Sir David Nicholson that we are on a cliff edge and he agreed\n.\n \nI\nt really is serious because that cliff edge is about forcing hospitals to fall over, change, merge or divest themselves of authority. Right now you are in a comfortable position in that the health and wellbeing board is not responsible. When that mix hits together and starts almost \nto \nsolidify, I do not think that the health and wellbeing boards have the strength or the maturity to deliver \non \nthat. That is, I suppose, the co\nmment that the Chair was making, \nand I fear at that point who gets control of it. Does it just collapse? \nMatt Tee: \nI do \nnot feel in a comfortable place and \nI do not think my memb\ners feel in a comfortable place.  \nI doubt whether yo\nurs do, \neither.\nCouncillor Hall: \nNo.\nMatt Tee: \nThis feels like we are in a storm and the storm is only getting worse. I re\ncognise the risk of what you say—\nthat we end up in a place where services fail and we are looking for who is going to pick\n it up and make something of it. But \nwe as health and with local government have a responsibility \nto see \nthat that does not happen. One of the conversations that I think we have not \nhad\n well enough, as health, \nis working with local authorities and\n political colleagues to make the case for change and to seek local political support. \nIn a way, i\nt is much more diff\nicult for Members of Parliament—and candidates for Parliament—\nto support change\n,\n because they are not dealing with some of those questions in terms of public services day in\n,\n day out. My experience is that local councillors can quite often see\n—\nparticularly because they have had to make very difficult decisions about their own public services\n—\nthe ne\ncessity and the case for change, \nand will support that if it is put in the right way.\nQ233 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: They are ve\nr\ny brave \ncouncillors\n.\nT\nhe transformational fund has £3.8 billion. I was looking at some figures a fortnight ago \nthat\n showed that \nthe \nGovernment, if you like, \nare\n looking to that to grow to around £59 billion\n,\n and, of that, they believe that there can be an efficiency gain of £20 billion. On those figures, it looks like that £20 billion could go to the Treasury. If that is actually the case, what do you have to say about that?\nMatt Tee: \nI am not familiar with those figures.\nQ234 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nI will \nhappily\n make them available to you because I am going to write\n to David Nicholson about them.\nMatt Tee: \nIt would be very good to see those figures. If you were to say to me, \n“\nCan we take £20 billion out of integrated care betwe\nen health and local authorities?”,\n that feels like a very big chunk of money to be taking out of those services.\nQ235 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nThey will grow it from £3.8 billion, so \nit is \njoint budgets, not just out of one side. They will grow that to get £59\n \nbillion\n,\n and, of that, if you integrate \ndivisions\n they could liberate\n— \nAndrew Webster: \nThere would still be a 40% deficiency.\nQ236 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: W\nhat would you think about it going to the Treasury?\nMatt Tee: \nI would go to John Appleby\n’\ns point, which is\n,\n \n“\nEfficiency for what? What does the money get used for?\n”\nQ237 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nIf it goes back into the Treasury\n,\n you will not be using it for anything.\nCouncillor Hall: \nWe have not seen those figures either. If that is the case\n—\nif you are talking about taking another 40% of the money out\n—\nthat does not sound to me sustainable\n,\n but we would very much like to see those. \nAndrew Webster: \nIt is probably worth making a couple of other points. Our estimation of the forward spending plans is that close to that number is going to come out whether there is an integration fund or not, so that issue is confronting local government anyway\n.\n I would very strongly echo Matt\n’\ns point\n: \nI think\n that \nbringing together the best clinical skill of the NHS with the local political skill of councils would be a significant advantage in developing and communicating these proposals.\nChair: \nThere is a final question on resource allocation.\nQ238 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nWe are \nover\n time as we were last time. You were all here when I raised a \nquestion\n earlier about resource allocation, \nso I do not need to repeat that,\n but \nI would \nask you\n,\n in relation to both the \nc\nonfederation and local government\n’\ns views on it, whether you are satisfied that the allocation is fairly based on need. \nP\nrobably, more importantly, have there been any conversations\n about,\n and do you think there is a prospect\n of\n, bearing in mind your earlier discussion about integration, the harmonisation of the allocation of funds\n across health and social care—\nin other words a greater harmonisation, perhaps even coming in one pot rather than two?\nAndrew Webster: In our \nRewiring Public Services\n document\n,\n we made it very clear that we do think there should be a single allocation to each locality for public services and that that should be based on a simpler formula\n,\n which is co\n&#x2011;\ndesigned\n by local and central Government rather than imposed by the Treasury, as currently exists. \nO\nur aspir\nation would be for a single pot\n for \nnot only \nhealth and social care\n, but \npublic services across the locality. \nIn the very short term, the system could do with some certainty about the basis on which the allocations are going to be made\n, because at the moment\n there is uncertainty about the CCG allocation formula. There is uncertainty about the formula that will be applied to the integration transformation fund\n,\n and there are lots of local government finance directors scratching their heads wondering what number to put in next year\n’\ns budget. The sooner they know that, the more likely we are to make the right decisions and deliver the best with that money. So, in the long run, harmonisation would be good. In the short run, certainty would be helpful.\nMatt Tee: \nI would make three points. I agree with \nthe certainty point absolutely; that is \na very strong message from us. \nThe second point is that\n,\n while there are a number of localities\n I know\n that think that the allocation at the moment is very unfair, I suspect, whatever you do to the allocation, you will not reduce \nthe\n number\n of those who feel that it is very unfair.\n John Appleby\n’\ns point about the complexity of the system plays through to that. \nMy third thought echoes something I said earlier, \nwhich is that,\n yes, we would share a general aspiration that there was more joint budgeting between different services, but, to repeat, just by having joint budgets\n, it\n does not give you joint services\n and\n \ndoes \nn\not give you integrated services.\n \nT\nhat is, I think, the difficult bit. You can create joint budgets by saying you a\nre going to have joint budgets, but \nthe working on the ground that makes it feel different for the person who is elderly with com\nplex needs is more complicated and \ndifficult to do than just putting the money together.\nCouncillor Hall: \nA joint budget is the lever to transforming services.\nAndrew George: \nThat is fine.   \nChair: \nThank you very much. Thank you for bearing with us\n in\n \nthe \ngathering gloom on a November evening. We shall reflect on what you said and have a report, I guess, early in the new year.\n&#xa0;\n              \nOral evidence: Public expenditure on health and social care\n, HC\n 793\n              \n              \n32\n"
