[[[ Primary School]]] (Academy)A Research Report by Jacqui Elton &amp; Dr. Trevor Male, University of Hull.November, 2013&#xa0;Wold Primary School a mixed gender primary community school in the City of Hull which was placed in Special Measures following an Ofsted Inspection carried out under in November, 2012.  The school was rated at Grade 3 in three of the four categories in the new inspection framework.  Grade 3 was previously held to be indicative of broadly satisfactory performance, but is now a new category entitled “requiring improvement”.  The school had thus been moved from ‘satisafactory’ (Ofsted Inspection of 2011) to one ‘requiring improvement’ just one year later.  In addition to being placed in Special Measures the Secretary of State has also invoked the powers awarded to him through the amendments to the 2011 Education Act and Section 4 of the Academies Act of 2010 to make the school an academy.&#xa0;Following the Ofsted inspection the Local Authority suspended the governing body and appointed an Interim Executive Board (IEB).  No changes were made to the senior leadership team, but the school was partnered with a larger local primary school.  The main credentials of the partner primary included its geographical proximity, its “good” pronouncement from Ofsted in 2011 (albeit under the less stringent Ofsted School Inspection Framework) and a headteacher who was a Local Leader of Education and had already performed similar duties.   Additional funds were made available to support the improvements required and, whilst the control of the non school–to-school aspect of this budget was given to Wold, the enduring perception was that the partner primary school had obtained full and final control of the these funds.&#xa0;The research reported here is drawn from interviews with the governors, head teacher, senior leaders, and teachers, in other words “school facing” stakeholders rather than other user or client groups.  The principal researcher had been a member of the governing body of the school since 2009 and was able to secure the support of the both the headteacher and the Chair of Governors for this investigation. Whilst the main part of the field work commenced in January 2013, the researchers were also able to access participant data and documentation retrospectively, going back to the date of the Ofsted inspection in November 2012.&#xa0;This extract focuses on the evidence that demonstrates a negative impact caused to staff by the twin effects of the school being placed in special measures and the enforced academisation process that followed.&#xa0;

[[[The context of the school]]]Wold Primary School is larger than average size with 536 pupils aged 3 to 11 years.  Almost all pupils are of White British heritage with the proportion of pupils known to be eligible for the Pupil Premium being below average.  The proportions of pupils supported through School Action and School Action Plus are below average as is those with a statement of Special Educational Needs.   Although the school meets the current government floor standard, and has done for a number of years, there was some fluctuation in the most recent set of three year rolling averages of end of Key Stage (KS) results.   The 2011 KS1 and KS2 results for English (Reading and Writing) and Mathematics, which dipped below the national averages, were atypical of the school’s general historical trend of producing year on year improved results which maintained parity with rising national averages.  At the time of Ofsted inspection in 2012 the school’s assessment results demonstrated that the 2011 results were anomalous or merely a ‘blip’ in the upwards trajectory of improvement, but had not been posted on RaiseOnline.  The result was that Ofsted excluded the 2012 results during their inspection process and their subsequent determination of school performance was based on the data for years 2009-2011, inclusive of the unrepresentative 2011 data.&#xa0;Wold Primary School did not experience an ordinary and uneventful time between the Ofsted inspections of 2011 and 2012.  The Grade 3 awarded in the 2011 Ofsted report painted a picture for the school going forward and acknowledged that significant staffing difficulties of the previous two years had been resolved.  With a new senior leadership team having been recently appointed the conditions for “rapid improvement” had been noted (Ofsted, 2011: 13).  Unfortunately the school encountered severe budgetary pressures caused by an inherited, significant and otherwise unbeknown overspend on the budget leading the local authority to invoke their statutory powers to serve the governing body with a warning notice in relation to the future removal of the delegated budget should the deficit issue remain unaddressed.   This warning notice persisted even though the governors’ and headteacher’s efforts at the deficit reduction soon became successful.  Compelled to act therefore, the resolution of the financial situation led to a whole school restructuring exercise.  A number of support staff were made redundant in this process and many of those surviving the restructure did so the cost of a downgrading. The process was lengthy, time consuming and traumatic for all those involved.&#xa0;It was against this background experienced by governors and staff that the school was placed in special measures and enforced academisation.  The impact has seemingly caused significant damage to staff morale and confidence with feelings of injustice and inequality, particularly when comparing themselves to the partner school required under the relevant legislation.

[[[Methodology]]]The key research questions adopted were;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What were the perceptions of the “school facing” staff of the processes invoked as a result of the forced academisation process?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How have the processes of forced academisation affected each of the “school facing” key stakeholder groups?“School facing” is determined to be those charged with delivering the educational service to the user groups of the school. This consists of staff either employed by the LA (School Improvement Advisor) or Wold Primary School (teachers, support staff, SLT and the head teacher) and the school governors.    &#xa0;The key data collection methods employed consisted of the following;  &#xa0;&#xa0;Full access was granted to the principal researcher by the Chair of Governors and the headteacher and an interview schedule was agreed upon as equating to once per term for each of the main school staff groups.  Subsequently, however, as the governors had been removed by the LA in December 2012 and replaced with the IEB, only one interview was conducted with each of the governor participants as, unless they had some other role in the school, they would not be party to the unfolding processes.The key data collection tool employed was semi-structured interviews.  The selection of participants from each of the key stakeholder groups was originally envisaged at the outset of the research project is illustrated in Table 1.   A purposive participant selection strategy was combined with, in the tradition of qualitative research, those who demonstrated a willingness to participate.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Data results]]]Half Term 0.5

[[[:  ]]]In the first half term of Term 1 (HT 0.5) from January to February 2013, five teachers were interviewed.  Although by this stage, the school had been in special measures since November 2012 and the Governors had already “appointed” the new academy sponsors, this period saw the actual manifestation of the impact of the special measures processes rather than any substantial mass application of the forced academisation processes: the latter processes were instead, mainly directed at the headteacher and the IEB. This period could perhaps be best described as the “shock and awe” period for those involved.  &#xa0;The themes relevant for this submission which emerged during this phase (number of responses in brackets) were those of:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Personal ]]]There was a very large amount of teacher discussion, with four of the five commenting on how they felt the processes were impacting them in a personal capacity.  The following is typical of these responses:&#xa0;I think that there’s a lot of pressure put on people who then put pressure on you. Friendships and work relationships are very tense now, very very tense now and you go home and you take it all home now.  Before it was a team and a joy to work here and there were lots of smiles around. I used to look forward to coming to work - school used to be my outlet and I thrived, but now it’s not that, it’s  a grind and a burden.  I feel unduly singled out.  I feel flat, very flat at the moment.  I feel that my face doesn’t fit here anymore.  Everyone is looking after themselves and it’s all very unpleasant especially for someone like me who used to find work their escape.  I feel out of control. I feel like a pawn in a bigger game. You hope things will change and you think it’s just a period that you are going through, but it’s not. It’s going to be like this for quite awhile. It’s whether you are strong enough to ride it out. I don’t think that I am.  I feel completely exhausted. This is the first week I haven’t gone home and cried all week. It’s just horrendous.  Not a nice place to be in at the moment.  I feel like a failure right now and I can’t see anyway out of here.  It’s hard.  I feel stifled.  I feel like I’ve had all the stuffing kicked out of me.[Teacher comment]&#xa0;

[[[The involvement of Third Parties (LA and the partner primary)]]]All the teachers felt a sense of frustration and some (3/5) expressed more negative feelings at the extent of third party involvement in the school.  The comments centered on the belief that the partner primary and the local authority were often contradicting each other with the improvement advice they were giving, and there was also a sense that the advice conflicted with what the teachers had previously understood to be good practice.    &#xa0;Now there are eyes everywhere and that pressure will make you slip up and make you do things you wouldn’t normally do. Different people are telling you different things.  People say do it this way and then someone else says no, do it that way instead.  [The partner primary] are due to be observed aren’t they and they are expected to get an outstanding I think? I went to observe them, I’ve always been told, I think for 4 Year olds 10 minutes on the carpet is quite adequate – 35 minutes! They kept their children on the carpet for 35 minutes. Its too long - you are taught children off the carpet in 10 minutes, so 35 minutes on the carpet? It’s not what I’ve been taught. [Teacher comment]&#xa0;

[[[Second Half Term]]]

[[[ (HT 1)]]]

[[[      ]]]In the second half term, from March to April 2013, the school was in second stage of special measures processes and layered upon this, the forced academisation processes began to filter down to staff. This period could best be entitled as the “coming to terms with it all and getting on with it” phase of the processes. A further five new staff were interviewed in this phase, two teachers and three support staff.  The main themes (number of responses in brackets) which emerged during this phase included those of;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Academy Concerns]]]The main pre-occupation of all interviewed, but especially so for all the three support staff, was whether they would keep their jobs, whether they would be expected to do more for less and what might happen after the Academy no longer needed to follow statutory pay and conditions legislation.

[[[&#xa0;]]]It’s really about whether we keep our jobs isn’t it. Are we going to be in the same job are we going to keep the same pay? The same pay scale?  There could be some extra resources versus a job or not. If yes, where am I going to be put? But its what level are you going to be put, what status? It’s a worry if someone else brought in as the head teacher because they will not know you. But is it better the devil you know?  If you have to reapply, will you be on the same pay-scale and the same pay? Are they wanting more out of you for the same money or for less money.  [Support Staff #1 comment]&#xa0;Happy to work in the academy if offered a job, just happy to have a job. [Support Staff #1 comment]&#xa0;

[[[Being judged]]]Of responses obtained in this second half term the category which drew the most overall comment was that of being categorised on the Ofsted lesson evaluation scale and this reflected the notion that although Ofsted insist it is the lesson that is judged, in reality the teachers feel that they themselves are being judged.  The two teachers discussed concerns around the increased regime of lesson observations and the how difficult and unpleasant they found the process of being observed.  Surprisingly, even though the lesson gradings do not apply to the support staff, they still felt as if they did.  All the support staff who commented took the gradings as a reflection of their own performance, when in reality it is the teacher who takes the responsibility for the performance of the support staff in their lessons.&#xa0;There’s the added pressure, am I going it right. If you get “requires improvement” you think am I doing it wrong? Self doubt has crept in that wasn’t there before. [Support Staff comment]&#xa0;A colleague has been put on “Unsatisfactory”, there’s no way she’s “Unsatisfactory”, possibly “Requires Improvement” maybe. [Teacher comment] &#xa0;You suddenly start to realise that this is a game, there’s no way that was a “Requires Improvement” lesson [Teacher comment]&#xa0;

[[[Views relating to the professional self]]]Four of the five staff discussed at some considerable length how the processes were making them reflect on their professional selves and how this affected their hitherto held beliefs in their capabilities as competent or “good” teachers. One teacher explained how the staff had been told that teacher talk was no longer acceptable in lessons, other than in tiny and separated amounts, &#xa0;Sometimes now when I am talking I feel upset about the fact that I am talking and thinking. Oh no, am I really a bad teacher, I’m talking to my kids? That’s the effect it had, we’re all desperate not to talk to them now. [Teacher comment]  &#xa0;Both teachers gravitated towards the opinion that having been buffeted around by rapidly changing notions of “what is right” and “what works” in the early days coupled with the ever-present lesson observation regime, they had effectively lost their pedagogical compass and professional confidence.&#xa0;

[[[The Ofsted ]]]

[[[judgement]]]

[[[ itself]]]Even one half-term on, the staff were still vociferously contesting the Ofsted judgement.  Only one teacher said that they thought the judgment was relatively fair, with the remaining four interviewees reporting a strong belief that the Ofsted judgment was “wrong” and experiencing difficulty in believing that the school deserved its “failing” label.   &#xa0;I rated the school as a good, actually a really good school. I’m not an expert but I think the Ofsted judgement was unfair. It was harsh, very harsh! Staff work hard, plan, plan, plan and deliver good lessons.  I go all around the school and see all teacher lessons and some of the Ofsted judgment’s for lesson observations don’t make sense for me. The Ofsted judgements on the lesson observations aren’t fair. I see all the things they do with the children. [Support Staff comment]     &#xa0;November 20131&#xa0;
