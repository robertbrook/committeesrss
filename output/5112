[normal]Supplementary written evidence from Certsure (BRC 75)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for the opportunity to present t
[normal]o the Select Committee
[normal] regarding 
[normal]Electrical Safety and 
[normal]Part P of t
[normal]he B
[normal]uilding Regulation
[normal]s
[normal] on 6
[normal]th
[normal] January 2014
[normal].  During the 
[normal]discussion
[normal], you requested more information regarding the Quali
[normal]fied
[normal] Supervisor
[normal] (QS) role and how the number of QS required 
[normal]is decided. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To help with you
[normal]r
[normal] considerations I would 
[normal]like to make the following 
[normal]additional 
[normal]points:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One specific question we were asked 
[normal]by the Select Committee wa
[normal]s
[normal]:  How many operatives can one Qualified Supervisor adequate
[normal]ly
[normal] manage?
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]The level of management and supervision required is determined
[normal] after careful consideration during the 
[normal]initial and subsequent surveillance 
[normal]assessment 
[normal]process
[normal]es
[normal], 
[normal]where the assessor will determine 
[normal]the
[normal] number 
[normal]required 
[normal]by sampling, listening, questioning and 
[normal]observing during the assessment and by visiting a 
[normal]representative
[normal] sample
[normal] of sites where the 
[normal]work has been 
[normal]completed.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]This assessment include
[normal]s
[normal] the identification, evaluation, estimation of the levels of
[normal] risks involved
[normal],
[normal] their comparison against benchmarks and 
[normal]the 
[normal]type of work undertaken by 
[normal]the 
[normal]company
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he answer may be 
[normal]one 
[normal]QS 
[normal]or possibly
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] significant 
[normal]number
[normal], depending on the type
[normal], extent
[normal] and location of the
[normal] company
[normal]’s
[normal] 
[normal]work
[normal] and the number of locations from which it operates
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In conclusion w
[normal]e believe there is no objective evidence to suggest the QS system is not working and that to increase the costs and regulatory burden on electrical firms by insisting that all competent 
[normal]persons 
[normal]who may be currently undertaking work 
[normal]under the 
[normal]supervis
[normal]ion of
[normal] 
[normal]a QS
[normal] become registered is impractical
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]It 
[normal]would be costly 
[normal]and place additional burden on
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]industry and there is no evidence to suggest that a
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]additional 
[normal]safety benefit would be delivered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The current framework provides the opportunity for continuous improvement
[normal] and our suggestion to the 
[normal]Committee 
[normal]is that the guidance criteria used for deciding the number of QS is enshrined in the
[normal] M
[normal]inimum 
[normal]T
[normal]echnical 
[normal]Competency
[normal] requirement
[normal] 
[normal]imposed on the scheme operators by DCLG
[normal], ensuring 
[normal]a 
[normal]consistent application against agreed standards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope this provides the C
[normal]ommittee with 
[normal]further useful information and I 
[normal]am happy to expand on any of the points raised above at the Committee
[normal]’
[normal]s request.
