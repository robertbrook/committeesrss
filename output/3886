[normal]Written Evidence submitted Anonymously [CST0028][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This is my statement. I am able to provide compelling documentary irrefutable evidence that it is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I certainly feel I have far broader points to make as a result of my experience and in more ways than one. I wish to submit this evidence to the inquiry if only by way of sworn affidavit. With an unknown cyber stalker wandering the streets and a corrupt City of 
[normal]London
[normal] cop making death threats, I need to remain anonymous. This is not about investigating my personal case. It is part of the culture now endemic in all police forces across the
[normal]country.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is the result of my persistent challenging the Home Secretary and Home Office claims that crime is falling, that this enquiry is taking place. That will be a matter of record. I am sure unless the emails are deleted Teresa May and Home Office will have copies. This followed research that only 51% of all reported crime was recorded. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It must also be noted persuading victims to withdraw their allegations. Some victims have also been accused unfairly of making up incidents and then threatened with prosecution. In my case, and I am sure not in isolation, three City of 
[normal]London Police Officers
[normal] crossed the Redline. When I refused to drop the reported crime they used tactics so horrific it crosses that Redline. I am of the opinion this is their Modus Operandi and would have been used extensively on victims reporting crime and unwilling to withdraw the report of a crime. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I reported my cyber stalker who was using a Google Blog, knew where I lived, my movements and dress code to the City of 
[normal]London Police
[normal] following the advice of ACPO. Google HQ at 
[normal]Buckingham Palace Road
[normal] agreed to identify the blogger and the operating address to any serving police officer. It was a 10p local telephone call for the investigating team or they could have lodged an application for communications data’ form against Google’s communications’ provider. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The
[normal] three
[normal] officers involved did not do that. Although I was in constant touch with them by email, they unlawfully and illegally contacted my communications provider BT. They obtained my home address, my bank details and my ex-directory telephone number. I received an unsolicited telephone call from DS [name redacted] indicating they would not be investigating the crime I reported. If I continued with my threat to serve a high court mandamus on the City of 
[normal]London Police
[normal] forcing an investigation they knew where I lived. I have a CD recording of that conversation where they made overt death threats. 
[normal]A recorded copy can be obtained from the 
[normal]IPCC
[normal] Freedom of Information department.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I note you advi
[normal]c
[normal]e; - I quote! If you wish to make a complaint about individual police officers, then you need to contact the police force of which they are members. This is not about making a complaint to the committee about the police officers but supplying the evidence to the committee that my case has far reaching implications. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I can assure you that avenue is fully exploited. The Head of Professional Standards Department [name redacted] then entered into a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and found for the named police officers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I escalated the complaint to the 
[normal]IPCC
[normal] and the individual who managed the complaint accepted [name redacted]’s report supported by the application for communications form. That form was fraudulent and like the Hillsborough and 
[normal]Plebgate
[normal], falsified after the event.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My communications’ provider BT confirmed this verbally then in writing. BT legal department has no record of any request for my personal data. That means the form was never submitted. How many times has this happened to other victims reporting a crime?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Although the 
[normal]IPCC
[normal] individual dealing with my case and found for the named police officers rejecting my complaint, a 
[normal]IPCC
[normal] FOI release contradicts that individuals findings as was submitted in my original email to Mr Bernard 
[normal]Jenkin
[normal] and the other committee members.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]IPCC
[normal] files and City of 
[normal]London
[normal] files including the CD recording of the threatening conversation is available to the committee. I would suggest that you or a colleague
[normal] or the committee request those files.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I give my consent to the Chairman Dame Anne 
[normal]Owers
[normal] of 
[normal]IPCC
[normal], the Freedom of Information Department of the City of London Police, Tom Winsor HMCIC, the Home Secretary Teresa May and the Home Office to make all files and emails submitted my me in regard to this enquiry to be released to the Administration Committee if required.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am sure from what has been exposed that far from being about individual police officers it provides proof that this culture of frightening victims attempting to reporting and having crime investigated is endemic and scary 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I attach a copy of the underground news that may hold additional evidence and the committee members should have a printed copy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In 1966 as a serving Special Forced Officer [code name the Countryman] undercover in a London Pub the Black Raven, I witnessed the landlord [my elder brother by 10 years] hand to a uniformed police officer £20 in used notes. He was paying the Met for protection. £20 was average weeks pay in 1966 - £250 today.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I passed that intelligence to my MI5 contact, [name redacted]. The figures are now faded with time but 467 police officers came under investigation. Over 167 took immediate retirement. About 35 were disciplined.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In 1973 - 5 junior police officers were jailed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If someone had said then that I would still be exposing corrupt police officers in 47 years time, 2013 I would have LOL. I did not expect to live this long. I can tell you that [name redacted] went on in 1979 to be DG MI5. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For decades I have provided intelligence to the security services Pro Bono if I came across something of a threat to this country.
