[normal]‘New Relations between Local Authorities and Schools’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Executive Summary[bold]Academisation has changed the responsibilities and functions of local authorities
[normal] (LAs)
[normal] in resp
[normal]ect of their work with schools, yet they retain significant statutory responsibility for fair access to schooling, the needs of vulnerable children, school improvement and performance, and advocacy for parents, families and children. Their ability to act u
[normal]pon these responsibilities is affected by financial loss as schools convert to academies and central government cuts funding. 
[normal]The resultant climate is competitive, and in some cases, combative.
[normal]This paper reports on findings of case studies 
[normal]of
[normal] four 
[normal]LAs
[normal] wit
[normal]hin one region. Three of the authorities attempted to mitigate competition within the market-led environment, whereas one embraced it. 
[normal]The findings from the project of relevance to this project are divided into two themes: 1) 
[normal]Statutory responsibilities of
[normal] LAs and reduced financial resources
[normal], and 2) 
[normal]Confusion in functions and responsibilities
[normal] of LAs.
[normal]Even though academisation promotes school autonomy, LAs remain statutorily responsible for s
[normal]ome of the operations of academies, 
[normal](for example,
[normal] 
[normal]statutory assessment of SEN and the prosecution of non-attendees at school
[normal])
[normal]. While responsibilities for vulnerable children and many other serious concerns and issues come to the local authority, limited fi
[normal]nancial and human resources can cause significant oversights. A core 
[normal]function for the LA is 
[normal]the capacity to act 
[normal]on all concerns and issues that are brought to it by stakeholders
[normal]. 
[normal]Respondents from the four case studies all reported some element of confusion in respect of their responsibilities to schools. There are responsibilities enshrined in the statutes themselves that have not changed, against which Ofsted 
[normal]inspect
[normal] local authori
[normal]ties, yet different messages 
[normal]about school autonomy 
[normal]emerge from the Department for Education. 
[normal]These ambiguities are exacerbated when schools are transitioning to academy status, and also impact upon an LA’s capacity to offer a stable 
[normal]set of
[normal] service
[normal]s for cru
[normal]cial functions like school improvement
[normal]. 
[normal]Conclusion[bold]This research suggests that a market economy of schooling and services to schools impacts upon local authorities’ capacity to meet the needs of disadvantaged children and young people. LAs need the financ
[normal]ial and human resources to respond to the issues that come to them. As inequalities within society increase, there will be greater demand placed upon LAs to respond to the needs of children.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is
[normal] a lack of clarity around role and
[normal] responsibility in the interactions betwee
[normal]n schools and local authorities
[normal],
[normal] and also 
[normal]within 
[normal]external relationships
[normal].
[normal] While a simple solution to the ambiguit
[normal]ies
[normal] may appear to be more clearly defining lines of accountability, I think there is a deeper problem 
[normal]to be resolved. Current policies impacting upon the education and care of children emphasise competition, including the academies programme, forcing school
[normal]s and LAs to compete for custom
[normal] and authority
[normal], 
[normal]work
[normal]ing
[normal] against co-operati
[normal]on
[normal] or community engagement. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The expansion of the academies programme 
[normal]since 2010 has resulted in a profound reconfiguration of the responsibilities and functions of local authorities in respect of the
[normal]ir
[normal] work 
[normal]with 
[normal]schools. 
[normal]Through
[normal] 
[normal]The Academies Act
[normal] (2010)
[normal] and 
[normal]The 
[normal]Schools White Paper
[normal] (2010) 
[normal]governing and management bodies of academies have new responsibilities that previously had been responsib
[normal]ilities within
[normal] the
[normal] local authority
[normal], including 
[normal]greater school-level control over finances and expenditure
[normal]. 
[normal]Yet Local 
[normal]Authorities
[normal] (LAs)
[normal] still retain important responsibilities in respect of schooling including:
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]Ensuring there is fair access to schooling
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]Supporting vulnerable children
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]Improving the performance of schools and ensuring high standards  
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]Using their de
[normal]mocratic mandate to advocate for parents, families and children 
[normal](DfE, 2010; Parish, Baxter and Sandals, 2012). 
[normal]The capacity of LAs to enact these responsibilities
[normal] is
[normal] affected by significant funding cuts to their formula grants (Stabe &amp; Jones, 2011), but 
[normal]also financial loss as schools convert to academies. A
[normal]cademisation 
[normal]has resulted in
[normal] pro
[normal]found
[normal] change
[normal]s to
[normal] how 
[normal]LA
[normal]s recognise and enact responsibilities for disadvantaged children in 
[normal]academy 
[normal]schools, 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]changes in financing have
[normal] also affected how local authori
[normal]ties relate to maintained schools. Furthermo
[normal]re, the promotion of autonomous
[normal] school
[normal]s has created a competitive 
[normal]environment 
[normal]that works against the best interests of disadvantaged children, making the job of the local authority to ensure the needs of the most
[normal] vulnerable are met much more difficult. 
[normal]An LA Senior Manager
[normal] with strategic responsibility for services to schools 
[normal]claimed that 
[normal]within her LA 
[normal]where 44% of schools are academies, 
[normal]relationships between schools had become “combative”
[normal] as a result of competition.  
[normal]Different 
[normal]LAs
[normal] have trialled different solutions to changes in their resource, but within four 
[normal]recent 
[normal]case studies
[normal] of LAs
[normal] each had made immense moves away from statutory provision as a norm. Of the four 
[normal]LAs
[normal] only one fully embr
[normal]aced a competitive market model to achieve its statutory responsibility to the social good, whereas the other local authorities have differently attempted to mitigate the challenges of a competitive environment so they may enact this responsibility. This h
[normal]as been through the following mechanisms:

[normal]Holding onto a limited statutory provision (although in light of recent funding cuts this is unlikely to continue)
[normal];

[normal]1.1 Evidential basis of the report[bold]This r
[normal]eport 
[normal]draws upon findings from the ‘New Relations between Local Authorities and Schools’ study to 
[normal]present evidence 
[normal]that addresses the terms of reference of this select committee inquiry in respect of the functions and responsibilities of local authorities. The report presents findings 
[normal]from this study 
[normal]that 
[normal]addresses 
[normal]t
[normal]he functions and responsibilities in relation to acad
[normal]emies and free schools of local authorities operating between the Secretary o
[normal]f State and individual schools, and considers the significance of these findings for determining
[normal] 
[normal]what these functions
[normal] and responsibilities should be. 
[normal]The study has focused upon four 
[normal]LAs
[normal] from within a single region looking at how their relationships with schools have changed as a result of structural reform in the schooling sector.

[normal]2.1[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] Statutory[bold] [bold]responsibilities [bold]of LAs[bold] [bold]and reduced financial resources[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]LAs report 
[normal]external 
[normal]perceptions that they are no longer responsible for schooling generally, and academy schools in particular, 
[normal]within this environment of apparently autonomous schools 
[normal]even though they retain statutory responsibility for fairness in school access, sc
[normal]hool performance, vulnerable children and advocacy for children, parents and families. 
[normal]LAs reported duties that they performed for both maintained and academy schools out of their central resource, including statutory assessment of SEN and the prosecution 
[normal]of non-attendees at school. 
[normal]An LA strategic manager within a considerably reduced core team
[normal] after adopting a competitive market model of service
[normal] 
[normal]reported 
[normal]that in spite of reform 
[normal]“…where I’m sitting it feels very much the same because all the issues and con
[normal]cerns, whether they’re about academies or not, come into us.”
[normal] 
[normal]This respondent also stressed the
[normal] very
[normal] important role LAs 
[normal]need to 
[normal]play in taking responsibility for excluded and vulnerable children and young people. 
[normal]Yet this respondent also said: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We’ve got two children 
[normal][from an overseas country] 
[normal]found strapped to the bottom of a lorry…  And we've got a whole range of services now working, sorting those children o
[normal]ut.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hey’re in foster care, getting them into school, the right support services. They’
[normal]re very homesick; trying to make contact with their families. All that stuff is really important. 
[normal]And we are doing it a bit on a shoestring I have to say at the moment [bold](
[normal]interview 
[normal]11 April 2013
[normal], brackets 
[normal]and emphasis added 
[normal]by researcher
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A
[normal]n Ofsted
[normal] report 
[normal]from an LA inspection from the same region was
[normal] 
[normal]released 
[normal]shortly after this interview
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]raising
[normal] 
[normal]serious 
[normal]concerns about child protection services
[normal]. It
[normal] 
[normal]claimed
[normal] that
[normal] within the inspected LA
[normal] “there are systemic weaknesses in managerial oversight and quality assurance that enable inconsistent and ineffective practice to go unchallenged and as a consequence some children and young people are exposed to unnecessary risk of significant harm”
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]T
[normal]his
[normal] was also an
[normal] LA
[normal] that had also adopted a fiercely competitive market model of services for children and young people
[normal], drawing upon the financial backing and commercial experience of a corporate partner
[normal]. 
[normal]The more market orientated LA in my study has adopt
[normal]ed a position of broker between service providers and schools. The LAs who have attempted to mitigate the effects of competition because it 
[normal]fragments 
[normal]co-operation amongst schools or works against the interests of the most disadvantaged 
[normal]remain located
[normal] 
[normal]withi
[normal]n market relations. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The solution
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]for survival within a market economy of services to schools for
[normal] 
[normal]all the case study
[normal] LA
[normal]s
[normal] has been 
[normal]the
[normal] disestablish
[normal]ment of
[normal] 
[normal]provision
[normal] within the LA
[normal], and move towards commissioning model
[normal]s to fulfil statutory duties
[normal]. 
[normal]The model
[normal] within one of the LAs 
[normal]aimed
[normal] predominantly 
[normal]to 
[normal]commission services 
[normal]for disadvantaged children and young people 
[normal]from school
[normal] providers
[normal]. The other three
[normal] LAs had developed some form of traded service
[normal] based upon their disestablished statutory service provision
[normal], in one case retaining a 20% interest in a joint venture established in partnership with a large corporate backer, and in the two other cases developing business units within the local authority. 
[normal]Service provision as a core function of the LAs is almost n
[normal]on-existent, and the traded services are offered to both maintained and academy schools.
[normal] This le
[normal]aves
[normal] LAs trying to account for differences in their commitments to maintained schools compared with academies. In many cases there remains little difference.
[normal] 
[normal]Ye
[normal]t some LA responde
[normal]nts argue there is a difference
[normal] in quality of service between statutory and traded provision. 
[normal]A respondent who at the time of interview retained a position within a small 
[normal]statutory provision 
[normal]unit within
[normal] an
[normal] LA
[normal] 
[normal]under threat of becoming a fu
[normal]lly traded service 
[normal]said
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It’s not a foregone conclusion that commissioning
[normal] out and putting things to arm’s length
[normal] will diminish the service, but I think there is a fear that it could
[normal]…
[normal]Certainly in practical terms, I can see that if I and my colleagues are 
[normal]commissioned out, then a lot of the stuff that just lands on your desk on a day-to-day basis I’m really concerned about who will do that?  If I’m commissioned to do specific things I will do those specific things, I will become a traded service. Who will p
[normal]ick up all the little incidental things which if they’re not picked up sometimes become huge things.  Personally I have fears about that, and I know that most of the colleagues I work closely with have fears about that as well
[normal]…
[normal]we are really genuinely worri
[normal]ed about it in terms of the service that the schools, families and children will be receiving
[normal] (Interview 16 May 2013)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Confusion in functions and responsibilities[bold] of LAs[bold]Respondents from the four case studies all reported some element of confusion in respect of their responsibilities to schools. There are responsibilities enshri
[normal]ned in the statutes themselves
[normal] that have not changed, against which Ofsted intend inspecting loc
[normal]al authorities, 
[normal]yet
[normal] different messages 
[normal]emerge
[normal] from the Department for Education. 
[normal]…We’ve got Sir Michael Wilshaw in Ofsted saying, “We’re going to inspect the local authorities and you are responsible for outcomes for all children, even if it’s in academie
[normal]s and free schools; it’s down to you to sort out how you negotiate that space with the academies”. We’ve got the DfE saying, “Actually schools are autonomous, they’re out of local authority control” (interview 11 April 2013).
[normal]This
[normal] ambiguity
[normal] has practical i
[normal]mplications for 
[normal]LAs when 
[normal]rationalising services and
[normal] managing
[normal] their costs. For example, when discussing statutory provision of Governor Services in one case study LA I was told:  
[normal]We looked into this quite carefully and in fact we asked our legal department
[normal] to look into exactly what the Local Authority was obliged to provide but it was not easy to discern. In the end the Local Authority believes that the induction training that we are providing for new Governors and new Chairs of Governors is something that 
[normal]we are obliged to provide (interview 16 April 2013).
[normal]For the main part,
[normal] 
[normal]the case study 
[normal]LAs seem to be minimising commitments to statutory provision
[normal],
[normal] particularly in respect of academies
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]However, they are still engaged in a transitional situation. One res
[normal]pondent drew attention to differences between sponsored and converter academies in relation to her LA’s responsibility for school improvement. She pointed out that the LA was likely to be already working with schools who were becoming sponsored academies, 
[normal]and that the LA was taking the lead in supporting the conversion process. 
[normal]T
[normal]he sponsor in my view should be wholly involved in the period up until conversion, and my experience is that they’re quite reluctant to do that.  Obviously they will do the TUPE
[normal] a
[normal]nd the statutory stuff that has to be done to keep the processes moving along, but in terms of school improvement, particularly in trying to raise achievement or trying to improve the quality of teaching, it’s quite difficult to get them involved until the
[normal] actual co
[normal]nversion date has taken place. 
[normal]That I don’t think is in the best interests of the school. 
[normal](Interview 16 May 2013)
[normal]This situation is further complicated because the sponsored academies are generally in a position where they are being ‘forced’ to c
[normal]onvert. Schools dislike this situation, and so it seems do the LAs in my case studies. 
[normal]We’re pretty consistent there because one of the things that I don’t think anyone is comfortable with is this whole concept of forced academies. And we’ve had quite int
[normal]eresting exchanges with the DfE about this, because they’ve come down with a hit list of schools and say, right this where you’ve g
[normal]ot to do this. I think issuing 
[normal]warning notices and things
[normal]…
[normal]But our principle has always been that if a school is going to convert, unless it’s absolutely failing and it’s on its knees – and we don’t have schools like that in 
[normal][this LA]
[normal] at the moment – then it’s something you negotiate with the governors. 
[normal](interview
[normal] 11 April 2013)
[normal]Furthermore, 
[normal]a
[normal] respondent suggested that sponsored
[normal] ac
[normal]ademies were a threat to the LA
[normal] maintaining a school improvement service, even as a traded service since “the more schools that are forced academies, I think they are less likely to buy b
[normal]ack because if you are a sponsored academy you will have your budget top-sliced by your sponsor for school improvement, so why would you then find another pot of money to buy local authority school improvement?” 
[normal](Interview 16 May 2013)
[normal]3[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Conclusions[bold]The LAs 
[normal]reported in this study recognise their statutory responsibilities for disadvantaged children. However, recent structural reforms are impacting in various ways on their capacity to act upon these responsibilities. This research suggests that 
[normal]a market econom
[normal]y of schooling and services to schools impacts upon local authorities’ capacity to meet the needs of disadvantaged children and young people. LAs need the financial and human resources to respond to the issues that come to them. As inequalities within soci
[normal]ety increase, there will be greater demand placed upon LAs
[normal] to respond to the needs of children.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]reported study i
[normal]ndicates that there remains a considerable lack of clarity around role and
[normal] responsibility 
[normal]in the interactions between 
[normal]schools and local 
[normal]authorities
[normal] 
[normal]and also through external relations
[normal]hips
[normal] with governmental bodies such as Ofsted. While a simple solution to
[normal] the
[normal] ambiguity may appear to be more clearly de
[normal]fining lines of accountability, 
[normal]I 
[normal]think
[normal] there is a deeper problem to be resolved
[normal]. Current 
[normal]policies impacting upon the education and care of children emphasise competition, including the academies programme, forcing schools and
[normal] LAs to compete for custom
[normal]. While three of the four case studies reported upon in this paper are attempting to mitigate 
[normal]the
[normal] competitive 
[normal]conditions, the evidence suggests that external pressures such as funding and central accountability 
[normal]are 
[normal]work
[normal]ing
[normal] against
[normal] their attempts at
[normal] co-operati
[normal]on
[normal] or
[normal] supporting
[normal] community 
[normal]engagement
