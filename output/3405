defaultI am submitting this evidence from a personal viewpoint of the owner of a small electrical company de
defaultaling primarily on a day to day business with domestic electrical installation.

defaultSpecifically I would like to deal with the points of concern the Committee have expressed an interest in.

default“Tdefaulthe extent to which members of the public are aware of the competent persons scheme and that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulationsdefault.”default&#xa0;defaultThe public
default have
default some awareness of The Competent Persons Scheme, but as very little enforcement takes place, I have found that most members of the public see it as a paperwork exercise rather than a legal requirement. In summary, they simply do not take it a
defaults a
default serious pi
defaultece of legislation, and are unlikely to until the scheme is enforced and publicised more widely.

default“Tdefaulthe extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations and the extent to which aldefaultl those working for a company are broughtdefault up to the same level of skills.”default&#xa0;default“Tdefaulthe extent to which those carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply, review or have their work reviewed to ensure that it meets the defaultrequirements of thdefaulte Regulations.”default&#xa0;default“Tdefaulthe adequacy of the review of electrical works carried out by Competent defaultPersons.”default&#xa0;defaultIf requirements for membership to Competent Perso
defaultns Scheme beco
defaultme too onerous, complicated and above all expensive, s
defaultmall local companies like my own
default will simply be driven out of business. I had to prove competence upon original registration and am checked yearly
default on quality management, knowledge and competence. This i
defaults way above the requirements of
default other construction trades
default and demonstrates the high le
defaultvel of competence required
default.  A
defaultdding further costs 
defaultand administration 
defaultnot only 
defaultdisproportionately 
defaultburdens small businesses, but 
defaultthe cost will ultimately be passed onto customers.
default I
default see no real evidence
default to change the current scheme
default, as the membership require
defaultment is already set at a high level compared to other trades.
default Indeed, the “communities” aspect of DCLG simply becomes meaningless if local communities lose 
defaultsmall local companies due to excessive and burdensome regulation issued by DCLG.
default&#xa0;

default“Tdefaulthe effect of comdefaultpetition between accreditation bodies, and the two separate registers of electricians, on the standards of review of domestic electrical workdefault.”default&#xa0;defaultCompe
defaultti
defaulttion between accreditation bodies is no bad thing as it allows electricians to make a choice between 
defaultbodies
default,
default and choose the one they feel provides them with the best value and support for their particular aspect of the 
defaultelectrical 
defaulttrade.
defaultThere should be no ambiguity between standards of review if all bodies meet UKAS requirements.
defaultWhat is wrong
default with 
defaultthe 
defaultcu
defaultrrent situation is the existence of two registers which is only going to confuse the public. There should be one register for all 
defaultmembers of 
defaultcompetent 
defaultpersons schemes. If certain accreditation bodies do not want to “join in” with the establishment of a sin
defaultgle register then they should be removed from accreditation scheme.
default This is a simple fix to a currently confusing situation for members of the general public.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default“defaultTdefaulthe adequacy of the supervision by DCLG of the accreditation schemes.default”defaultI can see no problems 
defaultwith the supervision of the accreditation schemes. The current problem is the lack of enforcement of the current rules by Local Authority Building Control departments
default (LABC’s)
default.
default Whilst these departments have a clear overview of 
defaultnew build projects, they have
default little
default oversight of what work is being carried out within existing dwellings; and this is where the majority of “under the radar / cash in hand / non Part P compliant work” is being carried out.
default LABC departments should be carrying out spot checks on refur
defaultbishments of existing dwellings to ensure compliance with the current rules 
defaultis
default being adhered to, and taking action against those found to be avoiding compliance.
