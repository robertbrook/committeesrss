&#xa0;&#xa0;I should like to give my views on the flagrant bias shown by the BBC – it really should be renamed as the Labour Broadcasting Corporation!   Over the past few years it has steadily got worse, with bias evident both in TV and radio content.  Radio comedy programmes such as The News Quiz and The One Show are examples.  Morning news features on Radio 4 have also shown a strong left-leaning bias.The Corporation seems to be stuffed with employees who are obviously much sympathetic to leftist views such as those published in the Guardian newspaper.  Recent criticisms of actions by the Guardian in publishing facts almost certainly detrimental to the country’s security were scarcely mentioned on BBC TV and radio news programmes.  Emphasis has long been on ‘savage Tory cuts’, and if there occurs anything that could be seen as detrimental to the Tory party it is pounced upon gleefully by the news team!BBC interviewers tend to be hard on those holding right-wing views but very soft on those holding left-wing views.  Left-wing interviewees are generally afforded more air-time than their right-wing counterparts.The BBC seems to be accountable to no-one when large pay-offs and expensive relocation plans of dubious value are implemented.BBC bias seems to be increasing rather than decreasing and I feel it is wrong for the nation to have to pay a Licence Fee to fund such propaganda broadcasting.  The BBC should be an impartial organisation, as once it was!&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;
