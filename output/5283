[normal]T
[normal]his evidence 
[normal]is submitted 
[normal]in relation to 
[normal]the pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Wales Bill. 
[normal]I am 
[normal]happy to elaborate on this evidence in person should the 
[normal]Welsh A
[normal]ffairs Committee 
[normal]consider that to be of value.
[normal]Focus of [bold]submission[bold] [bold]2
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]The evidence focuses on Part O
[normal]ne of the Bill (‘The Assembly an
[normal]d Welsh Government’).  
[normal]It draws upon my 
[normal]on-going
[normal] research on devolution, relating 
[normal]specifically 
[normal]to the capacity of the National Assembly for Wales (Assembly). It also uses
[normal] evidence 
[normal]submitted to the Commission on Devolution in Wales
[normal] (the Silk Commission) from 
[normal]the Study of Parliament Wales Group
[normal]. The 
[normal]submission focuses on 
[normal]the enduring issue of the Assembly’s 
[normal]capacity
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]as I 
[normal]regard 
[normal]this 
[normal]as critical to 
[normal]the 
[normal]scrutiny of the Bill
[normal] and its intended outcomes
[normal].

[normal]              
[normal]My 
[normal]submission 
[normal]contextualises 
[normal]P
[normal]a
[normal]rt O
[normal]ne of the Bill against 
[normal]the 
[normal]long-standing 
[normal]capacity
[normal] challenges that the Assembly faces
[normal]. This is a fundamental constraint that 
[normal]frames the context for 
[normal]the Assembly’s 
[normal]current 
[normal]operation
[normal], as well 
[normal]and 
[normal]many of 
[normal]the issues that 
[normal]are 
[normal]raise
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]in connection with the operation
[normal], public profile and acceptance 
[normal]of devolution in Wales
[normal].
[normal] Various pieces of r
[normal]ecent
[normal] published research by
[normal] 
[normal]our team at the University of Liverpool (
[normal]McAllister
[normal], Cole, Stirbu) 
[normal]rehearse
[normal] these issues in some depth
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]M
[normal]atters relating to Assembly size 
[normal]are highlighted here 
[normal]as these are especially relevant 
[normal]to Part O
[normal]ne
[normal], S
[normal]ection 2 of the Bill
[normal]:
[normal] “Rem
[normal]oval of restriction on standing for election for both constituency and electoral region”. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Moreover, the fundamental issue of capacity 
[normal]also relates to Part T
[normal]wo of the Bill, as these additional financial and fiscal re
[normal]s
[normal]po
[normal]n
[normal]s
[normal]i
[normal]bilities are framed by a desire f
[normal]or greater accountability. Without
[normal] the resources
[normal] to
[normal] properly
[normal] scrutinise and mana
[normal]ge these powers, that objective is unlikely to be fulfilled.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Assembly size[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]              
[normal]By 
[normal]all the evidence and 
[normal]by 
[normal]any international comparison, the Assembly is a very small 
[normal]institution
[normal] indeed
[normal]. 
[normal] W
[normal]ith just 60 elected members, i
[normal]t has fewer elected politicians than small US states such as Utah (73 members), North Dakota (94 members), Vermont (148 members) and Maine (151 members). 
[normal]The 
[normal]Assembly 
[normal]has fewer politicians 
[normal]than ‘small’ Ge
[normal]rman Lander
[normal],
[normal] such as Bremen (with 83 members) and Saxony Anhalt (97 members). 
[normal]The average size of national parliaments 
[normal]within the EU with 
[normal]populations of between 1-6
[normal] 
[normal]million 
[normal]citizens 
[normal]is 
[normal]approximately 
[normal]141 
[normal]elected 
[normal]members.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]              
[normal]Within the UK context, the Asse
[normal]mbly is less than half the size of the Scottish Parliament (129 MSPs) and substantially smaller than the Northern Ireland Assembly (with 108 MLAs), which has a population half the size of Wales. The 
[normal]Assembly has fewer 
[normal]politicians than many Welsh local 
[normal]authorities
[normal]: 
[normal]Cardiff 
[normal]Council 
[normal]has 75 councillors
[normal],
[normal] and Swansea has 72. 
[normal]In 2004
[normal],
[normal] when the Assembly’s powers were much more constrained, the Richard Commission advocated an increase to 80 AMs
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]              
[normal]It 
[normal]is frequently 
[normal]said that the 
[normal]matter
[normal] of Assembly size should
[normal] not be addressed whilst public disengagement with elected politicians remains high
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]against a 
[normal]context of economic recession
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]o the contrary, without consideration of 
[normal]the 
[normal]appropriate number of AMs, the capacity challenges which the Assembly currently faces are likely to be exacerbated by new powers 
[normal]over taxation and borrowing
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In turn, 
[normal]matters of capacity 
[normal]affect
[normal] negatively public confidence and support for the institution, 
[normal]as well as challenging many of the fundamental principles 
[normal]that 
[normal]we 
[normal]have set out
[normal] above.
[normal] 
[normal]Furthermore, the 
[normal]Assembly Commission
[normal] has a s
[normal]trategic goal to engage with the people of Wales by encouraging 
[normal]greater 
[normal]interest in the 
[normal]Assembly’s 
[normal]work and facilitating involvement with 
[normal]the 
[normal]legislative 
[normal]process
[normal]. 
[normal]For this to happen, there needs to be 
[normal]first, 
[normal]greater
[normal] 
[normal]clarity and intelligibility
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]also, 
[normal]sufficient
[normal] politicians to discharge 
[normal]the Assembly’s
[normal] duties effectively.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]              
[normal]We have argued elsewhere 
[normal](Cole, McAllister and Stirbu
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]2013) 
[normal]that
[normal] the
[normal] size of the A
[normal]ssembly
[normal] 
[normal]is at
[normal] the heart of many of 
[normal]its 
[normal]capacity 
[normal]challenges
[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]negative 
[normal]impact on 
[normal]scrutiny and on developing 
[normal]effective committee work is considerable. 
[normal] 
[normal]In particular, 
[normal]matters of capacity were 
[normal]assoc
[normal]iated with the intensive workload of the Third Assembly and driving and constraining changes to the system of committee scrutiny in the Fourth. 
[normal]The small s
[normal]ize
[normal] also places a substantive burden on the political parties to select candidates of the highest cal
[normal]ibre because the presence of more than
[normal] a handful of
[normal] less effective membe
[normal]rs can quickly become a serious
[normal] weakness. In contrast, larger-scale institutions such as the House of Commons or the Scottish Parliament can easily absorb the diverse skills range and 
[normal]experience of elected members into the overall mix of roles that any legislature furnishes.
[normal] 
[normal]In Wales since 2006, t
[normal]his 
[normal]has been exacerbated by the
[normal] ban on standing for election on both constituency and electoral region ballots.
[normal]9.
[normal]              
[normal]Our research has 
[normal]made various 
[normal]suggestions for addressing capacity weaknesses in the Assembly
[normal], 
[normal]acknowledging that 
[normal]some clearly address the symptoms rather than the causes
[normal] of the problem
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Changes to the dual candidacy ban
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Government of Wales Act, 2006 introduced a prohibition on “dual candidacy”, that is candidates standing for election in the constituencies and on the regional list simultaneously. This is an anomaly and out of line with virtually all other Additional M
[normal]ember Systems (AMS). Furthermore, it has a serious impact on capacity with regard to quality of candidates that parties might put up (and, therefore, of elected AMs). The Wales Office Green Paper (2012) 
[normal]on future electoral arrangements for the National Ass
[normal]embly for Wales
[normal] [bold](
[normal]http://www.walesoffice.gov.uk/have-your-say-2/
[normal]) suggested removing the ban
[normal] saying that the
[normal] UK Government believes: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“that, in principle, candidates should not be barred from standing for election simultaneously in an Assembly constituency and an Assembly region. It impacts disproportionally on smaller parties, who would understandably not wish to risk their smaller pool
[normal] of candidates in a constituency election when there may be a chance they could be elected from the regional list. Likewise, if a party does better than expected in constituency elections, candidates on that party’s regional list are unlikely to be elected
[normal]. The prohibition on dual candidacy may, in time, have a negative effect on representation in the Assembly as high quality candidates who stand as constituency candidates, but who fail to secure that seat, are lost to the Assembly because of the “all or no
[normal]thing” choice they are required to make.” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I agree
[normal] entirely
[normal] with the removal of the restriction in the draft Bill
[normal].
[normal] The ban introduced in 2006 was ill-advised and has affected 
[normal]both 
[normal]capacity and calibre
[normal],
[normal] especially given the 
[normal]split 
[normal]between list and constitue
[normal]ncy seats in the Welsh system. 
[normal]In other nations that use similar Additional Mixed 
[normal]Member 
[normal]Systems (AMS), there is no such restriction. Indeed, a 
[normal]recent Electoral Commission 
[normal]report 
[normal]in New Zealand rejected a ban
[normal],
[normal] as did the Arbuthnot
[normal]t
[normal] Commission in Scotland. 
[normal]Issues about mandate and procedures 
[normal]between constituency and regional members 
[normal]have been successfully resolved elsewhere
[normal],
[normal] and there is 
[normal]no reason to think W
[normal]ales is different in this regard.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Increasing the number of AMs 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]It is hard to disprove that substan
[normal]tial capacity constraints arise from having such a relatively small number of AMs. Any longitudinal
[normal] review of devolution in
[normal] Wales 
[normal]and strategic planning for the future of the Assembly 
[normal]means that at some stage the
[normal] core
[normal] capacity issues will 
[normal]have to be addressed, otherwise there 
[normal]will be an inevitable
[normal] continued impact on the profile, effectiveness and legitimacy of the Assembly
[normal]. 
[normal]It is, however, critical to consider the number of politicians representing Wales and its localities in the round, th
[normal]at is at European, UK, national and local level.
[normal] Equally, it lends weight to Section 3 of Part One of the Bill which rightly prohibits the holding of a seat in both the UK Parliament and the Assembly.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Research undertaken by McAllister (
[normal]in 
[normal]2008-9
[normal], whilst 
[normal]working with the Independent Panel on AMs Pay and Support
[normal]) and Cole et al (2013) 
[normal]has 
[normal]examined alternatives to 
[normal]increasing the finite number of AMs. It should be noted that each of these is far from perfect as they are essentially temporary solutions to symp
[normal]toms of a core problem.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Shorter-term alternatives: 
[normal]Assembly
[normal] A
[normal]ssociates
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is 
[normal]some 
[normal]merit in considering the appointment of a small number of individuals to serve on Assembly committees with the paramount objective of enhancing opportunities for 
[normal]scrutiny.  Such a proposal would build on practice
[normal] already underway
[normal] in local authorities, where scrutiny committees often appoint independent members 
[normal]as a means of 
[normal]enhanc
[normal]ing
[normal] capacity (Wilson and Game
[normal], 2011). The suggestion for Assembly Associates was raise
[normal]d by McAllister in research papers provided for the Independent Panel on AMs Pay and Support (2008-9) and in recent work on Assembly capacity with Cole et al (2013). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Such Associates 
[normal]might each serve for no more than four years and would have an unpaid an
[normal]d non-voting status. 
[normal]As well as 
[normal]augment
[normal]ing
[normal] in
[normal]ternal
[normal] expertise
[normal] for effective scrutiny
[normal], this
[normal] would have the added bonus of presenting greater 
[normal]diversity and experience to the 
[normal]work of the 
[normal]Assembly.  
[normal]Of course, there are 
[normal]difficulties with this suggestion
[normal] especially 
[normal]with regard to 
[normal]democratic legitimacy: Cole et al (2013)
[normal] suggest that it would not be appropriate to appoint more
[normal] than
[normal] six 
[normal]at any one time to ensure that 
[normal]elected AMs 
[normal]would 
[normal]retain at least a 10-1 ratio.
[normal] Although this is an interesting
[normal] 
[normal]innovation,
[normal] clearly it is an experimental one and one moreover, that is wholly unfamiliar to a UK parliamentary context. In addition, 
[normal]the 
[normal]likely financial 
[normal]differential between
[normal] 
[normal]pursuing
[normal] one of these routes 
[normal]or
[normal] having more directly AMs is minimal
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]‘Overhang’ seats
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A m
[normal]echanism for providing additional AMs without formally increasing the size of the Assembly 
[normal]could
[normal] lie in the concept of ‘
[normal]o
[normal]verhang seats’ (used in the New Zealand Parliament, the German Bundestag and the National Assembly of Venezuela). The need for ‘overhan
[normal]g seats’ arises when a party in a Mixed Member Electoral System wins 
[normal]more constituency seats than its share of seats determined by the party vote (that is, its overall proportional entitlement). In such cases, the extra seats are not normally removed, rath
[normal]er the number of representatives in parliament increases just for the life of that parliament, so adding to its capacity (Soberg Shugart and Wattenberg, 2003; National Assembly Independent Review Panel, 2009). 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Other[bold] sections[bold] of the Bill[bold]I agree 
[normal]with 
[normal]and support sections 3, 
[normal]4 and 5 of Part O
[normal]ne of the Bill. Any future changes to 
[normal]the Assembly’s electoral arrangements should only be made with the Assembly’s consent
[normal].
