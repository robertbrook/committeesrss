[[[The Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP)]]] was established in 2008 to advance public and private action on climate change through rigorous, innovative research. The Centre is hosted jointly by the University of Leeds and the London School of Economics and Political Science. It is funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council and Munich Re. More information about the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy can be found at: http://www.cccep.ac.uk&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment ]]]was established in 2008 at the London School of Economics and Political Science. The Institute brings together international expertise on economics, as well as finance, geography, the environment, international development and political economy to establish a world-leading centre for policy-relevant research, teaching and training in climate change and the environment. It is funded by the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, which also funds the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London. More information about the Grantham Research Institute can be found at: http://www.lse.ac.uk/grantham/&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;This policy paper is intended to inform decision-makers in the public, private and third sectors.

How should its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low-carbon innovation, and how should it measure success?-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How should the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low-carbon innovation will be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1 UK public funding for low-carbon innovation has reduced annually since the Government spending review in 2010 (National Audit Office, 2013). Research by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment suggests that the current level of public funding for low-carbon innovation, and the way in which it is targeted, is insufficient to achieve the UK’s legally-binding 2050 emissions reduction targets at the lowest possible cost.&#xa0;

[[[ of support for low-carbon innovatio]]]

[[[n in the UK]]]2.2 The key finding of a recent research project by the Grantham Research Institute (Aghion et al., 2012) is that there is a strong path dependency which determines the direction of innovation. Businesses which have innovated in low-carbon technologies in the past, and which are exposed to more low-carbon innovation in the economy, are more likely to direct their research activities towards low-carbon innovation in the future. Similarly, businesses with a history of ‘dirty’ innovation, and which are located in economies that are more specialised in ‘dirty’ innovation, are more likely to focus on it in the future.&#xa0;2.3 Since today’s stock of ‘dirty’ innovation is much greater than that of clean innovation, the path dependency effect tends to lock economies into high-carbon research and high-carbon emissions technologies, even after the introduction of a mild carbon pricing mechanism or research and development subsidies for clean innovation.&#xa0;2.4 This highlights the desirability of acting early to shift incentives away from ‘dirty’ innovation and towards low-carbon innovation. Indeed, the longer the delay, the more difficult and expensive it becomes to redirect the economy towards clean technologies, as shown by Acemoglu et al. (2012). Current UK policies are not sufficient to move innovation on to a low-carbon pathway and this will make the UK dependent on foreign technology to meet its 2050 emissions reduction target at least cost.&#xa0;2.5 Once the economy has shifted to a low-carbon innovation pathway, the path dependency effect implies that the economy then naturally locks itself into low-carbon technologies, removing the need for further Government support. This further strengthens the case for early Government action to support low-carbon innovation, which can be relaxed in the future as the economy’s stock of low-carbon knowledge grows. However, clear criteria governing future reductions in Government support for innovation must be set in advance to prevent unexpected policy changes that could inhibit investment. &#xa0;

[[[The type of support provided for low-carbon innovation in the UK]]]2.6 The UK’s current strategy appears to prioritise policies, such as feed-in tariffs and a carbon price floor, which promote deployment rather than direct support for research and development. However, as shown by Acemoglu et al. (2012), environmental policies that are economically optimal to fight climate change not only address demand but also directly incentivise the development of low-carbon technologies.&#xa0;2.7 Providing more direct support for research and development for low-carbon technologies, for example through tax credits and subsidies, would provide better value for money and could be economically advantageous for the UK as it is more likely to benefit UK businesses. Indeed, as shown by Dechezleprêtre &amp; Glachant (2013), deployment policies incentivise innovation activities not just in the UK but also in other countries. While these deployment policies certainly have a positive impact on global efforts to tackle climate change, they may provide less economic benefit to the UK and hence may be less politically acceptable.&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1 The best strategy for the UK Government is to target its support for low-carbon innovation at technologies that have the highest potential for emissions reductions, are furthest away from the market, and have the highest knowledge spillovers (i.e. knowledge benefits for other inventors).&#xa0;3.2 Research by the Grantham Research Institute (Dechezleprêtre et al., 2013) has shown that knowledge spillover benefits (i.e. the societal benefits that justify policy intervention) are much higher in radically new low-carbon technologies, such as renewable energy technologies, than in technologies aimed at improving the efficiency of existing high-carbon technologies. This justifies prioritising renewable energy technologies, in particular the most radically new technologies (for example offshore wind and marine energy), over energy efficiency technologies.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1 The measurement of success is important to sustain Government support for the LCICG. Researchers at the Grantham Research Institute have developed three indicators that can be used at the national level to assess the success of low-carbon innovation in the UK:&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Patent applications filed by UK businesses for low-carbon technologies, both in the UK and elsewhere. One benefit of using patent applications as a metric is that they allow the identification of low-carbon technologies at a highly disaggregated level (e.g. wave energy patents) and of their link to UK-based applicants.&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Exports of low-carbon capital goods from the UK (e,g, wind turbines). So far we have identified about 20 different low-carbon capital goods that we are able to trace in international trade databases.&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Foreign investments in UK-based low-carbon businesses and, conversely, investments made by UK-based low-carbon businesses in foreign countries, are another good indicator of the success of any low-carbon innovation strategy.&#xa0;4.2 Two of these indicators seem already to be part of the metrics used by the LCICG. We recommend that the international investment indicator should be added.&#xa0;4.3 Ideally, the LCICG should try to measure not only the impact of low-carbon innovation policies on the growth of the low-carbon sector, but also the impact of these policies on the growth of the economy as a whole. A key result from recent research by the Grantham Research Institute is that a redirection of innovation from ‘dirty’ to low-carbon technologies can lead to higher economic growth in the medium term because low-carbon technologies generate much larger knowledge spillovers in the economy than the ‘dirty’ technologies they replace (Dechezleprêtre et al., 2013). A necessary condition for low-carbon policies to impact growth of the economy more broadly is that the technologies they support must generate benefits outside their own fields.&#xa0;4.4 For example, Dechezleprêtre et al. (2013) found that clean patents in the car industry relating to the ‘generation, conversion or distribution of electric power’ have been used to develop new computer sciences patents in ‘electrical digital data processing’ technologies. Another example is ‘combustion apparatus using fluent fuel’ technologies, which have spilled over to ‘diagnosis, surgery and identification’ patents in medical science. The Grantham Research Institute is currently working on a project that analyses the impact of knowledge spillovers from green technologies on business performance. This methodology could be applied to UK businesses, in particular to measure the impact of low-carbon innovation on economic growth. This project seems very relevant for the work of the LCICG, and its results will be available in Spring/Summer 2014.&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1 DECC should prioritises innovation funding for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies.&#xa0;5.2 Given the current energy mix in the UK, support for CCS (including gas, industrial and biomass CCS) will be a key component of the Government’s strategy for achieving the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels. In addition, CCS technologies are still at an early stage of development; when Government support is most needed.&#xa0;5.3 In a recent paper, Dechezleprêtre et al. (2013) found that innovations in CCS technologies generate even larger knowledge spillovers than renewable energy technologies, implying that the incentives to conduct private research and development activities, compared to what is socially desirable, are lower for CCS than for other technologies (including renewables). Strong public support is therefore warranted.&#xa0;
