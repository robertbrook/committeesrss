defaultNCVO believes that local government procurement continues to be primarily driven by price rather than delivering true value for money.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNCVO is concerned that only 
defaultcontracts above EU procurement thresholds are covered by the Social Value Act’s provisions. Plans to increase EU procurement thresholds to €750,000 (circa £600,000) are likely to exacerbate this situation.

The City Council had reduced the number of homelessness services providers from 11 to 4, and required providers to demonstrate their financial strength while squeezing pricing. With contracts becoming leaner, this resulted in fewer VCSE providers deciding to bid.

default is essential for achieving value for money in local government procurement. While many commissioners express a desire to avoid creating oligopolies of large providers, funding cuts are driving them to commission at scale, putting system efficiency before frontline quality. A 2013 VCSE survey by Locality 
defaultfound that nearly 42% of respondents believe contracts have become larger in the last five years and a further 52% expect them to become larger still over the next five years. 80% said this would provide them with less opportunities and a lower range and quality of services in their area.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLarge contracts requiring significant capital (such as Payment by Results (PbR) contracts or contracts at significant scale) can squeeze out VCSE providers or lead organisations to seek loans at rates less favourable than those the public sector can acquire
default. Compact Voice’s 2013 survey of Local Compacts found that 42.1 percent of voluntary sector respondents believe that the capital 
defaultrequirements and financial risks involved with PbR ‘completely’ limit the sector’s capacity to compete for contracts with 28.2 percent of local authority respondents agreeing.
default

default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommissioners need to engage with and facilitate development of their local provider markets. Providers need a clear steer about future commissioning opportunities, plenty of notice if certain types of structures that will be required to bid (e.g. consortia), and information about their market position to help them decide whether to develop new services and take on investment.  
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPbR contracting is being rolled out without testing viability and impact on the market beforehand. Without sufficient research and learning, commissioning authorities can exclude VCSE providers or impose disproportionate and wasteful contracting processes.  It remains true that in many cases (for example, pilot or innovation projects) grant funding would be more appropriate and efficient than 
defaultcompetitive contracting. 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPoor quality decommissioning without proper explanation. VCSE providers are sometimes left to conclude that decisions about decommissioning have been made on the basis of short-term savings, rather than a strategy to improve service provision and quality. This can lead to providers leaving the market.
defaultQ2. Do authorities take sufficient advantage of collaborative and joint procurement opportunities, including those available from central government? In addition, the Committee would welcome information on PFI contracts and their operation with local government.defaultQ3. How can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives? More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies—locally and regionally. If not, how can deficiencies be addressed?default&#xa0;

defaultCommissioners often hold misconceptions about the probity of speaking with providers at the pre-procurement stage. This continues despite ‘mythbusting’ guidance from the Cabinet Office.
default As a result, contracting approaches and requirements may be selected that are not appropriate for the provider market. What is needed is a more
default systematic approach to gathering market 
defaultintelligence
default pre-procurement and 
defaultgreater co-designing with the market
default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommissioners lack an understanding of the commercial and governance arrangements of VCSE organisations and how this affects attitudes, management of risk and loan finance. A basic understanding of charity law and restrictions on charities would help.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPoor data creates challenges for constructing performance baselines and outcomes targets. This can result in targets being set that skew provider behaviour (‘gaming’) away from the originally intended outcome.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMisuse of contracts as the driving mechanism for relationships. Contracts should convey agreed values following a period of meaningful dialogue between the relevant parties. Variations during service delivery (for various reasons) are commonplace, so it is important that contracts are constructed by both sides to provide a flexible and supportive framework for when change occurs. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4. To what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are tailored to product and supplier market places? More specifically, do local authorities maintain and operate effective client management functions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow the flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget reductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered?default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6. Is local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress? Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective? More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered?default&#xa0;
