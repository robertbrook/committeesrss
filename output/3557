[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the opportunity to 
[normal]give 
[normal]oral 
[normal]evidence to the Science and 
[normal]Technology Committee on Wednesday 30

[normal] October. We sh
[normal]ould now like to submit furt
[normal]her 
[normal]written 
[normal]evidence that reinforces the importance of drawing on the pool of 
[normal]talented 
[normal]women who have taken a career break 
[normal]and now wish
[normal] return to research
[normal]. These individuals, with appropriate support and retraining, such as that offered by the Daphne Jackson Fellowships, can go on to 
[normal]become an integral part
[normal] of a diverse and talented STEM workforce.
[normal]We would like to reinforce the following points:
[normal]Career break rather than maternity break

[normal]ow
[normal] graduated from Oxford with a degree in Chemistry and then worked for Kodak for 3 years before returning to Oxford to do a PhD. She got married to an officer in the RAF and soon was expecting their first child. Due to her husbandâ€™s job they were moving e
[normal]very 2-3 years, and with two young children, a job in chemistry was not feasible. When her children went to school, and the family had a 3 year posting to RAF Brize Norton, she started applying for jobs but with no success. In 1998 the family returned to O
[normal]xford 
[normal]where
[normal] she 
[normal]heard
[normal] about the Daphne Jackson Trust and was awarded a Fellowship. She has been employed by Oxford University since.
