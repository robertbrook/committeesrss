[[[Malaria Consortium]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;Malaria Consortium is one of the world's leading organisations dedicated to comprehensive malaria and neglected tropical disease control and child health in Africa and Southeast Asia. As an international non-governmental organisation, we undertake programmes in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, surveillance, operational research and health system strengthening in Nigeria, Uganda, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Mozambique, Ghana, Senegal, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar. While malaria control is at the heart of our strategy, we also undertake complementary work on child health including integrated community case management of childhood illness (ICCM), malnutrition and the control of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Our concentration is on improving access to care for the poorest and most marginalised in society, including women, children and ethnic minorities.&#xa0;Malaria Consortium welcomes the opportunity to have input into this important inquiry. We have focussed our submission on those aspects of democracy and development in Myanmar that relate specifically to health, the area of our organisationâ€™s primary expertise. Our organisation refers to Myanmar/Burma as Myanmar and so for the purpose of this submission we shall use this title.&#xa0;&#xa0;
