[normal]Written evidence[bold] from[bold] [bold]Fred[bold]die [bold]Talberg[bold] CEO of PIE Mapping’ (CYC0026)[bold]Executive Summary[bold]PIE mapping have been running successful
[normal]ly
[normal] a HGV complaint routing service in partnership with London Councils that gives hauliers routes to follow
[normal], 
[normal]which is 
[normal]well 
[normal]received by the industry, both domestic
[normal]ally
[normal] and with a growing number of international operators.  
[normal]PIE also developed for
[normal] the Olympics 
[normal]a Freight Journey Planner used by TFL (still in legacy) that has the capability to impose road segment restrictions by time of day.  This was used effectively by the freight industry during the Games.
[normal]As such intelligent use and sharing of the road is in o
[normal]peration for the Lorry Control Scheme and is proof that it is possible to add further time and day dependent restrictions that the industry can manage around.  
[normal]Should good quality cycle data by; location and time of day
[normal] for a
[normal] 
[normal]cycle safety restriction, 
[normal]plu
[normal]s any key 
[normal]‘left turn’
[normal] sites that are more dangerous to use at certain times 
[normal]be available. 
[normal]This data can be included into a 
[normal]viable safer freight routing scheme.  This will be a more practical app
[normal]roach than an area wide HGV ban and more effective as we learn
[normal] more about how best to de-conflict HGV’s and cyclists. 
[normal]Other recommendations that would be
[normal] effective and
[normal] easier to implement 
[normal]that will have 
[normal]a big impact is to enforce construction projects to ensure contractor vehicles meet time of day and location routi
[normal]ng criteria.  
[normal]As such we have working proof that with good data we can set up a service for compliant HGV routes.  This will enable us to share our limited road space capacity more securely and still operate the city effectively.

[normal]A[bold]&#xa0;[bold]brief introduction abo[bold]ut yourself/your organisation and your reason for submitting evidence.[bold]I
[normal] (Freddie Talberg) 
[normal] live in London with a young family and 
[normal]I 
[normal]cycle and well as motorbike
[normal] (having passed a test) commute into central London so have firsthand experience from road user 
[normal]prospective. 
[normal]  I have 
[normal]a 
[normal]professional experience in making maps for the different driver communities in London from; motorcyclist, disabled (blue badge) driver as well as LCV (vans) and the HGV driving community.
[normal]My organisation PIE Mapping started 
[normal]by creat
[normal]ing
[normal] mapping guides for the various driving communities into London and 
[normal]has
[normal] developed to 
[normal]more
[normal] complex and sophisticated transport mapping and information services.  We delivered for TFL the comprehensive Freight Journey Planner (FJP) that was used in the Ol
[normal]ympic Games and is currently still being used in legacy.  We also created Journey Planning services for LOCOG during the Games that included navigating VIPs, Athletes, media etc across London.
[normal]PIE Mapping is 
[normal]a SME
[normal] business that has used 
[normal]entrepreneurial
[normal] innovation to work with London Councils to create a real first in navigating HGV’s across London in compliance to the London Lorry Con
[normal]t
[normal]rol Scheme (LLCS).  We have created the first compliant routing service for HGV’s that provides routes to hauliers/drive
[normal]rs that ensure
[normal]s
[normal] the correct routing for their vehicle
[normal]’s
[normal] to the roads and with compliance 
[normal]to
[normal] the LLCS scheme.  This ensures no penalties 
[normal]are
[normal] imposed,  for use of inappropriate roads.  We currently have over 330 paying hauliers with a 100% compliance and a z
[normal]ero PCN issue for our clients.  Customers include operators like; Superdrug, Wincanton
[normal] and Hanson
[normal]. 
[normal]The number of international haulier that sign up for our service is growing and the feedback we get from them is 
[normal]positive as 
[normal]they love that 
[normal]there 
[normal]is a servi
[normal]ce th
[normal]at provides an creditable routing 
[normal]to navigate a HGV in London.  
[normal]We digitise 
[normal]planned events such as the recent Lords Mayors Show, Remembrance Parade road closures etc.  
[normal]As such we
[normal] automatically regenerate routes if any of these planned events 
[normal]affect
[normal] t
[normal]heir normal routes 
[normal]this 
[normal]ensure
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]Operators a
[normal]lways have a compliant route
[normal] by day and time
[normal].
[normal]The recent development 
[normal]is the ability to download a route 
[normal]to sat nav.  This enables drivers to be se
[normal]nt a route to follow on their sat nav making it easier for drivers 
[normal]to follow the complaint and appropriate route
[normal]We are submitting evidence to prove that London has already a great working model for an HGV routing service that serves compliant routes which we have made easy enough that the drivers simply follow.  The feed
[normal]back is that the driver
[normal]s
[normal] love it and they are h
[normal]appy to be compliant and advised 
[normal]on their rout
[normal]es through London
[normal].  
[normal]Plus du
[normal]ring the Olympic G
[normal]ames the FJP (Freight Journey Planner) we created was able to restrict certain parts of the road network on a time of
[normal] day basis.  i.e. road closures for a couple hours
[normal], even with 
[normal]two 
[normal]short
[normal] time
[normal] window
[normal]s of
[normal] closure
[normal]s
[normal] in the same day
[normal].  This is reflective of the cycle community commuter morning and afternoon peaks. These are complex time closures which the FJP has incorporate
[normal]d.  Each freight operator was able to use the tool/service to create their time of day routes.  We routed journey
[normal]s
[normal] around the restrictions or if impossible suggested a new start time for their journey. 
[normal]Any factual information you have to offer from which [bold]the committee might be able to draw conclusions, or which could be put to other witnesses for their reactions.[bold]The conclusion I draw from this is that London has already some great working models to implement compliant routing that could include location a
[normal]nd time specific restrictions around the cycle network.  Our London Lorry Route Approver (
[normal]www.londonlorrycontrol.com
[normal]) could be configured to include these restrictions as could the TFL FJP.  
[normal]Please also note that a 
[normal]high risk 
[normal]of accident
[normal]s
[normal] happen at left turns,  these 
[normal]can 
[normal]be 
[normal]add
[normal]ed as 
[normal]left turn restrictions on smaller roads and on a time of 
[normal]day basi
[normal]s easily for HGV routing to be routed accordingly.
[normal] 
[normal]The beauty of this approach is the ability to c
[normal]reate time and location restrictions for cycle safety.  
[normal]The key for a viable city and road share model is good data to determine what times and locations we can de-conflict. 
[normal]The locations will need to be dynamic as TfL &amp; other
[normal]s will need to 
[normal]get a handle on
[normal] cycle 
[normal]behaviour 
[normal]data and which locations and times we need to protect from HGV’s .  This approach can provide a safer freight routing requirement.  i.e. hauliers have to sign up for the safer freight scheme which could be 
[normal]a 
[normal]volunteer 
[normal]service 
[normal]initially bas
[normal]ed on their TFL FORS membership (Fleet Operators Recognition Scheme).
[normal]  Alternatively this could be a compulsory requirement for construction project sites.
[normal]PIE with City University have been researching (own time) the data that is readily available that wi
[normal]ll enable us to create a good understand of the cycle behaviour model.  This
[normal] would include 
[normal]which roads/routes/areas by time of day and day of the week do we ne
[normal]ed to identify.  Our research found good contacts in TFL plus sites like thi
[normal]s:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]http://casa.oobrien.com/traffic/
[normal] , 
[normal]TfL
[normal] have volumetric data 
[normal]on 
[normal] 
[normal]http://w
[normal]ww.wocref.org/CRI-Volume_2_files/Gordon,Parkin-Patterns_of_Use_by_Season,_Day_of_Week_and_Time_of_Day_Leading_to_Route_Typologies.pdf
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Any recommendations for action by the Government or others which you would like the committee to consider.[bold]My 
[normal]recommendations would be to change the current LLCS
[normal] (London Lorry Control Scheme)
[normal] to be day time routing also instead of just night-t
[normal]ime or change the network restrictions for day time.  (technically we can handle the restrictions data and provide the comp
[normal]liant routes by time and day).
[normal]Other recommendations that will be easier and quick to implement that can work would be to enforce all construction sites/projects to have a complaint routing service for HGV contractors vehicles that includes time and 
[normal]location restrictions on the cycle network.  Therefore ensuring construction vehicles are not on these roads at the key times and locations as cyclist
[normal] based on a good cyclist data model
[normal].  
[normal]I recommend that the restriction areas are set up so they can be ch
[normal]anged as we will need flexibility to 
[normal]assign key locations as we better understand the vulnerable areas and behaviours.   
[normal]We need more data on which locations that is best for HGVs to avoid and at what times and days of the week so the system really works.
