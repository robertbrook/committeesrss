defaultThe Parliamentary Ombudsman 
defaultonly 
defaultinvestigates
default complaints that are sent via Members of Parliament. Until 2004

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Health Service Commissioner was established in 1973 to investigate complaints about hospital and community h
defaultealth services. The remit was expanded in 1996 to include complaints about general practitioners and matters of clinical judgement. Since 2002
default-03 only the total of ‘complaints and enquiries’ were reported for England (2003-04 in the case of Scotland).
default 
defaultEnglish, Scottish and Welsh health complaints were reported separately by the HSC until 1999. After devolution, the respective Public Service Ombudsmen handled 
defaulthealth 
defaultcomplaints in Scotland and Wales. Health complaints to the Northern Ireland Ombudsman (es
defaulttablished 1969) are not shown. 
default1.2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe remit of the 
defaultTax Adjudicator (established 1993)
default 
defaultexpand
defaulted to include Customs &amp; Excise and the Contributions Agency in 1996 and the Insolvency Service in 2003. The steep (and sustained) increase in complaints in the mid-20
default00s was attributed by the adjudicator to the introduction of tax credits.
default1.2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Prisons and Probation Ombudsman’s remit expanded to include 
defaultthe P
defaultrobation 
defaultService 
defaultin 2001 and asylum detention centres in 2006. Only prisons complaints are shown here.
default1.2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the 200
default11-12 Annual Report of the ICO, data protection complaints were reported as 13,034 for 2010-11 (about half the 2010-11 value in the previous year’s report) and 12,985 for 2011-12

defaultthe process in England and Wales
default dates from the late 1970s with significant reforms in 1998 and 2000. 
defaultThe procedures are somewhat different in Scotland and Northern Ireland and are
default handled by their respective administrative courts.

defaultSuccess rates at the first stage depend not only on the merit of the claims, but also on the way in which complaints are handled, which has changed 
defaultover the period. For instance, since 2004 the office of the
default 
defaultParliamentary Ombudsman

defaulthas

default‘i

default Commissioner

default The proportion of 
defaultcases granted 
defaultpermission 
defaultto bring a claim for judicial review 
defaulthas also fallen. 
defaultHowever, an increasing proportion of cases are settled in the pre-permission stage, often to the satisfaction of the claimant.
default 
default 
default4. Conclusiondefault4.1 As we showed in Section 2, complaints to ombudsmen and applications for judicial review have all increased markedly over the past three decades. 
defaultThe timing of the most rapid
default increases varied between 
defaultombudsmen.
default4.2 The proportion of com
defaultplaints 
defaultto 
defaultthe PHSO
default 
defaultand applications for JR allowed to proc
defaulteed through the first stage has
default fallen, as shown in section 3. 
defaultT
defaulthere have been changes to the ways in which claims are handled which 
defaultcould 
defaultaffect apparent success rates
default, including an increas
defaulted
default use 
defaultof more informal resolution procedures (see paragraphs 3.2 and 3.4, above)
default. 
default4.3 Consistent time series of complaints about public bodies are valuable metrics. Our data collection exercise was often frustrated by changing reporting conventions. Such 
defaultdata 
defaultb
defaultreaks have been more frequent since 2000. While some breaks reflected changed working practices and led to new consistent series, in other cases reporting 
defaultconventions 
defaultchanged from year to year 
defaultmaking comparison impossible. In addition,
default some long-standing s
defaulteries, 
defaultsuch as the number of complaints received by the Parliamentary Ombudsman 
defaultvia
default MPs,
default 
defaultceased to be
default publicly reported. 
default4.4 Such breaks and discontinuities are not only inconvenient for scholars but also have the effect of making the level of complaints 
defaultfar more difficult, if not impossible, to monitor by outside bodies (including the Public Administration Select Committee itself).
