[normal]Summary[bold]As part of our study
[normal] 
[normal]o
[normal]f
[normal] developments in UK 
[normal]executive 
[normal]government over the past 30 years, we have collated
[normal] 
[normal]data on 
[normal]complaints
[normal] to ombudsmen regarding government and public services
[normal] and applications for judicial revie
[normal]w
[normal].
[normal] In this paper we present the numbers of complaints and applications received and
[normal] (for selected cases)
[normal] the numbers and proportions that passed the first stage of the review process. Numbers of complaints have risen over the past 30 years while success ra
[normal]tes have declined. However, the numbers should be in
[normal]terpreted with caution, as 
[normal]remits and working practices have altered over time, which 
[normal]may 
[normal]affect both the numbers of complaints and 
[normal]apparent 
[normal]success rates.

[normal]Notes on remit and reporting changes:
[normal]1.2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Parliamentary Ombudsman 
[normal]only 
[normal]investigates
[normal] complaints that are sent via Members of Parliament. Until 2004
[normal]-05
[normal], 
[normal]the 
[normal]number
[normal] of complaints 
[normal]received via MPs 
[normal]w
[normal]as
[normal] recorded in the annual reports
[normal]. This number has
[normal] not been reported since that time (although the r
[normal]equirement 
[normal]to submit complaints via MPs 
[normal]still 
[normal]applies
[normal])
[normal]. The post-200
[normal]5
[normal] data 
[normal]w
[normal]ere
[normal] supplied by the office of the PHSO 
[normal]as 
[normal]a personal communication.
[normal]1.2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Health Service Commissioner was established in 1973 to investigate complaints about hospital and community h
[normal]ealth services. The remit was expanded in 1996 to include complaints about general practitioners and matters of clinical judgement. Since 2002
[normal]-03 only the total of ‘complaints and enquiries’ were reported for England (2003-04 in the case of Scotland).
[normal] 
[normal]English, Scottish and Welsh health complaints were reported separately by the HSC until 1999. After devolution, the respective Public Service Ombudsmen handled 
[normal]health 
[normal]complaints in Scotland and Wales. Health complaints to the Northern Ireland Ombudsman (es
[normal]tablished 1969) are not shown. 
[normal]1.2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The remit of the 
[normal]Tax Adjudicator (established 1993)
[normal] 
[normal]expand
[normal]ed to include Customs &amp; Excise and the Contributions Agency in 1996 and the Insolvency Service in 2003. The steep (and sustained) increase in complaints in the mid-20
[normal]00s was attributed by the adjudicator to the introduction of tax credits.
[normal]1.2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman’s remit expanded to include 
[normal]the P
[normal]robation 
[normal]Service 
[normal]in 2001 and asylum detention centres in 2006. Only prisons complaints are shown here.
[normal]1.2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the 200
[normal]11-12 Annual Report of the ICO, data protection complaints were reported as 13,034 for 2010-11 (about half the 2010-11 value in the previous year’s report) and 12,985 for 2011-12
[normal].
[normal]2.1 Judicial review 
[normal](JR) 
[normal]is the process 
[normal]whe
[normal]reby
[normal] the courts examine the decisions of public bodies. In its present form 
[normal]the process in England and Wales
[normal] dates from the late 1970s with significant reforms in 1998 and 2000. 
[normal]The procedures are somewhat different in Scotland and Northern Ireland and are
[normal] handled by their respective administrative courts.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]number of JR applications
[normal] 
[normal]are shown in Figure 2.
[normal] 
[normal]Data were obtained from annual Judicial Statistics
[normal] (
[normal]Judiciary of 
[normal]England and Wales)
[normal], Civil Judicial Statistics 
[normal](The 
[normal]Scot
[normal]tish Government)
[normal], and

[normal] 
[normal]Most types of complaint 
[normal]involve
[normal] a
[normal] two-stage process. 
[normal]Only some of the complaints made to the Parliamentary Ombudsman
[normal] or the Health Commissioner proceed
[normal] 
[normal]to a full investigation and 
[normal]report, and in
[normal] the 
[normal]case of 
[normal]j
[normal]udicial 
[normal]r
[normal]eview, a
[normal] 
[normal]claimant
[normal] must first be granted ‘permission to 
[normal]bring a claim for judicial review
[normal]’
[normal] before proceeding to a final hearing. 
[normal]The cases
[normal] that passed throu
[normal]gh the first stage of
[normal] each procedure
[normal] are
[normal] shown 
[normal]in Figure 3
[normal]. 
[normal]Our analysis does not include the outcomes of the second stage.

[normal]3.2
[normal] 
[normal]Success rates at the first stage depend not only on the merit of the claims, but also on the way in which complaints are handled, which has changed 
[normal]over the period. For instance, since 2004 the office of the
[normal] 
[normal]Parliamentary Ombudsman 
[normal] 
[normal]has
[normal] undertake
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]‘i
[normal]nvesti
[normal]gative activity’ and ‘interventions’ 
[normal]for some complaints 
[normal]without 
[normal]proceeding to 
[normal]a
[normal] full statutory investigation
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]report.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]3.
[normal]3
[normal] The Health Service
[normal] Commissioner 
[normal]altered the method for recording
[normal] complaints
[normal] and investigations
[normal] during the 2000s. There have also been changes to the 
[normal]complaints 
[normal]procedure
[normal], which for a period required a three-stage process involving the Healthcare Commission
[normal]. We are 
[normal]therefore unable to report the
[normal] numbers and percentages of cases 
[normal]passing the first sta
[normal]ge 
[normal]consistently after 2002.
[normal]3.
[normal]4
[normal] The proportion of 
[normal]cases granted 
[normal]permission 
[normal]to bring a claim for judicial review 
[normal]has also fallen. 
[normal]However, an increasing proportion of cases are settled in the pre-permission stage, often to the satisfaction of the claimant.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]4. Conclusion[bold]4.1 As we showed in Section 2, complaints to ombudsmen and applications for judicial review have all increased markedly over the past three decades. 
[normal]The timing of the most rapid
[normal] increases varied between 
[normal]ombudsmen.
[normal]4.2 The proportion of com
[normal]plaints 
[normal]to 
[normal]the PHSO
[normal] 
[normal]and applications for JR allowed to proc
[normal]eed through the first stage has
[normal] fallen, as shown in section 3. 
[normal]T
[normal]here have been changes to the ways in which claims are handled which 
[normal]could 
[normal]affect apparent success rates
[normal], including an increas
[normal]ed
[normal] use 
[normal]of more informal resolution procedures (see paragraphs 3.2 and 3.4, above)
[normal]. 
[normal]4.3 Consistent time series of complaints about public bodies are valuable metrics. Our data collection exercise was often frustrated by changing reporting conventions. Such 
[normal]data 
[normal]b
[normal]reaks have been more frequent since 2000. While some breaks reflected changed working practices and led to new consistent series, in other cases reporting 
[normal]conventions 
[normal]changed from year to year 
[normal]making comparison impossible. In addition,
[normal] some long-standing s
[normal]eries, 
[normal]such as the number of complaints received by the Parliamentary Ombudsman 
[normal]via
[normal] MPs,
[normal] 
[normal]ceased to be
[normal] publicly reported. 
[normal]4.4 Such breaks and discontinuities are not only inconvenient for scholars but also have the effect of making the level of complaints 
[normal]far more difficult, if not impossible, to monitor by outside bodies (including the Public Administration Select Committee itself).

[normal]nd since 2005 the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales has undertaken that role in Wales.
[normal] Since the creation of the Health Service Commissioner (HSC), the offices of Parliamentary Ombudsman and HSC have been held by the same person, now known as the Parli
