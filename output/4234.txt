[[[Written evidence submitted by European Plastics Converters ]]]

[[[EuPC]]]EuPC is the leading EU-level trade association, based in Brussels, representing European plastics converters. EuPC now totals 51 European plastics converting national and European industry associations; it represents close to 50,000 companies, producing over 45 million tonnes of plastic products every year. The European plastics industry makes a significant contribution to welfare in Europe by enabling innovation, creating quality of life for citizens and facilitating resource efficiency and climate protection. More than 1.6 million people are working in EU converting companies (mainly SMEs) to create a turnover in excess of €300 billion per year.EuPC, as the EU level trade body for users (converters) of plastics (polymer) materials, welcomes this Common’s select committee initiative on plastic bags and the dialogue that should come between the entire value chain for plastic products and society. As users of plastic materials we believe our written submission has added value. We have a neutral position on the materials used to produce plastic products as long as these provide the right quality to serve the customers’ needs. Converters only want their materials to be as sustainable as possible. Furthermore, converters acknowledge the environmental concerns surrounding certain waste streams (e.g. marine litter and Member State specific waste stream issues) and we are ready to work together with the entire value chain to further develop responses to these environmental concerns. In early 2013, EuPC commissioned the independent entity TCKT (the Transfer Center for Polymer Technology) to conduct independent industrial tests on the effects of degradable and oxo-fragmentable plastic carrier bags on the quality of plastics recycling. Therefore, four different mixtures of degradable plastic bags (3 biodegradable and one oxo-fragmentable) and one virgin LDPE recycling material were tests over the course of six months and from this material more than 3,700 measurements were made. The tests saw 9.45 tonnes of plastic bags being processed.

[[[Methodology and testing of the materials]]]The testing methodology was based on the EPBP (European PET Bottle Platform), procedure which aims at analysing the impact of certain material at various testing levels ( 2, 5, 10 and 50% )of test specimens (i.e. the materials being tested), in the recyclates mixture. The tests began with the collection of all kinds of pre-consumer plastic carrier bags available on the EU market (pre-consumer means the test results would be a best case scenario for the tested materials and post consumer waste would have even lower mechanical properties). The tests then focused on preparing mixtures for recycling of all these bags, simulating for end-of-life scenarios for the 3 bio-degradbale materials and the 1 oxo-fragmentable material. These different mixtures (labelled DEG1, DEG2, DEG3, DEG4*) of materials were then recycled. From the recyclates, a new film was blown and these new films extruded from DEG1, DEG2, DEG3 and DEG4 were then subjected to mechanical testing and the results were compared to a benchmark virgin LDPE recyclate.  *DEG1 = bio-degradable plastic carrier bags, DEG2= oxo-fragmentable, DEG3= bio-degradable plastic carrier bags, DEG4= bio-degradable plastic carrier bags

[[[Results of testing]]]The results of this testing showed that although all the material could be processed (recycled), the mixtures contaminated by oxo-fragmentable and biodegradable materials were unstable during recycling process and resulted in a reduced quality of recyclate. The main findings from these tests showed that mixtures containing oxo-fragmentable materials (DEG2 mixture) showed a substantial decrease in tensile strength, tear resistance and puncture impact. This is not to mention the issues of visual impacts with as little as 2% contaminations from oxo-fragmentable materials (which leads to difficulties in printing).The mixtures containing the other 3 different types of bio-degradable plastic bags also showed undulating results in mechanical properties. The general conclusion being, that contaminations of these biodegradable films results in difficulties in recycling and a reduced quality of recyclates. This all taken together, means that bags produced from recyclates containing oxo-fragmentable and biodegradable materials have reduced quality in terms of mechanical performance.

[[[2.1 Oxo-fragmentable plastics]]]The European Commission has already stated publicly that oxo-fragmentable plastics are not an environmental solution to littering and marine litter. EuPC is aware of this and has communicated the abovementioned test results to the European Commission.&#xa0;In the European Parliament, the recently finalised Prodi Report of the ENVI Committee states that oxo-degradable plastics (as one of the most dangerous and harmful plastics) should be phased out of the EU market or banned outright by 2020.&#xa0;The European Economic and Social Committee also has reservations about the use of oxo-additives in plastics products, as does the Committee of Regions opinion on plastics waste in the environment. &#xa0;EuPC is of the opinion that oxo-fragmentable plastics do not have any suitable end-of-life solution at the moment in Europe. The very idea of adding oxo-additives to plastic products goes against the goal of a resource efficient Europe, as plastics waste is a resource that can be reused and therefore, should not be contaminated by additives that will destroy the possibility or reuse/recycling (an additive that does not bring any positive environmental benefits).&#xa0;Finally, in the BIOIS report on the results of the European Commission’s Green paper consultation on plastics waste in the environment, 53% of respondents call for a prohibition in the use of oxo-degradable plastic, 33% state that the use of oxo-degradable plastics should not be promoted, 13% do not have a specific opinion on oxo-degradable plastics and only 1% state that oxo-degradable plastics should be promoted. &#xa0;

[[[Bio-degradable plastics]]]&#xa0;As far as EuPC is concerned, biodegradable plastics should go to their correct end-of-life solution and not enter traditional recycling streams (due to detrimental impacts on recycling). The correct end-of-life solution for bio-degradable plastics is composting. &#xa0;EuPC is also of the opinion that bio-degradable plastics must prove their sustainability, as in many cases bio-degradable plastics are less sustainable than traditional plastics or plastic products made from recyclates (see for example the DUH report in Germany where two large German retailers stopped using bio-degradable carrier bags as they were less environmentally friendly than traditional plastic carrier bags and were not in fact compostable). Finally, the BIOIS report on the results of the European Commission’s Green paper consultation on plastics waste in the environment shows that respondents to the European Commission’s recent Green Paper consultation on plastics waste, believe that bio-degradable plastics must prove their sustainability and whether they do, in fact, biodegrade under real world conditions. 5 December 2013&#xa0;
