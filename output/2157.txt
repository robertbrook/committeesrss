[[[Essex Bridleways Association – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;This Association, representing horse riders and carriage drivers in Essex , has followed closely the deliberations of the Stakeholder Working Group and indeed provided evidence to that group.  Our experience of the processes for claiming unrecorded rights of way set out in the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 has been considerable and we have , through that procedure, managed to have a very large number of unrecorded, and under recorded rights of way added to the Definitive Map for Essex.  This work continues through the voluntary efforts of this organisation’s membership, and it is clear from the enthusiasm with which our work is met, that there is a particular need for this to continue. &#xa0;It is clear that the Highway Agency, Essex County Council, would have failed to record those highways at their appropriate status, unless forced to do so by this Association, and those Rights of Way so recorded are now available to the use of the entire population for all time.&#xa0;There are alternative means by which Highway Authorities may increase the provision of bridleways. Unfortunately they seem incapable of so doing, and therefore the process by which we currently claim rights of way is inevitably highly necessary.&#xa0;The existing procedures, as set out in the Act, are cumbersome and time consuming, and for volunteers to undertake, quite daunting.&#xa0;It is therefore encouraging for us to see that the Stakeholder Working Group has made a number of recommendations to simplify the process. Furthermore they have included means whereby some of the difficulties for landowners, faced with inconvenient routes, are addressed.&#xa0;This Association therefore welcomes the Stepping Forward Report and urges that Parliament should adopt the proposals set out therein as a whole, refraining from making attempts to “cherry pick” from those suggestions.&#xa0;&#xa0;With due respect to our primary request as set out above, we do have concerns that it would fall hard upon our volunteers, and our association (a charity)  to have to apply to Magistrates to force a Highway Authority which chose to be obstructive, or merely was lethargic in dealing with a  claim to record a Highway, to duly process according to the law.  Meeting the costs thereof would be a very great deterrent to our cause and should be given careful deliberation before being enshrined in law.&#xa0;Furthermore, it is extremely important that the evidential tests which are to be set out , must be well founded, that they should be drawn up to take into account the need for a reasonable allegation of  subsistence of a highway to be sufficient for it to be tested through a formal process.&#xa0;The Countryside Commission in it’s report leading up to the publication of  “ Rights of Way into the 21st Century”  identified upwards of 10,000 miles of unrecorded, or under recorded rights of way in England.  For that purpose the Discovering Lost Ways project was commenced. However, that failed to deliver virtually any recorded ways before being withdrawn, but actually caused the volunteer network that had for the previous 50 years worked tirelessly to undertake that work,  to relax and  presume that all would be well. Unfortunately time passed, volunteers aged, and now some 50% of the time  allocated to record these lost ways has elapsed.&#xa0;The provisions of the 1949 Act required a 5 yearly review of the Definitive Map, In Essex such reviews did not occur for some 30 years or more, also policies were adopted that caused great disadvantage, Equestrian access was seen as unessential, the cost of higher status rights of way was seen as disadvantageous to the Highway Authority, and wherever there was discord at Parish boundaries over status, the lower was given precedence.&#xa0;Equestrian access, i.e. bridleway status, has since 1968 included cyclists and the very idea that, in times past, the ancient lanes of Essex were the preserve of only the  pedestrian, and should be recorded only as footpaths, is absurd. Yet there are hundreds of miles of ancient track so recorded.&#xa0;Equestrian Users commit themselves to financial outlays of approximately £ 6000 per annum per horse, spent locally, often with large amounts to forage merchants, and this is vastly more than any other class of user of the right of way network.&#xa0;The draft regulations that you are considering, require that you have due regard for beneficial effects upon the economy. This is home earned money spent directly in the UK economy, mostly upon home grown products.&#xa0;Persons engaging in equestrianism will only do so, given somewhere to ride!!&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
