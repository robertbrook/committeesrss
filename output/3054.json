"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the \nChartered Institution of Highways and Transportation (CIHT) (SRN 035)\n&#xa0;\nCIHT is a membership organisation representing over 12,000 people who work in the highways and transportation sector.  CIHT members plan, design, build, operate and maintain best-in-class transport systems \nand infrastructure, whilst respecting the imperatives of improving safety, ensuring economic competitiveness and minimising environmental impact.\n&#xa0;\nCIHT welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Transport\n Select Committee\n’\ns\n consultation on \nthe Stra\ntegic Road network\n. \nThis response incorporates the views of CIHT’s Council which \nis a \nrepresent\native body of our members\n’\n interests and opinions\n. We would welcome the opportunity to expand upon our response as required.\n&#xa0;\nCI\nHT welcomes the recognition of \nthe importance of \ncertainty of investment an\nd reform to the Highways Agency set out in Action for Roads. \nMore radical changes to the management of the network may have the capacity for greater improvements in the longer ter\nm \nand it is encouraging\n that such options have been considered in Action for Roads.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe standard of highway expertise in the \nUnited Kingdom\n is very high and is recognised worldwide. Our networks are amongst the safest in the world and our professional stan\ndards are highly regarded. The \nUnited Kingdom\n has contributed significantly to the development of highways as an increasingly more efficient sector of industry.\n&#xa0;\nIt is therefore appropriate that Action for Roads proposes an incremental change to the \nmanagement of the Strategic road network that builds on that expertise. Nevertheless the changes that are required do require \na boldness\n in approach so that the investment proposed can be used effectively to deliver real improvements to customers over time\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCertainty\n,\n and continuity\n of investment over a sustained period is important if overall improvements to the network are to be delivered effectively and efficiently. This need for certainty applies both to the reformed Highways Ag\nency and other “client” bodies and the wider supply chain of organisations working in the sector.\n&#xa0;\nGovernment needs to provide the certainty required by the supply chain side of the sector to invest in resource and capability to deliver the investment envi\nsaged. \nThe Roads Investment Strategy needs to be confirmed and be committed to quickly by all parties. \nThis will allow the Highways Agency to develop a robust pipeline of requirements for its supply chain in a form that allows the supply chain to \ninnovate and invest over a period of time.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCIHT \nargues\n that there is a clear need for a tra\nnsportation strategy that sets a \nclear framework of requirements over a sustained period fo\nr all elements of our transportation \nnetworks. \n \nThis strategy (or strategies) should include the strategic and local road networks,\n r\nail, aviation and ports and set\n out how those networks integrate with one another.\n&#xa0;\nThe publication of Action for Roads is welcome in that it \nsets out the importance of t\nhe strategic road network and \naims to define the needs of the strategic road network, linking investment over a period to the management structure required to deliver it. There is a concern that the absence of a national transport strategy (or strategies) \nmay mean that the investment identified in Action for Roads is not utilised effectively. The strategy should cove\nr\n other transport modes and importantly the overarching policy for the local roads network.\n \n&#xa0;\nIn developing its approach the government needs t\no ensure that the importance of understanding how customer needs are addressed in the new model for operation and be specific about how those needs are developed, protected and monitored by a regulator or other arrangement.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe government needs to be bold in recognising the capabilities required of a reformed Highways Agency. Those capabilities are likely to include a clearer appreciation of customer requirements and an expanded commercial capability, informed \nby other sectors. There is also a need for the reformed organisation to have more freedom to allow more innovation and more agility in decision making.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGovernment should recognise that the success of an improved \nstrategic network in meeting customer needs cannot be met without the local road network being also considered as part of a holistic solution that customers require.\n&#xa0;\nThe Department for Transport and government need to clearly define the role of the transp\nortation network in delivering the policies of the government. \n&#xa0;\nAction for Roads envisages the publication of a draft national policy statement on national networks in 2013. This needs to clearly set out the relationship of the strategic network to other \nnetworks, including the local highway network. It also needs to demonstrate how the policy links to both national and local planning policy, setting out a clear framework for the responsibility and accountability of developing the network.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nresponse to\n the questions are\n set out on the following pages.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1.&#xa0; \nCIHT welcomes the recognition of \nthe importance of \ncertainty of investment and reform to the Highways Agency.  \n1.2.&#xa0; \nThe current proposals to be enacted in legislation within this Parliamentary cycle offer a pragmatic and deliverable approach to change.  More \nradical changes\n, for example the introduction of a Regulated Utility Model in conjunction with direct user charging,\n to the management of the network may have the capacity for greater improvements in the longer term and it is good that such options have be\nen considered in Action for Roads.\n1.3.&#xa0; \nCertainty of investment over a sustained period is important if overall improvements to the network are to be delivered effectively and efficiently. This need for certainty applies both to the reformed Highways Agency and\n other “client” bodies and the wider supply chain of organisations working in the sector. \n1.4.&#xa0; \nThe five year funding period set out (in the Road Investment Strategy) is a welcome improvement from annualised budget cycles.  However, this falls short of the peri\nods required to undertake a holistic approach to asset management and delivery of customer expectations.  \n1.5.&#xa0; \nExperience from other models and schemes, for example on the M25 D\nesign Build Finance &amp; Operate\n scheme, and PFI investments in the local highway sect\nor have delivered real benefits through considering needs over a 25 year period.  Such approaches have enabled ambitious investment programmes to be delivered over a five year period followed by managed, longer operational periods. This 'invest to save' ap\nproach helps reduce ongoing operational costs through upfront investment in the asset. \n1.6.&#xa0; \nCertainty of investment over a sustained period will also allow a more resilient network to be developed, allowing the reformed Highways Agency and its supply chain to \nmeet the potential challenges of climate change by taking a longer term view of the needs of the network.\n \n1.7.&#xa0; \nThe increased level of investment is also welcomed as the sector has faced budget reductions that have led to asset deterioration.\n The investment ide\nntified will enable a series of key benefits to be delivered such as improving capacity, reducing congestion and improving reliability. These benefits will improve the network for users and deliver environmental benefits\n..\n1.8.&#xa0; \nThe sector already has a lot of e\nxperience to build on.  For instance, the lessons learnt from the managed motorways programme already underway have demonstrated the ability of the sector to deliver additional capacity withi\nn existing highway corridors. These improvements have been delive\nred more efficiently than full motorway improvements, delivering benefits to users and the environment in a shorter timescale.\n1.9.&#xa0; \nFuture Investment strategies should be informed by linking an understanding of the assets required to deliver all the purposes of\n the network derived from customer need. A proposed approach is set out in our response to Question 3 below.\n1.10.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCertainty of investment and clarity of the pipeline of works anticipated is fundamental to the ability of the supply chain to deliver a significant\n programme of investment in the timescales set out. If certainty is not delivered then \nproviding \nincreased resource will have a time lag before benefits can be \nfully \ndelivered.\n1.11.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is welcome that the importance of the local road network is recognised by Ac\ntion for Roads and that the effects on non-vehicular highway users are addressed to some degree. \n1.12.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNearly all journeys on the strategic road network begin and end on the local highway network. Unless linked to consideration of wider effects, improvements to\n the strategic road network (SRN) may have significant effects upon the local road network affecting all highway users, local communities and the environment. These effects may occur through diversion onto unsuitable parts of the network by charging, conge\nstion or control of access to the SRN. Customers do not take a different view of the networks they travel \non,\n a consistent appropriate standard of service delivery needs to be the aim.\n1.13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe issue of how the viewpoint of customers is taken into account in th\ne development of the network is fundamental to real and lasting improvements in the network. The role of a “regulator” acting in customers interests is commonplace in other sectors and in the transport sector and should be introduced alongside changes to t\nhe form of the Highways Agency in the way it manages the network. We set out in our response to Question 3 below how the requirements of customers should be \ndeveloped,\n a regulator could play an important role in that.\n1.14.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsideration of the local road networ\nk in conjunction with highway authorities, Local Transport Boards (LTBs) and Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) is vital and needs to be recognised and implemented as part of the changes proposed set out in Action for Roads.\n1.15.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe increased amount of maint\nenance investment for the local road network is welcome.  However, this must be considered alongside a reduced revenue budget for local authorities. There is the risk that the overall increase in investment could be jeopardised if the issue of the\n \ncontribu\ntion\n that the local network makes to the success of the S\nRN\n is not fully considered.\n1.16.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCIHT welcomes and supports the importance of the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme (HMEP) \nhttp://www.dft.gov.uk/hmep\n in delivering change to the local roads sector\n and will continue to work with the programme to ensure that linkages to the development of the SRN are maintained and enhanced.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1.&#xa0; \nCIHT \nargues\n that there is a \nreal\n need for a tra\nnsportation strategy that sets a \nclear framework of requirements over a sustained period fo\nr all elements of our transportation networks. \n \nThis strategy (or strategies) should include the strategic and local road networks,\n r\nail, aviation and\n ports and set\n out how those networks integrate with one another.\n2.2.&#xa0; \nThe publication of Action for Roads is welcome in that it \nsets out the importance of the SRN and \naims to define the needs of the network, linking investment over a period to the management structure required to deliver it. There is a concern that the absence of a \nN\national \nT\nransport \nS\ntrategy (or strategies) may mean that the investment identified in Ac\ntion for Roads is not utilised effectively. The strategy should cove\nr\n other transport modes and importantly the overarching policy for the local roads network.\n2.3.&#xa0; \nIt is welcome that the government have, over time, devolved responsibility for the local roads n\network to a local level in terms of decisions where funding should be spent\n,\n \nhowever\n an overall policy framework is required for highway authorities and other bodies to work within. T\nh\nis must set out the aims and objectives of the network in relation to th\ne needs of the country. \n2.4.&#xa0; \nThere could be benefit in considering the reform of how improvements to the local road network are delivered. The current arrangement contains inefficiencies, introduces inconsistencies and does not make best use of the pool of ski\nlled resource available.\n2.5.&#xa0; \nHow the national and local highway network contributes to and enables planning policy to be developed effectively and sustainably across the country is a clear requirement of government at all levels\n.\n \n2.6.&#xa0; \nA clear understanding of the \npurposes of the highway network for all its customers will help develop that strategy and its development will also allow clear accountability for delivery of the strategy to be set out to the different bodies required to deliver it.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.&#xa0; \nThe contribution that the \nhighway\n netw\nork is required to make to a range of policy areas should \nbe clearly defined in\n the strategy described above\n in our response to Question 2\n. In order to develop a robust prediction to underpin development of the network a series of \nkey steps should be undertaken a\nlongside existing economic modelling tools\n. \n3.2.&#xa0; \nThe development of these st\neps should be undertaken by all engaged in the sector including\n the gove\nrnment, \nHighways Agency and related authorities on the adjoining networks\n, groups representing the sector and the supply chain to the sector. \n3.3.&#xa0; \nThe steps CIHT propose, based on a system\ns thinking approach, are:\n&#xa0;\n3.3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIdentify the different classes of groups\n (customers)\n who are reliant on the network. As well as \ndifferent \nusers of the network these customer groups could in\nclude amongst others, adjacent communities, non-\nusers of the network, th\ne environment, her\nitage and the highway asset itself.\n3.3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIdentify \nthe different purposes that the network is required to deli\nver to different customer groups\n3.3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAnalysis to confirm how the network will best meet the different purposes identified and to identify \nwhat investment is required to meet those different purposes of all customers.\n3.3.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConfirm the wider benefits that will arise from meeting the needs of all customer groups and thereby define the Value for Money of the investment.\n3.3.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIdentify \nareas where investmen\nt in other modes will better meet\n the needs of customers and identify the parties best able to deliver that investment\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.4.&#xa0; \nThe investment identified\n should b\ne\n considered alongside the wider econ\nomic\n need\ns\n of the surrounding area. Action for \nR\noads proposes \nroute based studies as the basis for d\neveloping investment strategies. In order to be effective,\n these strategies need to work closely with LE\nP\ns, \nLTB\ns and local authorities to ensure all appropriate customer needs are addressed.\n3.5.&#xa0; \nI\nn proposing the additional\n analysis outlined above it should be recognised that the strategic road network is required to d\neliver in such a complex environment\n there can never be a complete answer\n.\n \nI\nt is important that benefits are delivered effectively\n against a pipeline with a hi\ngh degree of certainty\n rather than constant refinement of modelling that will never\n be able to\n present a complete\n or accurate\n picture. \n3.6.&#xa0; \nCIHT suggest that the work proposed above should be carried out alongside existing appraisal of schemes in the short ter\nm.\n3.7.&#xa0; \nThe role of the regulator identified in the response to question 1 in identifying the needs of customers is an important one t\no be developed as the Highways Agency changes form.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.&#xa0; \nSignificant improvements to the reliability\n, \nefficiency\n and safety\n of travel have already been m\na\nde on the S\nRN \nby in\nvestment utilising technology. T\nhe increasing \nlength of the network utilising Manage\nd \nM\notorway techniques to \nincrease capacity are welcome. T\nhe technology available to vehicle users, both in terms of safety and i\nnformation have developed and wi\nll continue t\no\n develop rapidly.\n4.2.&#xa0; \nThe reformed operator of the network needs to work closely with \nthe vehicle development sector to maximise the benefit of investm\nents both to vehicles and the network. Having c\nlarity \nof customer needs and purposes as outlined in the response to the earlier question\n will play an important role in that development.\n4.3.&#xa0; \nInfor\nmation n\needs \no\nf customers across the whole \ntransport network, including rail should\n be continuously developed from a customer’s perspective. There have been welcome improvements in the information available to customers for end to end journeys which includ\ne walking and cycl\ning. This information needs to i\nnform the development of the network\n and will\n r\nequire very different\n skills\n, based around understanding of customer analysis and needs\n to be bought into the reformed Highways \nA\ngency from different sectors.\n \n4.4.&#xa0; \nThe way in which technology changes customer behaviour over time will need to be monitored by the reformed Highways Agency and incorporated into the investment planning of the network.\n4.5.&#xa0; \nProviders on the network should be given the freedom to utilise techno\nlogy in how they deliver services to customers of the network rather than a prescriptive specification of how they provide a service. Continuing improvements in the safety of road workers, \nbought\n about by the use of technology should be encouraged.\n4.6.&#xa0; \nThe use\n of technology to regulate access to the network in order to manage traffic volumes\n and release extra capacity\n will be a key area for \ndevelopment, but will require a\n holistic approach with adjoining highway authorities to deliver an effective solution.\n4.7.&#xa0; \nThe\n use of BIM technology on the highways network should be a focus for the reformed Highways Agency and its supply chain. The use of technology to develop better understanding of whole asset information will lead to more efficient management of the service.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1.&#xa0; \nThe amount of income derived from Vehicle Excise Duty and fuel du\nty is significantly more than that spent on the roads network. Parts of the network, particularly the local roads network have significant requirements for investment to maintain the standard of the asset and this has been partially recognised in the addit\nional expenditure proposed in Action for Roads.\n5.2.&#xa0; \nExperience from around the wor\nld suggests that there is no\n single model that provides an appropriate model for a reformed strategic network to follow\n in terms of increasing investment\n. In many countries the u\nse of tolling to provide an income stream to finance investment has been successful. Clearly introduction\n of a widespread n\national road user charging scheme is not envisaged in Action for \nR\noads\n.\n \nIt \nshould not be ruled out \nhowever, \nuntil a clearer picture o\nf the ultimate investment need of the network, informed by analysis of customer needs has \nb\neen made. \n5.3.&#xa0; \nIt is also s\nensible not to focus on the\n argument between public or private investment. Each is likely to play a role in funding inv\nestment in the future n\network, and more \nopportunities should be found for Public Private Partnerships in which the Government invests and takes on a minority shareholding. \n5.4.&#xa0; \nT\nhere have been valuable lessons learnt in the highways sector through the use of Private Finance funded s\nchemes on both the strategic and local networks. Benefits have included:\n&#xa0;\n5.4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA whole life view of service delivery over a significant period of time, with investment occurring over a short initial period follow\ned by a long period of service delivery t\no defined performance \nstandards that reflect the needs\n of service users.\n5.4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPrivate sector providers, given the certainty of a clear programme of service delivery\n have invested in the development of new techniques and products, leading to efficiency improveme\nnts in service delivery.\n5.4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA focus on managing long term asset management techniques as risks of performance have been moved to the service provider\n&#xa0;\n5.5.&#xa0; \nT\nhese benefits, combined with a clear consideration of customer needs\n outlined above\n \nare consistent with man\ny of the features of \na regulated asset base\n model used in other sectors. This model may \nprovide the basis for a more robust funding model for the sector. Such a model could incorporate both public and private investment, dependant on different needs of the\n network an\nd\n could incorporate user charging at a future date.\n5.6.&#xa0; \nThe experience of other sectors, particularly in the rail sector will be useful in this regard. There would be a particular need for clear regulation to consider the needs for investment in the\n asset base.\n5.7.&#xa0; \nThe move towards a regulated asset base may well present the opportunity for innovative and new funding streams as the supply chain is broadened by entrants from a wider base of sectors. For example the local highway network in particular cont\nains significant amounts of other regulated assets, such as water, telecoms and power networks, all of which require continued investment. The \nscope for efficiencies seem\n potentially high. \n5.8.&#xa0; \nThe role for specific investment by business to improve networks t\nhat facilitate economic development is one that is already used in the sector but the development of LEPs and LTB’s would point to a wider consideration of the benefits of an enhanced approach.\n5.9.&#xa0; \nA reformed Highways Agency should be less constrained, more ag\nile and be able to take quicker decisions to attract and encourage more investors.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1.&#xa0; \nThe standard of highway expertise in the United Kingdom is very high and is recognised worldwide. Our networks are amongst the safest in the world and our professional standards are highly regarded. The United Kingdom\n has contributed significantly to the development of highw\nays as an increasingly more effi\ncient industry.\n6.2.&#xa0; \nIt is therefore appropriate that Action for Roads proposes an incremental change to the management of the Strategic road network that builds on that expertise. Nevertheless the changes that are required do require \na boldness\n in approach in order that the i\nnvestment proposed can be used effectively to deliver real \nimprovements to the network over time. It would be a mistake to view an incremental change as only a small one requiring minimal investment. \n6.3.&#xa0; \nAll of the groups need to encourage the entry of, and d\nevelopment of young people into the sector to provide the resource required to deliver future investment.\n6.4.&#xa0; \nOur views on the cha\nnges required are set out below:\n&#xa0;\n6.4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment:\n6.4.1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department for Transport and government need to clearly define the role of the t\nransportation network in delivering the policies of the government. Action for Roads envisages the publication of a draft national policy statement on national networks in 2013. This needs to clearly set out the relationship of the strategic network to oth\ner networks, including the local highway network. It also needs to demonstrate how the policy links to both national and local planning policy, setting out a clear framework for the responsibility and accountability of developing the network. It should cle\narly define the role of government in relation to the reformed Highways Agency.\n6.4.1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe government needs to be bold in recognising the capabilities required of a reformed Highways Agency. In particular it needs to ensure that the importance of understanding how customer needs should be addressed in the new model for operation and be speci\nfic about how those needs are protected and monitored by a regulator or other arrangement. Those capabilities are likely to include a clear appreciation of customer requirements, understanding of wider stakeholder needs and an expanded commercial capabilit\ny from other sectors. \n6.4.1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a need to maintain strong leadership through the process of change whilst the new requirements for the reformed Highways Agency are being fully defined and sourced, using the freedom of the new organisation to bring in new s\nkills and capabilities. This will ensure that momentum on delivering the pipeline of investment set out in Action for Roads is maintained.\n6.4.1.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment needs to provide the certainty required by the supply chain side of the sector to invest in resource and c\napability to deliver the investment envisaged. The Roads Investment Strategy needs to be confirmed and be committed to quickly by all parties so that the Highways Agency can develop a robust pipeline of requirements for its supply chain.\n6.4.1.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment should \nrecognise that the success of an improved strategic network in meeting customer needs cannot be met without the local road network being also considered as part of the solution that customers require.\n&#xa0;\n6.4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA reformed Highways Agency:\n6.4.2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Highways Agency needs \nthe capacity and capability to change\n, \nbuilding on the expertise that it has built up and maintaining strong leadership. This must not be lost. \n6.4.2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNeeds to develop an understanding of the wide range of purposes that the network has and further develop its cu\nstomer relationship capabilities, bringing in capability from other sectors as required. It should build links across sectors to do so.\n6.4.2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNeeds to recognise the importance of linking to authorities with responsibility for the local road network and economic \ngrowth including LEPs and LTBs\n6.4.2.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nShould develop its relationship with the supply chain to give it the freedom to deliver the investment it manages – it should concentrate on ensuring that the investment is focussed in the areas that best meet its \ncustomer’s \nneeds.\n \nWhilst the reformed Highways Agency will still be subject to European Procurement Regulations other unnecessary procedures should be removed.\n6.4.2.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNeeds to provide information on the pipeline of requirements set out in Action for Roads to its supply chai\nn as soon as possible.\n&#xa0;\n6.4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSupply Chain:6.4.3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe supply chain needs to recognise the opportunity offered by Action for Roads and start to invest in the resource and capability required to deliver a significant amount of investment.\n6.4.3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt needs to support the reforme\nd Highways Agency and government in developing an improved sector, bringing expertise from across the world to deliver the investment provided.\n6.4.3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt needs to recognise the importance of focussing on customers on the network and bring its expertise of deliver\ning services across both the strategic and local highway networks to help the Highways Agency change its role.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe would welcome the opportunity to expand upon our response as required.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
