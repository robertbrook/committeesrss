As the ruts become impassable even by these vehicles, they leave the green lanes and cause even more damage to surrounding land. The vehicles adversely affect wildlife and the noise they make is very intrusive for walkers looking for solace from the countryside.&#xa0;I  expressly support the formal submissions made by the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA), by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), by the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG) and by the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA).&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
