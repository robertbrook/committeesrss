[[[BACKGROUND]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The RAC is the UKâ€™s most progressive motoring organisation, representing more than seven million members, providing services for both private and business motorists, and is committed to making driving easier, safer, more affordable and more enjoyable for all road users. &#xa0;We employ more than 1700 patrols providing roadside assistance across the entire UK road network and through this we have significant insight into how the road networks are managed and maintained.&#xa0;There is little doubt that significant challenges lie ahead for those responsible both for strategic and local roads with congestion set to grow as a consequence of growth returning to the economy. This is compounded by the current condition of the roads which have degenerated as a consequence of several harsh winters and a lack of investment in maintenance and also the longer term need to reduce the environmental impact of road transport.&#xa0;We, therefore, welcome the opportunity to provide evidence to the Transport Select Committee as part of its review of the Strategic Road Network following the publication of its Action for Roads command paper.&#xa0;&#xa0;General policies&#xa0;Environmental benefits&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
