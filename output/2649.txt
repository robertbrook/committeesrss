Oral Evidence from Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care. Q15               CHRE, November 2012. An approach to assuring continuing fitness to practise based on right-touch regulation principles. Available at: http://www.professionalstandards.org.uk/library/document-detail?id=69393f02-d5a3-4ae0-a1bb-a7b437dc3485. We stressed that mechanisms for assuring the on-going fitness to practise of registrants should be based on an evaluation and quantification of the risks presented by the regulated professions. We urged regulators to develop ‘a clear understanding of what professionals do, and of the context in which they do it’ in order to understand and quantify the risks, and target their regulatory response.               The Council paper states that ‘it is anticipated that if a nurse or midwife is not able to revalidate, they will lapse from the register’.               As above: ‘it is anticipated that if a nurse or midwife is not able to revalidate, they will lapse from the register’.
