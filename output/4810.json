"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by ADCS The Association of Directors of Children's Services \n(ADCS) \nvalues the\n opportunity to respond to the c\nall for evidence by the Education \nSelect Committee on the Ofsted Social Care Annual Report 2012 – 1\n3\n.  \nADCS is the professional association for directors of children's services an\nd their senior management teams.\n \nUnder the Children Act 2004, the DCS\n \nis\n the \nchief\n officer responsible for the \ndischarge of local authority functions for children’s social care\n. T\nhe DCS provides a clear and unambiguous line of \nprofessional\n accountability for children’s services as well\n being \nprofessional\nly responsible\n for the leadership, strategy and effectiveness of local authority children’s services and, as such, has a particular interest in the \npublication of the Ofsted Social Care Annual Report. \nADCS \nbelieve\ns\n that inspection\n, by Ofsted\n, of the local authority, has\n the potential to be helpful\n if it supports improvement in outcomes f\nor children and their families and \nour response is set in this context.\n2012 – 13 was the first year that the Ofsted Annual Report has been split into two separate publications, one encom\npassing \nsocial care exclusively and another, published in early December 2013, focusing predominantly on the education aspect of Ofsted’s remit. It is not clear what benefit this brings to the workforce\n or the public\n, but the publication of two reports \nsep\narating the local authority’s work in respect of children’s social care from that of its role in quality assuring  school standards\n, does not reflect the co-dependencies that exist\n \nwhen improving outcomes for children and young people.\nA\nDCS welcomes Ofsted\n’s focus on improving standards in children’s social care. All directors of children’s services\n, whether their services have been judged\n by Ofs\nt\ned\n to be \n‘\noutstanding\n’\n or \n‘\ninadequate\n’\n, are committed to improving services for the children in their local area. \nOn publication of the Ofsted Annual Report, Sir Michael\n Wilshaw\n called for \n“strong and stable leadership to bring about sustained improvement in the help\n,\n care and protection of ou\nr most vulnerable young people”, ADCS agrees with this laudable aim and acknowledges the crucial \nrole of\n strong and stable leadership teams, not exclusively the director of children’s services but also the wider management team\n,\n in delivering good, sustain\nable services. Yet \nOfsted's approach to inspection, namely the single word judgment, is not conducive to \nleadership stability\n. A judgment of inadequate\n after the inspection of local authority children’s services\n, and the subsequent instability this can cau\nse, can be detrimental to the improvement journey of a local authority.\n In one local authority, the vacancy rate amongst children’s social workers \nincreased from 4% to 40% after a judgment of “inadequate”. Other children’s services departments, such as Bir\nmingham City Council, \nhave publically stated the impact that staff \nvacancies has had when trying to improve their service. \nA \nmove to \nnarrative judgment\ns, as opposed to a single word judgment,\n would allow local authorities to work with their local partner\ns\n,\n including health, police and education\n, in a less punitive environment\n to form an action plan to  i\nmprove\n services\n in their local area. \nHelping, protecting and caring for vulnerable children, young people and their families is a complex multi agency \nbusiness that is not eased by the febrile climate that children’s services leaders sometimes find themselves in during the immediate aftermath of an ‘inadequate’ inspection judgment.\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
