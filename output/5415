[normal]Written evidence submitted by[bold] Symphony Environmental Technologies[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Symphony is a British 
[normal]quoted 
[normal]company, selling British oxo-biodegradable technology and earning foreign currency for the UK around the world.  We are specialists in oxo-biodegradable plastics, and I have myself been working in the British plastics industry for the past 40 years.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am having difficulty 
[normal]with 
[normal]the evidence given to your Committee by 
[normal]some of the witnesses.  
[normal]I agree with 
[normal]the recyclers
[normal] that bio-based “compostable” plastic cannot be recycled with conventional plastic, and that it should not therefore be encouraged for plastic shopping bags (see the Austrian TCKT report of Nov 2013 commissioned by EuPC).  However, this is not the case with oxo-biodegradable plastics, for the reasons given in Roediger laboratories report of 2012, and their supplementary report of 2013, having reviewed
[normal] the
[normal] TCKT report.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the last two years Symphony have sold enough d
[normal]2
[normal]w masterbatch to make 300,000 tons of oxo-biodegradable plastic 
[normal]products, and 
[normal]we estimate that other suppliers sold at least the same amount, making a total of more than 600,000 tons. We know that oxo-biodegradable plastic products have been successfully recycled for the past 10 years by customers of ours around the world such as Altapro, Bemis, Fujairah, Polybless, Poly-America, Verolene
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]etc. In the UK we know that until recently Tesco’s carrier bags were oxo-biodegradable, and that they were successfully recycled by Jayplas.  In those ten years we have heard no reports of any difficulty encountered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our experience is entirely consistent with the Roediger report, that oxo-bio can be safely recycled, 
[normal]and
[normal] the recyclers have presented the Committee with no technical evidence and no experience to the contrary.  Not one of them 
[normal]was able to say 
[normal]that they had recycled ox
[normal]o-biodegradable plastic and 
[normal]encountered problems.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Chase Plastics say that oxo-bio is not the environmental option, but in its 2011 report for the UK Government, and in its 2012 
[normal]supplementary 
[normal]report
[normal],
[normal] Intertek found that it had better environmental credentials than conventional plastic, bio-based plastic, paper, or cotton. Chase Plastics’ statement that “i
[normal]n carbon terms they are significantly more burdensome on the environment than a reprocessed plastic bag” is not therefore correct.
[normal] Intertek also found that plastic carrier bags are not “single-use” bags.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is no reason why an oxo
[normal]-bio bag should not be made with
[normal] reprocessed material, and the OPA has proposed 
[normal]to the Committee 
[normal]an oxo-bio bag with 40% recycled content as the IDEAL bag. Chase Plastics say “A reprocessed plastic carrier bag, with its admirable environmental credentials, also can be sturdy and quite fit for repeated uses.
[normal]”
[normal]  This will not be affected by the oxo-bio additive, and the reason 
[normal]why 
[normal]the Tesco bags failed was because they were not properly made.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Mr. Baxter of BPI said on 8
[normal]th 
[normal]January “we have no commercial interest in supermarket carrier bags whatsoever. We do not make them. We do not sell them.”  Chase plastics confirmed on 6
[normal]th
[normal] December that they too are not involved in reprocessing carrier bags.”
[normal]The proposed exemption is for carrier bags, so 
[normal]I can see
[normal] no basis for saying that their business would be damaged.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]W[bold]ith regard to [bold]damp-proof membranes, the British Packaging and Industrial Films Association Standard 6/83A[bold]-1995[bold] for polyethylene damp [bold]proof membranes specifies LDPE as a suitable material and allows “segregated traceable recyclates [bold]of such.”    Therefore, manufacturers do not use recyclate made from post-consumer plastic waste such as plastic carrier bags which is not segregated and traceable.  The concerns expressed to the Committee by the recyclers on this issue are not therefore relevant to the Inquiry.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Further, damp proof membranes are made from LDPE, but 
[normal]Supermarket carrier bags are normally made from HDPE + CaCO3, which is not the same material. These carrier bags would not therefore be recycled into long-life films but into similar short-life products, as to which Roediger says “If
[normal] the new product to be made from recyclate which contains a pro-degradant formulation is intended for short-life uses such as garbage-sacks, bin-liners, shopping bags, bread wrappers etc. the effect of any pro-degradant formulation is unlikely to manifest itself before the end of the intended service-life.  Biodegradability for such items is in any event desirable, because a proportion of them will find their way into the land or sea environments, where they could otherwise subsist for decades after being discarded. “
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The reason why oxo-bio additive is included @
[normal] 
[normal]1% is that it will not work if added at a lower rate.  Therefore if the new product was made with 50% 
[normal]recycled oxo-biodegradable plastic
[normal] it would contain only half the amount of additive required to create oxo-biodegradability. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Even if HDPE + CaCO3 did find its way into damp-proof membranes oxo-biodegradation requires oxygen, so it cannot proceed where the dpm is covered with concrete, except if the edges (which are not acting as a dpm) are protruding.  Stabilisers would be necessary only for building films intended to be exposed to the open air
[normal], and stabilisers such as HALS are routinely included
[normal].
[normal] The 
[normal]stabiliser
[normal] would be added by the manufacturer of the new product, having regard to conditions and 
[normal]Standards
[normal] in his country
[normal] for the particular product
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DEFRA has found no evidence that biodegradable plastic bags of any kind encourage litter
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]BPI claim that the Roediger report shows that at even a 20% inclusion rate tensile performance drops by 16% (MD) and 24% (TD) immediately and after 300 hours of ageing by 25% (MD) and 39% (TD).  We have asked Roediger laboratories about this, 
[normal]and their response 
[normal]i
[normal]s that elongation was higher and variations could be caused by the difference in polymer grade used. 
[normal] 
[normal]They confirm that their 
[normal]report 
[normal]shows
[normal] that the blend 
[normal]containing oxo biodegradable ages just as well 
[normal]as 
[normal]compounds that do not contain oxo biodegradable
[normal]. 
[normal]Roediger 
[normal]see no reason to change their 
[normal]2012 
[normal]view
[normal], confirmed in 2013,
[normal] that 
[normal]“plastic products made with oxo-biodegradable technology may be recycled without any significant detriment to the newly formed recycled product.”  [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The fifth paragraph of the BPI evidence of 13.1.14 is particularly misleading.  First they say that the UK plastic recycling sector reprocessed 28
[normal]0,000 tonnes of product in 2012,
[normal]  
[normal]but t
[normal]his was all product
[normal]s
[normal], not just carrier bags (which is what the proposed exemption is for)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Second, Roediger confirms that there would be absolutely no need for stabilisers 
[normal]for short-life uses such as garbage-sacks, bin-liners, shopping bags, bread wrappers etc., nor for thick cross-section products such as garden furniture. The only need for stabilisers would therefore be for long-life films intended for exposure to the open environment – a very much smaller quantity than the 
[normal]280,000 tonnes to which Mr. Baxter refers.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Third, he says “a
[normal]ssuming an addition rate 
[normal][for stabiliser] 
[normal]of 2% - this will increase the cost to UK recyclers of £40 tonne.”  A tonne represents 110,000 carrier bags, so the cost would be 0.0003
[normal] per bag
[normal], which 
[normal]would be amply covered by
[normal] the 0.05 proposed to be charged.
[normal]  Moreover, the cost is not to UK recyclers at all. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would like to address Novamont’s comments (14.1.14) on the international standards applicable to oxo-biodegradable plastic.  Standard BS8472:2011 - “Methods for the assessment of the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]oxo-biodegradation of plastics and of the
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]phyto-toxicity of the residues in controlled laboratory conditions.”  These are detailed scientific tests to be performed in order to demonstrate degradability, biodegradability, and non-toxicity.  Although conducted in a laboratory, they have been prescribed by the Standards body for the purpose of measuring so far as possible the performance of the product in the open environment – otherwise there would be no point in doing them.  An arbitrary pass-fail test is not prescribed because it is for the end-user or government to decide on the basis of the test report whether the material is or is not suitable for the application in the environmental conditions for which it is intended.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The use of ISO 17556 is not confined to oxo-biodegradable plastics, but it is used to measure the biodegradation of such plastics.  This is the standard used by the 
[normal]Technical Research Institute of Sweden and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in their peer-reviewed work published in Vol. 96 of the journal of Polymer Degradation &amp; Stability (2011) at pages 919-928.  It shows 91% biodegradation in a soil environment within 24 months.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Professor Thompson said on 8
[normal]th
[normal] January 
[normal]that this
[normal] research required the plastic material to essentially be cooked at high temperature prior to being subjected to biodegradation testing. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the process, as might be expected from a professor who is not a polymer scientist.  This is a legitimate way, prescribed by the Standards organisations, to obtain oxidised material for biodegradation testing.   It speeds up the process but does not invalidate the tests – otherwise there would be no point in doing them.  It is necessary to speed up the test for an oxo-biodegradable plastic because it is designed so that it will not start to degrade until the expiry of the useful-life specified by the government or end-user.  In a UK environment the abiot
[normal]ic degradation of a carrier bag would take from 3
[normal]-12 months, and at the end of that time it would not be visible and would not be toxic and would not be plastic.  It is not 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]important how long 
[normal]the 
[normal]biodegradation phase lasts – materials which are obviously biodegradable such as leaves or twigs would take much longer to biodegrade.
[normal] Biodegradati
[normal]on would be progressive and would
[normal] occur concurre
[normal]ntly with abiotic degradation as
[normal] molecular weight
[normal] reduces.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In conclusion we agree with the OPA that 5p should be charged on oxo-bio carrier bags containing 40% recycled content, and 10p on other types of bags.  We would have no objection if the lower charge were 
[normal]applied only 
[normal]to 
[normal]such 
[normal]bags 
[normal]as are 
[normal]made in the UK/EU, as the 5p charge would more than cover the extra cost of manufacturing here, and would help to create 
[normal]local 
[normal]jobs.
