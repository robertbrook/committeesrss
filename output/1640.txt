[[[ classified as Restricted Byways.   ]]]&#xa0;My suggestion relates to saving time and funds of local authority officers. It simplifies the law and safeguards special areas of countryside from noise and pollution for safe and quiet enjoyment by the public. &#xa0;It is to stop off-roading, with mechanically propelled vehicles, in all National Parks.   Probably the simplest way of stopping 4x4s and trail bikes etc. would be for all unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) in National Parks to be re-designated as Restricted Byways. This would be in line with the statutory origin of Restricted Byways under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act and the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act. Furthermore the latter Act allows National Park Authorities to apply Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) recognising the special nature of National Parks.  Having no off-roading with mechanically propelled vehicles would further the purposes of National Parks which are:&#xa0;1. Conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage2. Promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of National Parks by the Public.&#xa0;Savings: not having to maintain rights of way damaged by motorised vehicles.Saving officers time in considering increasing requests for Traffic Regulation Orders in National Parks. &#xa0;Avoiding accidents by providing rights of way that are safe for horseriders, pedal cyclists and walkers.  &#xa0;I have some knowledge from living near the South Downs. When many paths were classified as RUPPS, there was increasing heavy use by motorised vehicles – trail bikes and 4x4s, resulting in damage to paths. Some horseriders feared to go there any more. It was a wonderful improvement and relief when restricted byways were introduce by statute. As there are no Byways Open to All Traffic in our area, we are able to conserve the natural beauty in this National Park. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;30 August 2013&#xa0;
