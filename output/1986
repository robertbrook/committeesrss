default1.1
default              
defaultHS1 Limited (HS1 Ltd) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Government’s post legislative assessment of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (Supplementary) Act 2008 (“Act”).
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultWe agree with the assessment set out in the 
defaultSecretary of State
default (
defaultSoS
default)
default 
defaultmemorandum that the legislation works as intended, and is an important component of the overall regulatory framework for HS1 Ltd. 
defaultOur response
default provides further detail to support this view.
default&#xa0;default2.0default              defaultBackgrounddefault&#xa0;default2
default.1
default              
defaultHigh Speed 1 (HS1), formerly known as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, is a 109 kilometre high speed rail line which connects London and the Channel Tunnel, passing through Kent.  HS1 is operated by HS1 Ltd under a 30 year Concession Agreement with the 
defaultSoS
default for Transport. HS1 is Britain's first high speed railway and the UK leg of the Paris-Brussels
default-Köln-Amsterdam-London (PBKAL) TEN-T priority project. The line successfully carries international and domestic passenger high speed services 
defaultand
default freight services. 
defaultHS1 has delivered significant time-savings for Kent commuters and international travellers. Performance is currently at world-class levels.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultHS1 Ltd is regulated through a framework of primary and secondary legislation enacted by the UK Government. The regulatory framework has been established to recognise the unique characteristics of HS1 while seeking to ensure that, as much as possible, HS1 Ltd is subject to similar regulatory supervision to the classic 
defaultUK 
defaultrail network.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultRegulatory supervision of HS1 Ltd is undertaken by the 
defaultOffice of Rail Regulation (
defaultORR
default)
default and the 
defaultDepartment for Transport (
defaultDFT
default)
default. The statutory framework for economic regulation of HS1 Ltd is derived from three main pieces of legislation
default: 
default the Railways Act 1993
default;
default CTRL Act 1996, as amended by CTRL (Supplementary) Act 2008 
default(“Act”); 
defaultand the Railways Infrastructure (Access and Management) Regulations 2005 as amended in 2009.
default&#xa0;
default The
default latter r
defaultegulations are expected to be further amended by the Recast Regulations currently under consideration for UK transposition.
default The pieces of legislation cannot be considered in isolation as the regulatory framework requires all of them working together.

defaultThe regulatory fra
defaultmework in which HS1 operates, which includes the HS1 Concession Agreement (between the 
defaultSoS
default and HS1 Ltd) 
defaultis compliant with the Directives and UK legislation
default set out above
default.
default&#xa0;
default3default.0default              defaultHS1 Ltd’s Assessment default&#xa0;default3.1
default              
defaultThe HS1 sale process has been a success generating £2.1bn in income for the taxpayer in 2010 with the opportunity to realise further taxpayer benefit in 2040.  It provides a framework for on-going delivery of important railway infrastructure services of benefit to UK plc. Significant 
defaultprivate investment such as that delivered by our shareholders relies on the existence of an independent regulatory body – such as the ORR. 
default&#xa0;

default.

default 
default              
defaultHS1 Ltd believes that the 
defaultCTRL (Supplementary) 
defaultAct
default 2008 works as intended, forming an important part of the independent regulatory framework. The Act
default:
default&#xa0;
default 3.3
default              
defaultThe
default existing HS1 regulatory regime and legislative structure works well and is effected through a combination of statutory duties (under primary and secondary legislation) and contractual rights that are in each case conferred on the ORR and/or the 
defaultSoS
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultThe Railways Act continues to regulate much of the operation and management of the other railways in the UK.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe Railways Act has been
default 
defaultdis
default-applied for the purposes of HS1 by specific legislation – the CTRL Acts. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultThe Railway
defaults Act is mentioned here because
default&#xa0;
defaultthe provisions 
defaultit contains 
defaultwill apply to the 
defaulttrain operators
default which use 
defaultHS1
default and to Network Rail in relation to the licensing, the granting of access and the operation of the domestic railway tha
defaultt interfaces with High Speed 1. I
defaultt is 
defaultimportant to note
default both the similarities and differences between the 
defaultUK
default regulatory regime and the regulatory regime that applies to 
defaultHS1
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultThe HS1 Concession Agreement brings together all the key pieces of legislation applicable to HS1 under a commercial contract with the 
defaultSoS
default.   
defaultAny changes to the regulatory 
defaultor
default legislation framework 
defaultin relation to HS1 Ltd would be subject to the change of l
defaultaw provisions outlined within the HS1 Concession Agr
defaulteement.
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultIn relation to the specifics of the Act, we fully support that the clarifications made on the role of the ORR and its ability to levy a fee, the confirmation of the Railway Act carve outs, the 
defaultconfirmation 
defaultthat
default HS1 is now a fully operational railway and the ability for the 
defaultSoS
default to provide financial assistance are essential and necessary
default for the HS1 regulatory framework to be successful.
default&#xa0;
default4.0default              defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultThe pieces of legislation outlined in 2.3 above are essential to the HS1 regulatory framework and the HS1 Concession Agreement.  
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultThat the Act 
defaultunder post legislative scrutiny 
defaultis a key piece of legislation shap
defaulting

default.  It
default 
defaultis our view that it is fit for purpose and should 
defaultbe retained
