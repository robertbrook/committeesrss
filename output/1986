[normal]Overview[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]HS1 Limited (HS1 Ltd) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Government’s post legislative assessment of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (Supplementary) Act 2008 (“Act”).
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]We agree with the assessment set out in the 
[normal]Secretary of State
[normal] (
[normal]SoS
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]memorandum that the legislation works as intended, and is an important component of the overall regulatory framework for HS1 Ltd. 
[normal]Our response
[normal] provides further detail to support this view.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.0[bold]              [bold]Background[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal]High Speed 1 (HS1), formerly known as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, is a 109 kilometre high speed rail line which connects London and the Channel Tunnel, passing through Kent.  HS1 is operated by HS1 Ltd under a 30 year Concession Agreement with the 
[normal]SoS
[normal] for Transport. HS1 is Britain's first high speed railway and the UK leg of the Paris-Brussels
[normal]-Köln-Amsterdam-London (PBKAL) TEN-T priority project. The line successfully carries international and domestic passenger high speed services 
[normal]and
[normal] freight services. 
[normal]HS1 has delivered significant time-savings for Kent commuters and international travellers. Performance is currently at world-class levels.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]HS1 Ltd is regulated through a framework of primary and secondary legislation enacted by the UK Government. The regulatory framework has been established to recognise the unique characteristics of HS1 while seeking to ensure that, as much as possible, HS1 Ltd is subject to similar regulatory supervision to the classic 
[normal]UK 
[normal]rail network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Regulatory supervision of HS1 Ltd is undertaken by the 
[normal]Office of Rail Regulation (
[normal]ORR
[normal])
[normal] and the 
[normal]Department for Transport (
[normal]DFT
[normal])
[normal]. The statutory framework for economic regulation of HS1 Ltd is derived from three main pieces of legislation
[normal]: 
[normal] the Railways Act 1993
[normal];
[normal] CTRL Act 1996, as amended by CTRL (Supplementary) Act 2008 
[normal](“Act”); 
[normal]and the Railways Infrastructure (Access and Management) Regulations 2005 as amended in 2009.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The
[normal] latter r
[normal]egulations are expected to be further amended by the Recast Regulations currently under consideration for UK transposition.
[normal] The pieces of legislation cannot be considered in isolation as the regulatory framework requires all of them working together.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]The regulatory fra
[normal]mework in which HS1 operates, which includes the HS1 Concession Agreement (between the 
[normal]SoS
[normal] and HS1 Ltd) 
[normal]is compliant with the Directives and UK legislation
[normal] set out above
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold].0[bold]              [bold]HS1 Ltd’s Assessment [bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]The HS1 sale process has been a success generating £2.1bn in income for the taxpayer in 2010 with the opportunity to realise further taxpayer benefit in 2040.  It provides a framework for on-going delivery of important railway infrastructure services of benefit to UK plc. Significant 
[normal]private investment such as that delivered by our shareholders relies on the existence of an independent regulatory body – such as the ORR. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]HS1 Ltd believes that the 
[normal]CTRL (Supplementary) 
[normal]Act
[normal] 2008 works as intended, forming an important part of the independent regulatory framework. The Act
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 3.3
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] existing HS1 regulatory regime and legislative structure works well and is effected through a combination of statutory duties (under primary and secondary legislation) and contractual rights that are in each case conferred on the ORR and/or the 
[normal]SoS
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]The Railways Act continues to regulate much of the operation and management of the other railways in the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]The Railways Act has been
[normal] 
[normal]dis
[normal]-applied for the purposes of HS1 by specific legislation – the CTRL Acts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]The Railway
[normal]s Act is mentioned here because
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the provisions 
[normal]it contains 
[normal]will apply to the 
[normal]train operators
[normal] which use 
[normal]HS1
[normal] and to Network Rail in relation to the licensing, the granting of access and the operation of the domestic railway tha
[normal]t interfaces with High Speed 1. I
[normal]t is 
[normal]important to note
[normal] both the similarities and differences between the 
[normal]UK
[normal] regulatory regime and the regulatory regime that applies to 
[normal]HS1
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]The HS1 Concession Agreement brings together all the key pieces of legislation applicable to HS1 under a commercial contract with the 
[normal]SoS
[normal].   
[normal]Any changes to the regulatory 
[normal]or
[normal] legislation framework 
[normal]in relation to HS1 Ltd would be subject to the change of l
[normal]aw provisions outlined within the HS1 Concession Agr
[normal]eement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]In relation to the specifics of the Act, we fully support that the clarifications made on the role of the ORR and its ability to levy a fee, the confirmation of the Railway Act carve outs, the 
[normal]confirmation 
[normal]that
[normal] HS1 is now a fully operational railway and the ability for the 
[normal]SoS
[normal] to provide financial assistance are essential and necessary
[normal] for the HS1 regulatory framework to be successful.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.0[bold]              [bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]The pieces of legislation outlined in 2.3 above are essential to the HS1 regulatory framework and the HS1 Concession Agreement.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]That the Act 
[normal]under post legislative scrutiny 
[normal]is a key piece of legislation shap
[normal]ing
[normal] the HS1 regulatory regime
[normal].  It
[normal] 
[normal]is our view that it is fit for purpose and should 
[normal]be retained
[normal].
