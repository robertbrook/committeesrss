[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Post Office L
[normal]imited 
[normal]is
[normal] pleased to respond to the
[normal] 
[normal]Business, Innovation and Skills Select
[normal] Committee’s
[normal] call for evidence for their short
[normal] inquiry into 
[normal]the Government’s proposals for the privatisation of Royal Mail.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Post Office and Royal Mail are now separate businesses
[normal].
[normal] The 
[normal]conditions in which The Post Office operates were defined in the Postal Services Act 2011 which was in turn based upon the 
[normal]independent 
[normal]Hooper Review.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Act
[normal], 
[normal]which included the separation of Post Office and Royal Mail also ensures that Post Office Limited remains in public ownership 
[normal]but 
[normal]paves the way for possible future mutualisation of the Post Office. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government policy posi
[normal]tion for the Post Office to 2015 w
[normal]as 
[normal]outlined in the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills policy document
[normal], 
[normal]Securing The Post Office Network in the Digital Age
[normal], published in November 2010. The document stated the Government’s aims for The Post Offi
[normal]ce
[normal], which included that The Post Office is not for sale, there will be no programme of closures, while there will be funding of £1.34 billion 
[normal]to maintain and 
[normal]modernis
[normal]e 
[normal]the network
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government policy stated that there would be a minimum nationwide netw
[normal]ork of 11,500 post offices and that the network would meet the national and l
[normal]ocal Government access criteria.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1 
[normal]Prior to the
[normal] separation of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Post Office and Royal Mail 
[normal]an
[normal] historic long term
[normal] commercial agreement between
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]Post Office and Royal Mail
[normal] was signed
[normal] 
[normal]ensur
[normal]ing 
[normal]that 
[normal]a strong link remains between Royal Mail Group and the Post Office to continue to supply Royal Mail products and services through its network.
[normal] 
[normal]At the s
[normal]ame time separation has 
[normal]also 
[normal]enabled Post Office Limited to focus more on its wider business priorities such as the growth of financial services
[normal],
[normal] including mortgages and the launch of the post office current account.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 
[normal]Post Office Limited
[normal] and Royal Mail are committed to the relationship with Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene describing 
[normal]The Post Office as 
[normal]‘the best and strongest network in the country, by any yardstick
[normal].
[normal]’
[normal] This was reaffirmed in 2011 when she said 
[normal]‘There is already a ve
[normal]ry strong and enduring commercial relationship between the Post Office and Royal Mail. It is clearly in the interests of us all that this strong relationshi
[normal]p is maintained in the future
[normal].
[normal]’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 
[normal]T
[normal]he Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, Dr
[normal] Vince Cable MP
[normal], has confirmed that while the two companies are separate, The Post Office and Royal Mail will work together on a commercial basis.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘
[normal]The Post Office and Royal Mail will continue to work closely together. Each company needs the other. Post o
[normal]ffices carried out over 3 billion mail transactions for Royal Mail last year. The two companies are closely linked in the public mind, and are bound together by an overwhelming commercial imperative. There is currently a long-term contract in place between
[normal] the two companies, and there will continue to be a long-term commercial contract in place. The chief executive of Royal Mail has said that it would 
[normal]be “unthinkable”
[normal] that there will not always be a strong relationship between the Post Office and Royal Mail
[normal].
[normal]’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4 
[normal]The Post Office is clear that 
[normal]m
[normal]ails services remain a very important part of 
[normal]our business
[normal]. 
[normal]  
[normal]Paula Vennells, Post Office Limited,
[normal] Chief Executive says
[normal] ‘
[normal]we are absolutely committed to our relationship with Royal Mail
[normal] which is demonstrated by the 
[normal]10
[normal] year agreement
[normal] that we have in place
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Indeed we have been working closely with Royal Mail to develop new products including UK’s largest ‘click and collect’ network
[normal], which will ensure that both businesses are well placed to benefit from the rapidly growi
[normal]ng parcels market, which is at the centre of Royal Mail’s growth strategy
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government’s 
[normal]actions 
[normal]to strengthen Royal Mail’s future and enable access to private capital are designed to assist Royal Mail in maintaining and developing its market and services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The background context for Post Office Limited includes – 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3 
[normal]The provision of mails services on behalf of Royal Mail is a key element of the Post Office business and the conditions are in place to ensure that this remains the case. It is important to Post Office Limited to have a strong Royal Mail as that can only a
[normal]ssist our business and support 
[normal]the nationwide network of Post Office branches.
