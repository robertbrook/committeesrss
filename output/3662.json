"&#xa0;\nDuring the year\n,\n \nthe Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman carries \nout research to \nfind out\n what our customers thin\nk about our service\n.  This includes telephone calls by the independent market research company IFF Research with \nall of our customers whose complaints have been investigated\n,\n and \nwith \na random sample of those customers who have made an initial enquiry\n to\n us\n.  Since 2010\n,\n we have received feedback from over \n8,000 people \nthis way.  T\nhis financial year alone we have \nsought \nthe \nopinions\n \nof over 1,700 of those who \nhave \nused our service.\nWe welcome this opportunity to share the latest figures from our customer satisfaction surv\ney with the Public Administration Select Committee\n. We\n hope that \nthey\n \nprovide \nfurther context for the Committee’s \ninquiry into \nParliament’s Ombudsman\n Service\n.\nSatisfaction levels have\n remained stable over the past five\n years\n,\n even though the number of people seeking our help has increased.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOur research has found that whether or not someone’s complaint is \nupheld \nhas a significant impact on \ntheir\n satisfaction levels.  \nC\nustomers whose complaints were \ninvestigated and \nupheld had a 98% satisfaction level. \n \nIn cont\nrast\n,\n only\n 57% of those whose complaint\ns\n we investigated but did not upho\nld were satisfied with our customer service overall. \n In 2012/13 \nmore \ncomplaints \nwere \nupheld than in 2011/12 or \nthat \nhave been upheld so far in 2013/14.\n  This is reflected in \nthe higher satisfaction levels for 2012/13.\nThese findings are borne out by research by other comparable bodies.  In their annual \nreview\n of \n2012/13, the Financial Ombudsman Service found that \n90%\n \nof those consumers who said they felt they had \n‘\nwon\n’\n \ntheir \ncomplaint gave positive feedback on the level of service\n provided.  \nIn contrast,\n 48%\n o\nf those consumers who said \nthey had \n‘\nlost\n’\n \ntheir complaint gave positive feedback.\nC\nertain aspects of customer service really matter to \ne\nveryone\n who use\ns\n our service.\nMr B’s mother was admitted to hospital with malnutrition and dehydration, and did not survive.  Mr&#xa0;B came to us but, after a detailed consideration of events by our clinical advisers, we decided there was nothing more we could achieve.  Despite this, Mr B wrote telling us:‘You have now answered our concerns methodically and sensitively and given us clarification to questions we were struggling to interpret … we would like to thank you for your diligence and integrity.’Our customer satisfaction survey reveals that\n the main reasons our customers\n are satisfied with our service\n are:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe quality of the information and advice\n we provide\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur h\nelpful, polite and sympathetic staff\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBeing kept\n informed and good communication\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur\n professionalism\n.\n‘They found things out that we didn’t have access to and they have made the hospital be truthful and honest with us at last.’\n‘They are very tolerant – they are easy to talk to – they are professionals and are not taking sides.’\n‘I feel like this will be coming to an end now, because the Ombudsman has taken over, it will bring closure.  As it’s independent it will either be yes it’s their failure or no.  You can’t go higher than the ombudsman.’\n&#xa0;\n November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
