[normal]I have enjoyed the pleasure of walking along many of the ancient green lanes that our countryside has in profusion.  But the advent of 4x4s racing noisily down and up these ancient trackways and trashing them is a blight on our civilisation.  These vehicle
[normal]s and their occupants appear to have a scant regard for the impact they have on the landscape, the environment and the farmers who have worked the land and still are.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]So I am asking for the following proposals to be included in the ‘Deregulation Bill’:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]. 
[normal]All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]When a local authority declines
[normal] to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The rural economy is under intense attack at present with financial and weather constrai
[normal]nts; that is now more important that the beautiful green lanes are properly protected from the degradation, noise and aggressive behaviour meted out by the recreational 4x4s and motorbikes drivers.  If an extremely valuable source of income to the rural ec
[normal]onomy – tourism, is not to be lost a result.  I am one of these rural tourists who has become a statistic of lost income
[normal] following my last experience  in the Dales (Yorkshire).  The deep ruts were bad enough, then a succession of motorbikes travelling at g
[normal]reat speed with no regard to the walkers in their way.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I expressly support the formal submissions made by The Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), by the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), by the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA), an
[normal]d the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I look forward to a positive outcome of these proposals being included in the ‘Deregulation Bill’.
