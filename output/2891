[normal]in
[normal] proposing a strengthened scrutiny procedure in any future Bill the Government should normally use an existing model rather than creating a new variation; and they should explain the basis for the decision. If the Government exceptionally take the view that it is necessary to create yet another variation rather than using an existing statutory scrutiny procedure, the reasons should be set out clearly in the Explanatory Notes to the Bill and in the delegated powers memorandum.”
