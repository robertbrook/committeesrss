"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Wheels to Work Association (W2WA)\n (LTD0036)\nFollowing the Transport Committee call for evidence on local decision making on transport expenditure the W2WA would like to make the following points;\n&#xa0;The Wheels to Wor\nk Association feels that local authorities are not looking at what could be achieved in terms of cost effectiveness and value from investment in the kind of local transport projects which provide local value alongside more traditional public and community \ntransport options. \n&#xa0;\nMoney is invested in Bus and Community transport, which is of essential value of course. But little thought is given to allocating funds to projects which enable travel to work, education and training where public transport is not viab\nle or only available during business hours. A key example is Wheels to Work (W2W).\n&#xa0;&#xa0;An Overview of Wheels to Work.&#xa0;For people living in rural areas, the lack of transport can be a major barrier to accessing training, employment and education opportunitie\ns. Young people can face a situation where without a job they cannot afford to buy a car or motorcycle, and without a vehicle of their own and where public transport is inadequate or only available at certain times of the day they cannot travel to work or \ntake part in a training course or education. Some Wheels to Work programmes have different names, but the philosophy is shared. These schemes generally operate a loan system of a personal mode of transport, such as a moped, electric bike or bicycle, or pro\nvide another means for an individual to make their journey. This might be a minor grant towards vehicle repairs, subsidised driving lessons or provision of general travel advice. Individuals who have taken part in Wheels to Work have commented on how suppo\nrtive the scheme has been, how it has opened doors that would have previously been closed and how training has enhanced their career prospects.\n&#xa0;\nW2W schemes require clients to have a firm offer of employment, training or further education in order to quali\nfy for assistance, although some schemes do encourage applications before the placement is secured. The second main criterion is that there is no suitable alternative transport solution available. For many clients this could mean that they are required to \nwork shift patterns that are outside the times of public transport provision.\n&#xa0;\nEvaluation has shown that Wheels to Work, by providing access to opportunities, can evidently turn an individual around from being a ‘drain’ on the economy, to being a contribut\nor towards the economy, paying national insurance and buying petrol. Looking at indicative costs to agencies to support jobseekers, some idea of the financial benefits of enabling an individual to access an otherwise inaccessible education, training or job\n opportunity can be appreciated. \n&#xa0;\nTherefore W2W is clearly an area where real value for money can be obtained in local transport expenditure, while at the same time increasing equality of opportunity in rural areas and improving access to work transport.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The Local Sustainable Transport Fund&#xa0;When announcing the creation of the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, former Transport Minister Norman Baker said \n“Wheels to Work schemes provide transport to people who are unable to access training, employment or education, due to a lack of suitable public or private transport.\n&#xa0;\n Schemes can, therefore, particularly benefit people living in isolated rural communities\n and can play an important part in helping people to come off benefits and regain their independence.” \nHe suggested\n&#xa0;\nthat local authorities might want to include a Wheels to Work scheme in their bid for LSTF funding.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nAround 20 Local authorities did this,\n however, the sustainable aspect of the funding for these new schemes appears to have been misunderstood in some cases and new schemes have been set up without a requirement for long term self sustainability having been built into the business plan. In add\nition, W2W has not been supported by all local authorities under the LSTF. This situation needs to be addressed, so that W2W becomes a ‘normalised’ aspect of local transport spend.\n&#xa0;\nThe Wheels to Work Association (W2WA) is the representative organisation f\nor Wheels to Work schemes throughout the UK, established following a short term grant from Department for Transport. The W2W Association is creating a national network for W2W which is working to bring structure and sustainability to the provision of W2W s\nchemes. The Association will assist W2W schemes in developing sustainable business plans.\n&#xa0;\nThe W2WA would be happy to appear before the committee to give evidence should it be required.\n&#xa0;\n\"Wheels 2 Work, providing affordable transport solutions to enable access to employment, training and education\".\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
