"Written evidence submitted by Dan Bailey&#xa0;\nI fully support the land reform agenda set out in briefing paper 432:50\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nIn my view comprehensive and radical reform of land ownership in Scotland is long overdue, and would revitalise local economies, boost small scale enterprise and give democracy itself a badly needed shot in the arm. \n&#xa0;\nMeasures really must be taken to break up the big estates that act as a wealth sink and a drag on social, environmental and economic progress. These should include: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhatever the constitutional settlement next year, we must make Scotland a hostile environment for money laundering, tax dodging, inherited wealth and entrenched privilege - and thereby a far more positive and \nforward-looking place for the rest of us.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n"
