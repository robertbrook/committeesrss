"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (DWB 12)1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCIPFA representatives have acted as advisers to the National Assembly for Wales’ Finance Committee during the 2013-14 and 2014-15 budget rounds, and also during their inquiry on borrowing powers and innovative approaches to capital financing, which was und\nertaken to inform the Silk Commission. \n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCIPFA welcomes the draft Wales Bill published on 18 December 2013,\n and \nits intention to \nincrease accountability of the Welsh devolve\nd institutions.  \nHowever, we consider that it does leave\n a number of questions unresolved and it is these which we wish to draw to the attention of the Committee\n.  We also make recommendations intended to assist the Committee in improving the draft Bill\n.\nThe budget process in Wales\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe draft Wales Bill contains\n no transfer of powers to the National Assembly for Wales over the budget process.  CIPFA considers that this is a key omission, and that it runs the risk having powers over taxation and borrowing without the ability to operate an appropriate budget proces\ns through which to hold the Welsh Government to account for its financial plans.\nBlock grant offset\n1.\n4\n              \nWe are concerned that the mechanisms planned to offset the block grant to account for tax revenues \nare not indicated,\n either on the face of the draft Bi\nll, or in the accompanying documentation\n.  Thus, not allowing\n \nfor scrutiny of this important element of tax devolution.\nControl over capital borrowing powers\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe consider that t\nhe absence of a control framework \nfor capital borrowing powers \nfrom the draft Bill is an omission which requires further consideration.  Without a prescribed control framework, scrutiny and control of borrowing and capital expenditure by the Assembly will be less effective.  \n&#xa0;\n2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTHE BUDGET PROCESS IN WALES2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCIPFA is concerned that the draft Wales Bill makes no provision to transfer legislative powers over the Welsh budget procedures to the National Assembly for Wales (the Assembly).  \nGiven that the \nB\nill intends to increase accountability, it seems remiss\n that it does not provide for an adequate budget process to allow the Assembly to hold the Welsh Government to account for its taxation and borrowing plans.\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe Silk Commission’s first report\n stated clearly that should its  \nrecommendations \nbe implemented,\n the current budget process in the Assembly\n \nincluding the framework set by Part 5 of the \nGovernment of Wales Act 2006\n (GOWA 2006), would \n‘\nno longer be fit for purpose\n’\n.\n \n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe report recommended that the Assembly should be given legislative control to set a\nnd develop its own budgetary procedures, as is the case with the Scottish Parliament.\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe report did not suggest a specific budget process for the Assembly to adopt or copy from elsewhere. \n H\nowever\n, it was clear\n that any revenue raising and borrowing proposals made by a future Welsh Government should be integrated together with spending proposals into a single Finance (or Budget) Bill. \n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe report \nwent\n on to provide a general outline of how such a Bill should be \nscrutinised and considered by the Assembly. In particular, an Assembly Finance Bill process should involve\n ‘\nenough time for proper scrutiny’\n and ‘\nthe full involvement of stakeholders’.\n       \n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn their response to the Silk report, the UK Government \nsuggest\ned\n with regard to the recommendation on budget procedures\n that the devolution of such powers could be considered in Part 2 of the Silk Commission’s work.\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTherefore, the draft Wales Bill contains no reference to the transfer of powers to the Assembly over \nthe budget process.\n  However, waiting for the second report of the Silk \nCommission\n and the UK Government’s response and subsequent legislation may not allow time for the development of an appropriate budget process for Wales, prior to the \nuse of taxation \nand borrowing.\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNew powers which\n would have to be incorporated into the budget process include\n consideration of\n:\n2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsidering \nthese,\n alongside the spending plans of the Welsh Government\n,\n will pose a considerable challenge to the Assembly and \nits\n committees, and will put significant emphasis on \nscrutiny of the \noverall affordability and sustainability of the Welsh Government’s fina\nncial plans\n.\n2.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSuch issues will be of considerable interest to civic society in Wales, and there will be a clear requirement for the Assembly to extend its scrutiny of the Welsh Government’s budget plans, including tax and borrowing proposals.\n2.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough the draft Bill provides that an annual report on the operation of the taxation and borrowing powers must be presented to the Assembly, this provides only for \nex ante\n scrutiny.\n2.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCIPFA considers that this is a key omission from the draft \nWales \nBill, \nand that it runs the risk of the Assembly having powers over taxation and borrowing without the ability to operate an appropriate budget process \nthrough which to hold the \nW\nelsh Government to account for its financial plans.\n&#xa0;What would devolution of budget\n procedures entail in practice?\n2.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Assembly’s current budgetary procedures are prescribed in Part of the \nGOWA 2006\n,\n and cannot be altered by the Assembly.  Powers over the Assembly’s current budgetary provisions could be devolved through one of two ways:\n2.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese powers could be devolved in practice by adding control over the Assembly’s budgetary procedures to \nSubject 13\n in Schedule \n7\n,\n and extending the scope of paragraph 5(2) of Part 2 to Schedule 7 to allow an Assembly Act to modify most (but not all) of the provisions contained in Part 5 of the \nGOWA 2006\n.\n2.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis would in turn allow the Assembly to pass an Act to replace or modify Pa\nrt 5 of the \nGOWA 2006\n which deals with finance and budgetary matters (e.g. Section 125 \nto 128\n) to establish a budget process which links taxation, spending and borrowing, and provides sufficient time for proper scrutiny and stakeholder involvement as reco\nmmended by the Silk Commission.  \n2.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWestminster legislation would need to contain general provisions in relation to the Welsh Consolidated Fund (WCF) and other basic financial safeguards, as is the case with the \nScotland Act 1998\n.  \nThe \ndraft \nWales Bill could be modified to provide for such measures, as well as \nto specify the minimum inclusions in Welsh legislation.\n2.17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe draft \nWales \nBill already provides for setting taxation rates and borrowing limits, however it could also deal with \nhow taxatio\nn/borrowing receipts are to be handled.  For example: taxation receipts and borrowings to be paid into the Welsh Consolidated Fund, repayments of borrowings to be a direct charge on the Fund and provision for the Assembly to authorise tax rates and borrowi\nng limits.\n2.18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSubject to any financial provisions contained in the draft Wales Bill, if granted such powers the Assembly could pass a Bill (similar to the \nPublic Finance and Accountability\n (Scotland)\n Act 2000\n) which could repeal and replace previous financia\nl provisions to set budgets, provide for the preparation of audit and accounts and accountability arrangements.  \n2.19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSuch a\nn Assembly\n Bill could incorporate: requirements for taxation, spending and borrowing plans to be linked, provisions for operation of the\n Welsh Consolidated Fund and detailed provisions for accounts and audit.\n  \nStanding Orders\n of the Assembly\n could make special provision for the handling of Budget Bills including a requirement that they can only be introduced by a \nWelsh \nMinister\n&#xa0;What \nare the likely timescales involved?\n2.20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn terms of timescales, the introduction of a Wales Bill during the current Parliament suggests that new powers will be devolved to the Assembly in time for the beginning of the fifth Assembly in May 2016. \n2.21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn practice t\nherefore, it seems likely that the 2017-2018 budget will be the first to take advantage of new borrowing, landfill tax\n and stamp duty land tax powers.  The 2017-18 budget which \nwould be considered in detail by the Assembly six months earlier\n,\n in October 20\n16.\n   \n2.22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis suggests that any devolution and subsequent changes to the budget process to make it fit for purpose to incorporate borrowing and taxation powers would have to be in place prior to this time, in order to enable the Welsh Government to prepare, \nand the Assembly to scrutinise, the 2017-18 budget adequately.\n2.23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is worth noting that in Scotland, where the Parliament already had legislative control over budgetary procedures prior to the \nScotland Act 2012\n, the Finance Committee \nis \nstill \ncontemplating\n \nhow the budget process will operat\ne as part of its consideration o\nf implementation of the \nScotland Act 2012\n.\n  Much of the issues \nraised\n will also be applicable in Wales.\n&#xa0;Recommendations2.24\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCIPFA recommends that:\n3.              BLOCK GRANT OFFSET3.1\n              \nThe draft Bill devolves powers over \ntaxation;\n \nbut\n makes no mention of how the Barnett-determined block grant from the UK Government will be reduced to compensate for these revenues. \n3\n.2\n              \nThe \nfirst report of the Silk Commission made recommendations on which mechanisms\n should be used to offset the block grant for each tax.  It recommended that:\n3.3\n              \nIn the UK Government’s response to the recommendations on SDLT and landfill tax it states that corresponding reductions to the block grant should be agreed with the Welsh Government, and in relatio\nn to income tax, makes no mention of the calculation of the corresponding offset.\n3\n.4\n              \nGiven that this has been the focus of much discussion during the scrutiny of the \nScotland Act 2012\n in the Scottish Parliament, we consider that the Wales Office could have learnt from this experience and provided an indication \neither \non the face of the draft Bill\n, or in the accompanying documentation,\n as to how such deductions would be conducted\n to all\now for scrutiny of this important element of tax devolution.\n              \n              \nRecommendations3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCIPFA recommends that the draft Bill, or accompanying documentation is amended to:\n&#xa0;\n4.               CONTROL OVER CAPITAL BORROWING POWERS4\n.1\n              \nThe draft Bill allows the Welsh Ministers to borrow up to £500 million to fund capital expenditure.  Such borrowing mu\nst\n be from the National Loans Fund\n (NLF)\n or commercial lenders.  The impact assessment supporting the draft Bill states that this borrowing is to be supported by the revenues of the devolved taxes (SDLT and landfill tax), and could be raised in the event of income tax devolution.\n&#xa0;\nSources of bo\nrrowing\n4.\n2\n              \nThe draft Bill anticipates that borrowing could be from the NLF and also from commercial lenders.  \n4.\n3\n              \nAccess to the NLF provides a more privileged, higher status and cheaper form of loan than is available to local authorities, the Northern Ir\neland Executive and the other bodies which are channelled into the Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) as their public lender.\n \n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the moment the draft Bill does not set any restrictions on the types of debt product which can be accessed from commercial lender\ns.\n&#xa0;\nLocal Government and the Prudential Framework\n4.5\n              \nB\norrowing and capital expenditure in local \ngovernment is\n controlled by the prudential framework.\n  \nTh\nis\n encompasses primary legislation\n, u\nnderlying regulation in the form of a statutory instrument, a professional code of practice – CIPFA’s Prudential Code for Capital \nF\ninance in Local Authorities\n and the requirement for elected members to approve capital expenditure plans and associated borr\nowing and investment decisions.  \n4.\n6\n              \nThe objectives of the Prudential Code are\n to ensure\n that:\n4.7\n              \nThe\n code is supported by a suite of prescribed prudential indicators which are designed to allow the council to test the affordability and sustainability of the proposed debt\n and to be assured that treasury management decisions are in accordance with good practice.  \nThe prudential indicators are in the public domain\n and \nrequire to be approved by elected members as part of the plans for capital expenditure.\n4.8\n              \nIn submitting \nevidence to the Commission on Scottish Devolution\n and to the Scottish Parliament’s Scotland Bill Committee\n we recommended that a robust control mechanism was necessary to ensure effective Parliamentary scrutiny.\n  \n4.9\n              \n In its report on borrowing powers a\nnd innovative approaches to capital funding, the Assembly’s Finance Committee adopted the principles of the Prudential Code in their recommendation that:\nIf the Welsh Government were granted\n \nborrowing powers, proposals for upper limits for its borrowing\n \nrequirements, demonstrating affordability, sustainability and\n \nprudence, should be presented to the Assembly within the budget\n \nmotion.\n4.1\n0\n              \nThis recommendation was accepted in principle by the Welsh Government:\nThe Welsh Government accepts that borrowing s\nhould be affordable, sustainable and prudent, and that the Assembly should be able to exercise its oversight and scrutiny roles in relation to borrowing as it does with other financial activities of the Welsh Government through the budget process and other\n mechanisms\n.\n4\n.\n1\n1\n              \nHowever, the draft Bill appears to contain no provision requiring that the Assembly have oversight of the Welsh Government’s borrowing powers by requiring approval or authorisation of their plans to borrow.\n  Again, there is a requirement to report to the Assembly \nex ante\n, however this does not allow the Assembly the appropriate consideration of the Welsh Government’s borrowing plans and whether these are affordable and sustainable in the long term.\n4.12\n              \nThe \nabsence of a control framework\n from the draft Bill\n is an omission which requires further \nconsideration\n.  Without a prescribed control framework, scrutiny and control of borrowing and capital expenditure by the Assembly will be less effective.   \n&#xa0;\nAffordabi\nlity of borrowing\n4.1\n3\n              \nThe fundamental objective of affordability is to ensure that capital investment remains within sustainable limits and to consider the impact upon the budget and on local tax.  \n4.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe ability of local government to fund the revenue cons\nequences arising from lending comes principally from grant paid by the Welsh Government and from the power to raise local taxation in the form of council tax. \n4.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe consequences of capital expenditure funded by borrowing are the repayment of the borrowing itself and the repayment \nof \ninterest.  \nLocal g\novernment statute dictates that liabilities from external borrowing have ‘first call’ on revenues, before any other\n type of expenditure.\n \n4.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe decision to undertake capital expenditure and subsequently pay interest and to repay external debt will represent a significant opportunity cost for the \nWelsh\n Government.  Clearly, this will com\ne at the expense of\n revenue expendi\nture\n on services\n.  Unlike the clarity with \nthe local\n government legislation, the draft Bill is not clear which income source the borrowing by the Welsh Government will be secured upon.\n&#xa0;\nNeed for \ncapital \ninvestment\n4.17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBorrowing is intended to fund capital \ninve\nstment\n and it is therefore essential that the need for borrowing is underpinned by a clear asset management strategy.  \nSimplistically, asset management planning considers future service delivery need.  That need then influences \ninvestment decisions which \ndrive\n the need for borrowing.  This can be contrasted with the practice under the previous control framework where the financial cap, rather than service need, dictated investment.\n4.18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Prudential Code prescribes that, in making its capital investment decis\nions, the authority must have explicit regard to option appraisal, asset management planning, strategic planning for the authority and achievability of the forward plan.  \n4.19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n              \nThe \nprescription that investment decisions (and therefore borrowing decisions) must\n have explicit regard to asset management is not evident in the \ndraft \nBill. \n&#xa0;\nComparison with the \nScotland Act 2012\n4\n.\n20\n              \nThe \nScotland Act 2012\n gives the Scottish Ministers the power to borrow for capital investment, limited to 10% of the Scottish Governmen\nt’s capital DEL each year within a statutory total of £2.2 billion.\n  There appears to be no similar annual profile of borrowing set out for Wales in the draft Bill.\n4.\n21\n              \nIf the Welsh Government were given powers on the same basis as Scotland, i.e. 10% of \nthe capital DEL in each year, then the limit on borrowing for the 2014-15 \nfinancial year would be around £142 million.\n  Such an annual profile on borrowing could prevent the situation where the entire borrowing limit is utilised at an early stage.\n4.\n2\n2\n              \nTh\ne \nScotland Act 2012\n also sets out that loans for capital purposes will generally be for a maximum of 10 years, with the option of this being extended in line with the life of the asset in question.  The draft Bill appears to state no time limits on the lif\ne of the debt of the Welsh Government, thus providing no safeguard for debt extending far into the future and potentially creating a burden on future generations.\n&#xa0;\nRecommendations4.23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
