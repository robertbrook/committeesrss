defaultCumbria Police and Crime Panel
default [PCC Progress 1

default]
defaultAt their meeting of 19 July 2013 the Cumbria Police and Crime Panel (PCP) were updated on the work of the Home Affairs Select Committee review "Police and Crime Commissioners: Register of Interests" to which Cumbria had initially been invited to contribute. Members of the Panel also noted the Select Committee's intention to undertake a major report regarding Police and Crime Commissioners late in 2013, a year on from their introduction.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs part of the initial Select Committee review the Panel noted that it had been stated that 
default"All three of the PCP chairs we heard from believed that their Panels did not have strong powers to hold a PCC to account." 
defaultThis is something that the Cumbria Police and Crime Panel also feel and as such agreed to write to the Select Committee to express their views and request that the powers and sanctions available to PCPs be reviewed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultUnlike some other Panels in the country the Cumbria PCP have not yet been in a position where they have needed to hold a confirmatory hearing. Based on the experiences of other Panels and Members own understanding of the powers of PCPs in these situations however, they would like to make the following suggestion and observation:
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a lack of clarity surrounding the role of Police and Crime Panels in the appointment of 
defaultI 
defaultcontinuation of temporary Chief Constable posts. Currently it is not clear regarding the Panels powers in to be involved in these as it is with substantive positions, for example the Temporary Chief Constable for Cumbria has been in position for almost twelve months. We would like to suggest that Panels should have a greater role in the scrutiny of these posts.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition to the issue of confirmatory hearings the Cumbria PCP would like to raise the issue of Panels' powers in relation to dealing with complaints about Police and Crime Commissioners. As you may be aware the Cumbria PCP has dealt with a number of complaints relating to the commissioner largely in relation to one specific incident and as such has a reasonable experience of this process.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe current powers are limited and do not enable the Panel to undertake any investigations into the issue beyond asking the Commissioner's Office to respond to the points raised, to see if they can be resolved and an explanation or clarification provided. The Panel then pass this information to the complainant and try to broker an informal resolution. There are no powers actually attached to this and in effect the Panel have no real powers to take any action regarding non-criminal complaints beyond raising any issues publically through the Panel meetings.
default&#xa0;
defaultMembers of the Panel feel that this system can lead to false expectations from complainants who may expect that further independent investigative work could be undertaken or actions result if the complaint is perceived to be upheld by the 
defaultPanel. As may be expected informal resolution is not always possible and yet there is very little the Panel can practically do beyond this point.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Panel would therefore request that as part of your review you explore the current powers available to Police and Crime Panels with a view to considering recommending to Government that they be extended.
default&#xa0;
defaultShould you require any additional information please do not hesitate to
defaultcontact me.
