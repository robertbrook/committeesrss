[normal]The North East of England 
[normal]developed a substantial TV and production sector between the late 1960s and late 1990s as a result of significant investment in local production by ITV Tyne Tees and BBC North East. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sadly 
[normal]jobs and commissions started to dry up in the early part of the ne
[normal]w century as ITV pulled out of its studio complex in Newcastle and focused production on London. Ofcom meanwhile agreed with ITV that it could pull out of its 
[normal]regional programme production licence commitment. Jobs were lost and many media professionals wer
[normal]e forced to move to London to find work. The BBC 
[normal]maintained its commitment to regional production with current affairs/documentary productions Inside Out and The Politics Show.

[normal] was a lowpoint for the region with the BBC’s decision to 
[normal]end its long ru
[normal]nning childrens
[normal] drama Byker Grove – which had been 
[normal]a successful training ground for performers and production talent such as Ant &amp; Dec, Jill Halfpenny and Oscar winning director Tom Hooper. In the same year
[normal],
[normal] ITV dropped 
[normal]its own long running North East-
[normal]base
[normal]d drama Wire in the Blood.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is to th
[normal]e credit of the BBC, that executives
[normal] recognized the significance of the gap left by 
[normal]Byker Grove. Another childrens’
[normal] show was swiftly 
[normal]parachuted into the region
[normal].
[normal] The Revenge Files of Alistair 
[normal]Fury ran for just one seri
[normal]es and offered work to production staff who had 
[normal]been 
[normal]previously 
[normal]employed on 
[normal]Byker Grove.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The new team at BBC North
[normal] in Salford
[normal] – liaising with the local Royal Television Society and Northern Film and Media – decided 
[normal]to 
[normal]tap in to
[normal] the region’s expertise in c
[normal]hildrens’ pro
[normal]duction by moving Tracy Beaker R
[normal]eturns to Newcastle.  The decision was then taken to shift production of the 
[normal]‘
[normal]60s detective drama Inspector George Gently from Ireland to Durham.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CBBC quickly built on that momentum 
[normal]and brought new childrens’ d
[normal]ramas Wolfblood and The Dumping Ground to the North East. They join the BBC1 period shopping drama The Paradise 
[normal](filmed near Sunderland) 
[normal]and ITV police 
[normal]series Vera (filmed in Northumberland). The BBC invested more than £1m in creating sets at Lambton Castl
[normal]e for The Paradise. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Northern Film and Media estimate these new television productions 
[normal]currently 
[normal]contribute more than £6m to the production economy of the region
[normal] - £12,700 a day in salaries, accommodation and equipment hire.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Director of BBC North Peter Salmon said he believed the success of the BBC move to Salford would be judged not on its impact around the North West, but on its ability to engage
[normal] audiences and revive and develop programme teams in Yorkshire and the North Eas
[normal]t.
[normal]The current level of 
[normal]television 
[normal]pro
[normal]duction 
[normal]in the North East proves 
[normal]the BBC is taking that strategy seriously. The corporation is also investing in developing new writers and new producers with projects including Jesting About 
[normal]- 
[normal]which aims to uncover co
[normal]medy talent. One of the successes of that project is North East writer-performer Jason Cook whose BBC2 comedy Hebburn is into i
[normal]ts second series. 
[normal]Executives at BBC North are currently
[normal] in discussions with Northern Film and Media and other partners about brin
[normal]ging further projects to the region.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Without the BBC, the North East television production sector would now be a shadow of its former self. It is the view of myself and many others in the region, that the BBC used its influence and resources to positively
[normal] make a difference to a 
[normal]production sector and programme-making tradition which had found itself facing terminal decline. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Seven years ago, 
[normal]London-based 
[normal]ITV, Channel 4, Five and Sky were unable to 
[normal]offer the North East production se
[normal]ctor a lifeline. The BBC 
[normal]however recognized the value of making use of experienced production teams and location managers. And further realized the positive impact on audiences of making television from this region of England.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This seems sensible and strategic 
[normal]use of the
[normal] licence 
[normal]fee 
[normal]- which 
[normal]of course 
[normal]is 
[normal]partly made up of contributions from the two million people resident in households around North East England.
