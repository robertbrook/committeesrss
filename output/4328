[normal]Written Evidence submitted by Food Security Ltd[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We are a group of concerned farmers who want to alert Government and the public to the rapid decline in the amount of food produced in this country, and to the fact [bold]that defence and national security are inextricably linked with home food production.[bold]We are not anti-government, neither are we commercially or politically motivated. We are particularly concerned about how 62m people will be fed in the event of a crisis,[bold] and what can actually be done to improve this critical situation.[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]Executive Summary[bold]For several years we have voiced our concern about the UK food trade deficit. Has the Treasury noticed this 
[normal]ever-incre
[normal]asing gap – now £19.5
[normal]bn, up £5bn since 5 years ago? Should this fact not be a potent warning and a wake-up call?

[normal] reliance on sea traffic is becoming gradually greater; however, no-one can deny the weakening of the Royal Navy. We also rely on 
[normal]certain geo-political factors that do not change – trade, distance, and
[normal] choke points that the UK depends on. 
[normal]There is a large range and shifting complex of risks and threats to our national security, but one thing is clear, that to increase UK food product
[normal]ion is essential and vital to our future safety as well as to our social and economic well-being.
[normal] David Heath’s article in the national press ‘Dig for Survival’ was starkly relevant in our present position.
[normal]Our thoughts are tersely summed up in the words o
[normal]f George Washington: ‘I know of no pursuit in which more real and important services can be rendered to any country than by improving its agriculture’.
