[[[ (CRJ 03)]]]1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This submission addresses the constitutional role of the judiciary within the UK constitution and the choices available to the courts – in their vindication of the rule of law – when faced with ‘unconstitutional’ legislation. It draws on arguments and analysis published in R. Masterman and J.E.K. Murkens, ‘Skirting Supremacy and Subordination: The Constitutional Authority of the United Kingdom Supreme Court’ [2013] Public Law 800.   &#xa0;A: The traditional subsidiary role of the courts&#xa0;2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the absence of a codified constitution guaranteeing its status the role and powers of the judiciary in the UK constitution have traditionally had to be inferred or induced from particular judicial decisions.   &#xa0;3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although in practice the system of checks and balances is akin to systems respecting a more formal separation of powers, Britain’s mixed model of government firmly subordinated the judiciary to the elected branches of government. The constitutional hierarchy, which stems from the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, conceived of the courts as ‘modest underworkers’ and ‘handmaids to Parliament’s will’. Courts were to interpret the text and to declare the law, and they enjoyed only limited review powers over delegated authority by Parliament to subordinate bodies. &#xa0;4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; By adhering to plain meaning (literalist/formalist) approaches to statutory interpretation (which avoid the charge that the judiciary might substitute its own view of the law for that expressed by Parliament), the judiciary acknowledge that democracy and public policy (i.e. most of effective law-making) are generally regarded as political matters to be determined in and by the legislature. &#xa0;5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The impact of this subordination on the constitutional status of the courts has been enormous. Between 1842 and the UK’s accession to the European Community in January 1973, not a single case reached the House of Lords on the question of the absence of limitations of Parliament’s ultimate law-making authority. The period from World War II until the 1960s ‘marked the depths of the irrelevance of the courts in the development of the constitution.’ &#xa0;B: The Development of Powers of Quasi-Constitutional Review:&#xa0;6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Developments since the latter decades of the twentieth century have prompted a re-evaluation of the constitutional position of the judiciary as necessarily subservient. Over this period, and as a cumulative result of the statutory conferral and arrogation of powers, the apex court gradually developed a ‘pronounced public law profile’ such that the United Kingdom Supreme Court (UKSC) can now be seen to discharge ‘some of the functions of a constitutional court’. In the absence of a documentary constitution, and in the light of the fact that the sovereignty of Parliament remains of fundamental importance to our understandings of the constitution, it is appropriate to classify these powers of review as quasi-constitutional. &#xa0;7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We identify two types of powers of quasi-constitutional review. The first type, explicit powers, derives from statute.  The UKSC has been allocated powers of quasi-constitutional review under the European Communities Act 1972 (ECA), the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA), and the UK’s devolution legislation. &#xa0;8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the context of EU law, Parliament’s competence is substantively limited in two ways: first, it may not legislate contrary to EU law (s.2(4) ECA 1972); and second, courts enjoy power to ‘disapply’ national law to the extent that it is inconsistent with directly effective provisions of EU law. It is acting in this capacity that the UKSC most clearly discharges functions akin to the strong form judicial review exercised by Supreme and Constitutional Courts elsewhere.  &#xa0;9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; HRA review gives rise to consequences of a slightly different order, permitting courts to interpret primary legislation in order to achieve compliance with the Convention Rights so far as it is possible to do so (s.3(1) HRA), or in the alternative providing for the issue of a declaration of incompatibility (s.4 HRA). Though neither option permits the court to mount a direct challenge to the legality of an Act of Parliament, the HRA nonetheless empowers the courts to test primary legislation, whenever enacted, for compliance with human rights standards&#xa0;10.&#xa0; The courts also exercise power to determine legal disputes relating to ‘devolution issues’ arising out of the transfer of legal powers to devolved bodies. The power of the UKSC – previously exercised by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council – is something of a departure from the traditional distinction placed by the constitution on the review of executive and legislative action, in the devolved context potentially subjecting both to judicial review.  &#xa0;11.&#xa0; Sovereignty-respecting measures are evident in both the HRA and in the devolution legislation. The HRA stipulates that neither the interpretation of legislation under s.3(1) nor the issue of a declaration of incompatibility under s.4 will affect the ‘validity, continuing operation or enforcement’ of the legislative provision(s) under review. The scheme of the devolution legislation, meanwhile, subjects only devolved legislation to potential review, and contains measures designed to preserve the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament. &#xa0;12.&#xa0; In addition to those powers of quasi-constitutional review allocated by statute, the expansion of the judicial review jurisdiction (and thereby of the constitutional powers of the courts existent at common law) has seen the development of implied powers of quasi-constitutional review by the judges themselves.  At the most straightforward level, a judicial belief in the ‘sanctity’ of statutory language has yielded ground to more generous and purposive techniques of construction.  Rather more fundamentally, the development of ideas associated with the ‘common law constitution’ – including the incremental development of a body of ‘constitutional rights’ and the acknowledgement of a distinction between constitutional and non-constitutional statutes – have exposed the traditional positivist and sovereignty-driven explanation of the constitution as being inadequate. The effects of this transition, which saw common law standards (as opposed to the inferred intent of Parliament) as underpinning the courts’ regulatory function, have been described as ‘one of the most fundamental realignments of the constitutional order since the end of the seventeenth century’.  &#xa0;13.&#xa0; The high watermark of this line of common law reasoning remains Lord Hoffmann’s articulation of the ‘principle of legality’ in R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Simms.  Via the controlling mechanism of the common law, Hoffmann addresses one of the most controversial and divisive issues in contemporary public law discourse; the tension between the legal controls imposed by the rule of law and the theoretically limitless legal power of Parliament.  On the one hand, Hoffmann is at pains to preserve the ability of Parliament to legislate contrary to fundamental individual rights.  On the other, he asserts that the constitutional function of the common law has expanded so as to subject primary legislation to a degree of legal control.&#xa0;14.&#xa0; We conclude that in certain clearly-defined areas of law, the UKSC already acts as a constitutional organ. It exercises quasi-constitutional powers in relation to the European Union and under the HRA and acts as a quasi-federal court in devolution cases. Hoffmann notes in Simms that the apex court in the UK is empowered to ‘apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.’ This, however, overstates the point in relation to cases that fall outside the above areas of law.  Clear legislative intent remains of unquestionable authority. The most the common law empowerment allows the judges to do is to require express or unambiguous words where Parliament wishes to override fundamental rights or the rule of law.&#xa0;C: The power of review in constitutional cases&#xa0;15.&#xa0; That the rule of law is one of the twin fundamentals on which the constitution rests, is acknowledged by scholars, judges and primary legislation and the sense that it is the role of the court to vindicate the rule of law has animated the incremental expansion of the judicial role since the mid-twentieth century.  Yet, as Hoffmann’s analysis reveals, it is the supremacy of Parliament that ranks first among these supposed equals. &#xa0;16.&#xa0; Any future determination of the respective constitutional role and function of the judiciary must then seek to address the tension between the sovereignty of Parliament and the rule of law by approaching them as equals.  A further formalisation of the relationship between Parliament and courts should examine how to make good the constitutional commitment to both democratic government and the rule of law.  &#xa0;17.&#xa0; We argue that the development of the constitutional function of the courts has rendered the traditional understanding of the necessarily subordinate role of the courts obsolete. Unquestioning acceptance by the courts of legislative direction – however Draconian – may no longer be taken for granted under this new constitutional equilibrium: the ‘respect to be shown to the considered judgment of a democratic assembly’ is no longer a matter of assumption and ‘will vary according to the subject matter and the circumstances.’ Equally, however, the argument that the UKSC should extend its brief and assert the ability to strike down legislation would be a clear usurpation of the powers of the legislature.  &#xa0;18.&#xa0; Possible judicial responses to Parliament doing the ‘unthinkable’ – for instance, passing legislation that disenfranchised a substantial proportion of the population on arbitrary grounds or insulated vast tranches of governmental activity from the scrutiny of the courts – tend to be couched in abstract terms and are often countered with a straightforward re-assertion of the sovereignty of Parliament. We argue that there are three legitimate judicial responses in constitutional cases, each occupying a position between uncritical, literal application of parliamentary intent and judicial enforcement of a substantive rule of law.  &#xa0;19.&#xa0; The most robust course available to the court draws inspiration from the seminal decision in Anisminic v. Foreign Compensation Commission.  In the exceptional case of a clash between constitutional fundamentals, the Anisminic decision might be deployed in order to support the reinstatement of a jurisdiction apparently ousted by statute, or – read more broadly – prevent the attempted insulation by statute of otherwise ultra vires activity from judicial review.  While falling short of US-style constitutional review, the possibility of this form of judicial disobedience to primary legislation remains the most potent weapon available to the UKSC in the event of a fundamental constitutional clash. &#xa0;20.&#xa0; Sitting below outright disobedience, in legal terms at least, would be the judicial articulation of a ‘declaration of unconstitutionality.’  Drawing inspiration from declarations of incompatibility under the HRA 1998, David Jenkins has argued that the courts possess the inherent power to declare Acts of Parliament to be unconstitutional ‘when Parliament legislates against legal norms or fundamental baselines for political behaviour deemed by courts of special significance within Britain’s unwritten constitution.’ Such declarations, Jenkins argues, would respectful of sovereignty in two ways.  First, they would be ‘nonbinding and not affect the legal validity’ of the statute in respect of which they were made.  Second, ‘the declaration openly recognizes Parliament’s exercise of sovereign power within (or, one might say, against) an accepted constitutional context.’&#xa0;21.&#xa0; Judicial disobedience would pose the most obvious threat to Parliament’s authority by rendering subsequent applications of the legislation contingent on the court’s disobedient response (though legislative restoration, or refinement, of the disputed provision would remain a possibility). The consequences of the issue of a ‘declaration of unconstitutionality’ would not be so severe.  A legislative response to such a declaration might result from the political damage caused by the interpretative authority attached to the judicial reading of the requirements of the constitution, but would not be an inevitability.  The impugned statute would remain operable.  The declaration of unconstitutionality would, therefore, better straddle the principle of judicial control and the principle of legislative supremacy, and offer greater respect to the political underpinnings of the UK constitution. &#xa0;22.&#xa0; Finally, the courts may in certain constitutional cases need to soften the letter of the law in order to achieve fairness in individual cases and to vindicate the judicial presumption that Parliament legislates ‘for a European liberal democracy’ in compliance with fundamental principles. Like equity, which ‘mitigates the rigour of the common law’, the rule of law ensures that the formal legal doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty does not lose sight of constitutional principles that are of fundamental importance in individual circumstances. &#xa0;23.&#xa0; The rule of law requires courts to interpret an Act of Parliament while ensuring that its application does not result in unfairness in speciﬁc cases. Attempts to reconcile parliamentary intent with the requirements of the rule of law are a less dramatic and a more realistic and workable suggestion than the conferral of a general discretion on the courts to disapply unconstitutional and pernicious legislation. &#xa0;24.&#xa0; The courts share in the task of policing the boundaries of a rights-based democracy with the legislature and executive; their role is complementary to that of Parliament, and of the executive.  To classify the quasi-constitutional functions of the courts as a step towards judicial supremacism is to deny the distinctive functions of the legislative and judicial branches: ‘[c]ourts do not substitute Parliament in the making of policy decisions as they are limited by the principle of institutional integrity: “[t]here is a Rubicon which they may not cross.”’ It also denies the crucial constitutional role of the courts in their habitual recognition of Parliament as sovereign. The constitutional functions and authority of the courts, therefore, form the embodiment of the balanced constitution in its modern incarnation.  &#xa0;30 October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A.V.
