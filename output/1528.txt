[[[Is the government taking the right approach to reduce heat energy demand]]]

[[[? ]]]The range of incentives and schemes to encourage increases in energy efficiency and the onsite generation of heat are aiming to work towards the behaviour change needed and to contribute towards a reduction in heat energy demand. Research indicates that between the years 2000–2011 there has been a 20% reduction in domestic gas consumption (Ricardo-AEA: http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2013/05/23/comment-cutting-demand-is-the-blind-spot-in-britain-s-great). Tools such as the National Heat Map give a good indication of the heat density across the UK; it would be a useful addition if this map was able to illustrate reductions in the heat use over time. It would also appear though that more time and effort is being invested in supply side management than in demand side management – i.e. heat (and energy) demand reduction. Domestic and commercial users of energy are interested in reducing the use of heat energy as it in turn reduces their fuel bills but this is proving to be challenging for many.

[[[at]]]

[[[? ]]]It is clear that steps are being taken in the right direction; however, with heat still accounting for nearly 50% of the UK’s energy use, it is difficult to see how quickly the demand for heat is reducing or if it is government policy which is behind the reduction.

[[[What will the local environmental impact (for example air pollution) be from the use heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units]]]

[[[? ]]]There is zero local environmental impact from the use of ground source heat pumps in urban areas (no emissions, no noise, no visible impact, as ground source heat pumps provide invisible heating systems and are the most unobtrusive heating (&amp; cooling) technology available on the market.

[[[What are the rel]]]

[[[ative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps]]]

[[[? ]]]This depends on the efficiency of the power station in converting gas to electricity (normally around 50%) and the Co-efficient of Performance (CoP) of the domestic heat pumps (normally around 400%). If heat pumps are poorly installed there is a danger that the CoP could fall to 200% and, at that level, there would be no merit in using heat pumps.  With the planned decarbonisation of the electricity grid the case for well installed ground source heat pumps gets stronger and stronger.Ground source heat pumps in well insulated buildings can be set to provide background heating at night (when electricity supply is significantly cheaper).

[[[Why is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK]]]

[[[? ]]]Heat Networks in the UK currently provide less than 2% of the UK’s heat demand (DECC), although an assessment in 2009 suggested “that in the right conditions heat networks could supply up to 14% of the UK’s heat demand.”Legal problems and custom have held back district heating schemes in the UK, as well as issues of measuring heat used by customers of district heating even though meters specifically for this purpose have been available for many years in mainland Europe.CHP has advantages in the heating season – but only marginal advantage in summer, unless connected to Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage.

[[[Should the government take any further any specific actions in relation to cooling]]]

[[[? ]]]We know that DECC are opposed to the idea of subsidising cooling by air conditioning: we are very much in sympathy with the idea that standard air conditioning should not be encouraged – because there are large carbon emission implications. This is because the standard approach to cooling – heat exchange with hot air – is expensive in electricity [and therefore carbon emissions].  However in warmer parts of Europe (and the World) where building cooling is recognised as being important to maintaining productivity, considerable work has been invested in developing Renewable Energy driven cooling systems and in balancing heating and cooling loads which if correctly executed can be the most energy efficient solution. Thermal Energy storage is at the heart of the systems and in this context providing heating can be considered as recharging the store with coolth and cooling as recharging the store with warmth.  In either case the heat is moved and stored rather than created.The CoP (Coefficient of Performance) of a roof-mounted chiller can be as low as 1.5 on a hot day [1 kilowatt of electricity is needed to provide 1.5 kW of cooling].  However, some cooling is necessary, and there is a very much more effective way of achieving this – by employing ground source energy and allowing heat to escape to cold ground instead of forcing heat into hot air.  The CoP of “free cooling” (heat exchange with cold ground by means of a circulation pump) can be as high as 25. The CoP of Renewable Cooling (heat exchange with cold ground assisted by a reversible heat pump) can frequently achieve a CoP of 8. Further this has the additional benefit of improving heating CoP the following winter as the ground has been recharged and is therefore warmer. Improvements in heating CoP can be dramatic lifting the annual heating CoP from around 4 to around 5 in many cases. The carbon emission savings of using Renewable Cooling, instead of standard Air Conditioning, are huge and we believe that DECC will come to see that these should be encouraged as part of the fight to reduce carbon emissions.There will need to be appropriate safeguards, which could be defined in terms of requiring a high CoP before Renewable Cooling is recognised and requiring a high temperature set point so that Cooling is only used when necessary (rather than as an indulgence).DECC has been inclined to reject subsidy for renewable cooling as their interpretation of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) is that it would not count as “renewable” although it would save significant CO2 emissions. We think that DECC, which frequently claims that the RHI is a “world first”, should be making the case to Brussels, rather than following DECC’s own timid interpretation of the RED.

[[[10. ]]]

[[[Why does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully]]]

[[[? ]]]The practical effect of DECC policy (although not the intention) has been to suppress the heat pump market:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Five years of discussion on RHI, but no RHI yet in place for domestic heat pumps.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; FIT (Feed in Tariff) subsidies from 1st April 2010 diverted attention to PV cells, with initial subsidies at 43p/kWh.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Commercial RHI for heat pumps was introduced in November 2011, with initial subsidy at only 3.5p/kWh (at the same time RHI for biomass introduced at 9.2p/kWh).-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DECC also introduced the unscientific idea of “naturally occurring energy” which confused the market and prevented Ofgem from accrediting any ground source heating and cooling systems for over a year.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DECC has overlooked the ability of ground source heat pumps to provide invisible heating systems with zero on-site environmental impact.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ground source heat pumps can also recycle energy from summer to winter and, through thermal energy storage, can balance the limitations of those technologies which suffer from intermittent renewable energy supply.-               The RHI provides an annual subsidy to reduce the annual cost of using renewable heat. The barrier to installing a ground source heat pump is not the annual running cost (which is small) but the up-front capital cost (which is large).

[[[How successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?]]]This may depend on the efficiency with which the RHI is administered by Ofgem. This, in turn, may depend on the complexity of the regulations Ofgem is asked to administer.

[[[ What is government policy doing to pro]]]

[[[mote thermal storage, and should it do more/different?]]]Thermal storage using seasonal thermal energy storage is a simple and practical method of balancing energy demand which is already in use in the UK. Government policy has not yet recognised the merits of this approach in saving carbon emissions. The misconceived policy of “naturally occurring energy” held back market developments in this innovative technology. DECC has recognised that this was inappropriate, but the Statutory Instrument of 28 November 2011 has not yet been updated. Government policy urgently needs to recognise and promote Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage as a means of saving carbon emissions. The Government should also encourage all forms of Heat Recovery where this can be used in conjunction with thermal storage in order to save carbon emissions.August 2013&#xa0;
