"&#xa0;\nWWC003Written evidence submitted by Richard Burden MPIntroductionAs the MP for Birmingham Northfield I welcome the oppo\nrtunity to make a submission to the Education Select Committee inquiry into the educational underachievement of white working class children.\nThis submission \nbuilds on a debate I held on this issue \ni\nn May 2009, when a report funded by Birmingham City Counc\nil revealed that \na high number of white pupils on free school meals in Birmingham we\nre performing poorly at schools.\n1\n \nMy response focuses on the \nextent of – and factors leading to –\n \nwhite working class pupils \neducational underachievement, and approaches th\ne Government can ta\nke in response\n.\n In summary, this \nsubmission:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Extent of White Working Class Underachievement&#xa0;\nIn 20\n10-2011\n less than a third of white British students eligible for Free School Means (FSM) reached the national GCSE target of 5A*-C passes including English and Maths. Barely a quarter of boys, and just above a third of girls, achieved the target. In contrast, 63%\n of white British students not eligible for FSM reached the national target. The \nsize of the attainment gap \nbetween FSM and non-FSM students is unique to t\nhe white\n ethnic group.\n2\n&#xa0;\nIn Birmingham, statistics from 2001-2003 revealed that\n following\n African Car\nibbean boys \nreceiving\n FSM, \nthe \ndemographic groups least likely to achieve 5 A*-C at GCSE were white boys and girls\n receiving\n FSM. Looking beyond averages, the absolute numbers of white pupils underachieving in education makes this issue particularly concer\nning. In 2003, 486 white pupils (compared to 89 Pakistani pupils, 56 black pupils, and 18 Bangladeshi pupils) in Birmingham did not achieve any GCSE grades at all.\n \n1 \n&#xa0;\nIn higher education, 2012 saw a fall of\n \n54,000 \nwhite \nmen applying to university, \nwhich w\nas \na\n d\necrease of 13% from \n2011 \n– \nand four tim\nes higher than the reduction of female \napplicants. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Factors leading to White Working Class Underachievement &#xa0;The\n reality is still that if you are white and disadvantaged, you are half as likely to achieve in education as those who are better off. \nThe odds are decisively stacked against poor white children achieving within the education system. &#xa0;\nThe \nreasons for educ\national underachievement \nin impoverished groups \nare myriad \nand well documented\n. Inadequate \nhousing, weak parental involvement, \npoor schoo\nl quality, familial low income and unemployment, and low aspiration and expectation\n \nall \ncontributing \nto \nwhy \nchildren \nfrom lower socio-\neconomic groups are less successful at school\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe geographic\nal\n areas in which white working class educational underachievement is most marked are also the areas \nthat have\n undergone massive change in employment patterns and relative weal\nth. In many cases this is associated with the decline of large enterprises associated with traditional industries – such as manufacturing – over the last quarter of the 20\nth\n Century. Although some of those industries have undergone a major and very positiv\ne transformation in recent years (such as automotive), \nthis innovation has often bypassed the people in the areas\n traditionally \nassociated\n with those industries.\n&#xa0;\nThe result is that inequality has grown, albeit highly unevenly even in geographically compac\nt areas, with pockets of high deprivation, low skills, high long term unemployment and low aspiration close to areas of relative affluence. \nThis has a \nmajor impact in increasing educational underachievement in the areas concerned. There are lessons here ab\nout the impact of some of the government’s current welfare reforms, which could \nfurther \naggravate the problem. That these issues are beyond the sc\nope of this paper should not \nminimise their importance.  \n&#xa0;\nThe ‘neighbourhood effect\n’ – how a community social\nises p\neople – is also a leading factor in \nreinforcing cycles\n of\n low aspiration and\n underachievement.\n3\n \nChildren in white working class communities do not benefit from the \nsocial and cultural capital of the middle classes, which is more conducive to\n success \nin\n education\n and schools. \nW\nhite children from disadvant\naged backgrounds do not grow up with \nthe \nknowledge\n – or role models \n– that\n demonstrate that education\n \nprovides \nopportunity, \nor that hard work \ncreates\n success and financial security. \n&#xa0;\nSchool based interventions&#xa0;\nIn terms of specific \ninterventions to\n address white \nunderachievement\n at school\n,\n \nlessons can be \nlearnt \nfrom success in\n reducing black minority et\nhnic disadvantage in education. Action is needed on a number of different levels: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;In 2009 \nI stated that \nwhen statistics are compiled to inform education policy\n, the\n \nGovernment must\n subdivide the white ethnic group according to \neligibility \nfor free school meals. \nAlthough the results of white children on FSM are now collect\ned, \nm\najor improvements need to be made in the dissemination\n of data \nso\n that\n \naccurate conclusions \nand assessment\n \ncan be made easily\n.\n \nSubdividing results by raci\nal and economic categories needs to become\n routine \nand explicit \nif we are to\n better\n understand, and act upon, \nthis issue. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSchools – and teachers –\n are critical for \nequipping children with the skills, opportunities and behaviour that will help them succeed in later life.  \nR\naising school quality in disadvantaged areas is clearl\ny of paramount importance \nfor improving achievement\n.\n \nSchools in disadvantaged areas face \nresourcing \npressures (such as equipment, subsidising the cost of trips, security and pastoral care) and difficulty in staff retention, standards and morale\n. \nThe Government should consider options for targeting funding on schools in areas with low white working class achievement beyond the Pupil Premium. Th\nese\n could include \nmeasures to incentivise outstanding teachers\n,\n or support q\nuality \nvocational\n schemes\n that provide real to alternatives to the academic route.\n&#xa0;\nResearch has also demonstrated\n that\n successful\n schools can \nhave\n a small scale, local \nimpact on regeneration within \na community.\n4\n \nThe \nimpact\n \nthat the new\n Bournville College – opened in 2010 with\n Lab\nour Government funding for the regeneration of Longbridge\n \nafter MG Rover collapsed in 200\n5 – has made in my constituency\n is testament to how \nwell-\nrun educational \nfacilities can raise local aspiration and \nopportunities\n.\n Further targeted efforts, similar to \nthat which funded Bournville, are needed. In light of this, the Department of Education must question the provision of resources and support for new free \nschools and academies \nin areas where there are already good schools\n \n– \nor \nwhere \nthe development of impr\noving schools could be undermined\n. Rather, the focus must be on\n targeting the \nareas of greatest need.\n&#xa0;\nBut, as noted above, a child’s background and environment is almost decisive in determining their educational outcomes. Although improving school quality\n in disadvantaged areas is important, the Government must recognise that the impact a school can have in turning a child’s life chances around is limited. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;It has also been well noted that \nstrong \nparental engagement is important for raising \neducational achievement.\n5\n \nSuccessful parenting for \neducation includes\n the\n provision of a stable and secur\ne environment\n for study\n,\n raising a child’s aspiration and ambition, and crucially – \n strong\n \nparticipation wi\nth the school. However s\nchool discriminatio\nn\n, stereotyping and\n distrust \nof low income parents\n has been well noted and remains a barrier to the successful engagement of such families in their child’s education.\n6\n&#xa0;\nThe Government need to consider how schools can improve engagement with families from disadvantaged backgrounds. P\nolicies to \nensure schools can \nconstructively and positively engage with parents from w\nhite working class backgrounds will be crucial for\n ensur\ning\n \nparents \nwill s\nupport, \nrather than restrict\n,\n educational achievement. \n&#xa0;\nTackling the Economic Environment&#xa0;\nHowever, the Government must recognise that the \noverall impact of a young person’s external environment on attainment is enormous. 3.5 million children in the UK live in poverty, a figure which is expected to rise further with the\n introduction of the Government’s tax and benefit reforms. \n&#xa0;\nGiven the fundamental importance of eco\nnomic inequality and community, \nthere is a clear need to tackle and economic environment to increase white working class attainment. \nA piecemeal response - \nfocusing solely on school based interventions and not tackling larger national questions of unemployment, skills, low pay and work insecurity, the poor availability and affordability of housing, and the rising cost of living – will be ineffective at improv\ning opportunities for poor white children.\n At a more local level, t\nhere must be a concerted effort to ensure that physical and \nenterprise regeneration initiatives reach \nthe areas concerned.\n&#xa0;\nThe importance of the wider economic environment in a child’s edu\ncation highlights\n why targeted educational initiatives of the kind outlined in this paper \nwill need to consider the\n industrial heritage of the communities involved\n, and aim to\n dramatically \nboost skills\n \nin the industries of the future. But rather than as a \nwake for days gone by, \nthis heritage needs to be celebrated and built on\n \nraise aspiration for the future.\n&#xa0;An Inclusive Cultural Approach&#xa0;\nMulti-culturalism has made a highly successful and valuable contribution to\n \nUK\n \nsociety\n – making our country\n more inclusive, tolerant and vibrant\n. \nBut\n it is well documented that there has been insufficient \nrecognition and celebration of \nthe \noften diverse heritage of\n \nculture and \nidentity of\n white communities, particularly in or near to major towns or in specific \nareas of the country \n– \nsuch as traditional coastal resorts\n.\n \n The\n Department of Education has previously acknowledged that needs to greater efforts made to include white people in discussions on diversity and identity,\n7\n but there is little evidence to demon\nstrate that \nthe Government has actively pursued \nsuch pol\nicies.\n&#xa0;\nSchools are important places for helpin\ng children explore\n their identity, and more \nemphasis needs to be made on how teachers can support white pupils to develop and express their culture \nand \nbackground\n. When developing such policies, the Government must be cautious to ensure that a white\n British history and narrative \nis not promoted at the\n expense of all other\n cultures – as\n is the danger with the current Secretary of State for Education’s\n refo\nrm of national curriculum.\n It must also be \nclearly\n differentiated\n \nand unequivocally opposed to \nthe racially divisive approach of groups such as E\nnglish \nD\nefence \nL\neague (EDL) and t\nhe British National Party (BNP). \n&#xa0;\nThe kind of approach\n \narticulated by perform\ners such as Billy Bragg and academics such as \nthe \nBirmingham community historian, Carl Chinn, may be useful in taking forward this expression of identity.\n&#xa0;\nIn brief, t\nhe focus must be on\n promoting a more inclusive approach\n, which\n \ncelebrates\n the numerous di\nfferent cultures that make up \nthe 21\nst\n Century British identity\n and aims \nto ensure that the school environment gives children from all backgrounds a fair start. \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1The Forward Partnership on behalf of the School Effectiveness Division, Children, Young \nPeople and Families Directorate, Birmingham City Council,\n The\n \n \nUnderachievement of White Disadvantaged Pupils in Birmingham, \nReport 1, November 2008\n3\n \nAinsworth J (2002) why does it take a village?
