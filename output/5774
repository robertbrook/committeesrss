[normal]Witnesses: 
[normal]–
[normal]              
[normal]Rt Hon Iain Duncan Smith MP, Secretary of State, Robert Devereux, Permanent Secretary, Mike Driver, Director General for Finance, Department for Work and Pensions
[normal] gave evidence.  
[normal]Q136 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Can I welcome you this afternoon to our slightly delayed session on the Annual Report and Accounts?  Secretary of State, I wonder if you could introduce yourself and your colleagues for the record, please.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I am the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.  Robert
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Devereux is the Permanent Secretary and Mike Driver is the Director General for Finance in the Department.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q137 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Thank you for coming before us this afternoon.  We are going to start off with a number of questions about Universal Credit and its implementation.  These are questions that we might have wanted to ask at the last meeting in December, but because the Annual Report and Accounts were not published until the day after our evidence session, there was some further information, particularly from the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report on the accounts, which contained some comments on how the Universal Credit IT expenditure was treated in the accounts and the plans and costs of taking the programme forward.  The meeting was delayed twice.  We eventually did hear from you on 9 December, but the Annual Report and Accounts were not published until the day after.  Was there a particular reason for that?   
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: The reason was that we were in discussion with the NAO throughout all of that, but, Mike, would you like to say something on the details of that?
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: It was just that we were completing an impairment review and going through the process of getting the accounts published.  I thought we had sent a memo to you on the day of the hearing.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We did. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q138 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Yes, it was after the hearing, which did not give us time to read it before we had a chance to ask questions.  You can imagine why some people are a bit suspicious that this is the Department’s attempt to sweep things under the carpet.  What do you say to that?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I do not think so because, if it was a carpet, it was a pretty public carpet, and we were all under it in that case.  The truth is that we were not sweeping anything under the carpet.  I suspect this is probably the most detailed and forensic impairment review that has ever been done on something run by Government.  It was all in the public domain.  We discussed it at great length with the NAO, and all the accounts were published directly and signed off by the NAO.  I do not know if I have missed anything on that; Mike, do you want say anything?
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: At the last meeting we had, we tried to take you through the detail of the numbers.  Obviously, you now have the accounts in front of you, and the C&amp;AG’s report, which sets out those numbers as well.  Depending on the questions you want to ask, we can take you through those details.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q139 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Some of this is about “who knew what when?”  Secretary of State, you told us in December that you had initiated the red team review in July 2012 because in 2011— 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: No, I initiated it before that.  It reported back in July 2012.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q140 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] You said that, the year before, 2011
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]12, you had concerns that they were trying to do too much on the digital front, and you thought it was necessary to stop and pause.  You gave oral evidence to us on Universal Credit implementation in September 2012.  Why did you not tell us about the red team review at that meeting, if it had already taken place?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Because it was an internal review and we were looking at the results of that and trying to make whatever decisions were necessary to reshape and to get this focused.  It was about some of the issues that were going on within the Universal Credit team, and what was happening with regards to particularly some of the elements of the meshing of security.  Those elements were, for the most part, being dealt with at the time, as we came forward later on and produced our note
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]taking.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q141 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] You did not even tell us the review was going on.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: With respect, I do not have to tell the Committee everything that is happening in the Department until we have reached a conclusion about what is actually happening.  I will take those decisions myself and account for the decisions that were taken, and I have done that.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q142 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] In fact, when you appeared before us in September it was an ideal opportunity to tell us that there were concerns about what was happening with Universal Credit, but at that session you were very bullish about how successful everything was.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I still remain very confident about how successful it will be, but at the time we were still working out exactly, with Philip Langsdale, how we would make the reset necessary to complete the process.  In fact, at that stage, we were looking at bringing forward the start-up so that we started as a pathfinder and changed the nature of the roll-out.  That was still being set at the time I appeared in front of the Committee.  It was by no means complete.  It would hardly be sensible for me to come in front of the Committee and discuss something that I still have not confirmed or even completed myself.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q143 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] You did not tell us anything about that at the time, either.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I do not think there was anything to tell the Committee at that stage.  As soon as we had something to say, we said it.  With these things, you make decisions; that is what I am here for, and that is what the Department is meant to do, and then we account for those in front of this Committee and in front of the 
[normal]PAC.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q144 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] This might be a question for Mr Devereux.  In the written evidence that was given to this Committee in September 2012, in connection with the report we were doing on Universal Credit, it was not simply that things were not mentioned, but the words that were used were very certain that everything was on track.  For example, it was stated that, “From October 2013, Universal Credit will be introduced simultaneously across all seven regions”.  Paragraph 35 of that written evidence states, “Universal Credit will be digital by default”.  Yet in December we were being told, no, it had been realised that digital by default was too difficult long before that.  Why was the written evidence that the Department submitted to the Select Committee quite so confident that everything was on track at that stage?    
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: As the Secretary said, we were in the process of running quite a large and complex programme.  All the way through those sorts of programmes, you are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating your forward plans.  We wrote down and told you what our plans were at that time.  As with several of the programmes we have been through—we will talk about personal independence and child maintenance later on—as things go along, and you learn, things change.  Large programmes are not the sort of things you write down on day one and it is just a question of shelling peas thereafter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q145 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Do you not think it is appropriate that this Committee, the Scrutiny Committee of the House of Commons, which is meant to be overseeing the work that the Department does, should at least have had the courtesy of being kept informed about these various changes? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: With respect, Chairman, I am afraid I think we did keep the Committee informed as and when we had clarified, in the course of the discussions, what we were doing, what we thought the problem was, where it existed, how to isolate it and what changes to make.  I do not for one moment agree, in any way at all, that we spent our time hiding stuff.  We knew very well throughout that we would be accountable to the Committee, 
[normal]all would become public, and we wanted to make sure that the programme that we set in train itself was viable.  That is exactly what we were doing at the time.  
[normal]We made changes at the time, which were very public, about the fact that we were going to commence with a pathfinder process, and that we would be doing it differently from what was originally intended.  That was made clear to the Committee as well.  With respect, Chairman, I do not think this Committee can run the Department.  
[normal]Chair:[bold]  I do not think we are trying to do that, Secretary of State.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith:[bold]  We account to the Committee for the decisions we have taken, and at that stage we were making decisions about the changes we felt necessary.  I am quite content with that.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q146 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] You said yourself that the changes were not major.  In answer to a question that I asked about 
[normal]how things had changed, you said that, no, that was always the intention.  What
[normal] was maybe the intention was the pathfinder, but actually it rolled out quite differently.  In fact, the first time there was any reference to the red team review was in the December hearing, and it was given as though we should know what it was, but it was not something that had come before the Committee.  Can I try another question, then?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Can I just explain?  That information was given to the NAO, and it was on the basis of that that they wrote most of their report.  It was not that we were not accounting for it.  It may be that the Committee itself got to it slightly later, but it was in the public domain.  It was certainly given to the NAO very early on, and they were looking at it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q147 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Can I ask some questions about the reset in February to May of last year?  You gave oral evidence to us on 10 July, when significant changes to Universal Credit implementation were announced, but you did not refer, during that session, to the critical MPA report or the reset, which had already taken place earlier that year.  Why not? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I cannot remember exactly what I said to the Committee.  If I had had notice, I could have looked back through it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q148 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] The first time the reset was mentioned was at the hearing in December.  Again, it was presented as though it was something that we should be familiar with, yet it was not something that you or your Ministers had said to us.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: With respect, the reset encompassed the pathfinder and the stuff that I was talking about at that particular hearing.  As I said at the time, we brought in the Cabinet Office to help us make the reset, and Howard Shiplee and others to make those plans.  We did not have the final setting for that until later in the year.  The PAC report, and that of the NAO on which it was based, actually related to what happened in the previous year.  The process of resetting and refocusing was only finally complete, in terms of beyond the pathfinder, towards the end of last year.  So, in fact, the Committee were the only ones at the end of the year to be able to discuss that, because that was when that information was available to everybody.  We were working on it through the year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q149 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] When was the reset publicly announced, or when did it go into the public domain?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: At the time of the Committee, before Christmas last year.
[normal]Chair:[bold] In December? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Yes.  We were still working on it until we completed the final process at the end of the year.  That is exactly what this was all about.  We were working with the Cabinet Office and looking at some trial programmes.  We had Howard
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Shiplee in to complete the process and decide whether or not we would do the two-track process, which we agreed to do.  Eventually, that all became the plan by the end of the year, which is when the Committee got to hear about it.  In July, we did not have that particular plan. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q150 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Although the NAO report was not published until 5
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]September, you must have been well aware of what was in that report when you appeared in front of us in July, but there was no hint that that kind of criticism was going to come from the NAO report.  
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We were in discussion with the NAO about all elements in their report at the time.  As I recall it, the Permanent Secretary and Mike Driver were also involved in that process, so it was all in the public domain.  With respect, I am not in a position to talk to the Committee about stuff that the NAO are looking into and doing at the time.  It is for them to make that public themselves.  
[normal]Chair:[bold] But it was a hostage to fortune that the—
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith:[bold]  With respect, the NAO report was not about the reset.  The NAO report was about what they perceived to have happened previously.  With respect, I think we have been round and round this one many times.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q151 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair: [bold]Mr Shiplee told us at that meeting that the pathfinder had demonstrated that the IT systems work.  You cannot get any more definitive than that.  Then he went on to deny that there were problems with the IT.  That was on 10 July, and then we discover on 5 September, when the NAO report was published, that there were serious problems with the IT.  Mr Shiplee must have known that that criticism was contained in the NAO report.   
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: With respect, I think Mr Shiplee was talking about the pathfinder IT and the programme as it lay.  He was not talking about what had happened back in 2012 when there was an issue with an element of that IT.  That would have been rolled out, and that was what the report was about from the NAO.  It was not about the reset.  
[normal]The reset for which Mr Shiplee was responsible was based on his decisions about what the IT was capable of.  He was quite clear when he appeared before you about what he believed about the IT.  In fact, you will see on the reset that the IT we are using is the IT that was originally designed, less the elements that we had to write off in the end because they did not work, and which were mostly to do with security.  We were quite clear in explaining that to the Committee, so I do not see what the issue is.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q152 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] The rest of the IT costs are due to be written off in five years, which suggests that—
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: No, they are not being written off, Chairman.  I have to get this one right.  
[normal]Chair:[bold]  Well, written down, then, in five years.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith:[bold]  Written down and written off are two very different issues.  Every company I have ever worked for in the private sector writes down equipment value, otherwise you would have full value remaining on your books.   It is being written down over a period of five years.  I will get Mike Driver to talk about that.  The key point is that it is being written down because all the IT systems that we use at the moment were written down in the accounts many years ago, but with respect, they still function, and they still run our benefit system.  Just because you write a system down over a period of time, it does not mean you have written it off, it just simply means for accounting purposes you do not let it remain at the set value.  Writing something off is when that element of equipment that you might have been developing or using does not have a value to the equipment that you are running.  That is where you write down.  Mike, do you want to say something on that?  It is quite important.  
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: As I explained to you when we were last at the Committee, we had originally intended to publish our accounts in June.  We had done an impairment review at the time on the IT of Universal Credit.  At that point, we had determined that some of the IT was not going to work.  This may have informed the presentation that Howard gave to you in July.  We identified that £34.4 million of the IT would not work.  We then did a further impairment review, working very closely with the National Audit Office, and as a result of that we impaired a further £5.7 million.  We wrote off in total, as I explained to you in December, £40.1 million.  That is code that was written that never went into use, so that is the write-off.  
[normal]What we have determined, and we have again worked with the National Audit Office on this, is that the useful life of the asset is five years.  We do a straight line depreciation of that, so we write down 20% of that every year.  That is set out in the Annual Report and Accounts at page 76.  The NAO have explained how that is working.  
[normal]Importantly, for any asset that you write down, you look at the useful life of it every year.  If we were to determine at some point that the useful life of this asset is six years or seven years, we would then change the amount that we would write down that asset by.  This is quite normal for most of our IT assets.  It is only Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment IT systems that we originally decided to write down over a 15-year period.  Almost every other IT asset in the Department is written down over a five-year period.  
[normal]The reason we went for 15 years for Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payments was that they were such massive strategic systems, and working with the NAO, with the agreement of the NAO, we felt we should write them down over a longer period.  In many respects, because of the pace at which IT changes, five years is probably a more sensible period over which to write the system down, but as I say, we will review that on an annual basis.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q153 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] That is not what the NAO said, is it?
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: Sorry, in what sense?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q154 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] Amyas Morse said, and I am quoting here, “
[normal]At this early stage of the Universal Credit programme, the Department had not achieved value for money
[normal].  
[normal]The underlying issue, highlighted in today’s report, is that the Department has written off £40.1 million on assets it will now never use and spent a further £91 million on assets that will support only a limited service for 
[normal]five
[normal] years, with clear consequences for public value.
[normal]”  
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: In his report on the accounts, however, he does not say that.  He says, “We consider that figure to be reasonable” as to the amount that we have as the book value of the asset, and also the write-off.  I think we have to— 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] He signed this off and this is his opinion.  The Public Accounts Committee has said—
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: Can I finish my point?  It is worth just saying about the Public Accounts Committee that in its press statement, it told us that it is likely that much of this, including at least £140 million worth of IT assets, will now have to be written off, but that is not the case either. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q155 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] Has Mr Devereux asked for ministerial direction about this project?  Are you absolutely confident that the Treasury criteria
[normal] 
[normal]of regularity, propriety, value for money, feasibility, as far as this programme is concerned, have been met?  You are also the accounting officer.  Have you ever asked for a ministerial direction?
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]:  I have not.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q156 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] Do you not think you should?
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: Why?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q157 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] Clearly, given the reports from the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office, the Treasury criteria are hardly being met.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: With respect, the investment in the programme is £2.3 billion.
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold]  My question was to Mr Devereux.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith:[bold]  We are talking here about a level that is much lower than most private companies would engage.  Secondly, this is already acknowledged—
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] It is public money. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Wait a minute.  In the PAC report, the NAO report, the value of the programme’s savings of over £35 billion through Universal Credit
[normal] 
[normal]is already acknowledged, so can we please get this in context?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q158 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] But you do not have Universal Credit rolled out yet. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We will have it rolled out; that is part of the programme.
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] It has been delayed.
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: This is important.
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] It is indeed. 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: The reason the Auditor General has signed off our accounts with these numbers, which everybody seems to want to dispute, is that he believes there is a value in excess of the capital value that is out in monetary terms.  That is a value to do with people going into work, to do with the consequence of the Universal Credit system, which is actually, as we speak today, in use in Hammersmith and various other places, and is rolling out.   
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] The roll out is delayed. 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: We can only do one question at a time.  The reason why—
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold]  Why?  You are supposed to have your finger on all of the buttons.
[normal]Robert Devereux:[bold]  I can answer them all.  Which question shall I answer?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q159 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] You keep arguing that the savings have already been made because of the savings that will come in via Universal Credit.  The point I am making is that the roll-out of Universal Credit has been delayed.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: With respect, Chairman, the hon. Lady has to understand what accounts actually tell you.  Accounts make a valuation about prospective savings and the value of the equipment in use.  Every company I have ever been in does exactly that.  These accounts, as signed off by Amyas Morse, as he was named, make it quite clear that he is content with that valuation and the write
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]down.    
[normal]Chair:[bold] The valuation is one thing.  I am going to come to Nigel now to talk a bit more about the valuation.  It might be valued at something, but we all have questions about whether it actually works or not.  I want to come back to that.  Nigel will ask about the actual writing down.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q160 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Nigel Mills:[bold] We are in danger of going round in a few circles on this, but, Mr Driver, you just said that you thought five years was an appropriate useful life for accounting for UC software.  Does 
[normal]that mean you will write the whole lot off over five years going forward, or will the new stuff you are working on last the 15 years?
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: The new code is being
[normal] written down over a 15-year period at the moment, but we are in discussion with the National Audit Office about the appropriate period for writing that down as well.  If you look at many organisations in the private sector, and the public sector, they will use very different periods.  What we would like to do is learn the lessons of Universal Credit so that we apply the appropriate accounting standard that works for the Department and for Government.  At the moment, we have just over £30 
[normal]million of code that will be used in the new end-state solution, whatever happens with the pathfinder. At the moment, that is being written down over 15 years.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q161 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Nigel Mills:[bold] So it may go to five, although it is still at 15, and you expect it to be at 15 for some kind of period.  Going on, when you did the testing of value of its useful life, you only have—not quite literally a handful of people—a few thousand
[normal] 
[normal]on UC.  Does it not work out quite a lot of money per head if you write off £18 million just on this software this year, if you only have a few thousand people?  How do you get to there being any value in use in that year?
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: We agreed the detail of this with the National Audit Office.  We did an impairment review on the basis of three different elements.  First of all, we looked at what we had paid, and ensured that we had got proper value for what we had paid.  We said we wanted code to do these things.  Did we pay a market price benchmarkable in order to determine that that was a fair price for what we received?  That was the first thing we did.  
[normal]We then did a full component review, looking at every part of the IT and the software licences that we had, to determine precisely whether each component at the component level would be used going forward.  That led us to identify that some of the code that had been written had no future, either within pathfinder or the longer-term solution.  
[normal]In the third element of the review we looked at the value of our asset to determine the replacement cost of producing that asset—these are all in line with international accounting standards—and the comparable cost of replacing that asset with a digital solution.  That showed that that was comparable, so there was value in that as well.  
[normal]The fourth element, and this was not something that formed part of the formal impairment review, was to look at value in use as well.  We took a subset of the overall Universal Credit business case, and applied it to the volumes that it was planned would go through the initial phase of Universal Credit.  We looked at what was already happening with the simple cases, then what would happen with couples and families and the tax credit system.  We applied some forecasts and looked at the likelihood of each scenario for each type of component occurring, and we came up with a value-in-use calculation as well.  That fourth methodology gave us even greater assurance that the value of what we have deployed in the IT would deliver benefits greater than the cost of that.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q162 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Nigel Mills:[bold] Presumably, the benefits are a lot higher in years 4 and 5 than they are in this current year.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: Yes, the benefits do grow over time because the volumes grow when it starts being applied to different types of people.  We have weighted the probabilities across the board on both the volumes and the potential dates of implementation of those.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: That would be the same for every programme, because you invest up front, and as you begin to put more people on it, thus you get the greater level, or the volumes, that refer to this ultimate saving. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q163 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Nigel Mills:[bold] But you chose a straight-line depreciation method.  Anyway, we are probably getting too accounting technical to make any real progress if we are not careful.  
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: We keep switching between two completely different things.  The assessed value on the balance sheet, which has been signed off by your Auditor General, as I keep coming back to, is the value that is ascribed to the thing that we have already built.  The speed with which it is then consumed in the write-down is a separate question.  They are both interesting questions, but they are completely separate, and the speed over which they are written down has no bearing whatsoever on the value that goes on the balance sheet.  If that is not clear, we are going to go round in complete circles. 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: I point to two things that the Comptroller and Auditor General said.  He says, on page
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]74 of the accounts, “I have not qualified my opinion on the Department’s 2012
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]13 Annual Report and Accounts in respect of the carrying value of the Universal Credit
[normal] 
[normal]intangible assets.  Nevertheless, I have issued this report to draw Parliament’s attention to the implications for the use of public funds.”  He then goes on to say, as a result of all the things he draws to your attention, the figures that we have been talking about, “The Department has recognised a carrying value for the Universal Credit IT assets of £151.9 million as at 31 March 2013. We consider that figure to be reasonable.”  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q164 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Nigel Mills:[bold] At this stage, with a couple of months of the year to go, you are still expecting it to be worth £72 million at the end of this year.  There is no need for further impairment in excess of the expected depreciation. 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: At the moment, what we would do is write down or depreciate the £91 million over the five-year period; the £30 million of code that has a longer-term future, we would apply a 15-year period to; and to any licences, we would apply a five-year depreciation from the point at which we purchased and put those licences into use.  I do not, at the moment, expect any further impairment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q165 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] Secretary of State, I cannot express adequately with the strongest feeling my concern about the hubris that you have demonstrated in your tone to this Committee.  You have not, certainly to my satisfaction—and I am sure anybody who is watching will draw their own conclusions—made any satisfactory explanation about how you have kept this Committee informed about the difficulties that the Department was experiencing.  There has been obfuscation, smoke and mirrors even up to a few weeks before the report from the National Audit Office.  The memorandum that was released in August was clearly saying that everything was fine and dandy.  It is clearly not.  I will give you one more opportunity to answer, so you can explain to this Committee why there was such poor information provided by your Department.  
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I just do not agree with you, and I do not agree that we have done anything else but be open and honest about what the issues are as and when they have been identified, and what we would do about them as and when we had made our decision. As I said earlier on, the purpose of what we do is to make those decisions.  When we found something wrong, we went about and sorted it out.  As we sorted it out, we made clear direction about that, and eventually, through the NAO, the PAC and the Committee, we have been pretty open about it.  I do not think there is anything more.  In fact, in a sense, we are going round and round in circles here at this Committee hearing at the moment.    
[normal]Chair:[bold] Part of our problem is that we are not convinced by your argument that you have got it sorted out.  I will go back to Nigel, who has some questions on learning lessons.  We will see whether you can satisfy us.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q166 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Nigel Mills:[bold] It is a pretty simple question: are we sure this cannot happen again?  Secondly, what kind of evidence can you provide to us that can reassure us that this cannot happen again on this programme?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: What exactly are you asking cannot happen again?  That is the point that I am unclear about.
[normal]Nigel Mills:[bold] We cannot spend £40 million on stuff that is worthless.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: With respect, when you look at private sector IT programmes, they write off between 30% and 40% from IT development.  When IT is developed, it is not an exact and totally perfect process.  When you define and decide on this, you come to a programme, but maybe something does not quite work as you intended when you were designing it.  You might need to make a change.  That IT element of a programme may not work as you had thought.  It may have no value; you have to write that off, but does the overall programme go on?  Do you develop it?  Do you continue to roll it out as we are doing with UC?  The answer is yes.  
[normal]What are the lessons to learn?  We need to be very close to a programme like this.  We need to be certain all the time that what is being assured to us is correct, the internal checks and balances are right,
[normal] 
[normal]and the leadership is right in that programme.  All of those things are the lessons to learn.  These are clear lessons, and on those, obviously, we need to be as good as we possibly can be.  
[normal]In terms of overall development of programmes, when you look back over this, as I have said time and time again, in the previous Government, many programmes were simply launched full scale and crashed completely.  In one of the Committees today, you have heard about the BBC themselves having a whole programme written off.  This is not a whole programme; this is an element of a programme.  We are still rolling that programme out; there are still people now on Universal Credit.  It will roll out, as we said, through the north-west, and as the PAC itself or the NAO certainly said, it has at least £35 billion worth of net benefits that will roll out as we get this right.  
[normal]The way we are doing it is the lesson.  We are doing it step-by-step, and as you roll it out you learn what is moving and not moving in it, what is right and what is wrong.  Then you test that, and then you implement that.  That is how we are doing it: stage-by-stage.  We are trying to ensure that, at every stage, as we roll forward, we get it right before we actually roll it out to other claimants.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q167 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Nigel Mills:[bold] So, Secretary of State, are you now happy that this project is running along consistent with the reset plan?  Everything is on track as we speak, basically.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: It is moving exactly in accordance with the plan, but, as with all plans, you will need to constantly make adjustments.  There is no perfect straight line on any of these developments; that is the nature of it.  If we are really honest about that, the thing 
[normal]that we need to make sure we are right about is that, as we discover a problem, we put it right as early as possible so that it does not affect other elements in the programme.  That is the key lesson, which is to get in as early as possible and adjust things as they go along.  That is why we have left this, and I keep coming back to it, on the process of test, learn and implement, which means roll out as pathfinder, expand the pathfinder, move in the new bits of IT over the next phases, test those—if they are right, you can go to the next phase and the next level—and work closely with the Treasury and the Cabinet Office to ensure that we achieve all of those objectives.    
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q168 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Nigel Mills:[bold] Are you confident now that the escalation mechanisms work so that, if there is a problem, that gets to your or Mr Devereux’s attention quickly, rather than getting hit with it?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Yes, we hold regular meetings and have constant discussions about it.  There are weekly reports on it, and I have the right kind of people involved in running the programme who have a past track record, such as Howard Shiplee and co.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q169 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] You said, as part of the roll-out, that there are different phases.  What phase are we at at the moment?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We have announced the new roll-out programme.  At the moment, we are extending out to the other pathfinder centres, which will be complete by about April.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q170 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] My question is: are the only people who are now on Universal Credit or have gone into the Universal Credit system still the single people with no family and no complicated housing?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: In the pathfinders, we said we would start with those who were single, but as we had others—  
[normal]Q171 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] You started them a year ago, so what has happened now?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Hold on.  As we change, and their circumstances change, they stay on Universal Credit.  The next phase of this is then to complete that roll-out to the pathfinders.  Then the phase we go through after that is expanding that to couples.  Then adding the rest of the families to that would be the following phase, and then eventually moving in the tax credits.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q172 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] The next phase is couples.  When is that likely to come in?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I cannot remember the date of that.  
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: Summer.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Yes, early summer. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q173 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] It is early summer before couples come in.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Yes, we set that out.  We can certainly write to you if it is not clear.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q174 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] If that is the case, are you still intending to have the whole thing rolled out by 2017?  We have not seen anything that suggests you are not.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: The whole thing is intended to be rolled out by 2016, as we said before.  Then, those who are already on those individual benefits that will already obtain to those will be migrated across over a period that goes on from 2016.  The last and most delicate group, as you said in the original report, are the people who are themselves in a support group of Employment and Support Allowance.  It is fair to say they are the most delicate group to be careful about, and they will not be brought on board until just after 2017.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Chair:[bold] We have some more questions about costs. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I should actually finish.  The claimant commitment, as part of Universal Credit, will be rolled out through all the jobcentres, and will be applicable by the late spring of this year to everybody who makes a claim as part of that in every jobcentre. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q175 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] But the actual payment of benefit of Universal Credit for the vast majority of people is still some years away. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: It is in accordance with the programme.  It was not going to be rolled out overnight.
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] You told us it was, actually.
[normal]Q176 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] All new claimants were meant to be on it by April this year.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I do not think we ever did, even on the original programme.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q177 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] Oh, I think you did.  Anyway, it is a question about the transparency of future UC costs.  As I am still in a fog with the costs to date, how will you ensure that the future Annual Report and Accounts contain transparent information about the impact of the delayed implementation on the overall costs and savings of Universal Credit?  This has already been touched on slightly.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: The accounts will show very clearly what we have spent.  In terms of value for money, that is something on which we have an ongoing dialogue with the National Audit Office. Our understanding is there will be a further value-for-money study on Universal Credit, which will pick that up. 
[normal]There is also an issue, because we have to produce a business case, as you highlighted in your earlier point.  The business case process is one that is absolutely transparent with the Treasury, so that demonstrates the net present value and also the expenditure at each phase of the project. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q178 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] The point of the question was the delayed implementation. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I am not quite sure what the point of the question was.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q179 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] What is the impact going to be of the delayed implementation—
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: What about it?
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] —on the overall costs and savings of Universal Credit.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: The business case will change.  The business case that the Public Accounts Committee looked at, as part of the work that the National Audit Office did and the hearing we had with them in September, I think quoted a net present value of Universal Credit of £35 billion.  At the moment, we are resetting the business case, taking into account the agreed plan for the implementation of Universal Credit, so the business case will be adjusted on that basis.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q180 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] Agreed with whom? 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: That will be agreed within the Department, and then with the Treasury.  We will agree with the Treasury and the Chief Secretary.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q181 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] But you have scrubbed the initial agreement, so you are now in a different business plan.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: We have not scrubbed any agreement.  What has happened is, over time, plans change.  What we tried to do is, in a completely fair, transparent and open way, adjust the business case to reflect that change of plan.  I am a bit worried I have misconstrued your question. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q182 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold]  I do not think you have.  The point I am trying to make here is that the original business plan was based on a process and a programme that we were consistently assured would come out on a specified timescale.  That timescale has got longer and longer and longer.  The concerns that have been expressed by this Committee and others have been pooh-poohed as being irrelevant because it is all going to be wonderful.  We are now in a situation where you have a new business plan and everything is being delayed, and I am asking you a very simple question.  Have you worked out what will be the additional costs because of the delayed implementation?  How will you present those costs transparently?  
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: At the moment, there are no additional costs.  In fact, in the Spending Review 2010 period, the costs will be lower than were originally forecast. 
[normal]Chair:[bold] That is because hardly anybody is in payment still.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q183 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] I was about to say, nobody is on Universal Credit apart from single men on Jobseeker’s Allowance.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: You are jumbling together two things.  The cost of implementing Universal Credit, as with any programme, is often front-loaded because we have to build the IT systems; we have to have the infrastructure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q184 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold]  Or fail to build it, in your case.  Yes, okay, we can go round and round in circles on this obviously, but the issue surely is that they are not as separate as you are attempting to convince this Committee. There has to be a bottom line as far as costs are concerned. There is most markedly a bottom line as far as those people who will be dependent upon Universal Credit are concerned.  
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: All funding has been agreed with the Treasury, with the Chief Secretary, as part of the last Spending Review, up to and including 2015 and 2016.  The benefits associated with the application of those costs or the spending of those costs are within the business case.  The last version of the business case that the NAO looked at showed a net present value to the Exchequer of £35 billion. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q185 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] But this is a new business case, so we presumably will see the details of that, will we?  
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: It is a continuation.  It is the same programme that we adjust to take into account what is happening.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q186 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] But it is not the same programme because it has been delayed.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: It is the same programme.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q187 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] In December, you told us that the new business case for Universal Credit would be presented to the Treasury in January or February.  Has that happened yet?
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: No. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q188 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Why not?  When will it happen?
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: Because we have been working through the detail of that.  We have been working through it in draft with the Treasury, in actual fact, and we expect that to happen over the next couple of weeks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q189 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Once the Treasury gets it, will you be making it public?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We do not have any plans to make it public, but I am happy to discuss it with the Committee at some point.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q190 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] At the moment, it is not something that we as a Committee or anyone else would be able to see? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Not at present, no.  We are still discussing it with the Treasury.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q191 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] You have told us that you propose to publish a breakdown of Universal Credit expenditure by different claimant types, and you will indicate the different elements of the payment: child care, housing costs, for example.  When will you start to publish this information?  How frequently will it be published?  In what format will it be available?  When will those claimants actually be within Universal Credit? 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: There are claimants already receiving Universal Credit now.
[normal]Q192 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] Yes, JSA claimants.
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: With respect, they are Universal Credit claimants.
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] The easy ones.
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: If after everything I say you are going to ask something else, it will take a long time.
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] No, I am making a comment.  I am not asking anything else.
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: The Secretary of State has made clear in earlier evidence the intent in terms of the statistical coverage.  The statistics in this Department are published by professional statisticians when they think the data are of good enough quality and there is enough of it.  We will get it done as soon as we possibly can.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q193 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] So when, given the delayed roll out of Universal Credit, do you expect to begin to see the beginnings of that?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: When it is available and it has been signed off by the statisticians.  We will be publishing regularly.  We publish data regularly once the statisticians agree to them.  
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: I have not come with a forward list of when they are doing it.  Let me check to see whether they already have a view about when that would be, because it is simply a function of—
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q194 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] So you have no idea of when Universal Credit will be expanded, as the question was asked on the Floor of the House.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We do know.  We laid the plan out before Christmas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q195 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] That was two adults and two children, as opposed to a single man on Jobseeker’s Allowance.
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: In the question you actually asked, you observed that the Secretary of State had committed to publishing data about how many people were on it, different kinds and what sort of payments.  I was answering that question.  That is not the same question as “What date will couples join?”, which we have already answered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q196 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] You cannot publish data until you have the data, and surely the data are dependent upon the number of people who are claiming Universal Credit.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I have no idea what you are asking.  I am sorry; you lost me about five minutes ago.
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] You have to try harder. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I am trying very hard. 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold]  Okay.  We will leave you off that and move on to Housing Benefit.
[normal]              [bold]Mr Duncan Smith:[bold]  We need a language co-ordinator.  This is a foreign language to me.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q197 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] You are still on track that, by summer of this year, the pathfinders will include couples.  It will go beyond the very simple, single JSA claimants.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Yes.  We were clear about that before Christmas, and I can be clear again that this is a phased roll-out.  We will be adjusting the IT as we go along, which is what we said when Howard Shiplee was sitting here with you.  The next phase, the full development, is for couples, and then from there it will be to increase that to families in the north-west, and then exactly the same going on eventually to tax credits.  We said we would roll out into the north-west.  On the experience of that roll out, we then go rolling out regionally, and so the rest of the country will be complete by 2016.  Then we start to bring those who were not early claimants in after 2016.  
[normal]Chair:[bold] That was the timetable that was set.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: That was pretty much what we said before, so I am not quite sure why we are discussing it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q198 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] One of the impacts of the delayed implementation of Universal Credit roll-out is that local authorities will have to continue to administer Housing Benefit for much longer than originally anticipated.  In December, you told us that there was already a budget allocation to cover the cost of this under the new burdens regime.  How much has been allocated to local authorities for this, over what period, and how many other new burdens are there?  
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: We will continue to fund local authorities for the administration of Housing Benefit.  We do that at the moment.  The accounts, I think, show at the back that the amount is about £300 million a year for Housing Benefit administration.  If there are delays in Universal Credit, we will continue to fund on that basis.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q199 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] But there will surely be additional costs year-on-year.  Nothing will stay still.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: What are the additional costs? 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: It is only a new burden if we require the local authority to do something different.  We would continue to fund them for doing the job that we have asked them to do, so if we are still asking them to administer Housing Benefit, we will still pay them to administer Housing Benefit.  Once Housing Benefit becomes part of Universal Credit and the 
[normal]housing costs are captured within that, we will be paying through the Universal Credit route within the Department.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q200 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] I think you may have missed the point.  By the time Universal Credit is rolled out, there are still going to be 700,000 DSA claimants who are not going to be on Universal Credit, so they will presumably still be on the previous benefits, including Housing Benefit.  Most local authorities are expecting not to have a Housing Benefit section by 2017, because they have taken you at your word and thought that was when— 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] It was going to be finished. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Yes, but we have been very clear about this to local authorities.  We are in constant discussion with them, and I think they understand this fully.  In accordance with the roll-out, any costs they incur with regards to the administration of that for Housing Benefit will be supported by us.  Their worry was: would they have to pick up any extra costs?  The answer is they will not.  That cost will be borne by us, because it is still part of administering Housing Benefit.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: In terms of Universal Credit and Local Government, a colleague from the Local Government Association actually sits on the UC programme board as well, so the dialogue is ongoing on those issues. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q201 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] But the issue is not the dialogue, although I am delighted to hear about it.  It is the hard pounds, shillings and pence.  You have an ever-expanding budget to cover this, do you? 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: No, the DWP never has an ever-expanding budget.  What we do have, though, is a requirement to continue to deliver the services, so if we are delivering those services through Universal Credit, we will pay through that route.  If there is a requirement for local government to continue to pay Housing Benefit because it has not been subsumed into Universal Credit, we will pay through that route.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q202 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mike Thornton:[bold] On the Housing Benefit problem, I appreciate the fact that the DWP will finance local authorities, but that is not necessarily the main difficulty.  Having experienced this myself, to be an efficient local authority—and I come from an area that has one of the most efficient local authorities in the country—you need to plan ahead: not next month or next year, but two, three, four years down.  The problem with what is going on here is it is making it very difficult for local authorities to plan ahead to be able to know whether to take on staff, because you do not want to take on staff and then pay them off and make them redundant.  You do not want to take on temporary staff, because that always costs more and is administratively difficult, and often temporary staff do not have the training needed.  A local authority needs to know, regarding the administration of a benefit, whether or not they will need someone two, three or four years down the line.  It is not really good enough just to say, “We will pay the benefit for them.”  
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We are not just saying that. 
[normal]Mike Thornton:[bold] They need to be able to plan properly, and it is very difficult if the DWP is changing its mind.  That is what the people in my authority are telling me: that they never know quite what they are going to have to do in the future, and it makes it extremely difficult to run an efficient organisation.  
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We are in constant discussion with local authorities at every level. We have been very clear to them, as we have reset what those plans will be; we are continuing to discuss that with them.  All of that evidence and information is being made available to them. If they have any concerns at all, they know the route to come through, and we can explain all of that to them.  We are being as open as we possibly can with them.  We fully and consciously recognise that, in all these changes, they need to get the earliest information possible, and that is a matter that is being dealt with by my colleague, Lord Freud, directly with that committee we set up, and also directly with the two councils themselves.    
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q203 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mike Thornton:[bold] I appreciate that, but the fact still remains that they are having to plan without knowing exactly what is going to happen.  As you said, you yourself quite understandably do not know what is going to happen.  They are having to forward-plan without knowing what is going to happen, so the cost to them of what is happening is not just going to be the cost of administering Housing Benefit, but also the cost of having to do things at the last minute or maybe having to lay people off in the future that they were not planning to or earlier than they expected, etc.; the cost of pensions and temporary workers.  All of this is more than simply the cost of the payment of the Housing Benefit to the individual.  I just want to ask you if your Department is going to make sure that those costs are covered, as well as the actual cost of the payment to the claimant.  
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: The costs that local authorities would and should have incurred in the course of the changes that would have come about are costs they have agreed they would be making anyway.  Some are a balance between savings and costs, because in some areas they were not administering things, and in other areas they are administering things that they were not administering before.  Council tax benefit is a good example of some swap-overs there.  
[normal]My point is, throughout, we are discussing that.  If, however, as a result of the changes, there is a clear and identifiable issue here, then it is a matter that they need to raise with us.  We will discuss it with them, and if it was directly as a result of some changes, of course we would certainly entertain discussions over that, but by and large we are trying to give them as much advance notice as possible about the changes that we make.  
[normal]In some senses, some of this early delay gives them a bit more time to make those plans.  Within the time scales generally, we originally said we would have this rolled out by 2017, with the exception of that one group of people who are in the support group.  By and large, that is going to be the case, but it tends to come later on.  I had discussions with some councils who said that giving them that extra time helps them to make those plans a little bit clearer.    
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q204 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] I want to ask questions about the digital solution, but just before I do that, we sometimes forget this is about real people.  If a current UC recipient falls ill, in what respect is his or her experience different from somebody who is just applying for ESA?
[normal]              [bold]Robert Devereux:[bold]  In principle, they are not applying for anything because they are on Universal Credit and they stay on Universal Credit.  The point of the principle that we have established is that the people who are making transitions—although the Committee has consistently characterised it as being all single people, in practice we now have couples; we have couples with children; we have couples on Housing Benefit, in small numbers, but—
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q205 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] So that person would be sent a form as they are now?
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: The process in principle is that they stay on Universal Credit.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q206 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] They stay on Universal Credit, but they get sent the same form that they would get sent now, presumably—the ESA50.   
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: I will check and let you know.  If they are not going to be available for the conditionality regime that we have within Universal Credit—and we have to demonstrate whether they are indeed subject to something of less conditionality—we would have to find a mechanism for checking that. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q207 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] So you would still be going through that same process? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: With respect, they would when they were on Universal Credit anyway.  You would still have to assess whether or not they were eligible for what would have been Employment and Support Allowance, that element of the sickness benefit that would pertain during the course of Universal Credit, so those checks and balances will still remain.  I think they are reasonable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q208 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] So the experience would be little different.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: In terms of whether or not they are considered to be sick in the sense of the criteria that exist for ESA, there would not have been a difference anyway, because of course they would have been considered as such even in Universal Credit.  The question still remains: are you eligible to be beyond work?

[normal]Q209 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] I am just trying to establish what differences the change is likely to make to ordinary people.  In December, we were told about the digital solution, and we then received the annual report and the comments by the NAO in the introduction to signing off the annual report.  One of the things said in that report was that there were uncertainties over the exact nature of the digital solution.  These are the words of the Comptroller and Auditor General; in particular, he said it is not clear “how it will work; when it will be ready; how much it will cost; and who will do the work to develop and build it.”  Are you in a better position now to answer any of those questions?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Yes, pretty much; I think so.  To follow the point that Mike Driver made earlier on, we are in the process of rolling out to the north-west in terms of using those legacy processes.  Secondly, we will then go regional with everything by 2016, and 
[normal]eventually bring those elements who were not on Universal Credit but were claiming the other benefits on, as I said, with one group left over.  
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] So what—
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Can I just finish?  You asked me a question; let me explain.  
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold]  I asked you a question about the digital solution.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith:[bold]  I am trying to explain.  Universal Credit rolls out stage-by-stage in that process.  We are developing alongside that—because there are some major benefits to be had from that—what we loosely refer to as the digital solution, the end-state solution.  The reason for that is that, not just for delivery of Universal Credit, but in terms of the way in which our internal systems work, this would drive huge benefits and be an even more efficient process eventually.  As we develop it, we will be able to test that process.  The first process going on with the Cabinet Office takes us to 100.  The next process we do will do 1,000, then 10,000 and then you roll the whole process out nationally.  That is how the process works.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q210 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] Can I ask you two things about that?  The suggestion was that you would have 100, in tests perhaps, by November of this year.  Is that correct?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: By which month? 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] November of this year.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: 2014?
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] Yes.  You would have 100 testing cases with this digital solution.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: On what we call the end-state solution—the digital solution, as you referred to it—the idea is you to go 100, certainly by then, I anticipate.  Then you go to 1,000, and then you do 10,000.  That is how it works. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q211 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] Can you explain for those of us, who perhaps are not as aware as yourselves, exactly what you mean by a digital solution?   
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: It is a different process from the existing normal way in which people have developed IT systems within Government, which is—
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q212 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] So it is not like Agile then; it is another different way.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: No, you 
[normal]absolutely 
[normal]develop it through Agile.  That
[normal] is exactly what the point is.  As for the way you develop it, it uses what we call shared memory, cloud-source memory, which is much quicker.  It means, therefore, that the processes themselves are simpler in the way the benefit is resolved and paid, and the way that the claims work.  It becomes a much more digital process, a very fast one and a much cheaper process to run.  It also has a major impact in due course, because of its speed and efficiency, on the internal resources that are necessary for running your back-to-work processes.  The reality is that, as 
[normal]an end-state solution, it becomes the best process, but in the meantime we continue to use and develop the existing or legacy process that we have talked about earlier on.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q213 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] So you do not accept, as the NAO said, that there were great uncertainties about this?  This was as recently as December.  The NAO said—and I read out the four points that they thought were not fleshed out—that there were great uncertainties in this digital solution.  Do you accept that?
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: I will use my view of how you translate to the digital world.  If you think of greater automation, you are getting closer to what in practice is going to happen here.  Quite a lot of the work on this is trying to work out what it is about the nature of the rules that exist in the system, and the way in which we process, that could be changed with some lateral thought to enable you to do this—straight
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]through processing that does not require any human intervention.  That is quite tricky stuff, because a lot of the things have built up, as this Committee knows, over many decades, with lots and lots of small detail all the way through.  Some of what is going on in thinking about this is less to do with the IT and more to do with a state of mind.  It is saying: “Can I sweep some of that away?  Can I make it a lot more straightforward?  Do I really have to do contributory benefits in exactly the same way I have always done?”   
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: It is a change in policy. 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: When you embark on that process, as we did, only some months ago, and we are still many months away from having a system that can do 100 people, it is not surprising that the National Audit Office describe it as uncertain.  It is uncertain, but that is what we are working through.  The questions from the Committee today seem to imply that there is a perfect state of knowledge for the Department and everything into the future, and if only we wrote it down, we would be fine.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q214 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] We would be less likely to think that, Mr Devereux, as I said earlier in relation to the written evidence you submitted in September 2012, if you had not been quite so confident previously that things—not should happen or “it is our intention”—very much will happen.  Given that background, being told again that this new system will be the answer, when clearly the previous one frankly was not, you can understand where we were coming from.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: With respect, I disagree.  We have never said the system we are developing is not the answer.  I made it quite clear that there is a different process.  We are continuing to develop the process that we started originally.  Alongside that, because of the phenomenal benefit— 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] That is what I want to ask about.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: —we are doing what you call digital, what we call the end
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]state solution.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q215 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] I did not call it the digital solution, with respect, Secretary of State.  You called it that when you came here in December.  Mr Shiplee said the digital solution is essentially an “open source”, web-based approach.  It is cheaper to build and use “because you do not have to pay large licence fees for it.”  He then said this option would not have been available in 2011 when the development began.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]:[bold]  Correct.
[normal]Q216 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore: [bold]Open-source software was available in 2011, was it not?     
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Yes, but it is not the sole part of it.  What he is saying is the capacity to develop that kind of system in the way and on the scale that we would be developing it was not generally available because no one had done it on that scale before.  That is why we are taking it rather carefully.  The advice from the Cabinet Office was that they believe ultimately this is the right process to go down, because the way it is done is somewhat different from the o
[normal]ther processes.  You build that process and then you test all types at 100.  Then you move
[normal] to expanding the scale of that to test again at 1,000, and then eventually expand to 10,000.  At that point, you believe you have tested volume and complexity, and at that stage you are ready to expand out fully.  That is the way it works, which is very different from the way that we are doing the other process, which is phase by phase bringing in new claimant types as we build it out.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q217 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] My understanding is that, if you use this approach—using open-source software—you will have to employ in-house experts to do this.  Have these people been recruited?  If not, when do you expect them to be recruited?  How much do you expect that to cost?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: First of all, we are recruiting them.  We have recruited a number and we will continue and complete that process over the next few weeks.  In the meantime, the Cabinet Office are working with us to continue that programme, rolling forward towards the number we talked about earlier.  
[normal]Glenda Jackson:[bold] How many? 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: I recruited last autumn a chap called 
[normal]Kevin
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cunnington
[normal]; I brought him in from Vodafone.  He was head of digital for Vodafone.  He is currently helping us make sure we have the right capability.  You are absolutely right this entire system assumes you have your own people doing it; that is necessary if you are going to run an online presence.  We have been benefiting from resources from the Government Digital Service over the last few months.  Kevin has alre
[normal]ady acquired some people; they are in the tens end of the market, not hundreds, and this programme
[normal] might have to grow a lot before it completes.  We are making a start on that, but they will have to be in house and we have to make sure that we can afford them within the constraints that we are used to. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q218 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] You would expect them to have to keep an in-house capacity as the system rolls out, even when they have done their development. 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: You would indeed.  All the evidence from major suppliers of online systems is that they are particularly vulnerable to external attack.  You have to be awake and ready to do something about it, not to fix it in six months’ time down the back of a contract.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q219 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] 
[normal]Mr Shiple
[normal]e told us this would be cheaper.  I would put it to you that it is different but not necessarily cheaper, because of the in-house capacity you have to develop and retain.  Is that not the case?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: No, he was right.  It is ultimately a cheaper process to develop than previous systems.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q220 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] Would it surprise you, therefore, that a large organisation such as the university in my city has moved away from open-source approaches because they found them, in the event, to be much more expensive and not necessarily cheaper at all? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I do not know the circumstances, but it may be in isolation they found using open source more expensive and they were not developing a system as we have described it.  That is the way in which you make it cheaper, and ultimately the way in which it affects how we run all of our systems within the DWP has massive potential savings for the Department and for Government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q221 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] Some of the experts in the computer press have suggested that recruiting the relevant calibre of IT specialists for what you want to do may be difficult, but you are reassuring us that has not been the case.
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: I have recruited a very serious person who has a serious track record in this.  He is already on the case, doing this.  The only way that we are going to have a safe online system is if we are capable of actually adjusting it in real time, with people who understand the code.  That is a different position to be in from having all of the deep knowledge of the systems out at the far end of a contract, which is historically where the Department has been. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q222 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] What is the role of the Cabinet Office in this now?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: The Cabinet Office are still supporting and assisting us, but it was always very clear they would be handing over to us as we take over.  The Department will run this themselves, but the Cabinet Office will remain, as I have made clear on a number of occasions, close to this project and still act as advisers and support us throughout the whole process, which is what their role is.  They could not, for one moment, try to run a project like this and all the other stuff they do across Government.  Like everything else, they get you going; they do the proof of concept, and then the idea was that we would move on progressively.  Even at the time of proof of concept, something like half or more of the people running this end of it were DWP employees already.  It is about moving out and expanding into the rest of that space and basically running it from DWP.  I would invite the Committee to come and have a look at it if you would like to see what they are doing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q223 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] The press reports of interdepartmental disagreement were clearly wrong, then. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: They are ludicrous, because this is a constant rolling process.  We are constantly in touch with each other.  I have seen a couple of the reports and, quite frankly, we discuss everything on a weekly if not sometimes daily basis, and make alterations and 
[normal]changes.  The Cabinet Office has been strongly in support and continues to be in support.  They continue to be on the team as well.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q224 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Would the Cabinet Office prefer you scrap the IT used in the pathfinder and just have a single solution?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: The Cabinet Office are not involved in that side of it.  They are involved in the digital or 
[normal]end-state 
[normal]solution that we discussed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q225 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] There was no disagreement over that. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: They oversee all of it.  It is not just us.  We have discussed this with the Treasury, with the Cabinet Office and everybody else.  We would not be rolling this out now if people were not in agreement that this is the right thing to do—and they are.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q226 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] Mr Devereux, on the local authority Housing Benefit, where local authorities outsource to a company and they have renegotiated the terms of that contract based on the original timetable and now they will have to renegotiate it again, if they incur is a penalty, will you fund it? 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: As the Secretary of State said, if individual authorities can identify that there are real costs to things—
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] If there is a penalty in renegotiating the contract, can they approach you?
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: They do not need permission to approach me. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q227 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] Will you fund it?
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: I can assure 
[normal]you they come regularly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q228 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] Mr Driver, I will just take you back to what you were saying earlier on about the write-off and the five-year capitalisation.  In the National Audit Office report, it said that £303
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million was spent up to April 2013 on IT for Universal Credit.  Is that correct? 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: Yes.  It is actually £312
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million, of which £303
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million was on the IT and £10
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million was on the IT running costs.  They quoted £312
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q229 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] £40
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million was written off; £91
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million was capitalised over five years.  Can you tell me what that other cost is?  If it was not for code, what was it for? 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: A lot of it was for development work around the IT itself, so it would be the project costs—all sorts of things of that sort.  We can give you quite a detailed breakdown, in fact, if that would be helpful.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q230 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] Out of the £312
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million, only £91
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million of that cost resulted in a useable asset. 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: No, that is not right.  Let’s call it £303
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million.  We spent £196
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million, which is the amount that we capitalised into our accounts.  Of that £196
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million, roughly £165
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million was on software code and £31
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million was on licences to use that code.  If you break that down, we had something that is worth £196
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million; of that, the licences are all in use, the majority of them within Universal Credit, although we found some licences that we did not use in Universal Credit but we have used in other projects within the Department.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q231 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] Of that IT cost, only £40
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million has had to be written off. 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: Yes.
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] The rest is all useable.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: It is.
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] That is up to April 2013.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: That is what is in his report, where the Comptroller and Auditor General says we have Universal Credit assets of £151.9
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million.  That is the figure he quotes in his statement. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q232 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] £303
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million or £312
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million was spent up to April 2013.  What has been spent since then on Universal Credit IT?  
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: I do not know whether I have the exact figure on IT, but in 2013-14 we are forecasting to spend £195
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million.  In terms of IT for certain, £26
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million of that is on IT live running.  It is a relatively small amount so far on IT upgrades to fix the system, so stabilisation of the system I think accounts for less than £5
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q233 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] The accounts last year were very late in being made public.  Will that happen again this year?  Do you expect it to? 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: No.  We hoped to publish our accounts last year on 25 June.  
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] We hoped you would as well.
[normal]Chair:[bold] Our original meeting was in September.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: We were ready to publish our accounts on that basis.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q234 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] Was it the National Audit Office that held it up?
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: No, I am not going to say that it was the National Audit Office that held it up, but at that point we felt that there was a probable write-off of £34.7
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million, and we thought there was a risk that we might have to write off up to a further £11
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million.  The way in which we were going to treat the accounts was to be clear about those two figures.  We had a discussion with the National Audit Office about whether or not they felt our impairment review had gone far enough.  On that basis, we felt that because Universal Credit 
[normal]was an issue of such public interest, it was better to do the impairment review and delay the accounts so we could give you a firm figure of what the write-off was going to be.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: It turns out your estimates were pretty much correct, and the impairment review came up with that.
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: That is the point I want to reinforce: what Mike has just told you is that at the point at which we would have published the accounts, we would have written off £35
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million with a risk of £10
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million.  We ended up publishing the accounts with a write-off of £40
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million, so all of the delay did little more than put some more precision on something we were ready to do then.  We have none the less completed, as I said earlier, probably the most definitive impairment review on an asset of this size that has ever been done.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: We are still talking about millions of pounds, but relatively small sums of money when compared with the overall accounts.  We would have liked to publish the accounts on 25 June, had we been able to, because it is £174
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion of public expenditure that the accounts cover. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q235 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] I do not know whether you are the right person to ask this, Mr Driver, but when we went to see the pilot and we were looking at the live-time information, the woman who was showing it to me said, “Now, at this point I can authorise that payment.”  I said, “So, will the claimant get that by tomorrow or the next day?” and she said, “No; it takes about five to seven days for it to go from the DWP into the person’s account.”  Why does it take that long? 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: It does not.  It takes a maximum of three days. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q236 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] So she was wrong. 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: I do not know who it was.  I do not know what the precise question was, but in terms of payments, we do not make any cheque payments.  All payments we make are electronic, the majority through the BACS system.  That would take three days, and in fact there is an issue in our accounts that shows how we take into account the transfer between accounting and cash. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q237 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] So it is a three-day period. 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: Yes.  We account for the payment on day one, but we do not actually transfer the money until day three.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q238 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] Why? 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: Because that is how long the BACS system takes to operate.  We account for it at the point at which we take a decision to pay.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q239 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] You could do faster payments.  Why don’t you do faster payments?
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: A faster payment would cost about 48p per payment; a BACS payment through a non-faster-payment route costs less than half a penny, and we make tens of
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]millions of payments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q240 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] Given the size of the customer that you are to your bank, you should be able to get a better deal. 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: That is not the case.  Our banking contracts are exceptionally good value.  We drive down the cost where we can.  We account for 25% of all BACS volumes; we get incredibly good value on the payments that we make through that system.  
[normal]Chair:[bold] We are going to move on to all the other spending commitments in your document. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q241 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dame Angela Watkinson:[bold] My questions are about overall welfare savings.  Is it too soon to assess whether the policy changes you have made are leading to the levels of savings you set out to achieve and what mechanisms can be used to assess that? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We can safely say that our forecasts, as adjusted constantly and reviewed by the OBR, tell us that we are on track to make the savings necessary.  Those were adjusted slightly recently to accumulatively some £50
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion by the end of this particular parliament, £25
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion by 2013-14, and the £18
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion that has been referred to refers to savings in 2014-15.  That is of the 2010 measures only.  The latest estimate is still some £18
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion.  Within that, you will see variations.  With these longer-term estimates, some may go up, some may go down.  Some are affected by things like the number of people unemployed, claimants, etc., so some of these volumes change.  By and large, we certainly are on track. 
[normal]The important thing is to look at where we think this is going in terms of GDP, and we believe by the end of the parliament, 2016-17 give or take, expenditure on out-of-work benefits should be down to about the 2008-09 levels, pre the recession.  We will have brought those down overall.  They are falling, and they will continue to fall. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q242 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dame Angela Watkinson:[bold] Regarding the £18
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion in savings to which you just referred and which will have been achieved by 2015-16, what are the biggest elements that will contribute to that saving?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: The £18
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion refers to 2014-15, not 2015-16, as originally forecast.  Do you want to go through some of the details of those, Robert?  They might find it quite useful.
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: You are asking what the larger elements are.
[normal]Dame Angela Watkinson:[bold] Yes, where most of the savings are coming from. 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: By far the largest individual one is changes to inflation and the uprating index.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] If we are talking about the £18
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion, 
[normal]the principal measure is the
[normal] CPI one.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The other large ones are the Housing Benefit reforms and the time-limiting of ESA.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Those are the ones that are into the several
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billions each.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q243 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dame Angela Watkinson:[bold] That is pretty much what you estimated before you set out. 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: As the Secretary of State said, some of these are really easy to work out after the fact: you know what you thought inflation was going to be, you know what it turned out to be, and you can just multiply it up.  When you are making changes that have real behavioural effects in the real world, it is difficult after the fact to exactly strip out those behavioural effects.  Our best sense of this is we think we are going to get of the order of £18
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion, as we expected. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q244 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dame Angela Watkinson:[bold] The annual report states that a further £3.6
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion of savings is expected to be achieved but spending on welfare overall is likely to increase.  Does that mean that, if these savings were not made, spending would increase by an equivalent amount? 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: The definition of savings is as compared with what would otherwise have been the case, and so total welfare spending is relatively flat over the period of this parliament.  Between 2013-14 and 2017-18, it is going to go from £204
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion to £208
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion in aggregate across us and HMRC.  The savings that we are making are keeping that number down.  In exactly the same way as the Secretary of State said for working-age benefits, if you express it as a share of the economy and GDP, it will be going downwards as a share of GDP back to where we were in 2008-09.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q245 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dame Angela Watkinson:[bold] Finally, the uprating of benefits was limited to 1% for three years from April 2013, rather than being linked to inflation.  Is there any evidence of how people on lower incomes are managing their increased costs, or again is it too soon to collate such evidence? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: The evidence we get is that people are by and large managing, and we have, as you know, a network of support payments available to people from within the DWP and we have now localised the Social Fund, as you know, which has gone out to councils.  They are, it appears, spending less than was originally the case before.
[normal]Dame Angela Watkinson: [bold]There is not an increase in demand.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: They are not seeing the increased pressure that you might have expected.  That £170-plus
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million was allocated to them.  It was not cut; it was the full amount.  We are watching it all the time and discussing it with them to see what they are spending it on generally and how they are spending it.  By and large, they managed it.  The big mistake was originally made when the last Government took things like crisis loans in and put them into the telephone system.  Of course, we saw them ratchet right up at that point from where they had been when they were face to face in the jobcentres.  Have you got the figures there? 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: The increase was very significant. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I will see if I can find them for you, but it was a remarkable increase, because going on the telephone made it much easier.  I can write to the Committee on that.  This is now about getting face to face again, which is where you should be dealing 
[normal]with the problems of the individual, not just giving them money.  Give them money where necessary, but if they have debt problems or problems with drug or alcohol abuse, they should be on things that change their lives, not just covered with money.  In some cases, we found that people are on 10 or 11 crisis loans a year, which is quite ridiculous, with no one checking up on it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q246 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dame Angela Watkinson:[bold] Contrary to expectations, the demand has gone down.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: It is a little early to say, but our general instinct and understanding is that we do not think local authorities are feeling the pressure to spend greater levels of money.
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: In the arrangements up to 2006, we were making about 1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million awards a year at a net cost under £100
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million a year.  When we introduced the direct telephony approach, we started to get to 3
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million claims at a total of £225
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million a year.  Doing things at distance that involved making payments in cash unsurprisingly generated volume. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Personally, I think it was a major mistake to distance it like that, because nobody really dealt with the problem.  We brought it back to local authorities and face-to-face stuff.  We did not ring-fence the money; we gave it to them, so they could do what they felt was necessary.  They are all doing slightly different things. 
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: We have not imposed a single system on any council or the devolved Administrations.  We have set out a framework for the types of things that we would expect them to support people with.  Some local authorities are using the money through their social services systems.  Some are providing an item of furniture or whatever it is if there is a need, rather than a cash payment, so there is a very different approach being taken through the localisation of this. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q247 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dame Angela Watkinson:[bold] Is there any noticeable inconsistency in different parts of the country or different parts of 
[normal]London
[normal]?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: It is a bit early to say at the moment.  As I say, we are not setting the rules for this for them, so there will be inconsistency in the sense that you will get different approaches taken by different councils.  I was with one the other day, talking to some councillors who said that at first they had been concerned about this but they like it very much, because they now think they can do more for the people coming through the door than was being done before.  I take my hat off to councils; they have taken a very positive approach to this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q248 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] How are they going to be able to do that in the future when the money coming from central Government is going to stop in April 2015? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: It is not stopping.  It is being put into the overall grant.  It will not be a separate amount of money, but it will be part of the overall grant.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q249 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] That is slightly different.  Will there be extra money in the grant?  Will the cap on their grant be lifted?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I cannot forecast what is finally agreed when the grant settlement comes, but account of that will be taken between the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Treasury, etc., when they want to set that process.  However, it will be subsumed into the grant, not as a separate process, because for this period we would have been administering it, which is why we have allocated it, but from then on, we will have ended the policy, so it is theirs, as it were, and that becomes part of the grant. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q250 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Local authorities are very concerned they will be expected to do what they are doing just now but will not get the money to do it.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: You are right.  There is a shift in the way the finances work for this.  For the current financial year, 2013-14, for the devolved Administrations there was a direct transfer from the Treasury to those Administrations. For local government in 
[normal]England
[normal],  we, as the DWP, have given them the money that we would otherwise expend through a Section 31 grant route mechanism.  From 2015-16, that approach will stop, so that the funding for English local government will go through the funding provider, from the Treasury, through DCLG to local government.  However, that is all part of the local government settlement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q251 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] You can imagine why local government is really worried that the money it is getting via quite a long route from DWP will stop, and there is no guarantee that the Department for Communities and Local Government is going to make up that money at all.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: That is an issue for the spending settlement for the DWP.  The settlement, 
[normal]Spending Review 2013
[normal], took the money out of our baseline, so that money has then been shifted into the Treasury and it forms part of whatever the agreement is between Treasury and local government.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Also, in the period that they take it, we will have a much clearer idea anyway how much is being spent over that period and what they are using it for.  That will help with the grant settlement in due course, because they will be able to take account of what they think they need. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q252 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Was it £170
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million you said that was transferred?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: It was just over.  I was just looking at the figures.  £176
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: It was £176
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million in the current year that we are paying through that mechanism. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q253 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Do you not think that as a Department you should retain some of the responsibility for the money for the Social Fund, rather than it just being put back to DCLG? 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: The total amount that is being spent on local government through DCLG is £50
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion.  If every single transfer that has happened over the last 10 years kept being tracked indefinitely—£50
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million here, £20
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million there, £40
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million there—we would 
[normal]have crates and crates of line items in the accounts, but none of this is ring-fenced.  So there is a little bit of me that thinks the grown-up thing to do is to pay the cash in the Parliament when it was voted to us, but thereafter—
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q254 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] But they have the experience of stuff not being ring-fenced and then not getting it.  This is just yet another thing.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We have this debate again and again.  The point was the Government came in saying that they would value local government by not ring-fencing moneys that go to them, on the basis that local government has to be responsible for delivering the necessary services to local people, rather than it being micro-managed from here.  This was one of the areas where we said, “Look, we do not know specifically how you are using it.”  We do know the way we were using it at the time was not right and that it would be far better to go local with it, and we are learning as we go along what they are using it for.  Some councils are quite different from the others.  It is about trusting local authorities to say, “We have this money and we think we know what is best to be used for people who are most in need.”  
[normal]Bear in mind we have not got rid of all of it.  It is worth reminding ourselves that we still have responsibility for winter fuel payments, cold weather payments, funeral payments and budgeting loans.  We devolved those two elements of essentially the community care grants and then the crisis loans, although there is a line of crisis loans that we still have responsibility for.  Essentially, it was a subset of the overall Social Fund, but we still have responsibility for those other elements. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q255 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] There is a danger of looking at the spend this year and not getting the true picture, partly because a lot of local authorities did not know what their demand or need would be, and therefore perhaps have not been as generous as they might have been had they been in a position to work out who was going to ask for what and how much they would have to keep aside to see them through the financial year. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I am not so certain that I would completely agree with that.  We are learning what local authorities are finding now, and it is a rolling picture.  We will be gleaning, as we were talking about earlier, what we think they are using it for.  As I understand it, there are some quite interesting, innovative approaches that local authorities are taking to making their money go further and ensuring they get support to people quickly and, at the same time, start to change the nature of the way they live their lives.  This was always the idea: that if they did it in each area, they would be able to meet that need in their area in their own way.  We are interested in knowing how they are doing it, although I am not controlling it or running it, and I do not have any advice to give them about how they should do it—certainly not from an organisation that saw a tripling in the numbers going in front of it through a change that I think was a mistake.  We would have been better off leaving it where it was with the jobcentres at that stage, because I think it was much better to deal with things face to face.  However, going to the local authorities is every bit as good.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: Our anecdotal evidence is that local authorities will probably spend less money on this provision in 2013-14 than we provided them with funding for.  What we have 
[normal]not done—and it goes back to Mr Thornton’s point about allowing local government the time and opportunity to plan—is taken that money off them in 2014-15.  It is likely that we will pass that money across to them on a quarterly basis, and if there is huge disparity between what we thought it was going to be spent on and what is being spent, we will have a conversation with them, but it is not our intention to claw back. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q256 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Nigel Mills:[bold] It might be useful if you could talk us through how the overall welfare cap could work.  What happens if during a year you start to get a bit near the ceiling, or the economy turns down and you have an unexpected peak that means you think you are going to go way over the cap?  How will that work?  What response would you have? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: The idea behind it is to try to take away the unpredictability of the AME—annual managed expenditure—spend that we have with Treasury.  The idea of the cap, and there are some exemptions, is to then set a control mechanism over that, which would have in its devices also a report to Parliament, so we would need to get the say-so of Parliament for us to breach the cap, if we intended to breach the cap.  It is not beyond the wit of man that you might breach the cap, but generally this is to put a discipline in.  
[normal]We have kept pensioners out of the cap, because we feel that is a separate policy area that needs to be dealt with separately.  Others have said they would have them in.  The idea then would be internally you would have to debate where you would make your savings necessary if one area had gone beyond what had originally been planned.  Bear in mind we have within the cap allowed for certain areas to be exempted that would be problematic; they would be difficult.  For example, state pensions, automatic stabilisers; we have talked about JSA, JSA-passported Housing Benefit, and then corresponding UC expenditure on Jobseekers’, and then full conditionality—these are the areas that would be difficult because they are being tugged outside.  However, the rest of it would be in, and within those more predictable elements, we believe it means necessarily the Department would have to try to retain control, and be very clear and quick about where they thought there were pressures coming.  
[normal]It is really important to establish that, if you are going to set a cap like this, you need to retain maximum flexibility within the area of the cap.  Any existing ring-fences need at some point to disappear, because that way the Department can then manage where their money is.  Otherwise, what happens is you get one area that is underspending but you cannot deal with it, and another area that may be overspending.  You need to have the flexibility to adjust across that, so your overall level then becomes the Department’s reporting point, not individual line items. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q257 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Nigel Mills:[bold] It sounds like you are expecting this to be more of a year-on-year budgeting restriction.  You think, “Next year, my budget is going to go up by 1% and my costs are rising by 3%, so we need to make some changes in advance,” rather than it being, “Oh dear, we are six months through the year and we are going to miss something horribly; I need to go and make changes very quickly to have the benefits there are.” 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We said it was a five-year process, annually managed through the Autumn Statement and adjusted if necessary.  You would not anticipate having to adjust it; that would be the point of setting a five-year span for the cap.  You would come back to the 
[normal]House if you were breaching within that year, but generally the Treasury would take the view that it was a five-year settlement and these things are apparently predictable within five years.
[normal]Mike Driver[bold]: As part of that process, the Office for Budget Responsibility will have a significant role in setting out the charter for that approach and also measuring our performance against the cap.  As part of that, though we are still working through the detail with Treasury colleagues, we would expect a breach of the cap automatically to trigger a debate in Parliament as well. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q258 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Nigel Mills:[bold] Would that be after a breach or before a breach?  Presumably, if you were going to breach, you would have to come and get parliamentary approval for the extra money.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: It would be at the point of decision on the breach; that is what it would be.  You would have to come in front of Parliament to explain that, and then the idea is there would be a vote on it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q259 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Nigel Mills:[bold] We understand that the state pension will be outside.  Will the other pensioner benefits also be outside, like the winter fuel payment, or are they in the cap? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: These are matters that are still under discussion at the moment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q260 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] I wanted to talk to you about staffing.  I do not know who would be the best person to ask—maybe Robert.  In December 2008, the DWP had 105,000 staff and last year it had 93,000, which is a reduction of 11%.  Has that level of reduction in staff had an effect on the implementation of Universal Credit and the welfare changes? 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: There are three or four things I need to say together here to get the story straight.  Let me tell you a story about higher performance in terms of the services we are producing, with fewer people, less money, and yet still higher levels of staff engagement, which in turn will take us back to better service in future.  To talk about the services first of all, I pulled out some figures just before we came.  With the sort of performance that the operational business is seeing now, where 80,000 of these people sit, we are typically clearing things in 10 days that 12 months ago we were clearing in 16 days.  There has been a huge improvement in the speed with which some of our basic benefits like JSA are being done.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q261 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] You still have the same volume; you are just dealing with it more quickly.  Is that what you are saying? 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: Yes, and the reason for that is people have thought very carefully about exactly how to improve the system.  One of the things that used to happen previously was that, partly because we were taking too long to pay things, people would ring up the call centres; the call centres would not necessarily know the answer, and they would give it to somebody else in a different part of the office to try to answer.  We have managed, by retraining the call centre people to answer better questions and at the same time making sure we are not behind, to reduce completely the total number of phone calls.  In November 2012, there were 4.5
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million inquiry phone calls in one month.  In November 2013, it was 
[normal]2.9
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million.  That is down over a third.  The number of calls we are now answering in the industry standard of 20 seconds is at the industry level of 80%.  The number of complaints we are getting for taking too long is down over a quarter.  
[normal]The entire system is basically working much better than it used to, delivering much better results for citizens, and also reducing lots of cost, because work is not being moved around the organisation.  People are picking it up, doing it once, and it is done.  That is a very substantial change when I have taken 20,000 staff out in the space of the last few years.  We are now running the organisation on a budget that is £2
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion a year less than it was in 2009-10, with an aggregate saving of £7.5
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]billion. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q262 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Teresa Pearce:[bold] Universal Credit and PIP have suffered significant delays, and you are saying that the reduction in staff is not a factor. 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: As the Secretary of State has made clear, the driving factor in all the reforms that we have done, unlike previous ones, is that we started and made sure that every time we opened something up it works and it works safely.  Every one of these has been planned to ensure we build from one to another.  The great majority of people are still currently receiving JSA and DLA.  The processing of the existing benefits is still the thing that most of the 80,000 staff are doing.  Over time, that will change. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q263 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] Was it planned that people applying for PIP, when it was introduced, would in some cases be waiting for five or six months to get a decision?  Was that planned, or are current applicants being used as guinea pigs when there should have been a proper pilot?
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: Was it planned
[normal]?  We have taken steps to progressively roll out the way the Personal Independence Payment works.  We started with a small group in the 
[normal]n
[normal]orth
[normal]-
[normal] 
[normal]w
[normal]est, as you know.  We then went 
[normal]on 
[normal]to 
[normal]an 
[normal]assessment.  We are now learning about what the health
[normal] 
[normal]care professionals
[normal] are doing. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q264 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] But are you not learning at the expense of people?  When we were told there was going to be a pilot of PIP, we thought that was good, because that is what we had originally asked for.  Then we were told there would be a pilot starting in April, I think, and then full-country roll out in June.  We said, “How do you assess a pilot in that period?”  I have read your interim report—the one you came and handed to this Committee—which was very bland about PIP.  Up and down the country, with both providers, people are waiting not just weeks but months to get a decision.  Having applied for benefit, they are not getting the money.  That would appear to be because the systems are not quite working.  At the Public Administration Select Committee last week, the Atos representative said that each actual assessment was taking twice as long as they had anticipated.  Are those things that should be properly piloted before you guinea-pig all new applicants?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: With respect, I do not understand how a pilot is defined differently from what you call guinea-pigging.  The reality is we are rolling it out carefully and slowly so that, when we strike an issue or a problem about longer times, we can then figure out whether there was an estimate that was not right and we need to adjust certain things, which is exactly what is going on at the moment, to ensure that flow increases and that people 
[normal]are able to do it.  That is what is happening.  All of these have programmes to get the backlog that existed under control.
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] Would that not have been—
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Hang on a second.  You asked a question, Ms Gilmore, and I want to complete this process.  This in a sense is what is called a rolling pilot.  You learn as you go along and you adjust; you do not completely open up the volume so you cannot adjust it.  We have not completely rolled out, because we have decided we need to make sure we adjust before we go to the next phase.  That is how it works.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q265 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] That is not quite true, Secretary of State, because it is rolled out across the whole country for all new claims for PIP.  There are people who, six months after they had the face-to-face assessment, still do not know whether they are getting the award or not. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Which is why we slowed down the remaining part of the roll-out and kept it under control—so that we can adjust as necessary and get it right.  We have not rolled out for all those people who are on for their annual reassessments, etc.  Those are not being rolled out for everybody.  We kept that under control. That is why we are doing it this way: so that we can learn whatever lessons are necessary before we go out fully.  Bear in mind we are not dealing with the vast majority of people who are on DLA, who are on lifetime awards.  That does not come for some time yet.  This is a process that allows us to check this out, and that is critical.  It did not happen under ESA.  They went completely straight out, and they hit a whole series of major problems.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q266 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] That is not true.  It was new claimants, exactly the same.  However, you have not got it working for new claimants and you have rolled it out for some of the soft migration.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We are making those adjustments for those new claimants and others. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q267 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] They still have not got their award.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We are doing it for that—to make sure we improve that and there is no backlog. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q268 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] We all have constituents who have had a face-to-face process and still have not been told they are to get an award.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: That is exactly the point; we are trying to make sure that those things we learn in this process are then adjusted quickly and we can get that under control.  I do not know what other way you would want it done.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q269 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] Might it have been more sensible to have a smaller scale, as you have done with Universal Credit?  You have told us over and over again that the reason Universal Credit is rolling out so slowly and through very small pathfinders is that you want to 
[normal]be careful that you get it right.  The Personal Independence Payment pilot was very short, it has been rolled out to all new claimants, and in some places to some transferring people, and the system just does not seem to be working.  It is a mystery whether that is because the staff are not properly trained or the process was not scoped properly in the first place, before contracts were entered into.  However, it is an interesting subject if you are not a claimant.  If you are a claimant, it is a very serious matter that you may be spending months waiting to know if you have been awarded this payment or not. 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: When we set off on this, we had constructed a test—a different and more substantial test compared with that for the DLA.  We had identified how long we thought that would take to do.  We said to providers, “That is what we think it might be, but we are not contracting for this time.  Your objective is to make sure you have enough resource here to cope with this.”  They have found in this short period they have more face to face than paper, and it is indeed taking longer at the moment.  You would expect that, when things start like that, they are going to have to make some further adjustments, and either bring more people in or change the balance on which some of these assessments are made.  That is what they are trying to learn now.  We could have started with a tiny number.  We have started with the flow, and, as the Secretary of State said, we have therefore made changes now to the speed with which we are doing the actual reassessment to give them the chance to bring this back into line, which is what both providers are planning to do now. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q270 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Have Atos and Capita been able to recruit enough assessors to do the PIP assessment?
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: They are both in discussion with the Department about how they remove the outstanding cases that you are talking about by recruiting more people, training them and making the process as efficient as it needs to be.  The Department is involved in that as well to make sure there is nothing the Department is doing that gets in the way of doing that.  This is the dialogue going on. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q271 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Were we not already in the position that Atos was struggling to recruit enough assessors for the Work Capability Assessment?  That is partly because of the reputation it had, but it has been struggling and there has been a huge turnover of staff.  Surely, you should have been able to foresee this: if they cannot recruit assessors for the WCA, where are all the other spare assessors going to come from for the PIP assessment? 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: To the best of my knowledge, at the expected length of assessment and the expected ratio of face to face to paper, both providers went out and managed to achieve the sort of quantity of assessors that they needed.  We are not in this position because somehow or other they had a catastrophic recruitment exercise.  The actual parameters about how many people are going and how long this is taking in the first instance are longer than when we tried it earlier on; we did try it earlier on, so it was not just made up.  In that process, we did make clear to them that this is an area where we have tried to make an assessment about how long that would take, but they are signing up to do these assessments, and their obligation was to make sure their supply chain was deep enough. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q272 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] The providers now seem to be surprised at how many face-to-face assessments have been carried out, but one of the primary rationales that was given for 
[normal]doing away with DLA and introducing PIP was to have face-to-face assessments.  We spent a lot of time on this Committee saying, “Do you really need that many face-to-face assessments?  Could there be exceptions?”  I remember on the Bill Committee we debated this at great length, and the whole attitude was that we must have face-to-face assessments, because that is what was wrong before. I find it hard to understand how you could scope it so badly wrong that they are now saying to you, “We are having to do more than we thought.” 
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: We are talking about percentages on the assumption.  We are not saying we originally somehow thought there would be no face to face, and now there are lots of them.  I cannot remember how many we expected there to be; I will drop you a line, but I have a feeling it is of the order of three-quarters were going to go face to face.  It is about 10% or 15% higher than that at the moment.  It is higher than we expected, but in the same sort of territory—towards the extent that most people are getting face to face, but it is more than they were expecting.  They have recruited at the level at which it would have worked at the timings and ratios we had previously.  Notwithstanding their contractual obligations to do the things that come towards them, they have not had a deep enough supply 
[normal]chain
[normal] to make sure they can pick that up in the short term.  However, that is what they are remedying now.  They are recruiting now; they are trying to find ways to ensure their process works well, and we will get out of the shortfall we have at the moment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q273 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] Secretary of State, when you came to the Select Committee just before Christmas, I told you about a former JCP adviser who was saying there was a culture of sanctioning inappropriately and how this was affecting and distorting the unemployment figures.  After that session, I was inundated by both claimants and also existing and other former JCP advisers who were telling similar stories.  You will be aware that the Committee has just published its report on JCP, and one of the points made was that there is evidence suggesting that “many claimants have been referred for a sanction inappropriately or in circumstances in which common sense would suggest that discretion should have been applied”.  At the time, before Christmas, you said that you did not accept this.  Do you now accept that position? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I do not accept it as a policy area.  We deal with a lot of individuals.  The advisers themselves are individuals.  There is a check-and-balance process in there.  However, I did have a look at this; I was just trying to find it.  On the sanctions regime, as we see it right now, it fluctuates month to month.  We have tightened up on sanctions, but generally it fluctuates, some lower than others. 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] It has increased extortionately, Minister, since November 2012. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Let me give you a figure here that is quite interesting.  Early signs are that, after introducing the new sanctions regime, as we did, the proportion sanctioned for high-level offences has fallen by almost 50%.
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] Can I move you on, Minister?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Medium-level sanctions appeared to have levelled off. 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] Can I move you on, please?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: With respect, you asked me a question.  I was just trying to give you a bit of evidence about what we believe to be the case with sanctions.
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] Minister, you are here; this is part of the accountability process of this Parliament and this country.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: With respect, you asked me a question.  I would quite like to answer it.
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] I did not ask you about the number of sanctions. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: You asked me whether I had had a chance to look at this and whether I had changed my mind, and I am just giving you what I looked at with this.
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] I did not ask if you would look at it; I said, “Do you accept it?” 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I talked about the fluctuations between 3% and 5% in any month.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q274 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] Do you accept it?  I think the answer is no. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I do not even know what the question was now. 
[normal]Q275 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] I said, “Do you accept this?”
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Accept what?
[normal]              
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] Do you accept that there has been inappropriate sanctioning?  You have said quite clearly, no, you do not.
[normal]  [bold]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: As a policy decision, I do not.  There may be individuals who have done things wrong.
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] Fine.  I would like to move on to my next question. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]:  I said to you in December that, if you would like, I would be very happy to see or speak to the individuals.  I have not heard anything from you. 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] That is rubbish, Minister.  You have had a letter from me.  
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I have not had the name and the details.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q276 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] Yes, you have.  That was one of my next questions: when am I going to be able to have the opportunity to meet with you and my whistleblower? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: You can meet with me at any time.
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] You have not responded to my letter.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: My door is open at any time.  I have not seen the letter.
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] You have had a letter from me.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I am telling you that I have not seen it, so if you would like to bring them in, I am more than happy to set that up.  Rather than shouting the odds, I am very happy to see you.
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] That is a positive response, Minister.  Thank you. 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Hopefully your officials behind are making a note of that.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I said that in December.  I still stand by it.  I am not trying to avoid it.
[normal]Robert Devereux[bold]: Can I add to that?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q277 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] Can I just direct my questions to the Secretary of State at this stage, thank you, Mr Devereux?  When the Minister of State for Employment came to this Committee, she also agreed to an independent review of sanctions, separate from the existing one that is going on.  I have also written to the Minister and have not had a response to that, in terms of when this will happen and its terms of reference.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We are reviewing the sanctions regime.  We keep it under constant review, and we will use whatever evidence is brought to us at the time of that review, and if I find there is any difference or problems about this, we will adjust it accordingly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q278 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] You will agree, as your Minister did back in November, that there will be a new independent sanctions review.  You agree to that, Minister.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I agree to there being a review, which is what she said.  I am not quite certain what she said at the time to the Committee.
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] No, that is fine, thank you.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I am going to explain this.  I am quite happy to have this process as general reviewed, and I do not think there is a problem with it.  However, if you want to bring stuff forward to me, you can.  There may be individuals’ issues, but there is no policy issue here that sets out to deliberately sanction people for no reason whatsoever.  I think Jobcentre staff up and down the country do a brilliant job.
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] I am sure the independent review you have confirmed will help in establishing that.  Can I move on now, Minister?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: They sanction people where necessary, not just because they feel like it.  It is quite important to say that.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q279 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] I want to ask you now about the spending round, where it was agreed that £350
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million was being allocated to programmes to support people with disabilities and long-term health conditions.  The disability strategy that was published in December did not explain how that would be allocated and, again, it would be helpful if you could provide a bit more information about that, especially since we know that currently there is only one disability support adviser to 600 people with disabilities who are seeking work.  On that ratio, it is not a good position to be in, is it? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: When you take into consideration the Work programme, the ratio rises quite dramatically.  I would simply say we are still discussing how best to use the 
[normal]money we are spending—the £350
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million—and when we are clear about that, we will come forward with it. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q280 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] When can we expect that, Minister? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: As soon as we are ready.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q281 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] I am sure that will give a lot of comfort to people watching.  Moving on to the labour market trends, you will be aware from figures in December that 1.47
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million people were working 
[normal]part
[normal]-
[normal]time because they could not find a full-time job.  I believe now, since the data set began, there are more working people in work living in poverty than both workless families and retired families combined.  What assessment has your Department made of the impact of involuntary part-time working?  What assessment have they done of the effect of in-work poverty on benefits
[normal] expenditure? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: It is very useful that you have asked this question, because I have been wanting to get to grips with this idea about people in work and in poverty.  What is interesting about this is in the figures—I went and checked these figures—because the number of working-age adults in poverty has broadly been flat since 2010-11, but it was under the last Government that it rose by 500,000.  The in-work poverty figures that have been referred to by the leader of the Opposition and now, I think, by you actually refer to the period of the last Government.  They do not appear to refer to this Government at all, because they have been flat.  They did rise by 1% under the last Government, so I will assume your criticism is of what took place before this Government came to power.
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] They are ONS figures and they are—
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I have the figures right in front of me.  I can tell you now that they refer to the period under the last Government.  The point is that one of the best ways to move people beyond and out of poverty is through work.  For example, children who are in workless families are three times more likely to be in poverty than those who are in families in poverty but in work.  The reality is there are something like 274,000 fewer children now in workless households than there were in 2010, and I think that is an advantage.  The figures that you have just given me, Ms Abraham, are actually about the period of your last Government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q282 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] What assessment has your Department made of involuntary part-time work and the effect of in-work poverty?  You can try to shift the blame on this whichever way you want, but at the end of the day these are figures from the Department. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: With respect, Ms Abrahams, you have been trying to blame us.  I was simply explaining what the figures are.
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] What assessment have you done on involuntary part-time employment and the effect on in-work poverty?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: As we said before, we have had the biggest rise in full-time work.  
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] I did not. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We have had the biggest rise in people going into employment.  The numbers of those wanting full-time work but getting only part-time work are now falling, and we believe they will continue to fall as people are able to develop their part-time work.  The key thing is our employment figures are remarkable.  I want to give you a comparison here.
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] Can I conclude, Minister—it does not matter— 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: With respect, Ms Abrahams, you ask a question, then you do not like my answer, so you then interrupt me.  Instead of hectoring me, maybe you would like to hear the answer.
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] You are not giving me the answer. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I will give you the answer.  We have worked on getting people back into full-time work.  This is really important.  Since the election, three-quarters of the rise in employment has been in full-time work.  Since the election, full-time employment is up by nearly 1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million—971,000.  Part-time work is up by 337,000, so considerably more, and last year full-time work was up by 457,000 and part-time work was down by 7,000.  What is quite interesting about this, when you compare us with our neighbouring countries and those who are seeking work, is something like 18.2% of those in part-time work actually would seek full-time work.  Well over 80% are getting the jobs that they want.  However, if you compare that to 
[normal]Spain
[normal], nearly 61% want full-time work and cannot get it.  In 
[normal]Italy
[normal], that figure  is 58%; in 
[normal]France
[normal], it is 31%; and the EU average is over 27% for those looking for full-time work who cannot get it.  Here in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] it is just over 18% and falling.  I want to see it come way down, but the way to do that is to do what we are doing with the economy, which is to get it right so that we produce more jobs, which is what we have been doing, and more full-time jobs—and record levels of them.  I have to say, our record on this is turning out to be rather good. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q283 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Debbie Abrahams:[bold] I think the record will show that you have failed to answer my question, because my question was: what assessment have you undertaken on involuntary part-time employment, and the effect on poverty and benefits expenditure?  I had nothing from you on that.  Thank you.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]:  That is because your figures are all incorrect. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q284 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] We are coming towards the end of our time.  We have lots of other questions, but I think we can cover them in other inquiries we are doing.  On the budget around the benefit cap and the impact of the benefit cap, the original estimate in the 2011 budget was that the benefit cap would save £225
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million in 2013-14, but the figures you provided us in mid-2013 updated the estimated to only £108
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million.  Then you said in January it would save £85
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million.  Why are the savings from the introduction of the benefit cap coming down all the time? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: You will see these savings forecasts vary for two or three quite interesting reasons.  One is that there is a data lag now between the scan originally taken and the cap applied.  There is also a churn due to changes in circumstances of the claimants who 
[normal]would originally have been capped.  For example, it is estimated 19,000 potentially capped claimants have moved into work, thus taking their households out of the potential cap. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q285 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Have they definitely moved into work or are they just looking for work?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: Those are our figures.  We will be confirming those.  I give you that it was a roundabout figure, but about 19,000 would have been in households that would have been capped, so they are no longer capped.  They are saving the state a lot of money by going back to work, but none the less they will not directly be a saving on the back of the cap.  There is also some better modelling in there.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q286 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] It might be that they are not caught by the benefit cap because in the meantime they have applied for a benefit that they qualified for but had not applied for.
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: This was only a 
[normal]figure about those who have gone back to work.  There may be others as well whose circumstances have changed and maybe they are now able to get a disability benefit or something.
[normal]Chair:[bold] Or they have just applied for a benefit that gets them out. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: If that is real and they have been assessed properly, I would not for one moment think that would be incorrect.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q287 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] If your modelling was so out—by a factor of three almost—how have you changed it?  Is it better now so that you can make a proper assessment of the number of households affected by the benefit cap? 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: As you get into this, everything becomes much clearer, but of course this is a dynamic process, as I said.  The thing about this that the Committee really needs to understand is that the cap itself is partly about saving but is hugely about cultural change for the people who are likely to be capped.  In other words, they start making choices about the direction of travel for their lives, and the point about this is that with the cap itself, as we go into it, we can understand better what changes they might make.  For example, I would never have estimated that this many people would have chosen to go back to work so early on, rather than be capped.  These are the kinds of things that we understand better as we roll this out.  It has been a very successful cap.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q288 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] Are you concerned that so many of the people who seem to fall within the cap are in temporary accommodation?  They may become different people.  You may have one group of people in temporary accommodation and they could move to other accommodation.  Other people will move in.  In the Haringey study—I do not know whether you have statistics for it—40% of people capped were in temporary accommodation. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I do not recognise those figures, but we look at that all the time.  We take into consideration what is actually happening to people.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q289 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] Did you read the Haringey report?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: I did. 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] Do you not recognise the figure of 40%?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We did not recognise the way they put those figures together was as clear as they said it was.  We take into consideration concerns from local authorities.  My main point is that, for the most part, we think the cap is working in terms of what it is doing to re-establish fairness.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q290 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] Would you consider exempting?  Some temporary accommodation is exempt but some is not.  Would you consider exempting all temporary accommodation?
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We will keep this always under review.  It depends on the strength of the case, but I am not going to make a decision right now.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q291 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] In 
[normal]Aberdeen
[normal], almost 100% of those who are caught by the benefit cap are in temporary accommodation.  We have quite high-cost accommodation.  The result is that, if you follow through the logic of the benefit cap, they are made homeless but they become the statutory responsibility of the local government, which has to make up the shortfall between what they can get from the benefit system and what they need to afford the temporary accommodation.  There are no savings.  I am wondering whether the £85
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million saving this year is an absolute saving, or is it a saving on the benefit cap budget but the costs have been diverted even to local authorities or other agencies, who are having to pick up the pieces. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: We have not seen evidence of that, and we keep in close contact with local authorities throughout all that.  As I said earlier on, there is a certain amount of churn, and we started by piloting this one, so we started a bit later than we would have anticipated, because I was determined to make sure we got this right.  That is another reason there is a slightly lower level of savings in this first year.  I have to say, notwithstanding that, I think the cap is a massive success story.  People understand what it does.  It does more than just save money.  Saving money is important, but the key point is most of the people who see it have at least the strength to believe the benefit system is worthwhile, so it restores some fairness in their minds.  It is likely to help people understand the nature of benefit payments and necessity of those that are paid, rather than feeling there is some amount of money being paid to people who should not get it.  This is helpful to the rest of the people who are on welfare as well.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q292 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] It is more to set a tone than to save money. 
[normal]Mr Duncan Smith[bold]: It does both.  By no means, when you look at the amounts of money we are saving, was the benefit cap ever meant to save staggering sums of money.  It was saving money but at the same time changing lives, and we are seeing some evidence of that.
[normal]Sheila Gilmore:[bold] How is somebody in temporary accommodation supposed to change their life in order to avoid the cap, perhaps for three or four months while they are in that temporary accommodation? 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Or indeed a full-time carer who is caught by the cap, if they are looking after an adult child.  Anyway, we are looking at all of these kinds of things as part of our inquiry into Housing Benefits and we hope you will look at our recommendations when they come forward.  Thank you very much for coming along this afternoon.  I said we would try to keep it within the two hours, and I have almost managed that.  We have lots more questions but I am sure you will be back in front of us sometime in the future.  Thank you and your colleagues for coming along.
