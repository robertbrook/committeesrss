"Written evidence from the Law Societies of England and Wales and of Scotland&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSummaryDo you agree with the list of measures falling within the Ministry of Justice’s responsibility that the Government proposes the UK should seek to rejoin after exercise of the block opt-out? Do you consider that the UK should seek to rejoin measures which are not contained in the Government’s list, or, conversely, do you consider that the UK should not seek to rejoin measures which are contained in the Government’s list?What is your assessment of the national interest involved in rejoining the measures for which the Ministry of Justice is responsible?&#xa0;\nThe Law Societies believe that the EAW is extremely important and related to a number of the measures overseen by the Ministry of Justice\n addressed in this response\n.  \nThe EAW\n could be improved but offers a better and more efficient system than previous arrangements.\n  (We address these points in more detail in our response to the Home Affairs Select Committee's inquiry.)\n&#xa0;\nThis provides for a prisoner transfer scheme, which the Law Societies view as helpful \nin enabling nationals to serve sentences in their own Member States.\n&#xa0;\nProsecutors regard these measures as particularly valuable.\n&#xa0;\nThis measure can improve the procedural rights of the accused, for example, in EAW cases.\n&#xa0;\nThis \nwill be beneficial \nto many\n \ndefendants resident in a Member State other than where they are due to stand trial.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMeasures within the remit of the Ministry of Justice omitted from the list &#xa0;There are a number of measures that the Law Societies believe should be added to the list\n \n.\n&#xa0;\nConflicts of jurisdiction in criminal matters\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMutual recognition of judgments and probation decisions\n&#xa0;\nDo you have any comments on the analysis of policy implications and fundamental rights provided in the Ministry of Justice’s Explanatory Memorandum?Do you consider any other factors should be taken into account in deciding whether the UK should seek to rejoin each measure?European Supervision Order\nEuropean \nA\nrrest \nW\narrant\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nProcedural rights roadmap\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAccess to justice\n&#xa0;\nEuropean judicial network\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPotential cost of opt-out\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nCouncil Framework Decision 2002/348/JHA on the European arrest warrant and surrender procedures between Member States.\n \nBar Council of England and Wales; Law Society of England and Wales—Supplementary written evidence to the \nHouse of Lords’ EU Select Committee’s \noriginal inquiry.\n \nAssange\n (Appellant) v The Swedish Prosecution Authority (Respondent), [2012] UKSC 22.\n Command Paper 8671 -
