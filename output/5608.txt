[[[Background: ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Government’s Fuel Poverty Advisory Group for England has recently released its annual report. FPAG’s report to Government is attached. At the time of the release, Derek Lickorish MBE, Chairman of the FPAG commented:&#xa0; &#xa0;"With a cold winter, rising energy bills and a worrying increase in winter deaths, the plight of the fuel poor has never been more serious. The recent political noise may create a lot of ‘heat’ for some, but it does nothing to heat the homes of the fuel poor. The plasters and platitudes approach of Government isn’t working. Business as usual simply won’t do.” He added: “It is time for all political parties to unite, stop playing politics and join forces in the interests of the most vulnerable in our society.&#xa0; The only sustainable solution to end the misery and health inequalities of living in a cold home is to improve its energy efficiency through insulation measures. The recent political conflict has created more uncertainty and not less for consumers and other stakeholders, as it risks increasing the cost of borrowing to replace our aging energy infrastructure which, if not completed in a timely manner, could drive wholesale energy prices even higher”. &#xa0;Final consumer electricity bills are currently made up of wholesale energy commodity costs, transmission and distribution network costs, metering and other supply costs, supplier margins, VAT and the impacts of social, energy and climate change mitigation related policies. In recent years, wholesale commodity prices have been cited as the main reason for the extent of recent domestic price rises, however, NEA also believes all of these elements are currently increasing to unprecedented levels and all projections indicate a worrying upward trend. On the 23 October 2013, the current situation was noted by the Prime Minister:&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;“John Major is absolutely right that bills in this country have reached a completely unacceptable level. We need to take action on that. We need to help people to pay their bills, and we also need to help to get bills down. This is where we need a frank conversation about what is putting bills up…..What we need to do is recognise that there are four bits to an energy bill: the wholesale prices, which are beyond our control; the costs of transmission and the grid, which are difficult to change; the profits of the energy companies; and the green regulations. It is those last two that we need to get to grips with. So I can tell the House today that we will be having a proper competition test carried out over the next year to get to the bottom of whether this market can be more competitive. I want more companies, I want better regulation and I want better deals for consumers, but yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that the right hon. Gentleman put in place as Energy Secretary”.Following the PM’s announcement, the Treasury, Number 10 advisors and Energy Ministers were in intense discussion about how to address the soaring costs of energy supplied to homes and businesses within the UK. Whilst this was entirely welcome, the focus of the so-called ‘Green Levy Review’ appeared to be focused exclusively on the Warm Homes Discount Scheme (which provides low income pensioners with an automatic rebate on their bills and other vulnerable groups can get access to rebates) and the Energy Company Obligation (the principal policy to enable low income and vulnerable households in England to benefit from energy efficiency measures). Therefore, whilst NEA welcomed the intention to address the necessary balance between energy, social and industrial policies that can either continue to be funded regressively by all energy consumers or potentially be funded via direct taxation, the exclusive focus &#xa0;on programmes that support fuel poor households (and which will help many households directly reduce their energy bills this winter) was, at best, perverse.Energy efficiency is the most cost effective way of reducing the risk of fuel poverty and domestic carbon emissions. Focusing on cutting or dramatically modifying existing energy efficiency programmes was therefore the wrong short term solution. UK household expenditure on gas and electricity has doubled from £15bn per annum to £30bn a year since 2003. It was therefore wrong to prioritise a cut in the only programmes that can help to reduce household expenditure (for wasted energy) and keep vulnerable households warmer in their homes. Instead, the UK Government should be massively expanding resources directed to this area, especially for low income households living in the worst properties and deprived areas, as they fall far short of what is required to protect the health and welfare of these households or more generally bring about the scale of investment required to address our aging and thermally inefficient existing housing stock. The ambiguity over this area has now created a hiatus in providing direct assistance to vulnerable households and has further damaged the insulation and heating industry which is still suffering from the loss of the Warm Front scheme in January. &#xa0;Of far greater concern to households (and therefore Government) should be the most regressive levy, the carbon floor price (CFP). The CFP scheme should have been considered and reformed as a priority as a result of the Green Levy Review. Together with the auctioning of EU emissions trading scheme permits to fossil fuel generators, 

[[[the CFP will raise around £2 billion in 2013 rising to nearly £7 billion by 2027, an average of £4 billion per year for the Exchequer]]]. Whilst both these measures will lift the market price for energy (and hence the consumer will almost certainly pay more in the short to medium term), the CFP contributes to no overall carbon emission reductions. The Government should therefore accept that, if the CFP has to be retained (as Government has indicated that by removing the programme altogether this may require higher Contract for Difference payments), the revenue from the CFP must be recycled back into a much more ambitious energy efficiency programme. This in turn would lessen the concern that UK energy consumers are paying over the odds for the price of carbon compared to the rest of Europe at a time when low carbon generators are also receiving a lucrative windfall (whilst the Treasury directly benefits from the proceeds). 

[[[By redirecting this funding it could substantially reduce fuel poverty and bring about a major opportunity for further jobs within the energy efficiency industry.]]] &#xa0;In addition, the majority of the costs of the Government’s Electricity Market Reforms (EMR) are likely to be recovered through electricity bills. The Government has therefore already confirmed that funding raised from levies on consumer energy bills, under the Levy Control Framework (LCF), will rise to £7.6bn in real terms in 2020/21 and could equate to £9.8bn a year when the final limit is set in nominal terms on revised ONS and OBR numbers. The LCF budget is currently circa £2.35 billion. Given recent developments to the EMR policy package (the impact of the extension of the Feed in Tariff regime from 5 to 10MWe, the likely Contract for Difference (CfD) exemption package for energy intensive users, access for low carbon generators to access CfD support through Final Investment Decision enabling process, the development of the capacity mechanism and the longer than expected CfD periods) it is critical that the Government also recognises and addresses these escalating costs. A transparent and effective levy control framework should aim, at a minimum, to set a robust and comprehensive cap on all EMR’s energy and industrial policies which continue to be funded directly by energy consumers. In addition, if the Government wish to avoid the perception that they are directly benefiting from their policies to fund energy, social and industrial policies via energy consumers, the Coalition should cut or pledge to recycle all VAT revenue which is currently paid on all energy consumer funded levies from now on.&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;Finally, the planned exemption for energy intensive users from the costs arising from Contract for Difference must also be considered an urgent priority and funded out of taxation or cut altogether. The Government has already developed an exemption for certain energy intensive industries from the Carbon Price Floor and EU Emissions Trading Scheme. These are paid for via taxation and therefore are more progressive. Now however, energy intensive industries may be able to offset their share of the substantial additional costs arising from DECC's new-long term ‘contracts for difference’. Whilst competitive industry is clearly important to the UK Government, this additional step will have a cost elsewhere and is likely to be funded by other energy consumers. &#xa0;

[[[Summary of recommendations]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]January 2014&#xa0;Annex: &#xa0;Fuel Poverty Advisory Group (for England), 11th Annual Report 2012-13&#xa0; With the exception of network distribution charges which are expected to fall within the next Electricity Distribution Price Control period (RIIO ED1). Ofgem have however stated that the 14 electricity distribution companies (DNOs) still have a key role to play in identifying fuel poor and vulnerable customers and delivering solutions. They also note that this will require a major cultural and behavioural shift and have set relevant outputs on DNO’s new social obligations.  Hansard, Prime Minister’s Questions, October 23rd 2013. Energy prices - Commons Library Standard Note, Published 06 November 2013 Fuel poverty leaves those affected facing unmanageable choices about where to spend their limited income. It leaves many fearing for their health or the health of their children. Even at a conservative estimate, in England and Wales, 2,700 people are dying each year because of fuel poverty - far exceeding those killed on our roads. Beyond unnecessary and premature mortality, there are many other health impacts from living in cold homes and this costs the NHS and local health and care services hundreds of millions of pounds each year. This left England as the only UK nation without a Government-funded energy efficiency programme. In contrast, Scotland and Wales have maintained and even expanded tax funding for their own national programmes (in addition to ECO).
