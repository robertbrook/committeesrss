"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written Evidence Submitted by Angela Cross-Durrant [PHS0037]&#xa0;                                                                      Question 11&#xa0;11\n              \nThe relationship between the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman and the individual citizen ought to continue to be one through which individuals can complain direct about health service issues.  \n&#xa0;\n11.1\n              \nThere is, however, arguably a case for a single health and social care complaints handling body.  As mentioned earlier, many individuals, e.g. in residential homes, receive some level of healthcare as well as social care while under the aegis of social services.  A single body ought to investigate these ‘dual’ cases of care because neither social workers nor local authority officers can address healthcare matters, which go well beyond following administrative processes and procedures.\n&#xa0;11.2\n              \nThe Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman should continue to report to Parliament on the standard of service offered to the public;  to raise issues;  provide feedback on what has been learned from casework, etc.  However, the Ombudsman should also report on themes in complaints, dissatisfaction and comments \nabout the Ombudsman’s office\n and comparisons year on year to demonstrate whether or not the Ombudsman’s own practice has changed as a result, and/or where there is persistent repetition of the same kind of complaint.\n&#xa0;\n11.3\n              \nThe\n Public Administration Select Committee ought to continue in its ‘investigative’ role regarding the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.  This can ensure a light is shone on issues that emerge through contact with the Select Committee or as a result of official reports, and so on.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 12&#xa0;\n12\n              \nProviding evidence is essential if a complaint is to be made.  Whereas this stage of making a complaint falls outside considerations about complaints systems, the stage itself is a crucial part of a complaint.  However, obtaining that evidence is sometimes difficult if not impossible, despite individuals’ rights to it.  It also affects the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman’s effectiveness in handling complaints inadequately dealt with elsewhere.\n&#xa0;\n12.1\n              \nHealth and social care providers withhold information very often because of varied interpretation and \nmis\n-use of Acts of Parliament, which are designed to allow individuals access.  This practice denies individuals any prospect of either corroborating or even making a complaint.  For example, there are insurmountable obstacles preventing relevant personal information being obtained by individuals despite the rights conferred by the Data Protection Act.  [Until guidance from the Department of Health changed, information sought by Executors via the Access to Health Records (of the Deceased) Act 1990 was unnecessarily difficult and in many cases impossible.]  Furthermore, by default, the obstacles are condoned by the Information Commissioner’s Office and by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.  \n&#xa0;\n12.2\n              \nThe Data Protection Act (DPA)1998, is meant to enable individuals to see personal information held on themselves:  it also confers the right for them to correct any factual inaccuracies in the records.  However, the Data Protection Act (DPA)1998 Subject Access Modification (Social Work) Order 2000, Statutory Instrument 2000, No. 415 remains open to different interpretation and consequently is easily \nmis\n-used. This Statutory Instrument states that personal data may sometimes be withheld, but only in circumstances where the disclosure would be likely to prejudice the carrying out of social work \ndue to the serious physical or mental harm it would cause\n either to the data subject or a third party.  There is no obligation for social workers to seek medical opinion despite the fact that they are not medically trained.  Councils and social workers can use this exemption with impunity.  They do not have to prove serious physical or mental harm – they can just state it.   The DPA also gives individuals the right to correct factual \ninaccuracies in their records.  They cannot, however, correct any factual inaccuracies without seeing what has been proffered as facts at the outset. \nMis\n-use of the Statutory Instrument results in gross injustices the length and breadth of the country, as well as preventing access to evidence to enable individuals to make complaints.  (See example 1 attached.)\n&#xa0;\n12.3\n              \nWhen individuals complain to the Information Commissioner that personal information has been withheld, the default is to find in favour of the data processor (the body in jurisdiction) because the Information Commissioner states his office does not have the expertise to question social services.  ‘\nThe ICO does not have the expertise necessary ...’  \nto ‘\n...challenge the view or conclusions of a social work professional in terms of why they believe disclosure of certain information would cause harm.’*\n  The public can only wonder why the Information Commissioner does not ‘buy in’ that expertise as necessary, and as recommended for NHS complaints in the Francis Report.  On complaining to the Parliamentary and Health Ombudsman a complainant will find that the Ombudsman supports the Information Commissioner because the Ombudsman “would not seem (it) appropriate for the ICO to challenge a professional opinion”.^  The public could be forgiven for concluding that no-one can question social services opinions.  The lack of necessary expertise to investigate and, where appropriate, challenge these opinions means that the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman cannot ever be effective in handling these sorts of complaints.  \n&#xa0;\n12.4\n              \nThe only recourse is to the court, but extremely few complainants can afford to take that path.  Consequently, victims of these flaws are \nleft abandoned as\n ‘collateral damage’, regardless of the lasting effect on them.   At the very least, the guidance and/or Statutory Instruments pertaining to the Data Protection Act need re-wording to prevent individuals being denied the means (a) to comment or complain about public services and (b) to prevent people from never discovering what is in the data being held on them or the opportunity to correct factual inaccuracies.  This would reduce considerably the complaints reaching the Information Commissioner’s Office and subsequently reaching the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, both of which ought to reduce costs.\n&#xa0;\n12.5\n              \nDiffering interpretations of the Access to Health Records (of the Deceased) Act 1990 has also prevented key evidence being obtained to make a complaint about the care of a person who died.  Delays surrounding the various interpretations made it virtually impossible to bring a complaint to a hospital let alone to escalate it to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.  (See example 2.)\n&#xa0;\n12.6\n              \nThe case examples attached demonstrate the powerlessness of individuals caught up in complaints about councils/social services, withholding personal information despite the DPA, associated complaints to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.    \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 13&#xa0;\n13\n              \nThe relationship between MPs and the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman ought to allow independence from each other while enabling co-ordination.  In some ways, MPs can be seen as giving advice about whether, how or when to complain.  There is merit in retaining the MP ‘filter’ because its removal could adversely affect complainants who may clearly need a kind of sponsor.  Removing the role could also reduce the ‘intelligence’ an MP has about serious issues some of her/his constituents face.\n&#xa0;\n13.1\n              \nHowever, it may be that MPs need to hone investigation or ‘triage’ skills of their own.  This might mean some form of coaching perhaps, or the opportunity occasionally to buy in expertise.  Nonetheless, all efforts should be made to avoid MPs being perceived, if not used, as additional, unpaid staff for the ombudsman.\n&#xa0;\n*  Response from ICO 2011\n^\n Response from PHSO 2011\n[Examples derived from acting as voluntary advocate.]\n&#xa0;\nExample 1\n&#xa0;\n(\ni\n)\n              \nAn individual needed personal information held by a local council in order to seek redress for being appallingly wrongly accused of abusing a family member.  The family member had been cared for by the individual for more than 20 years and had survived an incurable condition because of her care (confirmed by medical consultants dealing with the condition).  The case was unsubstantiated and closed.  The complainant sought personal information to enable the individual to complain to the LGO.  The council had concealed the details of the accusations through severe redaction of the records.  \n              \n(ii)\n              \nThe individual complained to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) that the council \nmis\n-used the Data Protection Act (DPA)1998, Subject Access Modification (Social Work) Order 2000, Statutory Instrument 2000, No. 415 to refuse to divulge the specific allegations that were made.  This Statutory Instrument states that personal data may sometimes be withheld only in circumstances where the disclosure would be likely to prejudice the carrying out of social work \ndue to the serious physical or mental harm it would cause\n either to the data subject or a third\n party.  There is no \nobligation \nfor social workers to seek medical opinion and in this case none was sought.  Some of the records that were redacted by the council were later divulged by one of the third party organisations involved in the case.  No harm whatsoever was caused and social work continued untrammelled. The full detail, however, remained ‘secret’.\n&#xa0;\n(iii)\n              \nThe ICO could not deal adequately with the complaint stating that  ‘\nThe ICO does not have the expertise necessary ...’  \nto ‘\n...challenge the view or conclusions of a social work professional in terms of why they believe disclosure of certain information would cause harm.’\n  Moreover, the ICO stated that where there are opposing views, the ICO ‘..\nwill usually give the benefit of the doubt to the party whose (data) processing has been called into question.’\n **  \n&#xa0;\n(iv)\n              \nSubsequently, the individual complained to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (in 2011) who considered that she had no means of challenging the opinion of social workers that harm would not ensue if records were disclosed.  She decided not to carry out an investigation.\n&#xa0;\n(v)\n              \nThe complainant has never been told what the specific allegations against her were, even though the case was closed because it was unsubstantiated.  She cannot correct any factual inaccuracies to set the record straight. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n*\n       ICO response letter \n* *     PHSO \nCase review letter 2011\n&#xa0;\nAddendum\n&#xa0;\n(vi)\n              \nIt is worthy of note that over 26,000 people were victims of unsubstantiated allegations of abusing vulnerable adults in 2011-12***.  [A further 23,500 cases were inconclusive or not determined, which also casts doubt on these 23,500 safeguarding referrals also.]  Of the unsubstantiated 26,000 individuals wrongly subjected to safeguarding investigations and the horrific treatment they received during the process, no doubt subsequently many would have wanted to set their records straight.  However, as in paragraphs (ii) &amp; (iii) above, individuals cannot set records straight without seeing what the records and the actual allegations show.  In such circumstances, it is often argued that the accusers must be protected (though they are usually known anyway to the complainants, as in this case).  It seems that natural justice, let alone human rights, of the victims of unsubstantiated allegations are utterly ignored in these circumstances, and this practice effectively prevents individuals from making complaints. \n&#xa0;\n(vii)\n              \nThere are no data concerning how many of victims of unsubstantiated allegations made successful Subject Access Requests in order to see their personal information.  Nonetheless, a \ntotal of more than 26,000 wrongly accused individuals in just one year should not be ignored by the Public Administration Select Committee when considering the implications \nof \nvaried interpretation and \nmis\n-use of legislation to block \nthe path of making co\nmplaints.  It is highly probable\n that very, very few of the 26,000 ‘made it’ to the ICO let alone to complaining to the relevant ombudsman.\n \n  \n              \n* * *  Health and Social Care Information Centre. “Abuse of Vulnerable Adults in England 2011-12.  Final Report.”   pp37-49\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nExample 2\n&#xa0;\n(\ni\n)\n              \nAn elderly resident in a care home died in her residential care home in 2005 shortly after two out-patient appointments to the local hospital.  The consultant told the lady’s daughter, who had accompanied her mother on the final appointment, that he would be in touch with her GP because her mother was not expected to survive much longer.  Soon after her death, it transpired from the care home records that none of the staff on duty on the day she died recognised that she was dying, despite a GP reportedly visiting the lady twice the day before she died.  There seemed to be confusion about what the GP had said to staff on his visits, and about what he prescribed and advised.  Later there was also confusion about what had transpired between the hospital consultant and the GP.  The lady’s son-in-law was her Executor and made a request to the Hospital Trust to see the records to reassure himself that nothing untoward had contributed to the patient’s death.\n&#xa0;\n(ii)\n              \nThe Hospital Trust took the view that the 1990 Act prevented access to the records of the deceased by anyone who was not making a claim arising from the patient’s death. The Act, Section 3 (1)(f) however, states that a deceased’s personal representative, namely her/his Executor, may have access or \nsomeone with a claim against the estate\n.\n The Trust interpreted the subsection as only someone with a claim may have access, and that could include the Executor but only if he were making a claim arising out of the patient’s death.  The Executor was not making any claim.  After many months of correspondence, the Executor contacted the Chair of the Strategic Health Authority, who virtually dismissed the request for assistance on the grounds that the request was the business solely of the hospital in question.  The next year, the daughter wrote to her MP seeking help, who passed the letter to the then Minister for Health.  The Minister responded to confirm, unsurprisingly, what the Department of Health Guidance contained, namely that \neither the Executor or someone with a claim can have access to the records, \nand that they are not mutually exclusive\n.\n  The Hospital Trust in question refused the request again some six months later, citing advice from its own solicitor, claiming that the Department and the Minister had misunderstood the Act and attendant guidance.  A complaint was made to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman who did not proceed to an investigation because it was thought the matter was one of interpretation of the law and, therefore, ought to be dealt with in court.\n&#xa0;\n(iii)\n              \nIn February 2010 the Department of Health’s new guidance on access to records of the deceased made very clear that the Executor of a will “\nis the only person who has an unqualified right of access to a deceased person’s records and need give no reason for applying for access to a record.”\n ^^   Five years had passed.  In November 2010, the Executor sent a copy of the guidance to the Hospital Trust.  It agreed to a further request from the Executor.  By that time the Trust had re-organised; there was a new Chief Executive and a new team dealing with complaints – and perhaps a new solicitor.  The consultant and the GP had retired.  The Trust considered it beyond its time limit to complain, and decided it had satisfied the long-standing complaint about the records.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n^^ ‘\nGuidance for access to health records requests’.  DH 2010\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
