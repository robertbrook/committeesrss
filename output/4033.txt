[[[Summary]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Although certain genres, such as impartial news and current affairs are essential to a public service remit, ‘public service’ should not be seen as confined to specific genres.  The values of ‘intrinsic importance and merit’ apply across the board.  The BBC’s non-commercial status has underpinned its leading role in a wide range of genres, including innovative comedy, popular drama and numerous entertaining factual formats. This competition with commercially funded channels has been essential to maintain a high standard across terrestrial broadcasting as a whole.The Corporation’s role in pioneering technological developments in the public interest is central to its public service remit, as is its delivery of exceptional online content.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Funding by licence fee rather than direct taxation underpins the BBC’s editorial independence from the Government -even though it remains vulnerable to Government pressure.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;This proposal also assumes that a limited part of the broadcast output can be described as ‘public service content’ rather than recognising that broadcasting as a whole offers a service to the public.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;46. As newspapers, that are not subject to impartiality requirements, become ‘broadcasters’, with online audio-visual content, there are renewed threats to impartiality rules. …. The standards of public service broadcasting, and in particular the all-important requirements for impartiality and balance, could be seriously jeopardised by the effects of politically partisan broadcasting creeping in through the back door. In our view, online versions of newspapers should therefore come within the regulatory scope of Ofcom, but with a lighter regime than for conventional broadcasters&#xa0;&#xa0;
