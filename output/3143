defaultThe Consumer Council gave oral evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee on 11 September 2013 on how the Northern Ireland (NI) retail banking market affects NI 
defaultconsumers
default. We were asked for further information on a range of subjects as follows:
default&#xa0;
defaultStdefaultatistics on access to daily banking services- NI consumersdefaultThe Family Resources Survey (FRS) collects information on the incomes and circumstances of private households in Northern Ireland. It has been running in Great Britain since October 1992, but 
default2002/03 saw the introduction of Northern Ireland for the first time. The latest report was published in February 2013 and summarises the results for the 2010/11 survey in which 1,896 households were interviewed.

defaults Survey were
default asked about the types of accounts they have held over the last 12 months. 
default&#xa0;
defaultInformation on the numbers of people/households with access to bank accounts is an important indicator for financial inclusion. The Consumer Council’s ‘Price of Being
default Poor’
default report shows that consumers on low incomes that cannot access mainstream financial services end up paying more, a “poverty premium”, for the services they need (for example, higher gas and electricity bills because they cannot get direct debit disc
defaultounts).

defaultshows the percentage of households with one or more current, savings or investment accounts and those with one or more direct payment accounts, including and excluding Post Office Card Accounts (POCAs).  This has b

defaultA POCA allows c
defaultonsumers to withdraw cash at the Post Office but there are no facilities to set up direct debits to manage money and pay bills.

defaultTable 4.1 shows that 
default13 per cent of households in NI do 
defaultnot have a current account with access to direct debit and overdraft facilities.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt also shows that 
defaultonly 
default95
default per cent of households in NI had
default any type of
default account including POCAs.
default 
defaultThis was the lowest proportion for any region in the UK, with the exception 
defaultof East Midlands (which was equal to NI), an

default per cent. 
defaultAge profile of consumers without a current accountdefault&#xa0;
defaultWe 
defaultwere 
defaultasked to provide further data on the age profile of consumers who do not have a current account and the p
defaultroportion of consumers who do not have an alternative such as a Post Office Card Account.
defaultTo do this, we had to request
default further data from the Family Resources Survey which is specific to Northern Ireland adults
default (individuals)
default only. 18 per cent of NI adults 
default(individuals) 
defaultdid not have a current account at t
defaulthe time of the survey in 2010/11.
