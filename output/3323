Written evidence from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) [PUB00012] default&#xa0;
defaultAbout NCVO defaultNCVO champions and strengthens the voluntary sector, with over 10,000 members, from the largest charities to the smallest community organisations. Alongside our sister councils in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, we make sure the voluntary sector can do what it does best 
defaultwww.ncvo.org.uk
default. 
defaultNCVO convenes the Public Service Delivery Network, a group of 2500 organisations that have an interest in public service delivery. NCVO also convenes a Special Interest Group (SIG) of sub-contractor organisations involved in the Work Programme, and a Payment-by-Results working group that will be making recommendations in late 2013.

defaultSummary default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government’s policy goals, as expressed in the Open Public Services white paper, are positive and could support more effective and open public services. 
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, at present, poor commissioning and procurement practice is hampering the Government’s ambitions. Ultimately, this will impact on the quality of public services. 
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPublic bodies are focussing on securing the cheapest price, rather than assessing value for money. This can exclude voluntary organisations and SMEs from public service delivery. 
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOther barriers facing voluntary organisations include: inappropriate procurement approaches; larger contract sizes; short procurement timescales and disproportionate bidding requirements. 
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany VCSEs are unable to participate in payment-by-results (
defaultPbR
default) contracts because of the cash flow and working capital requirements to the detriment of market diversity and user experience. 
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a lack of open and consistent data available, despite its importance for effective policy formation, driving improvements in procurement and securing better value for public money. 
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultImproving commissioning and procurement requires focussing on culture as much as procedure. Increased training and support for commissioners and procurement professionals will be vital if the government’s objectives to deliver better public services are to be achieved. 
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCitizen-led delivery of public services relies on the trust and commitment of local communities, these communities are often mobilised around particular voluntary or community groups; if properly supported these groups can provide a route for more effective services. 
default&#xa0;

default19default Large contracts excluding the VCS have been most visible in the Government’s flagship Work Programme. Organisations wishing to deliver one of 40 prime contracts had to display an annual turnover of at least £20 million and the financial capacity to deliver large contracts that require significant cash-flow. Consequently only three charities now act as a prime contractor. The 21 prime contracts for the

default21default A 2013 VCSE survey by Locality found that 42% of respondents believe contracts have become larger in the last five years and a further 52% expect them to become larger still over the next five years. 80% said this would provide them with less opportunities and a lower range and quality of services in their area. 
default22default A recent NCVO survey found that 23 out of 46 respondents said the scale of contracts has prevented their organisation bidding for work. One respondent noted how a county council have moved to county wide contracts rather than local ones, and that this has opened up the market to national providers to the detriment of local organisations. The full survey results can be provided on request.

default30default Good practice does exist. For its Café West Tender, York City Council held a number of events where they engaged with potential providers to discuss how social value should be built into the specification of the contact. Items in the specification included employing local people, working with people with disabilities and creating employment pathways.
