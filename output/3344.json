"&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPreventing visual impairment\n can deliver substantial downstream cost savings which should be factored into the efficiency gains. These \nprovide\n a better overall interface between the health care and social care, which will bring about longer-term improvements in efficiency, preventive\n care and reablement.    \n1. Introduction&#xa0;1.1\n \nThis document sets out the response of the Optical Confederation to the Health Select Committee inquiry into \nP\nublic\n E\nxpenditure\n on Health and Social Care\n. It builds \nup\non \nwritten evidence\n submitted to the \nCommittee on the same topic in September 2011\n.\n&#xa0;1.\n2\n \nThe Optical Confederation represents the 12,000 optometrists, the 6,000 dispensing opticians and 7,000 optical businesses in the UK who provide high quality and accessible eye care ser\nvices to the whole \npopulation. \nThe Confederation is a coalition of the five optical representative bodies: the Association of British Dispensing Opticians (ABDO); the Association of Contact Lens Manufacturers (ACLM); the Association of Optometrists (AOP); the Federation of M\nanufacturing Opticians (FMO) and the Federation of Ophthalmic and Dispensing Opticians (FODO).\n As a Confederation, we work with others to improve eye health for the public good. \nThe Optical Confederation welcomes this opportunity to submit\n comments\n to the \ninquiry\n on public expenditure\n, and would be willing to support the Health Select Committee in making equity and excellence in eye care\n a reality\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.) Progress on making efficiencies through the integration of health and social care services.&#xa0;\n2.1\n \nThe\n increase in demand for NHS eye care services \nrequires\n careful planning by all health and social care professionals in order to slow, or even to halt, this rise. \nSome progress has been made with \nthe establishment of Local Eye Health Networks (LEHNs) across all NHS England Local Areas. \n&#xa0;2.2\n The aim is that\n these\n LEHNs will bring together all local eye health stakeholders in a clinically-led, patient- and population-focussed model to achieve progre\nss against the sight loss indicator locally. This will involve assessing local eye health needs, redesigning pathways as necessary in line with QIPP\n \nprinciples and maximising the deployment of resources across primary, secondary, social and voluntary secto\nr care for health gain.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 As previously mentioned, \neye care services can be a lead area for QIPP, freeing up resources in the NHS, and delivering quality improvements at low cost. A very noteworthy innovation in eye care is the development of the Commis\nsioning Toolkit for Eye Care by the UK Vision Strategy. This toolkit highlights why eye care services should be prioritised, the potential for a small investment to deliver siz\ne\nable results, and provides guidance to support the commissioning of better eye \ncare services across the NHS.\n \nMoreover, the recently formed\n Clinical Council for Eye Health Commissioning \nwill also aim\n to offer united, evidence-based clinical advice and guidance to those commissioning and delivering eye health services in England on is\nsues where national leadership is needed.\n&#xa0;\n2.4 \nThe Clinical Council for Eye Health Commissioning plans to work in partnership with NHS England, to support the development of services to meet local needs and improve outcomes based on best evidence and in th\ne most patient sensitive and cost-effective ways.\n \nThe Clinical Council is now contributing to the development of NICE accredited commissioning guidance on cataract and glaucoma services.\n \nThe Council will then move on to look at the best ways of improving t\nhe quality and efficiency of services for age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy in line with indicator 4.12 of the Public \nH\nealth \nO\nutcomes \nF\nramework\n.\n&#xa0;3. IT &#xa0;\n3.1 \nIn line with the NHS’s vision for referrals to be completely paperless\n by 2018, the\n interconnectivity of community optical, GP, Choose and Book and hospital eye service IT systems should be \nmade a\n priority\n by government\n as it will enable rapid exchange of clinical, referral, financial and audit data. The Scottish Government \nis already making good progress towards this goal and, as a Confederation, we warmly welcomed NHS England’s announcement in June 2012 that they were in the early stages of developing a national specification for primary ophthalmic services (POS) claims and\n payments, an important first step towards greater connectivity in England and collecting outcomes data. We look forward to working with all relevant stakeholders to achieve integrated IT systems, as mentioned above, as their absence is a major obstacle to\n integrated eye care.\n&#xa0;\n4.) Reports of particular financial pressures in the system, such as funding for General Practice, and for Accident and Emergency services4\n.1 \nUrgent eye care is provided by GPs, optometrists, A&amp;\nE departments, minor injury units, eye casualty departments and rapid-access outpatient clinics. An urgent eye condition is any eye condition that is of recent onset and is distressing or is believed by the patient, carer or referring health professional t\no present an imminent threat to vision or general health. However many patients treated by the urgent eye care service have non-urgent conditions, particularly patients who self-refer to eye casualty. \n4\n.2 \nMost hospital urgent eye care services report that\n they struggle to keep pace with demand. Demand for hospital eye emergency services is thought to be increasing. Evidence from London, shows that over a five year period up to 2011, demand at two major eye casualty units increased by seven and ten per cent\n year on year\n and eye emergencies are estimated to make up 1.46-6% of accident and emergency attendances\n. However, most urgent eye conditions are non-acute and relatively straightforward to treat\n. \n4\n.3 \nTo make services more accessible and reduce pressur\ne on hospital eye casualty, a significant proportion of patients can be diagnosed and managed in a primary care instead by a healthcare professional with a slit lamp (which allows you to see the front and back of the eye in detail and is needed to diagnose\n most urgent eye conditions) and the skills and experience to use it. GPs do not usually have slit lamps or enough experience of using one, but community optometrists do and are\n \nwell placed to promptly diagnose, triage and treat patients with urgent eye \npr\noblems safely and efficiently.\n4\n.\n4\n \nOther efficiencies could be made by nationwide adoption of \na number of successful enhanced eye care services, namely in glaucoma referral refinement, management of stable glaucoma, and primary eyecare assessment in \ncommunity optical practices.  These tried and tested schemes have delivered better patient outcomes, local cost savings, reduced waiting times and helped to deliver a local patient-centred service without increasing patient risk.\n Adopting these schemes ha\ns also freed up significant capacity in secondary eye care to focus on patients facing acute or chronic sight loss. \n&#xa0;5. Falls prevention&#xa0;5.1 \nThe impacts of sight\n loss on older people are well \ndocumented, including the role uncorrected visual problems pla\ny in falls and performance of \neveryday\n tasks\n.\n \nThe full financial cost of these falls to the NHS and social care has not been calculated, however it is conservatively estimated\n by the Royal National Institute of Blind People\n at £25 million per year\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nEpivision (2009) for RNIB Future Sight Loss UK (2)\n Tate et al (2005) The prevalence of visual impairment in the UK; A review of the literature \nwww.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/PublicWebsite/public_prevalencereport.doc\n Access Economics (2009) for RNIB Future Sight Loss UK (1)\nhttp://www.opticalconfederation.org.uk/downloads/\nconsultations/OC%20Submission%20to%20HSC%20Inquiry%20into%20Public%20Expenditure.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.commissioningforeyecare.org.uk/\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/216162/Improving-outcomes-and-supporting-transparency-part-21.pdf\n, p.112-114.\n \nSmith H\nB, Daniel CS, Verma S Eye Casualty Services in London Eye (Lond) 2013 Mar;27 (3):320-8 Epub 2013 Feb 1  \n Flitcroft DI, Westcott M, Wormald R, Touquet R.
