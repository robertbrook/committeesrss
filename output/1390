[normal]Written evidence submitted by Paul MK Dodgshun (HOT04)[bold]Summary:[bold]1:  Scientific Theory:  [bold]In respect of heat pumps the draft RHI policy, published on the 12
[normal]th
[normal] July, is scientifically incorrect on two counts.  It disregards the consequences of :- 
[normal]              
[normal]1.1:  Carnot's Law [
[normal]1:
[normal]&#x200e;
[normal]]  , and 
[normal]1.2:  Ohm's Law, I2R losses and power factor [
[normal]2: 3: 4:
[normal]].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2:  Domestic Heat Pumps:[bold]2.1:  Maximum Efficiency:[bold]The policy should mandat
[normal]e the use of the most Carnot efficient pumps that are commercially available.  These are pumps of the air-to-air type and they can achieve a headline Coefficient of Performance (COP) that is greater than 5.5.  All heat pump types with lower comparable COPs
[normal] should be suppressed by the policy, unless extenuating circumstances apply; this is a consequence of 1.1:.  If implemented, this proposal will halve electricity bills compared to inefficient air-to-water pumps, currently promoted by the RHPP and proposed 
[normal]by the draft RHI.  Failure to implement this proposal will result in double the Carbon burn for running domestic heat pumps.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2:  Capacity:[bold]Each household to be allowed only 1kWe of Grid supplied heat pump capacity.  Spread over 8.6 million households th
[normal]at produces a maximum generation demand of 8.6GW (10% of current grid capacity).  This maximum demand will appear for most of the winter as a continuous (modulated air-to-air heat pumps run continuously) load on the electricity grid.  Homes with pre-existi
[normal]ng fossil fired boilers should retain those boilers, new homes have them fitted where practicable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3:  National Gas and Electricity Grid and Distribution:[bold]3.1:  Electricity Grid and Distribution:[bold]2.2: is a consequence of 1.2: in respect of the National El
[normal]ectricity Grid and distribution network.  The 1kWe of electricity proposed in 2.2: will be doubly effective, if supplied to efficient air-to-air pumps as compared to air-to-water pumps. Supplied to air-to-air pumps, 1kWe will supply about 4kW of heat per p
[normal]ump at freezing (0C).  If full-sized, inefficient air-to-water pumps are permitted, maximum generation capacity on the grid may need to be double the current (about 86GW) level.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Doubled generation capacity means doubled conductor cross-sections and doub
[normal]led transformer capacities in the whole of the distribution network, if line and transformer losses, currently 8%, are not to rise.  Grid line losses, currently 3%, may be prevented from rising by higher grid voltages and/or greater conductor cross-section
[normal]s, but transformer replacement will be needed.  Localised gas fired generation, mostly in the south, should require less long distance transportation of electricity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2:  Gas Grid:[bold]There is an interaction between the gas grid and the electricity grid, as
[normal] gas is diverted from 
[normal]domestic consumption to gas fired electricity generation.  Ideal sites for this generation  would be where electricity grid substations and gas grid pipes are co-located, along with adequate water.  The appropriate percentage of diver
[normal]sion is the question; it does not have to be 0% or 100%, and that is a cardinal error in the draft RHI policy.

[normal]4:  The government is currently subsidising and encouraging the sale of heat pumps that use twice as much electricity as the best alternative.  That means double s
[normal]ized electricity bills that will continue for the life of the equipment; the subsidies do not cover the losses.  The subsidies are an expensive trap for the pump owner and a waste of money for the taxpayer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5:  The draft RHI policy should be redrafted to
[normal] offer to give every household a 1kWe heat pump of the highest Carnot Efficiency air-to-air type.  This would cost less than £1000+fitting per pump.  All other subsidies for heat pumps should be withdrawn.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6:  Soon, the government will have to ban the 
[normal]installation of heat pumps greater than 1kWe in size and then only one per house, unless they are supported by self-generation.  Any additional heat load is to be supplied by fossil fired equipment (boilers, stoves, fires or whatever) or night storage heat
[normal]ers.  In most cases, this is likely to be pre-existing equipment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7:  My proposal, 1kwE per house, requires a capped 10% increase in generation capacity (8.6GW).  Inefficient(x2) full-sized(x10) pumps could require a 200% increase, alongside massive grid
[normal] reinforcement.  There is no economic case for :-
[normal]7.1:  a 200% increase in grid capacity,
[normal]7.2:  a 200% increase in generation capacity, and
[normal]7.3:  a full-sized inefficient fleet of 8.6 million heat pumps;
[normal]that runs at high load for only a few cold days in t
[normal]he year, instead :-
[normal]7.4:  no increase in grid capacity, albeit with a few days of increased grid losses,
[normal]7.5:  a 10% increase in generation capacity, and
[normal]7.6:  a 1kWe air-to-air heat pump per house
[normal]suffices to achieve the objective, a minimum Carbon burn. 
[normal]At sub-zero temperatures, heat pumps become inefficient and taken over the full CCGT/grid/distribution/heat pump route they become no more efficient than boilers and much poorer than boilers, if grid reinforcement is not extensive.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8:  Heat pumps have an
[normal]other serious efficiency problem: part load running.  When run at low to very low part loads, even the best modulated pumps, have very poor Carnot efficiencies.  When sized for heating a house at minimum design temperatures, perhaps -15C, they inevitably r
[normal]un at low to very low part loads at more average temperatures.  To combat this problem, small pumps need to be fitted that can hold a house (20C) temperature down to about freezing (0C) ambient temperature.  My proposal also does this; a 1kW(electrical)/4k
[normal]W(thermal) heat pump will hold the temperature of my house at my winter quarter average (100kWh per day, stated by my gas bill) load, based on continuous (4x24=96kWh per day) running.  My house is a five bed, detached with double glazing, loft and cavity i
[normal]nsulation; if it works for my house, then it will for 95% of the others.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9:  The most efficient heat pump is a good air-to-air pump, running continuously at full load, with a minimum temperature drop across its refrigerant circuit.  Anything else involve
[normal]s wasted electricity.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2: Introduction:[bold]2.1: I am a retired mechanical engineer from the nuclear power industry.  After working at Longannet, Hunterston 'B' and Heysham Power Stations, I joined the staff of 
[normal]a small engineering team preparing and evaluating nuclear safety cases in support of nuclear power stations in the south-east of England.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2: In June, I was cold-called by a company who wished to sell me a heat pump.  I agreed to accept a sales engineer's visit to my house.  When the sales engineer asked for my order, I responded with 'due diligence first'.  Due diligence continues.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3:
[normal] The insights gained allow me to address the committee's following questions :-
[normal]2.3.1: 
[normal]              
[normal]Q1 - Why does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully? 
[normal]              
[normal]A1 - Because it has got the fundamental science wrong.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.2: 
[normal]              
[normal]Q2 - What are the relative merits o
[normal]f using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps?
[normal]              
[normal]A2 – Capacity balance should be about 90% gas/fossil fuel, 10% air-to-air heat pump.  Heat production balance is then about 10% gas/foss
[normal]il fuel, 90% air-to-air heat pump. Use of gas/fossil fuel occurs when it is as efficient as or more efficient than the heat pump, taken over the full CCGT/grid/distribution/heat pump route (i.e. at sub-zero temperatures).  This balance has the minimum Carb
[normal]on burn and the minimum capital cost over the generation/grid/distribution/heat pump route as compared to the boiler route.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.3: 
[normal]              
[normal]Q3 - How successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?
[normal]              
[normal]A3 – In respect of heat pumps, disastrous unless totall
[normal]y redrafted.
[normal]______________________________________________
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3: Facts:[bold]3.1:  Carnot's Law:[bold]Carnot's Law states that the theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat pump is equal to Thot/(Thot-Tcold) where temperatures are stated in degrees absolute (e.g. fr
[normal]eezing is 273C and boiling is 373C)
[normal]COP 5/30=(273+30)/(30-5)=303/25=12.12
[normal]COP 5/60=(273+60)/(60-5)=333/55=6.05
[normal]12.12/6.05= 2
[normal]This is the basis of the statement that air-to-air pumps that blow air at 30C are twice as efficient as air-to-water pumps that use
[normal] hot wet radiators at 60C.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Real heat pumps deliver less than the theoretical maximum, perhaps 0.4 to 0.6 forms the main range.  Part load coefficients at loads below 50% start to deteriorate rapidly to 0 at 0% part load  e.g. If the theoretical Carnot eff
[normal]iciency is x, the pump factor is 0.5 and the part load factor is also 0.5, then the overall efficiency of the pump is x/4.  The Carnot efficiency of resistive heating is 1.0.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]______________________________________________
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.2:  I2R Losses in [bold]Transformers and Cables on the National Grid and Distribution Networks[bold]Current losses on the National Grid are about 3%.
[normal]Current losses on the Distribution Network are about 8%.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If 8.6 million homes have 10kW(electrical) heat pumps fitted, then this is a 
[normal]capacity demand on the grid system of 86GW, approximately equal to the currently installed capacity.
[normal]If this doubles line and transformer currents, then the I2R losses quadruple to (3+8)*4=44%.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The I2R losses heat the lines and transformers which have the
[normal]rmal overload protection.  At some point the protection will start 'tripping' and supply breakers will open.  The result may be blackouts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Major reinforcement of the grid and distribution networks would be needed, right down to the 415V transformers that 
[normal]supply houses.  If the cabling needs reinforcing, that means digging up the roads.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My current domestic electrical load is about 10kWh per day, all year.
[normal]My current domestic gas load is an average of about 100kWh per day during winter and 10kWh per day in 
[normal]the summer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Transferring all my winter demand to the electrical supply will increase my peak demand on the electrical supply by a factor of about 11.  I have no reason to think that my consumption is atypical.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10/11ths of that higher electrical load will
[normal] be continuous over the colder days, with peaks in the remaining 1/11 that mirror the current 24 hour demand curve of the grid.  When a pre-existing grid peak combines with a heat pump load peak, then what is the demand on, 1: local supply transformers, an
[normal]d 2:  power station capacity?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is the local supply transformers that receive the greatest increase.  The power station load rises by a factor of 2 but the domestic supply transformers experience an 11 fold rise.  Local supply transformers are sized 'sto
[normal]chastically'; they are already too small for all the total installed load in the attached houses and presumably their supply cables are similarly sized.  An 11-fold increase in cable cross-sections and transformers is predicted on the 415V system.  I2R los
[normal]ses have a major effect on the draft RHI policy.  There has to be a better way and there is:  the 1kWe capacity air-to-air heat pump, installed one per house.
[normal]______________________________________________
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.3: Efficiencies and Coefficients of [bold]Performance (COPs)[bold]The draft domestic RHI policy is about the comparative efficiency of two routes :-
[normal]1:  generator/grid/distribution/heat pump, and
[normal]2:  domestic boiler.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The best gas turbine generators achieve about 0.65 efficiency
[normal]Big steam turbines 
[normal]achieve about 0.35
[normal]Grid losses are currently about 3%, so 0.97
[normal]Distribution losses are currently about 8%, so 0.92
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The efficiency of domestic pure resistive heating from :-
[normal]1: gas generated grid supplied electricity is .65x.97x.92x1.0
[normal]              
[normal]= 0.58
[normal]2: steam turb
[normal]ine, grid supplied electricity is .35x.97x.92x1.0
[normal]              
[normal]= 0.31
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The highest(65%) generation efficiencies come from CCGT plant; the highest heat pump headline COPs(5.5+) come from air-to-air pumps .
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clearly, the most efficient overall system requires the highest
[normal] generation efficiencies, coupled with the lowest grid and distribution losses and the heat pumps with the highest COPs (.65x.97x.92x5.5= 3.19).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The poorest system is steam turbine electricity, through overloaded grid/distribution to a resistive load (.
[normal]35x.86x.72x1.0
[normal]              
[normal]= 0.22).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The ratio of best to worst is 3.19/0.22=14.5. 
[normal] It is a very large number and graphically illustrates the potential benefit of heat pumps, PROVIDED  that ALL the technology involved is operating at optimum efficiency.   [bold]1: Generati[bold]on, [bold]2: grid, [bold]3: distribution, and [bold]4: heat pump [bold]efficiencies have to be individually maximised to achieved the combined desired result, whilst noting that the gas grid can help in a major way.[bold]______________________________________________
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Efficiency[bold] Tables:[bold]Note:  This is purely an efficiency analysis; it does not consider prices
[normal]              
[normal]3.19 is the ceiling efficiency for this exercise.

[normal]2: boiler
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]= 0.85
[normal]Comparative 
[normal]efficiency: equal
[normal]Conclusion: Fossil fired boilers are just as efficient as heat pumps and that is before heavy line losses are considered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.1.2:  If grid and distribution currents double, then line and transformer losses quadruple (so-called I squared
[normal] R losses) :-
[normal]This also implies the same line and transformer losses for all the grid load, not just the heat pump load.  This comment applies to all subsequent cases (double grid/distribution losses).[bold]

[normal](pump poorer by 0.54)[bold]Conclusion: Fossil fired boilers are more efficient than heat pumps by a clear margin.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]= 0.85
[normal]Comparative efficiency: pump poorer by 0.52
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal](pump poorer by 0.69)[bold]Conclusion: The use of heat pumps with heavy line losses is a non-starter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Overall Conclusion:  Everyone should be using a fossil fired 
[normal]boiler at temperatures of -15C because doubling the grid/distribution system and installing matching gas generator capacity is a very expensive business, particularly when you consider that it is only fully used on a few coldest days of the year.

[normal]3.3.6:  Part Load Factor[bold]COPs are reduced by part load running.  This is a potent source of pump efficiency problems when pumps operate at below half power.  At 0 part load the efficiency becomes 0%.  All pumps that are sized to deli
[normal]ver the full heat load of a house at -15, or -10C when pump COPs are reduced, are going to normally operate in a low or very low part load condition at more usual temperatures.

[normal]better by 2.05[bold]The [bold]major 1.45 reduction is a consequence of part load running.  The use of one heat pump, sized to a full house heat load at -10C or -15C, to cover the full load range from 100% to 0% is hopelessly inefficient, because the pump will spend most of its operatin[bold]g hours in the low part load condition.[bold]______________________________________________
