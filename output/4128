defaultAs a JIB Approved electrician with a 5 year apprenticeship a DMS, 2 HNC,s and experience of working in other countries.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Part P so called electrician or 
default"PRETEND"default electrician is an excuse to devalue the trade.
defaultThe government have brought in this 
defaultPartP
default with very little thought and even less policing of the actions of those in the trade and with apparent scant regard to those who should be overseeing the so called training and approval of (PART P) electricians.
defaultThe 
defaultorganisations
default and providers of these courses (5-10 day wonders) are regarded in the trade as the 
default"Scam Merchants"default. They have a vested interest in making money, safety can be considered a secondary or third consideration.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis problem has been caused by Politicians who have introduced a bill without real research and consideration as to the consequences or methods of policing this bill.
defaultTherefore this needs to sorted by proper consultation with all affected parties including, 
defaulttradespeople
default, employers and the public.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have spoken to several companies as to why they have not taken on apprentices and have been told that they have had problems where the apprentice has left early to take a Part P and they have no intention of taking any more, in fact one company has since gone out of business.
defaultThis is just one of the consequences of an inept and poorly thought out bill.
defaultThe other consequences might not come to light until later from poorly installed electrics.
defaultThere is also the problem of (PART P) electricians doing work they are unqualified to do as there is no proper tracking system in place, 
defaultie
default working in commercial and industrial areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have come across several areas of concern where supposedly qualified/competent persons have worked who were members of the NICEIC these were reported.
defaultThe replies to these reports were that they "Would be looked into", nothing was ever done, remedial work never took place!.
default&#xa0;
defaultPart P as a scheme/method of raising safety standards is instead lowering the standard of both workmanship and safety.
default&#xa0;
defaultI am quite willing to use my time and explain to this select committee what many in the trade feel should be done to sort out this fiasco brought about by the inept or incompetent 
defaultaficionadoâ€™s
default that are allowed to put these schemes together.
