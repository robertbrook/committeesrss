[normal]Written submission from Gordon [bold]Sim[bold] (BRC 71)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As a JIB Approved electrician with a 5 year apprenticeship a DMS, 2 HNC,s and experience of working in other countries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Part P so called electrician or 
[normal]"PRETEND"[bold] electrician is an excuse to devalue the trade.
[normal]The government have brought in this 
[normal]PartP
[normal] with very little thought and even less policing of the actions of those in the trade and with apparent scant regard to those who should be overseeing the so called training and approval of (PART P) electricians.
[normal]The 
[normal]organisations
[normal] and providers of these courses (5-10 day wonders) are regarded in the trade as the 
[normal]"Scam Merchants"[bold]. They have a vested interest in making money, safety can be considered a secondary or third consideration.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This problem has been caused by Politicians who have introduced a bill without real research and consideration as to the consequences or methods of policing this bill.
[normal]Therefore this needs to sorted by proper consultation with all affected parties including, 
[normal]tradespeople
[normal], employers and the public.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have spoken to several companies as to why they have not taken on apprentices and have been told that they have had problems where the apprentice has left early to take a Part P and they have no intention of taking any more, in fact one company has since gone out of business.
[normal]This is just one of the consequences of an inept and poorly thought out bill.
[normal]The other consequences might not come to light until later from poorly installed electrics.
[normal]There is also the problem of (PART P) electricians doing work they are unqualified to do as there is no proper tracking system in place, 
[normal]ie
[normal] working in commercial and industrial areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have come across several areas of concern where supposedly qualified/competent persons have worked who were members of the NICEIC these were reported.
[normal]The replies to these reports were that they "Would be looked into", nothing was ever done, remedial work never took place!.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Part P as a scheme/method of raising safety standards is instead lowering the standard of both workmanship and safety.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am quite willing to use my time and explain to this select committee what many in the trade feel should be done to sort out this fiasco brought about by the inept or incompetent 
[normal]aficionadoâ€™s
[normal] that are allowed to put these schemes together.
