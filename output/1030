[normal]Disqualifying prisoners sentenced to 4 years or more [bold]in prison from voting[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Disqualifying only those prisoners serving four or more years would have the undesirable effect of enfranchising a substantial proportion of convicted prisoners.  
[normal]According to figures from the Ministry of Justice, on
[normal] 31 March 2013 there were 26,972
[normal] 
[normal]convicted 
[normal]adult
[normal] British
[normal] 
[normal]prisoners 
[normal]serving sentences of less than fou
[normal]r years
[normal] (excluding fine defaulters)
[normal]; a f
[normal]igure that represents almost a third (32.2%)
[normal] of the total prison population.
[normal]Many 
[normal]of those individuals sentenced to 
[normal]less than
[normal] four years in prison
[normal] 
[normal]are 
[normal]guilty of extremely serious and violent crimes.  T
[normal]hey include 
[normal]those 
[normal]convicted 
[normal]of rape, robbery and 
[normal]causing death by dangerous driving.
[normal]  
[normal]It would be totally inappropriate to extend 
[normal]the right to vote, during the period of their imprisonment, to individuals
[normal] who have violated 
[normal]so seriously the rights of their fellow citizens
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b)[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Disqualifying prisoners sentenced to more than six months in prison from voting[bold]&#xa0;[bold]If only 
[normal]those prisoners sentenced to more than six months in pris
[normal]on
[normal] were disqualified from voting, this 
[normal]would still enfranchise thousands of prisoners.
[normal] 
[normal]According to figures from the Ministry of Justice, on 31 March 2013 there were 4,623 
[normal]prisoners
[normal] 
[normal](excluding fine defaulters) 
[normal]se
[normal]rving sentences of six months or
[normal] less
[normal].  
[normal]Even allowing for the foreign national prisoners in that group, the House of Commons Library has estimated that around 4,000 British prisoners would be enfranchised if the rules were changed in this way.
[normal]Among 
[normal]the prisoners serving 
[normal]six months 
[normal]or less 
[normal]in prison
[normal] are those convicted of theft, assault and dr
[normal]ink driving.  If the offence committed is deemed sufficiently serious by a British judge to justify 
[normal]the 
[normal]decision to deprive
[normal] the perpetrator of his or her liberty,
[normal] even for a 
[normal]relatively 
[normal]short period, it is 
[normal]right that he or she is 
[normal]also denied
[normal] the civic right to vote for the duration of their imprisonment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]case law of the 
[normal]European Court of Human Right is haphazard, but has gradually moved towards the enfranchisement of all prisoners.  It is unlikely to accept
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal]ny
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]compromise
[normal] solution’ such as
[normal] disqualifying prisoners sentenced to more than six months in prison from voting.
[normal]  In the case of 
[normal]Frodl –v- Austria
[normal] 
[normal]the European Court of Human Rights
[normal] ruled 
[normal]unlawful the Austrian 
[normal]law 
[normal]ban
[normal]ning 
[normal]prisoners 
[normal]from 
[normal]voting if they had been sentenced to one year or more in prison.
[normal]  
[normal]Th
[normal]is demonstrates
[normal] that
[normal],
[normal] i
[normal]f the Government sets a
[normal] fixed ‘length of sentence’ 
[normal]threshold 
[normal]above which prisoners automatically lose their right to vote, that law would risk being ruled incompatible 
[normal]with the E
[normal]uropean 
[normal]C
[normal]onvention on 
[normal]H
[normal]uman 
[normal]R
[normal]ights
[normal] (ECHR)
[normal].
[normal]  In 
[normal]Frodl
[normal], the Court suggested that denial of the right to vote, as a sanction, had to be linked to the character of the crime, a qualification that would lead to the enfranchisement of all prisoners bar a small group such as those guilty of electoral fraud.
[normal]In addition, i
[normal]f the Government did allow prisoners sentenced to less than six months to vote in elections, and this was deemed unlawful by judges in Strasbourg
[normal], the Government would have accepted the principle that 
[normal]judges of the European Court of Human Rights have
[normal] the final say
[normal] even on the minutiae of UK pen
[normal]al policy
[normal], but c
[normal]ould 
[normal]continue to 
[normal]f
[normal]ace further demands 
[normal]from the Court 
[normal]to give 
[normal]the vote
[normal] to those prisoners who were still disqualified from voting
[normal], and further demands for compensation from British prisoners claiming that their rights were being breached. 
[normal] It is arguably the worst solution, sacrificing a key democratic principle, but leaving a high risk of future legal challenge in Strasbourg.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](c)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Disqualifying [bold]all prisoners serving custodial sentences from voting – a restatement of the existing ban[bold]&#xa0;[bold]In 2005 the European Court of Human Rights held
[normal], in the case of 
[normal]Hirst v U
[normal]nited 
[normal]K
[normal]ingdom
[normal],
[normal] that the UK ban on prisoner voting
[normal] 
[normal]violated the right to free and fair elections in Article 3 
[normal]of the Protocol to the E
[normal]C
[normal]HR
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]The C
[normal]ourt reasoned that the ban was ‘disproportionate’, amounting to an automatic blanket ban on all
[normal] convicted prisoners.
[normal]Second, the Court
[normal] noted that UK prisoners are not informed in court, at sentencing, that they forfeit the ri
[normal]ght to vote.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Third, the Court argued:
[normal]‘...
[normal]there is no evidence that Parliame
[normal]nt has ever sought to weigh the
[normal]competing interests or to assess the p
[normal]roportionality of a blanket ban
[normal]on the right of a convicted prisoner to vote .
[normal].. it cannot be said that
[normal]there 
[normal]was any substantive debate by me
[normal]mbers of the legislature on the
[normal]continued justification 
[normal]… for maintaining such a general restriction ...’
[normal]The Court’s first argument, that 
[normal]the current UK ban 
[normal]on prisoner voting is 
[normal]a
[normal]n automatic 
[normal]blanket ban
[normal] on all convicted prisoners, is factually incorrect.  The UK ban
[normal] 
[normal]does not apply t
[normal]o prisoners on remand, 
[normal]n
[normal]or to prisoners convicted for 
[normal]contempt of court 
[normal]n
[normal]or for
[normal] default
[normal]ing on fines.
[normal]  The Court is also incorrect to descr
[normal]ibe the ban on prisoner voting a
[normal]s disproportionate.  Under the law as it stands, every prisoner over the age of 18 and who is a British national will regain the right to vote once he or she is released from prison.  The length of time for which each prisoner loses the vote is lost is therefore directly proportionate to the seriousness of the crime he or she has committed, as the length of the voting ban mirrors exactly the 
[normal]length of the sentence served.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]Court’s 
[normal]second 
[normal]argument, that UK prisoners are not informed in court, at sentencing, that they will lose the right to vote, can be addressed easily through a minor ch
[normal]ange to sentencing guidelines requiring judges to inform those given a custodial sentence that they will lose the right to vote for the duration of their imprisonment.  There is no need to lift the ban on prisoner voting in order to address this issue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Court’s third argument, that Parliament had not held a substantive discussion 
[normal]on the issue of prisoner voting,
[normal] was incorrect and ill-
[normal]in
[normal]formed at the time of their judgment.  The matter 
[normal]had
[normal] 
[normal]been
[normal] dealt with by Parliament.  In 1999 the then Home Office Minister George Howarth led a working party on electoral procedures which, as part of its work, examined this issue in detail.  Following on from this review, in the year 2000, the legislation on prisoner voting was modified (under the Representation of the People Act 2000) to permit remand prisoners to vote.  Along with two consultations under the last Labour government, one in 2006 and the 
[normal]other in 2009, the matter
[normal] was 
[normal]further 
[normal]addr
[normal]essed on 10
[normal] F
[normal]ebruary 2011, when an extensive 
[normal]debate was held in the House of Commons
[normal]. 
[normal]Members of Parliament 
[normal]from all sides of the House 
[normal]voted, by 234 votes to just 22
[normal], to retain the current ban on prisoner voting.
[normal]  This emphatic statement of Parliament’s support for the 
[normal]status
[normal] 
[normal]quo
[normal] on prisoners’ voting rights should take precedence over the rulings of the European Court 
[normal]of Human Rights on this issue.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Additional Questions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]There are strong historical justifications for denying prisoners the vote.
[normal]  
[normal]British law has
[normal] 
[normal]de jure
[normal] restricted the voting rights o
[normal]f 
[normal]prisoners 
[normal]since the passing of the Forfeiture Act 1870
[normal]. 
[normal]In fact a ban of sorts
[normal] had existed, 
[normal]de facto
[normal], since 1832 as the franchise 
[normal]during that period was extended only
[normal] to men 
[normal]who owned land worth 
[normal]ten pounds
[normal] or more
[normal], while common law
[normal] directed that felons forfeited their lands.
[normal]  
[normal]Since 1870
[normal], 
[normal]four Representation of the People Acts - in 191
[normal]8, 1
[normal]969, 1983 and 2000 – have retained restrictions
[normal] 
[normal]on 
[normal]prisoners
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]right to vote
[normal].
[normal]In the case of 
[normal]Hirst v UK
[normal] the European Court of Human Rights held that the UK’s restrictions on prisoner voting were
[normal] incompatible with the ECHR
[normal].  In fact, voting rights for prisoners were specifica
[normal]lly excluded from the ECHR
[normal] from the outset.  W
[normal]hen British representatives were negotiating the text of the 
[normal]ECHR
[normal] in 1949
[normal], 
[normal]the French proposed including 
[normal]in the document the right to vote by “universal suffrage”
[normal].  Britain expressly rejected this wording on the grounds that it was too vague, and could lead to the right to vote being given to those who were denied it under British law - including prisoners. 
[normal]As UK delegate
[normal] 
[normal]Sir Oscar Dowso
[normal]n told representatives from other European nations at the negotiations
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“[i]
[normal]n no State is the right to vote enjoyed even by c
[normal]itizens without qualifications…
[normal]it is our view that the variety of circumstances to be considered may justify the imposition of
[normal] a variety of qualifications
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I
[normal]n Britain, 
[normal]these qualifications included restrictions on the voting rights of 
[normal]“peers, 
[normal]felons and lunatics”
[normal]. 
[normal] The UK Government’s
[normal] objection was accepted
[normal] by those negotiating the 
[normal]ECHR
[normal], and
[normal] the phrase ‘universal suffrage’
[normal] was 
[normal]specifically and deliberately 
[normal]omitted from the Convention
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The philosophical justifications for denying prisoners the vote are clear.
[normal]  
[normal]Individuals 
[normal]keep
[normal] most of their basic human righ
[normal]ts whilst serving a custodial sentence
[normal].  They retain the right to humane treatment, to be adequately fed and clothed.
[normal]However, f
[normal]or someone to receive a 
[normal]custodial sentence in England, he or she has
[normal] to have committed a serious crime. 
[normal] 
[normal]By doing so, t
[normal]hat person has
[normal] broken their contract with society to such a serious extent th
[normal]at they 
[normal]lose a number of rights
[normal];
[normal] their liberty, their f
[normal]reedom of association, and the
[normal] right to vote.
[normal]  When British voters elect 
[normal]a government they choose the 
[normal]me
[normal]n and women who will
[normal] make laws on their behalf. 
[normal] 
[normal]Convicted prisoners should have no say in this
[normal]; those who break the law should not
[normal] make the law.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The prisoner voting debate raises important questions about where the authority of national parliaments ends and that of the European Court of Human Rights begins.  
[normal]When Br
[normal]itain 
[normal]signed up to the ECHR
[normal], it was to help prevent a repeat o
[normal]f the catastrophic devastation, unprecedented suffering and appalling
[normal] 
[normal]human rights violations 
[normal]caused by the Second World War.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, in 
[normal]Tyrer v 
[normal]United Kingdom
[normal], judges in the European Court of 
[normal]H
[normal]uman 
[normal]R
[normal]ights
[normal] adopted the view that the Convention was what it termed “
[normal]a living instrument
[normal]”.  
[normal]Similarly, in  
[normal]Cossey v United Kingdom
[normal] the Court stated that it had a duty to “
[normal]ensure that the interpretation of the Convention reflects societal changes and remains in line with present day conditions
[normal].” 
[normal]What that 
[normal]has 
[normal]meant in practice 
[normal]i
[normal]s tha
[normal]t the Court assumed 
[normal]a legislative function fundamentally at odds with its judicial mandate
[normal].  It did so with no mandate from the Council of Europe member states.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is not disputed that the European Court of Human Rights has authority to hear and make authoritative rulings relating to cases involving alleged breaches of fundamental human rights by governments within the Council of Europe.  However, the signatories to the ECHR would never have envisaged that the Court would attempt to interfere in the minutiae of an individual nation’s electoral 
[normal]and penal 
[normal]laws, let alone try to overrule the clearly stated view of a national parliament on the issue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This was the argument 
[normal]made in 
[normal]the dissenting judgment
[normal]s
[normal] in the case of 
[normal]Hirst v UK
[normal].  Among those judges who dissented from the European Court of Human Rights’ judgment against the UK was the President of the Court, Judge Jean
[normal]-Paul Costa.  In his judgment Judge Costa
[normal] said:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]With due respect, I see no convincing arguments in the majorit
[normal]y’s
[normal]reasoning that could persuade m
[normal]e that the measure to which the applicant
[normal]was subject was arbitrary, or
[normal] even that it affected the free expression of
[normal]the opinion of the people
[normal]...it is not for the Court to 
[normal]prescribe the way in which national legislatures 
[normal]carry out their legislative functions. It must be assumed
[normal]that section
[normal] 3 of the Representation of the 
[normal]People
[normal] Act [2000] reflects political,
[normal]social an
[normal]d cultural values in the United 
[normal]Kingdom
[normal].
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The European Court of Human Rights’ own case law allows member states a “margin of appreciati
[normal]on” which accepts the ECHR
[normal] can be validly interpreted in different ways by different member states according to their own cultural, historical and philosophical traditions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As Judge Costa 
[normal]added in the conclusion of his dissenting judgment:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]The point is that one must avoid confusi
[normal]ng the ideal to be attained and which
[normal]I support – which is to make every e
[normal]ffort to bring the isolation of convicted
[normal]prisoners to an end, even when they have bee
[normal]n convicted of the most serious
[normal]crimes, and to prepare for their reintegration into so
[normal]ciety and citizenship – and
[normal]the reality of Hirst (no. 2), which on the o
[normal]ne hand theoretically asserts a wide
[normal]margin of appreciation for the States as to the c
[normal]onditions in which a subjective
[normal]right (derived from judicial interpretation!) may be exercised, bu
[normal]t goes on to
[normal]hold 
[normal]that there has been a violation of that right, the
[normal]reby depriving the State of
[normal]all 
[normal]margin and all means of appreciation
[normal].
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In seeking to redefine the details of UK electoral and penal law, the European Court of Human Rights has exceeded its proper 
[normal]judicial 
[normal]authority
[normal] and set itself on course for a constitutional clash with the elected and accountable legislative bodies in the UK
[normal].
[normal]  I
[normal]f the Court insists on expanding its influence and eroding the margin of appreciation, Strasbourg judges will find themselves more frequently in direct opposition to national courts and parliaments. Democratic parliaments across Europe will find themselves, with increasing regularity, forced to choose between the will of their people and the views of foreign judges. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Furthermore, 
[normal]on good constitutional authority from senior judicial figures, 
[normal]it is legit
[normal]imate for Parliament and UK
[normal] courts to reject the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. 
[normal]Lord Chief Justice Igor Judge used the 2010 annual Judicial Studies Board lecture to state that, although the decisions of the European Court of Justice bind UK courts, decisions of the
[normal] Strasbourg court 
[normal]do not.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]As a matter of statute the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights
[normal]do not bind our courts. The statutory obligation on our courts is to take account
[normal]of the decisions of the court in Strasbourg...We can follow the reasoning and if possible identify and apply the principle to be found in these decisions,
[normal]particularly those of the Grand Chamber.  But I venture to suggest that that is
[normal]not because we are bound to do so, even if the decision is that of the Grand
[normal]Chamber, or because the Supreme Court is a court subordinate to the Strasbourg court, but because, having taken the Strasbourg decision into account and
[normal]examined it, it will often follow that it is appropriate to do so.  But it will not
[normal]always be appropriate to do so.  What I respectfully suggest is that statute
[normal]ensures that the final word does not rest with Strasbourg, but with our Supreme Court.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the same speech, Lord Chief Justice Judge argued that “
[normal]Too many decisions from Strasbourg, and too ma
[normal]n
[normal]y domestic decisions, are cited in argument, and, I’m sorry to have to say this to my brother and sister judges, in all our judgments
[normal].”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lord Neuberger, currently President of the Supreme Court, said the following in 2011, shortly after Parliament had voted to retain the current ban on prisoner voting:
[normal]“
[normal]The fact remains though that when Strasbourg speaks, it is ultimately for
[normal]Parliament to consider what action needs to be taken...Placing such decisions
[normal]in the hands of the judicial branch of the state poses a danger for the judiciary
[normal]and for liberal democracy, because it removes the debate from the public and
[normal]their elected representatives.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is the clear view of two of this country’s most respected and senior judges that decisions of the European Court of Human Rights
[normal] 
[normal]are 
[normal]binding neither on UK courts nor
[normal] Parliament.  The Strasbourg court 
[normal]has issued judgments on UK prisoners’ voting rights, but the question of 
[normal]whether to enfranchise more prisoners or retain the current ban is one for Parliament. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The right to vote is not a human ri
[normal]ght; it is a civic right.  Human rights
[normal] are 
[normal]by definition 
[normal]extended 
[normal]under the ECHR
[normal] to every human being.  Fundamental rights like 
[normal]Article 3 ECHR – “No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman
[normal] or degrading treatment 
[normal]or punishment
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]are held under the Convention to apply 
[normal]with reservation 
[normal]to every citizen regardless of 
[normal]gender, nationality, 
[normal]race, religion, age
[normal], property, political opinion or any other status
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Voting rights, on the other hand, are 
[normal]usually 
[normal]qualified.  As discussed in our response to Additional Question 1 (above) the term “universal suffrage” was specifically exclude
[normal]d from the text of the E
[normal]C
[normal]HR
[normal] in recognition of the fact that not every citizen is entitled to vote.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Every 
[normal]single 
[normal]member country of the Council of Eur
[normal]ope imposes some form of 
[normal]restrictions
[normal] on the right to vote
[normal], for instance by imposing a minimum voting age
[normal] or limiting the right to vote to their own nationals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]It is entirely appropriate to deprive prisoners of the right to vote for the duration of their 
[normal]sentence.  Indirectly, through their right to choose their elected representatives, voters have the power to make, influence, block and amend laws.  That important power to shape the laws of the land is one that should not be granted to those who, at the time of an election, are serving a custodial sentence for breaking one or more of those laws.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The European Court of Human Rights is unable to 
[normal]enforce its own judgments or compensation awards
[normal] against national governments
[normal].  
[normal] 
[normal]Furthermore, the Council of Europe cannot impose fines on the UK Government for non-compliance with European Court of Human Rights judgments.  If Britain maintains the current ban on prisoners voting 
[normal]then 
[normal]t
[normal]he unimplemented judgment 
[normal]in 
[normal]Hirst v UK
[normal] 
[normal]will 
[normal]simply remain, along with hundreds of others, 
[normal]on the 
[normal]Council of Europe 
[normal]Committee
[normal] of Ministers’ list for review.
[normal] This is the same body that, through the Izmir Declaration 2011 and the Brighton Declaration 2012, has called on Strasbourg
[normal] to show greater respect for national democratic institutions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]According to the European Court of Human Rights
[normal], as it held
[normal] in the case of 
[normal]Frodl
[normal] v Austria
[normal],
[normal] it is unlawful for a government to impose a ban on prisoner voting based 
[normal]solely 
[normal]on the length of the sentence being served.  Therefore if the UK Government opted to amend the law in order to disqualify 
[normal]from voting prisoners sentenced
[normal] to
[normal] more than six months, four years or any other fixed period then it c
[normal]ould, based on existing Strasbourg case law, be interpreted as another form of “blanket” restrictio
[normal]n and therefore ruled unlawful.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Domestically, retaining the current ban on prisoner voting would respect the clearly stated view of Parliament, as expressed 
[normal]most recently 
[normal]on 10 February 2011 when the House of Commons voted by 234 votes to 22 in favour of the following motion:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]That this House notes the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights
[normal]in Hirst v the United Kingdom in which it held that there had been no
[normal]substantive debate by members of the legislature on the continued justification
[normal]for maintaining a general restriction on the right of prisoners to vote;
[normal]acknowledges the treaty obligations of the UK; is of the opinion that legislative decisions of this nature should be a matter for democratically-elected lawmakers;
[normal]and supports the current situation in which no sentenced prisoner is able to vote except those imprisoned for 
[normal]contempt, default or on remand.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If the UK retained its current ban on prisoner voting, and therefore refused to implement the judgments against it in 
[normal]Hirst
[normal] and 
[normal]Greens and MT
[normal], the sanctions at the Council of Europe level would be primarily political
[normal].  There might
[normal] be some 
[normal]mild diplomatic 
[normal]criticism from the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers in Strasbourg.  However, expulsion 
[normal]from the Council of Europe 
[normal]is utterly implausible
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] The Council
[normal] of Europe has not 
[normal]expe
[normal]lled
[normal] Bulgaria for 
[normal]breaches of the right to life (
[normal]cases of fatal polic
[normal]e brutality
[normal])
[normal], Moldova for 
[normal]the 
[normal]torture
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] prison
[normal]ers
[normal] and Russia for a
[normal]trocities committed 
[normal]by its armed forces 
[normal]in Chechnya.  
[normal]If the Government refuses
[normal] to change the law 
[normal]on 
[normal]prisoner voting, the m
[normal]atter will remain on the 
[normal]list of unenforced judgments kept by the Council of Europe.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]A
[normal]s explained in our response to Question 5, the European Court of Human Rights held, in the case of 
[normal]Frodl v Austria
[normal], that it is unlawful for a government to impose a ban on prisoner voting based solely on the length of the sentence being served.  Therefore if the UK Government opted to amend the law in order to disqualify from voting prisoners sentenced to more than six months or 
[normal]more than 
[normal]four years, this could still be interpreted as another form of “blanket” restriction and therefore ruled unlawful.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Given the shifting goalposts of the European Court of Human Rights, any compromise solution is likely to be temporary.  The court has a political agenda that is likely to press gradually for the enfranchisement of all prisoners.
