defaultDisqualifying prisoners sentenced to 4 years or more defaultin prison from votingdefault&#xa0;defaultDisqualifying only those prisoners serving four or more years would have the undesirable effect of enfranchising a substantial proportion of convicted prisoners.  
defaultAccording to figures from the Ministry of Justice, on
default 31 March 2013 there were 26,972
default 
defaultconvicted 
defaultadult
default British
default 
defaultprisoners 
defaultserving sentences of less than fou
defaultr years
default (excluding fine defaulters)
default; a f
defaultigure that represents almost a third (32.2%)
default of the total prison population.
defaultMany 
defaultof those individuals sentenced to 
defaultless than
default four years in prison
default 
defaultare 
defaultguilty of extremely serious and violent crimes.  T
defaulthey include 
defaultthose 
defaultconvicted 
defaultof rape, robbery and 
defaultcausing death by dangerous driving.
default  
defaultIt would be totally inappropriate to extend 
defaultthe right to vote, during the period of their imprisonment, to individuals
default who have violated 
defaultso seriously the rights of their fellow citizens
default.

defaultDisqualifying prisoners sentenced to more than six months in prison from votingdefault&#xa0;defaultIf only 
defaultthose prisoners sentenced to more than six months in pris
defaulton
default were disqualified from voting, this 
defaultwould still enfranchise thousands of prisoners.
default 
defaultAccording to figures from the Ministry of Justice, on 31 March 2013 there were 4,623 
defaultprisoners
default 
default(excluding fine defaulters) 
defaultse
defaultrving sentences of six months or
default less
default.  
defaultEven allowing for the foreign national prisoners in that group, the House of Commons Library has estimated that around 4,000 British prisoners would be enfranchised if the rules were changed in this way.
defaultAmong 
defaultthe prisoners serving 
defaultsix months 
defaultor less 
defaultin prison
default are those convicted of theft, assault and dr
defaultink driving.  If the offence committed is deemed sufficiently serious by a British judge to justify 
defaultthe 
defaultdecision to deprive
default the perpetrator of his or her liberty,
default even for a 
defaultrelatively 
defaultshort period, it is 
defaultright that he or she is 
defaultalso denied
default the civic right to vote for the duration of their imprisonment.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultcase law of the 
defaultEuropean Court of Human Right is haphazard, but has gradually moved towards the enfranchisement of all prisoners.  It is unlikely to accept
default 
defaulta
defaultny
default 
default‘
defaultcompromise
default solution’ such as
default disqualifying prisoners sentenced to more than six months in prison from voting.
default  In the case of 
defaultFrodl –v- Austria
default 
defaultthe European Court of Human Rights
default ruled 
defaultunlawful the Austrian 
defaultlaw 
defaultban
defaultning 
defaultprisoners 
defaultfrom 
defaultvoting if they had been sentenced to one year or more in prison.
default  
defaultTh
defaultis demonstrates
default that
default,
default i
defaultf the Government sets a
default fixed ‘length of sentence’ 
defaultthreshold 
defaultabove which prisoners automatically lose their right to vote, that law would risk being ruled incompatible 
defaultwith the E
defaulturopean 
defaultC
defaultonvention on 
defaultH
defaultuman 
defaultR
defaultights
default (ECHR)
default.
default  In 
defaultFrodl
default, the Court suggested that denial of the right to vote, as a sanction, had to be linked to the character of the crime, a qualification that would lead to the enfranchisement of all prisoners bar a small group such as those guilty of electoral fraud.
defaultIn addition, i
defaultf the Government did allow prisoners sentenced to less than six months to vote in elections, and this was deemed unlawful by judges in Strasbourg
default, the Government would have accepted the principle that 
defaultjudges of the European Court of Human Rights have
default the final say
default even on the minutiae of UK pen
defaultal policy
default, but c
defaultould 
defaultcontinue to 
defaultf
defaultace further demands 
defaultfrom the Court 
defaultto give 
defaultthe vote
default to those prisoners who were still disqualified from voting
default, and further demands for compensation from British prisoners claiming that their rights were being breached. 
default It is arguably the worst solution, sacrificing a key democratic principle, but leaving a high risk of future legal challenge in Strasbourg.
default&#xa0;
default(c)default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDisqualifying defaultall prisoners serving custodial sentences from voting – a restatement of the existing bandefault&#xa0;defaultIn 2005 the European Court of Human Rights held
default, in the case of 
defaultHirst v U
defaultnited 
defaultK
defaultingdom
default,
default that the UK ban on prisoner voting
default 
defaultviolated the right to free and fair elections in Article 3 
defaultof the Protocol to the E
defaultC
defaultHR
default.
default 
default 
defaultThe C
defaultourt reasoned that the ban was ‘disproportionate’, amounting to an automatic blanket ban on all
default convicted prisoners.
defaultSecond, the Court
default noted that UK prisoners are not informed in court, at sentencing, that they forfeit the ri
defaultght to vote.
default&#xa0;
defaultThird, the Court argued:
default‘...
defaultthere is no evidence that Parliame
defaultnt has ever sought to weigh the
defaultcompeting interests or to assess the p
defaultroportionality of a blanket ban
defaulton the right of a convicted prisoner to vote .
default.. it cannot be said that
defaultthere 
defaultwas any substantive debate by me
defaultmbers of the legislature on the
defaultcontinued justification 
default… for maintaining such a general restriction ...’
defaultThe Court’s first argument, that 
defaultthe current UK ban 
defaulton prisoner voting is 
defaulta
defaultn automatic 
defaultblanket ban
default on all convicted prisoners, is factually incorrect.  The UK ban
default 
defaultdoes not apply t
defaulto prisoners on remand, 
defaultn
defaultor to prisoners convicted for 
defaultcontempt of court 
defaultn
defaultor for
default default
defaulting on fines.
default  The Court is also incorrect to descr
defaultibe the ban on prisoner voting a
defaults disproportionate.  Under the law as it stands, every prisoner over the age of 18 and who is a British national will regain the right to vote once he or she is released from prison.  The length of time for which each prisoner loses the vote is lost is therefore directly proportionate to the seriousness of the crime he or she has committed, as the length of the voting ban mirrors exactly the 
defaultlength of the sentence served.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultCourt’s 
defaultsecond 
defaultargument, that UK prisoners are not informed in court, at sentencing, that they will lose the right to vote, can be addressed easily through a minor ch
defaultange to sentencing guidelines requiring judges to inform those given a custodial sentence that they will lose the right to vote for the duration of their imprisonment.  There is no need to lift the ban on prisoner voting in order to address this issue.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Court’s third argument, that Parliament had not held a substantive discussion 
defaulton the issue of prisoner voting,
default was incorrect and ill-
defaultin
defaultformed at the time of their judgment.  The matter 
defaulthad
default 
defaultbeen
default dealt with by Parliament.  In 1999 the then Home Office Minister George Howarth led a working party on electoral procedures which, as part of its work, examined this issue in detail.  Following on from this review, in the year 2000, the legislation on prisoner voting was modified (under the Representation of the People Act 2000) to permit remand prisoners to vote.  Along with two consultations under the last Labour government, one in 2006 and the 
defaultother in 2009, the matter
default was 
defaultfurther 
defaultaddr
defaultessed on 10
default F
defaultebruary 2011, when an extensive 
defaultdebate was held in the House of Commons
default. 
defaultMembers of Parliament 
defaultfrom all sides of the House 
defaultvoted, by 234 votes to just 22
default, to retain the current ban on prisoner voting.
default  This emphatic statement of Parliament’s support for the 
defaultstatus
default 
defaultquo
default on prisoners’ voting rights should take precedence over the rulings of the European Court 
defaultof Human Rights on this issue.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAdditional Questionsdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultThere are strong historical justifications for denying prisoners the vote.
default  
defaultBritish law has
default 
defaultde jure
default restricted the voting rights o
defaultf 
defaultprisoners 
defaultsince the passing of the Forfeiture Act 1870
default. 
defaultIn fact a ban of sorts
default had existed, 
defaultde facto
default, since 1832 as the franchise 
defaultduring that period was extended only
default to men 
defaultwho owned land worth 
defaultten pounds
default or more
default, while common law
default directed that felons forfeited their lands.
default  
defaultSince 1870
default, 
defaultfour Representation of the People Acts - in 191
default8, 1
default969, 1983 and 2000 – have retained restrictions
default 
defaulton 
defaultprisoners
default’
default 
defaultright to vote
default.
defaultIn the case of 
defaultHirst v UK
default the European Court of Human Rights held that the UK’s restrictions on prisoner voting were
default incompatible with the ECHR
default.  In fact, voting rights for prisoners were specifica
defaultlly excluded from the ECHR
default from the outset.  W
defaulthen British representatives were negotiating the text of the 
defaultECHR
default in 1949
default, 
defaultthe French proposed including 
defaultin the document the right to vote by “universal suffrage”
default.  Britain expressly rejected this wording on the grounds that it was too vague, and could lead to the right to vote being given to those who were denied it under British law - including prisoners. 
defaultAs UK delegate
default 
defaultSir Oscar Dowso
defaultn told representatives from other European nations at the negotiations
default:
default&#xa0;
default“[i]
defaultn no State is the right to vote enjoyed even by c
defaultitizens without qualifications…
defaultit is our view that the variety of circumstances to be considered may justify the imposition of
default a variety of qualifications
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultn Britain, 
defaultthese qualifications included restrictions on the voting rights of 
default“peers, 
defaultfelons and lunatics”
default. 
default The UK Government’s
default objection was accepted
default by those negotiating the 
defaultECHR
default, and
default the phrase ‘universal suffrage’
default was 
defaultspecifically and deliberately 
defaultomitted from the Convention
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe philosophical justifications for denying prisoners the vote are clear.
default  
defaultIndividuals 
defaultkeep
default most of their basic human righ
defaultts whilst serving a custodial sentence
default.  They retain the right to humane treatment, to be adequately fed and clothed.
defaultHowever, f
defaultor someone to receive a 
defaultcustodial sentence in England, he or she has
default to have committed a serious crime. 
default 
defaultBy doing so, t
defaulthat person has
default broken their contract with society to such a serious extent th
defaultat they 
defaultlose a number of rights
default;
default their liberty, their f
defaultreedom of association, and the
default right to vote.
default  When British voters elect 
defaulta government they choose the 
defaultme
defaultn and women who will
default make laws on their behalf. 
default 
defaultConvicted prisoners should have no say in this
default; those who break the law should not
default make the law.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe prisoner voting debate raises important questions about where the authority of national parliaments ends and that of the European Court of Human Rights begins.  
defaultWhen Br
defaultitain 
defaultsigned up to the ECHR
default, it was to help prevent a repeat o
defaultf the catastrophic devastation, unprecedented suffering and appalling
default 
defaulthuman rights violations 
defaultcaused by the Second World War.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, in 
defaultTyrer v 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default, judges in the European Court of 
defaultH
defaultuman 
defaultR
defaultights
default adopted the view that the Convention was what it termed “
defaulta living instrument
default”.  
defaultSimilarly, in  
defaultCossey v United Kingdom
default the Court stated that it had a duty to “
defaultensure that the interpretation of the Convention reflects societal changes and remains in line with present day conditions
default.” 
defaultWhat that 
defaulthas 
defaultmeant in practice 
defaulti
defaults tha
defaultt the Court assumed 
defaulta legislative function fundamentally at odds with its judicial mandate
default.  It did so with no mandate from the Council of Europe member states.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is not disputed that the European Court of Human Rights has authority to hear and make authoritative rulings relating to cases involving alleged breaches of fundamental human rights by governments within the Council of Europe.  However, the signatories to the ECHR would never have envisaged that the Court would attempt to interfere in the minutiae of an individual nation’s electoral 
defaultand penal 
defaultlaws, let alone try to overrule the clearly stated view of a national parliament on the issue.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis was the argument 
defaultmade in 
defaultthe dissenting judgment
defaults
default in the case of 
defaultHirst v UK
default.  Among those judges who dissented from the European Court of Human Rights’ judgment against the UK was the President of the Court, Judge Jean
default-Paul Costa.  In his judgment Judge Costa
default said:
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultWith due respect, I see no convincing arguments in the majorit
defaulty’s
defaultreasoning that could persuade m
defaulte that the measure to which the applicant
defaultwas subject was arbitrary, or
default even that it affected the free expression of
defaultthe opinion of the people
default...it is not for the Court to 
defaultprescribe the way in which national legislatures 
defaultcarry out their legislative functions. It must be assumed
defaultthat section
default 3 of the Representation of the 
defaultPeople
default Act [2000] reflects political,
defaultsocial an
defaultd cultural values in the United 
defaultKingdom
default.
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe European Court of Human Rights’ own case law allows member states a “margin of appreciati
defaulton” which accepts the ECHR
default can be validly interpreted in different ways by different member states according to their own cultural, historical and philosophical traditions.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs Judge Costa 
defaultadded in the conclusion of his dissenting judgment:
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultThe point is that one must avoid confusi
defaultng the ideal to be attained and which
defaultI support – which is to make every e
defaultffort to bring the isolation of convicted
defaultprisoners to an end, even when they have bee
defaultn convicted of the most serious
defaultcrimes, and to prepare for their reintegration into so
defaultciety and citizenship – and
defaultthe reality of Hirst (no. 2), which on the o
defaultne hand theoretically asserts a wide
defaultmargin of appreciation for the States as to the c
defaultonditions in which a subjective
defaultright (derived from judicial interpretation!) may be exercised, bu
defaultt goes on to
defaulthold 
defaultthat there has been a violation of that right, the
defaultreby depriving the State of
defaultall 
defaultmargin and all means of appreciation
default.
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultIn seeking to redefine the details of UK electoral and penal law, the European Court of Human Rights has exceeded its proper 
defaultjudicial 
defaultauthority
default and set itself on course for a constitutional clash with the elected and accountable legislative bodies in the UK
default.
default  I
defaultf the Court insists on expanding its influence and eroding the margin of appreciation, Strasbourg judges will find themselves more frequently in direct opposition to national courts and parliaments. Democratic parliaments across Europe will find themselves, with increasing regularity, forced to choose between the will of their people and the views of foreign judges. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore, 
defaulton good constitutional authority from senior judicial figures, 
defaultit is legit
defaultimate for Parliament and UK
default courts to reject the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. 
defaultLord Chief Justice Igor Judge used the 2010 annual Judicial Studies Board lecture to state that, although the decisions of the European Court of Justice bind UK courts, decisions of the
default Strasbourg court 
defaultdo not.
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultAs a matter of statute the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights
defaultdo not bind our courts. The statutory obligation on our courts is to take account
defaultof the decisions of the court in Strasbourg...We can follow the reasoning and if possible identify and apply the principle to be found in these decisions,
defaultparticularly those of the Grand Chamber.  But I venture to suggest that that is
defaultnot because we are bound to do so, even if the decision is that of the Grand
defaultChamber, or because the Supreme Court is a court subordinate to the Strasbourg court, but because, having taken the Strasbourg decision into account and
defaultexamined it, it will often follow that it is appropriate to do so.  But it will not
defaultalways be appropriate to do so.  What I respectfully suggest is that statute
defaultensures that the final word does not rest with Strasbourg, but with our Supreme Court.
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the same speech, Lord Chief Justice Judge argued that “
defaultToo many decisions from Strasbourg, and too ma
defaultn
defaulty domestic decisions, are cited in argument, and, I’m sorry to have to say this to my brother and sister judges, in all our judgments
default.”
default&#xa0;
defaultLord Neuberger, currently President of the Supreme Court, said the following in 2011, shortly after Parliament had voted to retain the current ban on prisoner voting:
default“
defaultThe fact remains though that when Strasbourg speaks, it is ultimately for
defaultParliament to consider what action needs to be taken...Placing such decisions
defaultin the hands of the judicial branch of the state poses a danger for the judiciary
defaultand for liberal democracy, because it removes the debate from the public and
defaulttheir elected representatives.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is the clear view of two of this country’s most respected and senior judges that decisions of the European Court of Human Rights
default 
defaultare 
defaultbinding neither on UK courts nor
default Parliament.  The Strasbourg court 
defaulthas issued judgments on UK prisoners’ voting rights, but the question of 
defaultwhether to enfranchise more prisoners or retain the current ban is one for Parliament. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe right to vote is not a human ri
defaultght; it is a civic right.  Human rights
default are 
defaultby definition 
defaultextended 
defaultunder the ECHR
default to every human being.  Fundamental rights like 
defaultArticle 3 ECHR – “No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman
default or degrading treatment 
defaultor punishment
default”
default 
defaultare held under the Convention to apply 
defaultwith reservation 
defaultto every citizen regardless of 
defaultgender, nationality, 
defaultrace, religion, age
default, property, political opinion or any other status
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultVoting rights, on the other hand, are 
defaultusually 
defaultqualified.  As discussed in our response to Additional Question 1 (above) the term “universal suffrage” was specifically exclude
defaultd from the text of the E
defaultC
defaultHR
default in recognition of the fact that not every citizen is entitled to vote.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultEvery 
defaultsingle 
defaultmember country of the Council of Eur
defaultope imposes some form of 
defaultrestrictions
default on the right to vote
default, for instance by imposing a minimum voting age
default or limiting the right to vote to their own nationals.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultIt is entirely appropriate to deprive prisoners of the right to vote for the duration of their 
defaultsentence.  Indirectly, through their right to choose their elected representatives, voters have the power to make, influence, block and amend laws.  That important power to shape the laws of the land is one that should not be granted to those who, at the time of an election, are serving a custodial sentence for breaking one or more of those laws.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe European Court of Human Rights is unable to 
defaultenforce its own judgments or compensation awards
default against national governments
default.  
default 
defaultFurthermore, the Council of Europe cannot impose fines on the UK Government for non-compliance with European Court of Human Rights judgments.  If Britain maintains the current ban on prisoners voting 
defaultthen 
defaultt
defaulthe unimplemented judgment 
defaultin 
defaultHirst v UK
default 
defaultwill 
defaultsimply remain, along with hundreds of others, 
defaulton the 
defaultCouncil of Europe 
defaultCommittee
default of Ministers’ list for review.
default This is the same body that, through the Izmir Declaration 2011 and the Brighton Declaration 2012, has called on Strasbourg
default to show greater respect for national democratic institutions.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultAccording to the European Court of Human Rights
default, as it held
default in the case of 
defaultFrodl
default v Austria
default,
default it is unlawful for a government to impose a ban on prisoner voting based 
defaultsolely 
defaulton the length of the sentence being served.  Therefore if the UK Government opted to amend the law in order to disqualify 
defaultfrom voting prisoners sentenced
default to
default more than six months, four years or any other fixed period then it c
defaultould, based on existing Strasbourg case law, be interpreted as another form of “blanket” restrictio
defaultn and therefore ruled unlawful.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultDomestically, retaining the current ban on prisoner voting would respect the clearly stated view of Parliament, as expressed 
defaultmost recently 
defaulton 10 February 2011 when the House of Commons voted by 234 votes to 22 in favour of the following motion:
default&#xa0;
defaultThat this House notes the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights
defaultin Hirst v the United Kingdom in which it held that there had been no
defaultsubstantive debate by members of the legislature on the continued justification
defaultfor maintaining a general restriction on the right of prisoners to vote;
defaultacknowledges the treaty obligations of the UK; is of the opinion that legislative decisions of this nature should be a matter for democratically-elected lawmakers;
defaultand supports the current situation in which no sentenced prisoner is able to vote except those imprisoned for 
defaultcontempt, default or on remand.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf the UK retained its current ban on prisoner voting, and therefore refused to implement the judgments against it in 
defaultHirst
default and 
defaultGreens and MT
default, the sanctions at the Council of Europe level would be primarily political
default.  There might
default be some 
defaultmild diplomatic 
defaultcriticism from the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers in Strasbourg.  However, expulsion 
defaultfrom the Council of Europe 
defaultis utterly implausible
default.
default 
default The Council
default of Europe has not 
defaultexpe
defaultlled
default Bulgaria for 
defaultbreaches of the right to life (
defaultcases of fatal polic
defaulte brutality
default)
default, Moldova for 
defaultthe 
defaulttorture
default 
defaultof
default prison
defaulters
default and Russia for a
defaulttrocities committed 
defaultby its armed forces 
defaultin Chechnya.  
defaultIf the Government refuses
default to change the law 
defaulton 
defaultprisoner voting, the m
defaultatter will remain on the 
defaultlist of unenforced judgments kept by the Council of Europe.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultA
defaults explained in our response to Question 5, the European Court of Human Rights held, in the case of 
defaultFrodl v Austria
default, that it is unlawful for a government to impose a ban on prisoner voting based solely on the length of the sentence being served.  Therefore if the UK Government opted to amend the law in order to disqualify from voting prisoners sentenced to more than six months or 
defaultmore than 
defaultfour years, this could still be interpreted as another form of “blanket” restriction and therefore ruled unlawful.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultGiven the shifting goalposts of the European Court of Human Rights, any compromise solution is likely to be temporary.  The court has a political agenda that is likely to press gradually for the enfranchisement of all prisoners.
