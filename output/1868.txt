[[[Geoff Dawson – Written evidence ]]]&#xa0;My concern is with the state of the Green Lanes that I constantly see being destroyed by motorised vehicles, 4x4s and trials bikes.I remember one occasion when I went caving on Fountains Fell in the Yorkshire Dales. On the way to the cave, we walked along a perfect grassy track. On the way back, 2 recreational 4x4’s approached and past us. Just the 2 of them, but they reduced the track to a quagmire in a single pass. Two peoples’ moment of fun destroyed the track for everyone for the next year!I would like to make two proposalsThese proposals are covered in more detail by the formal submissions made by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group(GLEAM), the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA)  and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA) which I expressly support.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
