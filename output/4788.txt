[[[Written evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Gloucestershire [CST0044]]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Thank you for your letter regarding the Public Administration Select Committee’s current inquiry into crime statistics.  In answer to your questions, I can respond as follows:&#xa0;1.              I have set the Gloucestershire Constabulary no targets: they only have the one target set by the Home Secretary to reduced crime.&#xa0;2.              National Crime Recording Standards (NCRS) and National Standards for Incident Recording (NSIR) audits are undertaken regularly and reported to Chief Officers and my Office both directly and through an Executive Performance Summary. &#xa0;Audit results across 2013 from Gloucestershire show that 91% of crimes that should be recorded are recorded. &#xa0;This figure however fluctuates across the different crime categories, with 96% of acquisitive crimes recorded and 88% of violent crimes recorded. As for the classification of crimes, Gloucestershire currently has upwards of 95% of offences categorised correctly.&#xa0; This is due in the most part to the way that the Constabulary has control of the recording of crimes within the Force Crime Validation &amp; Evaluation Unit.&#xa0;The audit process was changed early in 2013 from solely looking at thematic (one crime type at a time) to a regular overall audit.&#xa0; 400 incidents are looked at every month, split by crime types. Three things are measured:&#xa0;&#xa0;This review and change in practice and regular reporting gives me confidence in the crime statistics for Gloucestershire to the extent indicated above.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
