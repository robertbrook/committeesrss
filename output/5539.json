"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the National Trust&#xa0;&#xa0;Executive summary&#xa0;1. \nNational Trust is a major landowner in \nEngland\n, \nWales\n and \nNorthern Ireland\n with 255,000 h\nect\na\nres (ha) of countryside, \n700 k\nilo\nm\netres\n of coastline and 400 gardens in our care for the benefit of the nation.\n&#xa0;\n2. Approximately half \nof this land is of h\nigh nature value, accessible and  \n enjoyed by million\ns of people. Together with tenanted farmland, it makes a significant contribution to \nlocal \nand regional \neconomies. \n&#xa0;\n3. We recognise the harm caused by\n \nInvasive Non-Native Species (\nIN\nNS) - be they plant diseases in\n gardens\n and woodlands, plants in water bodies or predatory mammals on seabird \nislands. \n&#xa0;\n4. We recognise the value of both \neffective quarantine measures\n,\n and rapid reaction to control and eradicate INNS inclu\nding plant diseases\n. \n O\nur \nstaff can spend up to half of their time\n controlling invasive species\n,\n at a cost of up to £12000 per h\na depending on the situation\n.  \n&#xa0;\n5. \nThe draft EU Directive proposal to list 50 INNS is not sufficiently sensitive to existing risk from species and those \nnative species \nthat are poise\nd\n to cause harm in areas \nof the EU where they are not native. More emphasis should be based on risk-\nbase\nd assessments that identify species \nof most \nconcern and provide the basis for risk-\nbased trading.\n&#xa0;\n6. \nThe Invasive Non-Native\n \nSpecies Framework Strategy\nfor Great Britain\n (GB INNS Framework), \nin \npromoting sound \nmanagement\n of INNS, could help define what success looks like, promote more effective engagement with NGOs, and forge more citizen science and state agency based partnerships.\n&#xa0;\n7. The Scottish INNS legislation looks promising, as do initiatives in \nNorthern Ireland\n and the \nRepublic\n of \nIreland\n to tackle INNS on an island –wide basis. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1. Introduction&#xa0;\n1.1.  \nThe National Trust welcomes the opportunity to provide evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee’s inquiry on Invasive Species.\n&#xa0;\n1.2. \nThe National Trust is \nEurope\n’s largest conservation charity with over 4 million members and an annual turnover of more than £430 million. We currently manage over 250,000 ha of countryside, several hundred historic houses, gardens and parks and more than 700 km of coastline across \nEngland\n, \nWales\n and \nNorthern Ireland\n. Nearly 50 % of the water in \nEngland\n and \nWales\n runs through National Trust land.\n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nThe National Trust exists to look after special places for ever, for everyone. We do this in a way which connects \nthe\n benefits \nof nature \nwith people, welcoming around 100 million visits to the outdoors, coast and countryside locations managed by the National Trust. We invest over £130m into conservation projects each year, and some of this funding comes from corporate partners. \n&#xa0;\n1.4. \nManagement of invasive species is a major investment in \nresource\n for the Trust. Typically our countryside a\nnd gardens staff spend up to half \nof their time reducing the impacts of invasive species and plant diseases, most of which are non-native.\n&#xa0;\n1.5 \nWe welcome the Committee’s interest in the degree to which the \nUK\n should align with EU initiatives, look to legislation in \nScotland\n as a guide, and help shape the G\nB INNS Framework of the future.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2. Overview&#xa0;\n2.1 Invasive Non Native Species (INN\nS\n)\n are a major threat to the \nUK\n’s native wildlife and its economy. They also have adverse societal impacts \nwhich include the profound sense of loss of\n iconic and beautiful native species such as the red squirrel \n(which can \ncont\nr\nact and die from disease spread by the non-native grey squirrel\n)\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nProgrammes \nto tackle INNS \nin which we are especially active, often in partnership with other organisations and with the help of hundreds of volunteers, include: \n(1)  Control of \nHottentot\n fig from coastal slopes in \nCornwall\n (\nto win back flower rich grassland and restore feeding places for the recently re-established chough, the county’s \nemblemic\n bird\n)\n \n(2) Control of \nRhododendron\n in north \nWales\n and north Devon to restore oak woodland, and its native bird and lichen species\n, and on \nBrownsea\n and \nLundy\n \nIslands\n, to restore habitat for the red squirrel and Lundy cabbage respectively. \n \n(3) Eradication of rats from \nLundy\n \nIsland\n to save \nspecies such as the Manx shearwater \nfrom extinction there\n. \n(4\n) Control of grey squirrels in and around refuge areas for red squirrels in the north of \nEngland\n and on \nAnglesey\n. \n(5\n) Control of non-native aquatic (e.g. \nNew Zealand\n pygmy weed) and \nbankside\n plants (such as Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam) in and around our thousands of ponds and other water bodies \n(6\n) Plant health and \nbiosecurity\n in our heritage gardens. \nWe have a rigour programme of deploying \nbiosecurity\n to minimise the risk of plant diseases damaging high value plants and destroying the beauty of our nationally important gardens.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 \nRigorous prioritisation based on risk\n assessment is critical\n. Early intervention and the resources need\ned for this are equally \ncritical, especially where non-native invasive species have been tracked and found to be established in satellite areas. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3. Our concerns&#xa0;\n3.1 \nThe \nfuture of the \nDefra GB INNS Programme Board\n&#xa0;\nThe GB INNS Programme Board represents an \nimportant commitment by the \nUK\n to reduce the damaging influence\n of non-native species\n, and it should be maintained\n. But it nee\nds more resource to engage with people \nto be vigilant, \nto \nexert stricter quarantine measures, control and eradicate some species at an appropriate scale, define success and report on success or failure.\n The Board also \nneeds to prioritise high risk species – these are the small suite of non-native invasive species that have the highest capacity to transform \nnative \nhabitats and ecosystems. \n In some cases the Board needs to stimulate research where there are significant knowledge gaps. The two examples below illustrate the need to act now on (1) a high risk species not yet established in the \nUK\n; and (2) on one which is established but spreading and whose ecological impact is not well understood.\n&#xa0;\n(1) Water hyacinth, native to \nSouth America\n, is a major pest of water bodies, making them \nunnavigable\n and reducing their biodiversity. This species does not breed in the \nUK\n yet, but could do so in a series of warmer weather years. We need a formal watching brief backed by a rapid response mechanism to ensure that water hyacinth does not become established in the \nUK\n&#xa0;\n(2) Chinese water deer, \nestablished in the east of \nEngland\n, has recently invaded \nOrford\n Ness\n, a 15 km long shingle spit off the \nSuffolk\n coast that is \ninternationally important fo\nr its wildlife and \nhistorical heritag\ne. \nWe do not \nknow \nthe impact of Chinese water deer on either the natural or cultural or historical features on \nOrford\n Ness\n but remain concerned about this knowledge gap.\n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nObjective setting and realistic \ncostings\n for control/eradication of INNS\n&#xa0;\nIn the management of INNS \nsuccess\n is reported in a variety of ways\n. It is \nin\nsufficient for success to be gauged by how much \nof a INNS\n has been removed. \nA better measure \nis if native species and habi\ntats can be shown to have \nbeen restored\n, or ecosystem functioning improved\n as a result of the \nmanagement\n. \nWe should not be afraid to recognise failure but need to \nmake sure effective communication is in place to report \non \nwhat does not work.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nIncreasing \nthe \nuse of innovative \nmethods \nto \ndetect\n early stages of\n \nestablishment of INNS. \n&#xa0;\nGovernment and others should make more use of innovative methods to detect the early stage of INNS establishment where these are practicable \nFor example, hair tubes for mammals \nand collections of faeces \nfrom which DNA can be extracted to identify species and also individuals; e (environmental) DNA – which can be used to track presence of non-native invasive amphibians such as bullfrogs in ponds for example; camera\n traps. Much of the data collection can be done by volunteers but would need coordinating with state agencies and analysing by scientists.\n&#xa0;\n3.4 T\nhe minimum requirements for successful management \nof INNS\n&#xa0;\nThe National Trust\n sees the minimum requirements for successful management of INNS as:\n&#xa0;\n3.4.1 \nRealistic and appropriate prioritisation based on risk assessment for native wildlife, people and the economy\n. This could lead to risk-\nbased trading of species such as \nINNS of \naquatic plants\n3.4.2 Consultation with local people leading to r\napid decision making leading to rapid action\n3.4.3 \nAction at the appropriate scale (e.g. \nfor \nbankside\n INNS plants such as Japanese knotweed,  whole water \ncatchments rather than\n just one \npart of the \ncatchment where the species is known and conspicuous\n)\n3.4.4 \nCriteria for success agreed early in the project\n, and success/failure reported on at milestones and at the end of the project.\n&#xa0;\n3.5 \nDelivery mechanisms\n \n&#xa0;\nWe see a m\najor role for Local Nature Partnerships \nas delivery bodies \nto coordinate, communicate and stimulate state agency, local authority and \nvolunteer partnerships to tackle INNS\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.6 Legislation\n&#xa0;\nWe advocate b\netter use of\n powers in\n \nthe \nW\nildlife \n&amp; C\nountryside\n Act 1981 Schedu\nle 9 and equivalent in \nNorthern Ireland\n to raise awareness of the risks of unrestricted movement of certain species by human agency, and also learning from INNS legislation in \nScotland\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.7 Knowledge gaps\n&#xa0;\nWe advocate m\nore research on ecological processes and pathogens transfer\n between INNS and native species \n(\nnon-native and native crayfish species;  grey/red squirrel - \nNT supporting the latter)\n&#xa0;\n3.8 The Committee might want to consider the following&#xa0;\n3.8.\n1. Is the EU draft Directive on Invasive Non – Native Species (INNS) fit for purpose? \n&#xa0;\nIs \nthe EU draft Directive’s s\nelection of 50 species deemed to cause most\n harm\n sufficiently sensitive –\n or\n would a risk-based\n \nselection\n, using \nclimate change scenario\ns and/or \nhorizon scanning be better at preventing spread\n and \nestablishment?\n&#xa0;\nWill the EU Directive be sufficiently sensitive to th\ne need to p\nrevent \nthe\n spread of potentially invasive species from EU Member states where \nthey are either \nnative\n or \nlong established to those where not yet established but where they could cause harm.\n&#xa0;\n3.8.2. \n How do we prioritise (we cannot manage all INNS everywhere)? \n&#xa0;\nWe should focus on s\ntrengthen\ning\n existing legislation\n. The\n Scottish model looks promising.\n E\ncological priorities\n should be based\n on global responsibilities\n, for example the\n removal of rats from seabird islands. Societal and economic benefits from managing INNS may\n however need to\n be based on different priorities\n, for instance \nkeeping new plant diseases out of publicly accessible heritage gardens, and clearing away Himalayan balsam to allow access to river banks by anglers.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.8.\n3. How do we measure and report on success and failure? What does success look like?\n&#xa0;\nManagement needs to be lead by carefully constructed \n‘\nsmart\n’\n objectives. INNS \ncan be regarded as successfully managed\n when they have been prevented from invading the \nUK\n through effective legislation and/or quarantine. \n&#xa0;\nIn some cases \ninvading or established INNS may \nhave been controlled successfully \nbut the expected positive impacts such as evident restoration of native species and/or habitats\n or wider \nsocietal or economic benefit may not have been measured. \nThe f\nailure of management of INNS is rarely reported\n. This may be\n because objectives were poorly defined at the outset.\n&#xa0;\nA s\ntrengthened GB INNS Framework Strategy \ncould help to address this problem\n, especially if\n it is\n more inclusive of NGOs in decision making\n and\n includ\nes\n on appropriate application of the precautionary principle.\n&#xa0;\n3.8.\n4. Should there be a\n UK/all \nIreland\n approach to management of INNS?\n&#xa0;\nINNSs do not respect international boundaries, especially when there is no sea barrier or obvious border control. It makes sense to support the strengthening of al \nUK\n/ all \nIreland\n strategy to tackle INNS. \n&#xa0;\nAgain a strengthened GB INNS Framework Strat\negy has a supporting role here, as it does in promoting functional working links between Departments at state borders.\n&#xa0;\n27 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
