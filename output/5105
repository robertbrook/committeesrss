defaultPrisoner: “And after [my] release… I had a bank account with 45,000 shekels from [my] salary from the Palestinian Ministry of Prisoners’ Affairs… and there remained a deficit of 30,000 shekels for the wedding … I decided to arrange an imaginary plan for th
defaulte Israeli ShaBaK (i.e., Israel’s General Security Service) [to discover] so that I would be arrested... After I would spend five years [in prison] I would receive a salary of about 4,000 shekels [upon release] and this amount would be for three years. That
default means there would be a total amount of 135,000 shekels and then I would cover my debts.”  [Testimony of Suspect, Israel Police form, Aug. 18, 2013]

defaultthe May 2011 salary budget, shows that these salary payments to terrorists come from the PA’s salary budget
default,
default which is paid from the PA’s 
defaultgeneral budget. In 
defaultthis

defaultdiscussing the PA

default 
defaultChairman of the Prisoners' Club, Qadura Fares:default "All in all, we are in the same situation as others. What is disbursed to the prisoners is exactly what is disbursed to me and you [i.e., government employees]. These are salaries. Therefore, when the salaries are paid to those working in [government] min
defaultistries and institutions, they will also be paid to the prison
defaulters."

defaultFunding by the UdefaultKdefault and other Western donorsdefaultIt is clear from the rules, regulations, and statements of the PA
default that
default any country that gives funding to the PA’s general budget or to the payment of salaries participates in paying salaries to terrorists. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, due to the PA’s inability to raise the money to 
defaultcover
default its monthly budget 
defaultexpenses, 
defaultthe PA has conditioned
default payment of terrorist prisoners
default’
default salaries on “
defaultavailability of fundsdefault":
default  default“Head of the Statistics Department of the Ministry [of Prisoners' Affairs], Abd Al-Nasser Farwaneh… confirmed that the first group of released prisoners will be able to receive the Dig
defaultnified Life Grant next month and explained 
defaultthat payment will depend on availability of fundsdefault."

defaultEvery prisoner will be granted a monthly salary… These regulations will be implemented from Jan. 1, 2011, 
defaulton the basis of available defaultsources of fundingdefault."
default[PA regulation, 
defaultAl-Hayat Al-Jadida

default&#xa0;
defaultSince
default salaries are conditioned on “availability of funds
default,
default” even those countries
default,
default which earmark their donations for specific PA needs
default and expenses
default, such as teachers’ salaries, instead
default of donating directly to the PA general budget, 
defaultin effect 
defaultfacilitate payments to the terrorists.
default Earmarking money for

defaultfree
defaults
default up money in the budget that would otherwise have paid the 
defaultteachers
default, and thus make money for terrorists “available”. 
defaultAccordingly, those countries that give money directly for the PA budget’s use, are paying the salaries and grants to terrorists. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe PA is aware of the Western world’s refusal to pay salaries 
defaultto terrorist
defaults
default, and this was expressed by PA Minister Karake who mocked and rejected Europe’s demand that their money not fund terrorists:
defaultPA Minister of Prisoners’ Affairs Issa Karake:
default"The Europeans want their money that comes to us to remain clean- not to go to famidefaultlies of those they claim to be terroristsdefault. [They] need to renounce this occupation mentality. These [prisoners] are heroes, 
defaultfedayyeen
default (self-sacrificing fighters), and fighters … We appreciate the people of the revolution 
defaultand are proud of themdefault."

defaultJust a month after the PA minister made these remarks the EU sent 
defaultmore 
defaultmoney to the PA to pay salaries – including those of terrorists:
default"Yesterday [Dec. 15, 2013] the European Union donated approximately 11 million euros to pay 
defaultthe November salaries and pensions of approximately 71,000 Palestinian government employees and pensioners in the [West] Bank and the Gaza Strip."

default)
default&#xa0;
defaultAdditional RemarksdefaultPMW’s reason for submitting evidence:defaultPMW believes that peace education is a critical component for achieving peace. By providing salaries and other financial rewards to terrorists, the PA is educating its people to glorify violence and terror against Israeli civilians and to see murderers as 
defaultrole models. Financially rewarding murderers of civilians constitutes an overwhelming impediment to peace. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPMW’s recommendations to the UK GovernmentdefaultThe UK and other international donors have the power to influence the PA to put an end to the glorification and payment of financial rewards to terrorists. Donor countries have the power to bring about this change, were they to 
defaultlink
default their funding upon the 
defaultelimination of terror glorification 
defaultby the PA, 
defaultits rewarding terrorists and turning them into role models for youth. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA more 
defaultconservative approach to eliminate terror glorification 
defaultwould deduct from 
defaultthe PA’s 
defaultfunding, the amount that 
defaultthe 
defaultPA was spending on
default payments to terrorist
defaults, until they stopped terrorists salaries and terror glorification.
default&#xa0;
defaultBrief description of PMW:defaultPMW fills a unique role internationally by monitoring, translating, and preparing in-depth reports about Palestinian society, leadership an
defaultd activities, and bringing the findings directly to decision makers around the world. PMW’s goal is to research PA society and expose fundamental impediments to peace actively generated by the PA, so that those impediments can be eliminated. PMW monitors o
defaultfficial PA daily newspapers, official PA TV, PA schoolbooks, sports and cultural activities, PA leaders’ statements and activities, children’s songs and dance, formal and informal education, children’s TV programs and music videos. By doing so PMW is able 
defaultto report key indicators of PA intentions and ideology, and uncover impediments to peace which are found in many PA government-controlled structures.
