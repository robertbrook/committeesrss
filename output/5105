[normal] 
[normal]The Palestinian Authority has stressed that the monthly

[normal] is not

[normal]but a salary the terrorists receive because of their

[normal] 
[normal][WAFA (the official Palestinian Authority news agenc

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All these payments not only reward terror, as the PA min
[normal]i
[normal]ster 
[normal]indicates
[normal], but certainly can be seen by individuals as a motivation for terror. PMW has 
[normal]received 
[normal]a copy
[normal] of a signed statement to Israel
[normal]i
[normal] police made by one terrorist prisoner
[normal] who said that since his first imprisonment
[normal] for planning a suicide terror attack
[normal] was 
[normal]less than five years, 
[normal]he planned another attack in order to reach 5 years
[normal]’ imprisonment, which would provide him with a monthly salary upon release
[normal]. The monthly salary of 
[normal]4
[normal],
[normal]000 shekel
[normal]s
[normal] after leaving prison would 
[normal]cover 
[normal]his 
[normal]debt, he explained, and the 
[normal]money was his 
[normal]sole 
[normal]motivation: 
[normal]Prisoner: “And after [my] release… I had a bank account with 45,000 shekels from [my] salary from the Palestinian Ministry of Prisoners’ Affairs… and there remained a deficit of 30,000 shekels for the wedding … I decided to arrange an imaginary plan for th
[normal]e Israeli ShaBaK (i.e., Israel’s General Security Service) [to discover] so that I would be arrested... After I would spend five years [in prison] I would receive a salary of about 4,000 shekels [upon release] and this amount would be for three years. That
[normal] means there would be a total amount of 135,000 shekels and then I would cover my debts.”  [Testimony of Suspect, Israel Police form, Aug. 18, 2013]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following PMW’s exposure 
[normal]of the fact 
[normal]that the PA pays salaries to terrorists, many European countries have
[normal] debated the issue
[normal], condemned the practice
[normal] and asked for clarifications fro
[normal]m the PA. 
[normal]However, r
[normal]ecently,
[normal] PA Minister of
[normal] Prisoners' Affairs Issa Karake
[normal] mocked the European countries for challenging the PA’s funding of terror
[normal] saying "the Europeans want their money that comes to us to remain clean.” He said
[normal], at a ceremony honoring released terrorists all of who were murderers,
[normal] that Europe’s seeing Palestinian prisoners as terrorists is “occupation mentality” since according to 
[normal]the PA they 
[normal]“
[normal]are heroes”:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]PA Minister of Prisoners' Affairs Issa Karake
[normal]"The Europeans want their money that comes to us to remain clean -- not to go to families of those they claim to be terrorists[bold]. 
[normal][They] need to renounce this occupation mentality. Thes[bold]e [prisoners] are heroes[bold]... These heroes, whom you are applauding, must live in dignity, so that we will continue to hold our heads high. We appreciate the people of the revolution and 
[normal]are proud of them."[bold][Official PA TV Live,

[normal]Nov. 4, 2013]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These words of
[normal] the PA minister 
[normal]articulate 
[normal]the fundamental disagreement between the PA and the West
[normal] about how to define a terrorist and how 
[normal]the PA should use donor money
[normal]. The US and Europe see Palestinians who 
[normal]have 
[normal]murdered Israeli 
[normal]civilians 
[normal]as terrorists who should be 
[normal]punished
[normal]. 
[normal]The PA sees Palestinians who 
[normal]have 
[normal]murdered 
[normal]Israeli civilian
[normal]s as “heroes” and reward
[normal]s
[normal] them financially. Since the PA cannot cover its expenses or pay salaries independently
[normal], the 
[normal]PA use
[normal]s the
[normal] donor money in its general budget according to its own di
[normal]scretion. The 
[normal]U
[normal]K
[normal], Europe and other donors

[normal]The PA paid terrorist prisoners and released prisoners [bold]more than[bold] $1[bold]0[bold]0[bold] [bold]million [bold]in 2013[bold]PMW has precise official PA figures for three of the 
[normal]five
[normal] payments the PA made to prisoners and released 
[normal]prisoners in 2013. Regarding 
[normal]the

[normal]n spite of not ha

[normal]estimated
[normal] salary payment for 2013 
[normal]based on other off
[normal]icial PA statements, the number
[normal] of prisoners, the average salaries in 2011 and the salary

[normal]PA Minister of Prisoners’ Affairs Karake:[bold] “The allowance’s maximal amount is around 2,000 shekels…”
[normal]PA Minister Karake:[bold] “First of all, the fixed salary (

[normal]Attorney Suad Ghazaleh:[bold] “The law says ‘loans.’”
[normal]PA Minister Karake:[bold] “This isn’t a loan. You have to return a loan. Le
[normal]gally, this is entirely untrue. This is a salary (

[normal] 7.5 million shekels every month.”[bold] [Official PA TV, Dec. 2, 2013]

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Calculating PA expenditure for salaries in 2013 using 2011 as a base[bold]The May 2011 report cited above was the last time the PA published the figures for its monthly salary budget. 
[normal]The average monthly expenditure in 2011 totaled [bold]17,678,247 shekels ($5,211,747) and approximately $62.5 million for all of 2011.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]To 
[normal]estimate 
[normal]the yearly 
[normal]expense 
[normal]for 2013, starting with 2011 as a base, thr
[normal]ee adjustments have to be made. 
[normal]-The number of pris
[normal]oners has gone down, by 500, lowering expenses
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]- Many long term prisoners were released by Israel, lowering expenses 
[normal]- Many of the 5000 prisoners would be receiving 1
[normal],
[normal]000 – 2
[normal],
[normal]000 shekel
[normal]s
[normal] more a month than in 2011, as all salaries for terrorists rise the
[normal] longer they are in jail, raising expenses.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Given these higher and lower adjustments, PMW 
[normal]calculates
[normal] it would be safe to 
[normal]estimate 
[normal]that the salary expenses have not changed very much since they cost to the PA 
[normal]$62
[normal].
[normal]5
[normal] million in 
[normal]2011.
[normal] However, 
[normal]in the interest
[normal] of caution, PMW is choosing a figure of 10% lower expenditure since 2011 - so as to be certain we are not overestimating PA expenses to terrorists.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The final salaries expenditure estimate for 2013: [bold]Base figure: 2011 yearly expenditure: $62,540,964 [bold]M[bold]inus (10%)[bold] [bold]$6,254,096 [bold]2013 salaries equal at least $56,000,000 [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Payment 5: [bold]Released prisoners who were jailed for 
[normal]five
[normal] years
[normal]: [bold]No estimate[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Released prisoners who were jailed for 
[normal]five
[normal] years or more receive a monthly stipend or salary of 4,000 shekel
[normal]s
[normal] from the PA upon leaving prison, apparently for 
[normal]three
[normal] years: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"Al-Haj was one of 26 citizens released by the occupation's forces in the early hours of Wednesday morning [Aug. 14, 2013] despite protests by families of Israelis killed in Palestinian attack
[normal]s... The released prisoners received a hero's welcome in the West Bank by senior [Palestinian] Authority officials and by their relatives… 
[normal]Money is not an immediate concern because the [Palestinian] Authority will pay at least 4,000 shekels a month to pris[bold]oners released after serving a long prison term, and considers them to be returning soldiers."[bold] [
[normal]Al-Hayat Al-Jadida
[normal], Aug. 16, 2013]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As stated above, the PA has not released official figures as to the numbers of recipients or its monthly expenditure so PMW 
[normal]has chosen no
[normal]t
[normal] to include this payment

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]And more benefits are pending:[bold]“[PA] Minister of Prisoners’ Affairs Issa Karake
[normal] announced that the prisoners’ issue is constantly and continuously on the government’s table, due to the great interest in this issue and to the 
[normal]search for every possibility to assist them[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]as fighters who sacrificed for their homeland and country…[bold] [bold]Karake 
[normal]noted that in recent years the Ministry of Prisoners’ [Affairs], in cooperation with all institutions,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]enacted four implementing regulations of the prisoners’ law…
[normal] 
[normal]Karake related to a number of other proposals for regulations, which he hopes will be duly a[bold]pproved. They relate to university education in prisons, fertility services for released prisoners, salary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]completion and the establishment of a national fund to support prisoners and their families, alongside[bold]&#xa0;[bold]a regulation for deceased released prisoners.[bold]”

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Salary payment or social welfare?[bold]There has been discussion in a number of European parliaments
[normal], especially in UK Parliament, 
[normal]as to whether these salary payments are social 
[normal]welfare 
[normal]stipends
[normal] to families or salary payments to terrorists.
[normal] As PMW has stressed in the past, 
[normal]and as official PA statements and reports corroborate, 
[normal]t
[normal]hese payments to terrorists are not categorized 
[normal]by the PA as 
[normal]social welfare
[normal] in name and not
[normal] treated as social welfare in
[normal] practice. T
[normal]he PA has
[normal] stressed 
[normal]as 
[normal]cited above
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]payments to terrorist prisoners are rewards “
[normal]out of esteem for their sacrifice and struggle[bold]"
[normal]:
[normal]"[Minister of Prisoners' Affairs Issa] 
[normal]Karake denies rumors about changing salaries (Arabic: [bold]rawatib[bold]) into soci[bold]al assistance[bold]... He noted that the government… has authorized regulations to support and protect them 
[normal]out of esteem for their sacrifice and struggle[bold]." 
[normal][WAFA (the official Palestinian Authority news agency), Dec. 27, 2012]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition, 
[normal]the
[normal] Minister of Prisoners’ Affairs Issa 
[normal]Karake himself
[normal] has confirmed that
[normal] 
[normal]the prisoner is the only person who can decide where the salary money goes. He is the only one who
[normal] can assign a power of attorney, and he is not obliged to transfer the
[normal] money to his wif
[normal]e and children:
[normal]PA Minister of Prisoners’ Affairs Issa Karake[bold]:[bold] "The current procedure in the Ministry of Prisoners' Affairs is that the prisoner determines who has the p
[normal]ower of attorney... 
[normal]He gives the power of attorney to whomever he wants from within thi
[normal]s group -- first-degree relatives -- to receive his monetary allowances." [Official PA TV, Feb. 17, 2013]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In an interview
[normal],
[normal] the wife
[normal] of a prisoner 
[normal]explained that her husband 
[normal]gave h
[normal]is salary to others and not 
[normal]to 
[normal]her:
[normal]PA TV journalist[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Roba Al-Najjar[bold] to wife of prisoner:[bold]&#xa0;[bold]"For nearly four years, the prisoner's allowance from the Ministry of Prisoners' Affairs and the official institutions has not reached 
[normal]your hands and your children's hands... Did you try to turn to the authorities?"
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Prisoner's wife:[bold]&#xa0;[bold]"A year and a half ago, I went to the Ministry of Prisoners' Affairs... Their answer was: 'Your husband transfers it to the person he wants. It's in his power not to transfer [it to you] and we can't do anything about it."
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Prisoner's wife:[bold]&#xa0;[bold]"[My husband]
[normal] told me: 'If you do what I 
[normal]want, it [the monthly salary] will return to you. As long as you are like this, it won't return to you.'" 
[normal][Official PA TV, Feb. 17, 2013]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This confirms 
[normal]that 
[normal]it is not only the 
[normal]letter 
[normal]of 
[normal]the law but 
[normal]also 
[normal]Palestinian Authority p
[normal]ractice, that the prisoner determines where 
[normal]his salar
[normal]y 
[normal]money goes – and he can withhold it from his wife and children and save it for 
[normal]when he is 
[normal]release
[normal]d
[normal] if he chooses. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]P[bold]A[bold] [bold]payments to [bold]terrorists[bold] [bold]and Western donor money [bold]There are some European officials 
[normal]who have 
[normal]argued that the PA has as separate account from which it pays salaries to terrorists and therefore donating money for PA salaries or to the general budget is not funding terrorists.    
[normal]The chart 
[normal]and the accompanying 
[normal]article 
[normal]cited 
[normal]above, 
[normal]quoting 
[normal]the official PA document
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]analyzing
[normal] 
[normal]the May 2011 salary budget, shows that these salary payments to terrorists come from the PA’s salary budget
[normal],
[normal] which is paid from the PA’s 
[normal]general budget. In 
[normal]this 
[normal]detailed article in 
[normal]the official PA daily’s 
[normal]financial 
[normal]supplement 
[normal]discussing the PA
[normal]’s
[normal] salary budget, the payments to prisoners were explicitly presented as part of the monthly salaries
[normal]’
[normal] budget
[normal] even citing that it was 2.43% of t
[normal]he general budget for salaries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]C
[normal]hairman
[normal] [bold]of the PA-
[normal]funded Palestinian 
[normal]Prisoners’ Club
[normal] Qadura Fares
[normal] 
[normal]confirmed in an interview on official 
[normal]PA
[normal] TV,
[normal] that since payments to prisoners are like other civil 
[normal]servants’ 
[normal]salaries they are 
[normal]all
[normal] paid together. He explained that in times of financial crises
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]when
[normal]ever
[normal] salaries are paid to civ
[normal]il servants “they will 
[normal]also be paid to the prisoners”:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]PA TV host:[bold] "How were the prisoners' salaries and allowances affected by the economic crisis in Palestine?"
[normal] 
[normal]Chairman of the Prisoners' Club, Qadura Fares:[bold] "All in all, we are in the same situation as others. What is disbursed to the prisoners is exactly what is disbursed to me and you [i.e., government employees]. These are salaries. Therefore, when the salaries are paid to those working in [government] min
[normal]istries and institutions, they will also be paid to the prison
[normal]ers." 
[normal][Official PA TV, Jan. 17, 2013]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Funding by the U[bold]K[bold] and other Western donors[bold]It is clear from the rules, regulations, and statements of the PA
[normal] that
[normal] any country that gives funding to the PA’s general budget or to the payment of salaries participates in paying salaries to terrorists. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition, due to the PA’s inability to raise the money to 
[normal]cover
[normal] its monthly budget 
[normal]expenses, 
[normal]the PA has conditioned
[normal] payment of terrorist prisoners
[normal]’
[normal] salaries on “
[normal]availability of funds[bold]":
[normal]  [bold]“Head of the Statistics Department of the Ministry [of Prisoners' Affairs], Abd Al-Nasser Farwaneh… confirmed that the first group of released prisoners will be able to receive the Dig
[normal]nified Life Grant next month and explained 
[normal]that payment will depend on availability of funds[bold]."
[normal] [bold][
[normal]Al-Ayyam
[normal], Aug. 19, 2013]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]Every prisoner will be granted a monthly salary… These regulations will be implemented from Jan. 1, 2011, 
[normal]on the basis of available [bold]sources of funding[bold]."
[normal][PA regulation, 
[normal]Al-Hayat Al-Jadida
[normal], April 15, 2011]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Since
[normal] salaries are conditioned on “availability of funds
[normal],
[normal]” even those countries
[normal],
[normal] which earmark their donations for specific PA needs
[normal] and expenses
[normal], such as teachers’ salaries, instead
[normal] of donating directly to the PA general budget, 
[normal]in effect 
[normal]facilitate payments to the terrorists.
[normal] Earmarking money for 
[normal]teachers’ salaries 
[normal]free
[normal]s
[normal] up money in the budget that would otherwise have paid the 
[normal]teachers
[normal], and thus make money for terrorists “available”. 
[normal]Accordingly, those countries that give money directly for the PA budget’s use, are paying the salaries and grants to terrorists. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The PA is aware of the Western world’s refusal to pay salaries 
[normal]to terrorist
[normal]s
[normal], and this was expressed by PA Minister Karake who mocked and rejected Europe’s demand that their money not fund terrorists:
[normal]PA Minister of Prisoners’ Affairs Issa Karake:
[normal]"The Europeans want their money that comes to us to remain clean- not to go to fami[bold]lies of those they claim to be terrorists[bold]. [They] need to renounce this occupation mentality. These [prisoners] are heroes, 
[normal]fedayyeen
[normal] (self-sacrificing fighters), and fighters … We appreciate the people of the revolution 
[normal]and are proud of them[bold]."
[normal][Official 
[normal]PA TV Live,

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Just a month after the PA minister made these remarks the EU sent 
[normal]more 
[normal]money to the PA to pay salaries – including those of terrorists:
[normal]"Yesterday [Dec. 15, 2013] the European Union donated approximately 11 million euros to pay 
[normal]the November salaries and pensions of approximately 71,000 Palestinian government employees and pensioners in the [West] Bank and the Gaza Strip."
[normal][WAFA, official PA news agency, and 
[normal]Al-Hayat Al-Jadida
[normal], Dec. 6, 2013]
[normal]From the EU press release: 
[normal]"For many y
[normal]ears, the EU has been the biggest donor and most reliable partner to the Palestinian Authority. Today's contribution to salaries and pensions is further evidence of our unimpeded support for the Palestinian people which will continue in 2014."

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Western donor countries’ choice to ignore the 
[normal]fact that the PA 
[normal]is spending over 
[normal]$
[normal]100 
[normal]million 
[normal]dollars 
[normal]a year in 
[normal]payments to terrorists 
[normal]from the money 
[normal]they donate 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]the PA 
[normal]for development 
[normal]enables 
[normal]the PA to continue its policy of rewarding terrorists and murderers without having to worry about the source of income to cover these expenses.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Conclusions:[bold]The PA [bold]makes [bold]four[bold] payment[bold]s[bold] to terrorist prisoners[bold] and released prisoners[bold],[bold] which [bold]reached [bold]in 2013 [bold]to [bold]over[bold] [bold]$[bold]100[bold] million dollars[bold]. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Countries [bold]which donate [bold]money to the PA’s general budget or to the salaries budget are directly making payments to terrorists.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Countries which earmark [bold]their donations for specific [bold]projects are f[bold]r[bold]eeing up money [bold]elsewhere [bold]with[bold] which the PA [bold]pay[bold]s[bold] terrorist salaries.[bold]&#xa0;[bold](

[normal] 
[normal]with additional 
[normal]sources in 
[normal]4 reports on PA terrorist salaries
[normal].
[normal])
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Additional Remarks[bold]PMW’s reason for submitting evidence:[bold]PMW believes that peace education is a critical component for achieving peace. By providing salaries and other financial rewards to terrorists, the PA is educating its people to glorify violence and terror against Israeli civilians and to see murderers as 
[normal]role models. Financially rewarding murderers of civilians constitutes an overwhelming impediment to peace. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]PMW’s recommendations to the UK Government[bold]The UK and other international donors have the power to influence the PA to put an end to the glorification and payment of financial rewards to terrorists. Donor countries have the power to bring about this change, were they to 
[normal]link
[normal] their funding upon the 
[normal]elimination of terror glorification 
[normal]by the PA, 
[normal]its rewarding terrorists and turning them into role models for youth. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A more 
[normal]conservative approach to eliminate terror glorification 
[normal]would deduct from 
[normal]the PA’s 
[normal]funding, the amount that 
[normal]the 
[normal]PA was spending on
[normal] payments to terrorist
[normal]s, until they stopped terrorists salaries and terror glorification.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Brief description of PMW:[bold]PMW fills a unique role internationally by monitoring, translating, and preparing in-depth reports about Palestinian society, leadership an
[normal]d activities, and bringing the findings directly to decision makers around the world. PMW’s goal is to research PA society and expose fundamental impediments to peace actively generated by the PA, so that those impediments can be eliminated. PMW monitors o
[normal]fficial PA daily newspapers, official PA TV, PA schoolbooks, sports and cultural activities, PA leaders’ statements and activities, children’s songs and dance, formal and informal education, children’s TV programs and music videos. By doing so PMW is able 
[normal]to report key indicators of PA intentions and ideology, and uncover impediments to peace which are found in many PA government-controlled structures.
