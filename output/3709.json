"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Peter Garland (CYS0008)\n&#xa0;\nI offer these thoughts as a cyclist, male, 59 years old, who has ridden an annual four to five thousand kilometres a year, mostly in the UK outside London, for the last twenty years or so.\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI see numerous examples \nof  so\n called \n“\nbike lanes\n”\n \nwhere a strip \nof road margin has been marked with a white line, often filled in green. Usually this strip will continue for a short length of road but only for as long as the road is wide enough for traffic to pass a bike without crossing the centre line. As soon as the\n road narrows the \n“\nbike lane\n”\n \nterminates.\n&#xa0;\nI have never been able to see what benefit I derive, as a cyclist, from such road markings. I assume that it is supposed to make the cars keep out of the bike lane but I can assure you that the road markings make \nno difference whatsoever to the clearance passing cars allow me. But the real concern is that if separation of cars and cycles is the rationale for such markings the fact that they disappear exactly at the point when they might deliver most benefit (the ro\nad narrowing) makes clear that these piece-meal \nlenghts\n of painted tarmac are mere tokens without substance. \n&#xa0;\nI also see schemes where the cyclist is led either onto a pavement or even into a true cycle lane physically separated from traffic and pedestria\nns by raised paving. Often, these too will terminate after a very short while, thus forcing the cyclist to rejoin the traffic and so, in my view, increasing the risks.\n&#xa0;\nMy question for the committee is: What evidence is there that such short length \n“\ncycle \nlanes\n”\n \ndeliver any benefit that exceeds the costs of installation?\n&#xa0;\nMy suspicion is that there is no such evidence. Rather, the installation of these schemes is driven by a \nmis\n-guided sense of a need to do 'something' or, worse, to meet some arbitrary targ\net for installed length of bike lanes.\n&#xa0;\nI consider that all such half-hearted measures have unintended negative consequences. Not least of which is that they insidiously create the perception amongst non-cyclists that cycling is a dangerous activity that r\nequires such special provisions and, amongst drivers, that cyclists should \nonly\n cycle in the bike lane.\n&#xa0;\nI would ask the committee firstly to consider any evidence of benefit of non-segregated bike lanes. If any benefit can be demonstrated then fine go ahe\nad (though I shall remain mystified!)\n&#xa0;\nAnticipating that the move to do something will not stop (there is a certain momentum behind these things) will the committee consider making recommendations to relevant bodies that require any cycle lane to have some\n sort of sensible minimum length, and that they should ideally cover a complete journey, say from one town to the next or from a suburb to the city centre. Certainly, \nthe  installation\n of piece-meal short lengths should cease.\n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA related point is tha\nt, if such schemes are installed they \nmust\n be maintained to be effective (but seldom are). Effective maintenance would include trimming encroaching vegetation, sweeping broken glass and other sharps from the surface and effectively policing the parking of \ncars in the bike lane. I see many examples where all these factors prevent the use of cycle lanes, thus rendering the full costs of installation wasted. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
