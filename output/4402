default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Local Government Technical Advisers Group (
defaultTAG) represents a large number of local authorities in the country, these include those with highway and transport responsibilities; such as Transport for London, most London boroug
defaulths, Metropolitan authorities, Unitary authorities, consultants providing highway and transport services for major local authorities and many of the districts and towns in two tier authorities. While these ‘second tier’ authorities do not have direct respon
defaultsibility for transport, they do have a major role in looking after significant towns and the sensible overall planning of them including providing a reasonable environment and trying to ensure, through the Highways and Transport Authorities, that the trans
defaultport system is fit for purpose. Overall we represent over 100 different authorities. Thus for any technical or professional group, we believe we are the most effective representative organisation likely to have a technical as well as public view on any pol
defaulticy issues (we are professional advisers to the LGA).

defaultTAG does 
defaultappreciate central government support for local services including transport however local government have vastly insufficient funding or powers to ensure that the services are properly delivered or directed to the real priorities.

defaultRegardless of the level
default of overall funding or powers, the present and near future mechanisms for funding for transport have a number of problems these can be summarised as follows:
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.1
default              
defaultFunding mechanisms for 
defaultvarious Local Transport infrastructure and services have changed at frequent intervals over the memory of Transport professionals in TAG.  In the 1970’s the main funding was through the Transport Policies and Programme annual submission and this covered re
defaultvenue and capital and monies which were duly made from central funds to Councils or Councils were allowed to spend their rates based receipts on various items of Transport. Each submission was often a substantial work volume or overhead on Local Authoritie
defaults (LAs) and the administrative work/ overhead has grown very substantially over the last 30 years. Ownership /responsibility for management of various roads, buses and trains have also changed many times during the last 30 years which have had similar impa
defaultcts limiting the ability of local authorities to consistently deliver sensible integrated transport policies.  Furthermore the substantially greater and increasing levels of resources available to the Highways Agency for their 2% of the road network has fu
defaultrther hindered the LAs task.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultIn order to deliver effective management of local transport, LAs really need a major input into key areas including:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultRecently funding and legislation have not been sufficiently supportive for LAs 
defaultto make an 
defaultadequate contribution to these needs.  Furthermore despite promises of simplification and less bidding required to obtain moneys from central government, recently the complications have grown.  At present funding is available for the services and heavily s
defaultkewed towards capital including:
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultPost 2015 most of the funding for local authority major and minor capital schemes will go into the Single Regional Growth Fund. Other funds almost inevitably will be available but as yet we do not know how this will pan out and how much revenue assistance 
defaultwill be available. Recently released National Statistic figures indicate that LA revenue expenditure on Highways and Transport has fallen by £1,706m or 26% between 2009-10 and 2012-13, with the consequential reductions in services both in terms of public t
defaultransport and maintenance activities and further reductions are anticipated. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultWithin this overall reduction in revenue spend a number of elements, such as the costs of servicing debt associated with previous investment and statutory concessionary fare 
defaultreimbursements have been constrained by external factors, the impact of which is to increase pressure and reduce services further in other key areas such as infrastructure maintenance and other concessionary fare arrangements for example. 
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultOne significant impact of the speed and severity of the levels of reduction in revenue spending is the level of de-skilling which is occurring; many skilled and experienced staff have left local government service, a trend which is set to continue as previ
defaultous decisions on spending continue to impact. The private sector has suffered similar reductions in revenues and consequentially reduced staffing levels. There is evidence of recovery in the private sector market, accompanied with indications of skills sho
defaultrtages. The ability to deliver increases in infrastructure investment effectively both in the immediate and medium term must therefore be questionable. In the longer term the ability to attract high quality graduates into the industry to deliver the necess
defaultary essential skills sets must remain questionable given the volatility in the funding of infrastructure both at the national and local levels. 
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultIt appears that the Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPS) charged with deciding how local areas should bid 
defaultfor capital transport funding now cover a completely new set of divisions of the Country not particularly reflecting traditional area wide divisions and that the people making decisions are not democratically accountable.  Additionally, a significant propo
defaultrtion of the funding over which the LEPs will now preside had previously been devolved to LAs.  Nevertheless the LAs will still have financial responsibility to ensure that the money is properly 
defaultspent and will make the best of the challenge presented by th
defaulte new arrangements. Experience suggests it usually takes at least 20 years for a fairly consistent management to get to grips with an understanding of how an area works and the priorities
default; this 
default represent
defaults
default a significant challenge and steep learning curv
defaulte for the LEPs particularly in the area of transport. Furthermore even then, if there is money on offer
default,
default experience indicates that local authorities will and have bid for schemes or infrastructure which would not normally be their priorities (as they often
default get a much subsidised product even if they don’t really need it).
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default              
defaultTAG does welcome the government’s recognition that maintenance needs substantial extra funding and recent announcements relating to additional capital investment but so far the sums se
defaultem well short of sufficient to meet the costs of keeping the system in its present depleted state, let alone covering the years of shortfall.  We should certainly not be spending money expanding the existing road or even rail infrastructure until we have p
defaultroperly looked after what we have got.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultWhile it is difficult for TAG to surmise the government’s intentions the following may be considerations:
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTAG believes LAs
default have the length of experience and knowledge and are 
defaultbest placed to know what communities need.
default The new system will r
defaultesult in fragmentation of national transport budgets
default and w
defaulteakening of clarity of direction for funding priorities – national vs. local
default. The
defaultre will be an i
defaultncreased numbers of organisations involved in the funding decision and distribution of funding –
default this could also be a 
defaultproblem for DfT dealing with more organisations with less budget.
default4.3
default              
defaultAlternative
defaults may include – direct funding to LA
defaults
default. Whi
defaultle this would need some assessment by the DfT, such assessment must ensure that it matches the needs identified in para 3.2 above rather than be based largely on modelled travel t
defaulti
defaultme savings. While we are not geared up to identify models used in other cou
defaultntries we believe that a study would throw up some useful alternatives.
default4.4
default              
defaultGenerally, yes – organisations will group and arrange to pool and share resources
default and
default buy in if necessary but this will take a little time and require some relearning by some of the bodies. 
default4.5
default              
defaultIt is q
defaultuestionable whether the levels of funding currently provided through the indicative allocations is sufficient to maintain a viable establis
defaulthment 
defaultfor assessing and prioritising schemes with 
defaultgreat uncertainty remaining regarding the funding to other streams particularly Growth Funds. 
defaultAssessment methods for local and trunk roads do need a complete overhaul and should be objective and strategy ba
defaultsed rather than spurious modelled time savings 
default- 
defaultfor peak times and 30 years ahead should not be used.
default4.6
default              
defaultThis assessment task is further complicated by LA
defaults downsizing with loss of skills, private sector downsized with only limited scope for growth due to
default critical loss of skills. Longer term skills and retention issues need
default a
default pipeline approach
default,
default not stop / start.
default4.7
default              
defaultTAG recognises the need 
defaultto continue 
defaultto 
defaultreinforce
default the 
defaultlinkage between transport and economic outcomes – 
defaulthowever
default,
default while we fully recognise tha
defaultt Communications and Transport are one important requisite for economic health
default,
default the scale, sort
default (mode capital or revenue etc)
default and management of transport to best deliver the economic health is far from clear.(please see our evidence to the 
defaultS
defaulttrategic 
defaultR
defaultoads inquiry)
default.
default4.8
default              
defaultIt may be that 
defaultUnitary or Combined authorities
default covering all modes and all networks
default way forward? – local base, knowledge and service delivery combining essential skills for larger geographic / economic areas. 
default4.9
default              
defaultCollaboration can and has worked although strong leadership is essential and a lead authority is a practical requirement.
default4.10
default              
defaultMany formal relationships have been swept aside as burdens of reporting and red tape have lifted
default.  In
default some areas
default this 
defaulthas resulted in absence of regular contact.
default In order to be e
defaultffective 
defaultthis
default needs to be on a personal basis, re
defaultgular and focused communications.  While people do change jobs the Ministerial changes and the Civil service procedures for cycling staff around do not help to get a thorough understanding 
defaultand optimum delivery
default. 
default The loss of Regional Office for the DfT and DOE/DCLG has exacerbated this problem. Furthermore some large organisations such as
default Network Rail / ORR 
defaultare 
defaultimpenetrable
default and the bus industry is fragmented but behaves like semi-monopolies i
defaultn different areas.
default4.11
default              
defaultNo – funding allocations
default are 
defaultinadequate to sustain basic transp
defaultort needs especially outside London – please see para 3.2 for identified needs. 
defaultAs mentioned in 3.1 funding streams are constantly changing and the bidding process for funding often with small sums involved is a substantial overhead on delivery. The compet
defaultition element of the regional growth fund adds a further degree of uncertainty regarding potential levels of funding likely to 
defaultbe available for transport. Additionally, while the regional growth fund has recently been defined in outline o
defaultther funding strea
defaultms 
defaultremain 
defaultuncertain
default.
default 
defaultThere appears to be an a
defaultbsence regarding sub-national / regional scale project funding.
default 
default4.12
default              
defaultWithin our larger towns
default,
default the 
defaultCity Deals
default may provide an
default opportunity for some larger scale projects but 
defaultare 
defaultnot structured for this purpose and
default 
defaultit is not 
defaultclear how coverage will map across England.
default4.13
default              
defaultA significant investment has been made establishing LTB’s an
defaultd although some of the work will no doubt be salvaged through the SLGF process, this is now controlled through LEP’s who are not democratically accountable.
default4.14
default              
defaultGreat uncertainty of the levels of future funding for, not only, major transport schemes but k
defaultey elements of work previously funded through the Local Transport Plans such as potentially road safety and Sustainable Transport which in addition to the LTP’s was funded through a competitive pot arrangement the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. Many of 
defaultthe activities have no direct alignment to the original objectives of LEP’s.
default4.15
default              
defaultAnother key factor is the l
defaultack of forward planning
default, consequent
default loss of any concept of pipeline 
defaultand so 
defaultloss of key skills.
default4.16
default              
defaultThis is m
defaultore problematic given the direction of planning policy which is removing the need to 
defaultprovide even basic essential infrastructure in the pursuit of short term objectives and 
defaultlikely only to provide 
defaultland owners with windfall income. 
default4.17
default              
defaultA 
defaultWorkplace Parking levy 
defaulthas been successfully introduced in
default Nottingham 
defaultand enabled additional funding to
default be directed towards transport investment given the additional revenue stream provided. However, the government’s apparent approach of adopting only populist solutions to transport problems is likely to prevent even the most forwarding thinking authorities
default adopting such innovative approaches. 
default4.18
default              
defaultAdditionally, opportunities for private sector funding are not well distributed and individual interventions may not necessarily be directed in the interest of an overall transport strategy, for example by seeking to increase road capacity rather than impr
defaultove public transport. Accordingly, 
defaultcontinuing public sector funding to deliver transport objectives
default appears necessary.
default 
default419
default              
defaultThere appears to be only l
defaultimited
default alternative funding
default 
defaultopportunities 
defaultin
default the
default short-term with 
defaultpotential for 
defaultonly slight growth 
defaultprimarily
default in areas where growth is already a problem 
defaultand in the longer term
default this alternative funding remains problematic
default. 
defaultA system which recovers increases in land value resulting from transport investment is one option which is regularly identified and dismissed o
defaultn the basis of complexity however it is less clear whether it is the vested interests of the land owners which are the greatest problem to be overcome.
default4.20
default              
defaultIn terms of delivery, most local authorities work with the private sector both for technical work a
defaultnd delivery of projects. The major obstacle to better working has been the lack of ability to adequately forward plan due to financial uncertainty. 
default4.21
default              
defaultLocal authority members are being held accountable for the performance of the network but increasingly the investment is being directed by LEP’s wi
defaultthout democratic accountability. Whereas this may be seen to be good reason for LA’s to work productively wit
defaulth LEP’s it is unclear what motivation exists for reciprocity. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe hope that this evidence will be useful to the Committee. We would be pleased to elaborate, provide any supporting evidence by additional documentation and verbally in front of the Committee
default.
