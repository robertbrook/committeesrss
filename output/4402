[normal]Thank you for the opportunity to raise issues and submit evidence to this Inquiry. As a background we 
[normal]would also refer to our evidence 
[normal]submitted to the Strategic Roads Inquiry two months ago.

[normal]In our evidence to the Committee we have structured our response, following this Introduction and a Summary Issues section with general issues
[normal] 
[normal]followed by responses to the eight questions raised
[normal] in the Call for Evidence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Local Government Technical Advisers Group (
[normal]TAG) represents a large number of local authorities in the country, these include those with highway and transport responsibilities; such as Transport for London, most London boroug
[normal]hs, Metropolitan authorities, Unitary authorities, consultants providing highway and transport services for major local authorities and many of the districts and towns in two tier authorities. While these ‘second tier’ authorities do not have direct respon
[normal]sibility for transport, they do have a major role in looking after significant towns and the sensible overall planning of them including providing a reasonable environment and trying to ensure, through the Highways and Transport Authorities, that the trans
[normal]port system is fit for purpose. Overall we represent over 100 different authorities. Thus for any technical or professional group, we believe we are the most effective representative organisation likely to have a technical as well as public view on any pol
[normal]icy issues (we are professional advisers to the LGA). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]This evidence has been seen and approved by TAG representatives in various areas of the country.

[normal]TAG does 
[normal]appreciate central government support for local services including transport however local government have vastly insufficient funding or powers to ensure that the services are properly delivered or directed to the real priorities. 
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Regardless of the level
[normal] of overall funding or powers, the present and near future mechanisms for funding for transport have a number of problems these can be summarised as follows:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Funding mechanisms for 
[normal]various Local Transport infrastructure and services have changed at frequent intervals over the memory of Transport professionals in TAG.  In the 1970’s the main funding was through the Transport Policies and Programme annual submission and this covered re
[normal]venue and capital and monies which were duly made from central funds to Councils or Councils were allowed to spend their rates based receipts on various items of Transport. Each submission was often a substantial work volume or overhead on Local Authoritie
[normal]s (LAs) and the administrative work/ overhead has grown very substantially over the last 30 years. Ownership /responsibility for management of various roads, buses and trains have also changed many times during the last 30 years which have had similar impa
[normal]cts limiting the ability of local authorities to consistently deliver sensible integrated transport policies.  Furthermore the substantially greater and increasing levels of resources available to the Highways Agency for their 2% of the road network has fu
[normal]rther hindered the LAs task.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]In order to deliver effective management of local transport, LAs really need a major input into key areas including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]Recently funding and legislation have not been sufficiently supportive for LAs 
[normal]to make an 
[normal]adequate contribution to these needs.  Furthermore despite promises of simplification and less bidding required to obtain moneys from central government, recently the complications have grown.  At present funding is available for the services and heavily s
[normal]kewed towards capital including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Post 2015 most of the funding for local authority major and minor capital schemes will go into the Single Regional Growth Fund. Other funds almost inevitably will be available but as yet we do not know how this will pan out and how much revenue assistance 
[normal]will be available. Recently released National Statistic figures indicate that LA revenue expenditure on Highways and Transport has fallen by £1,706m or 26% between 2009-10 and 2012-13, with the consequential reductions in services both in terms of public t
[normal]ransport and maintenance activities and further reductions are anticipated. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]Within this overall reduction in revenue spend a number of elements, such as the costs of servicing debt associated with previous investment and statutory concessionary fare 
[normal]reimbursements have been constrained by external factors, the impact of which is to increase pressure and reduce services further in other key areas such as infrastructure maintenance and other concessionary fare arrangements for example. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]One significant impact of the speed and severity of the levels of reduction in revenue spending is the level of de-skilling which is occurring; many skilled and experienced staff have left local government service, a trend which is set to continue as previ
[normal]ous decisions on spending continue to impact. The private sector has suffered similar reductions in revenues and consequentially reduced staffing levels. There is evidence of recovery in the private sector market, accompanied with indications of skills sho
[normal]rtages. The ability to deliver increases in infrastructure investment effectively both in the immediate and medium term must therefore be questionable. In the longer term the ability to attract high quality graduates into the industry to deliver the necess
[normal]ary essential skills sets must remain questionable given the volatility in the funding of infrastructure both at the national and local levels. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]It appears that the Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPS) charged with deciding how local areas should bid 
[normal]for capital transport funding now cover a completely new set of divisions of the Country not particularly reflecting traditional area wide divisions and that the people making decisions are not democratically accountable.  Additionally, a significant propo
[normal]rtion of the funding over which the LEPs will now preside had previously been devolved to LAs.  Nevertheless the LAs will still have financial responsibility to ensure that the money is properly 
[normal]spent and will make the best of the challenge presented by th
[normal]e new arrangements. Experience suggests it usually takes at least 20 years for a fairly consistent management to get to grips with an understanding of how an area works and the priorities
[normal]; this 
[normal] represent
[normal]s
[normal] a significant challenge and steep learning curv
[normal]e for the LEPs particularly in the area of transport. Furthermore even then, if there is money on offer
[normal],
[normal] experience indicates that local authorities will and have bid for schemes or infrastructure which would not normally be their priorities (as they often
[normal] get a much subsidised product even if they don’t really need it).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8
[normal]              
[normal]TAG does welcome the government’s recognition that maintenance needs substantial extra funding and recent announcements relating to additional capital investment but so far the sums se
[normal]em well short of sufficient to meet the costs of keeping the system in its present depleted state, let alone covering the years of shortfall.  We should certainly not be spending money expanding the existing road or even rail infrastructure until we have p
[normal]roperly looked after what we have got.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]While it is difficult for TAG to surmise the government’s intentions the following may be considerations:
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]TAG believes LAs
[normal] have the length of experience and knowledge and are 
[normal]best placed to know what communities need.
[normal] The new system will r
[normal]esult in fragmentation of national transport budgets
[normal] and w
[normal]eakening of clarity of direction for funding priorities – national vs. local
[normal]. The
[normal]re will be an i
[normal]ncreased numbers of organisations involved in the funding decision and distribution of funding –
[normal] this could also be a 
[normal]problem for DfT dealing with more organisations with less budget.
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]Alternative
[normal]s may include – direct funding to LA
[normal]s
[normal]. Whi
[normal]le this would need some assessment by the DfT, such assessment must ensure that it matches the needs identified in para 3.2 above rather than be based largely on modelled travel t
[normal]i
[normal]me savings. While we are not geared up to identify models used in other cou
[normal]ntries we believe that a study would throw up some useful alternatives.
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]Generally, yes – organisations will group and arrange to pool and share resources
[normal] and
[normal] buy in if necessary but this will take a little time and require some relearning by some of the bodies. 
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]It is q
[normal]uestionable whether the levels of funding currently provided through the indicative allocations is sufficient to maintain a viable establis
[normal]hment 
[normal]for assessing and prioritising schemes with 
[normal]great uncertainty remaining regarding the funding to other streams particularly Growth Funds. 
[normal]Assessment methods for local and trunk roads do need a complete overhaul and should be objective and strategy ba
[normal]sed rather than spurious modelled time savings 
[normal]- 
[normal]for peak times and 30 years ahead should not be used.
[normal]4.6
[normal]              
[normal]This assessment task is further complicated by LA
[normal]s downsizing with loss of skills, private sector downsized with only limited scope for growth due to
[normal] critical loss of skills. Longer term skills and retention issues need
[normal] a
[normal] pipeline approach
[normal],
[normal] not stop / start.
[normal]4.7
[normal]              
[normal]TAG recognises the need 
[normal]to continue 
[normal]to 
[normal]reinforce
[normal] the 
[normal]linkage between transport and economic outcomes – 
[normal]however
[normal],
[normal] while we fully recognise tha
[normal]t Communications and Transport are one important requisite for economic health
[normal],
[normal] the scale, sort
[normal] (mode capital or revenue etc)
[normal] and management of transport to best deliver the economic health is far from clear.(please see our evidence to the 
[normal]S
[normal]trategic 
[normal]R
[normal]oads inquiry)
[normal].
[normal]4.8
[normal]              
[normal]It may be that 
[normal]Unitary or Combined authorities
[normal] covering all modes and all networks
[normal] way forward? – local base, knowledge and service delivery combining essential skills for larger geographic / economic areas. 
[normal]4.9
[normal]              
[normal]Collaboration can and has worked although strong leadership is essential and a lead authority is a practical requirement.
[normal]4.10
[normal]              
[normal]Many formal relationships have been swept aside as burdens of reporting and red tape have lifted
[normal].  In
[normal] some areas
[normal] this 
[normal]has resulted in absence of regular contact.
[normal] In order to be e
[normal]ffective 
[normal]this
[normal] needs to be on a personal basis, re
[normal]gular and focused communications.  While people do change jobs the Ministerial changes and the Civil service procedures for cycling staff around do not help to get a thorough understanding 
[normal]and optimum delivery
[normal]. 
[normal] The loss of Regional Office for the DfT and DOE/DCLG has exacerbated this problem. Furthermore some large organisations such as
[normal] Network Rail / ORR 
[normal]are 
[normal]impenetrable
[normal] and the bus industry is fragmented but behaves like semi-monopolies i
[normal]n different areas.
[normal]4.11
[normal]              
[normal]No – funding allocations
[normal] are 
[normal]inadequate to sustain basic transp
[normal]ort needs especially outside London – please see para 3.2 for identified needs. 
[normal]As mentioned in 3.1 funding streams are constantly changing and the bidding process for funding often with small sums involved is a substantial overhead on delivery. The compet
[normal]ition element of the regional growth fund adds a further degree of uncertainty regarding potential levels of funding likely to 
[normal]be available for transport. Additionally, while the regional growth fund has recently been defined in outline o
[normal]ther funding strea
[normal]ms 
[normal]remain 
[normal]uncertain
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]There appears to be an a
[normal]bsence regarding sub-national / regional scale project funding.
[normal] 
[normal]4.12
[normal]              
[normal]Within our larger towns
[normal],
[normal] the 
[normal]City Deals
[normal] may provide an
[normal] opportunity for some larger scale projects but 
[normal]are 
[normal]not structured for this purpose and
[normal] 
[normal]it is not 
[normal]clear how coverage will map across England.
[normal]4.13
[normal]              
[normal]A significant investment has been made establishing LTB’s an
[normal]d although some of the work will no doubt be salvaged through the SLGF process, this is now controlled through LEP’s who are not democratically accountable.
[normal]4.14
[normal]              
[normal]Great uncertainty of the levels of future funding for, not only, major transport schemes but k
[normal]ey elements of work previously funded through the Local Transport Plans such as potentially road safety and Sustainable Transport which in addition to the LTP’s was funded through a competitive pot arrangement the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. Many of 
[normal]the activities have no direct alignment to the original objectives of LEP’s.
[normal]4.15
[normal]              
[normal]Another key factor is the l
[normal]ack of forward planning
[normal], consequent
[normal] loss of any concept of pipeline 
[normal]and so 
[normal]loss of key skills.
[normal]4.16
[normal]              
[normal]This is m
[normal]ore problematic given the direction of planning policy which is removing the need to 
[normal]provide even basic essential infrastructure in the pursuit of short term objectives and 
[normal]likely only to provide 
[normal]land owners with windfall income. 
[normal]4.17
[normal]              
[normal]A 
[normal]Workplace Parking levy 
[normal]has been successfully introduced in
[normal] Nottingham 
[normal]and enabled additional funding to
[normal] be directed towards transport investment given the additional revenue stream provided. However, the government’s apparent approach of adopting only populist solutions to transport problems is likely to prevent even the most forwarding thinking authorities
[normal] adopting such innovative approaches. 
[normal]4.18
[normal]              
[normal]Additionally, opportunities for private sector funding are not well distributed and individual interventions may not necessarily be directed in the interest of an overall transport strategy, for example by seeking to increase road capacity rather than impr
[normal]ove public transport. Accordingly, 
[normal]continuing public sector funding to deliver transport objectives
[normal] appears necessary.
[normal] 
[normal]419
[normal]              
[normal]There appears to be only l
[normal]imited
[normal] alternative funding
[normal] 
[normal]opportunities 
[normal]in
[normal] the
[normal] short-term with 
[normal]potential for 
[normal]only slight growth 
[normal]primarily
[normal] in areas where growth is already a problem 
[normal]and in the longer term
[normal] this alternative funding remains problematic
[normal]. 
[normal]A system which recovers increases in land value resulting from transport investment is one option which is regularly identified and dismissed o
[normal]n the basis of complexity however it is less clear whether it is the vested interests of the land owners which are the greatest problem to be overcome.
[normal]4.20
[normal]              
[normal]In terms of delivery, most local authorities work with the private sector both for technical work a
[normal]nd delivery of projects. The major obstacle to better working has been the lack of ability to adequately forward plan due to financial uncertainty. 
[normal]4.21
[normal]              
[normal]Local authority members are being held accountable for the performance of the network but increasingly the investment is being directed by LEP’s wi
[normal]thout democratic accountability. Whereas this may be seen to be good reason for LA’s to work productively wit
[normal]h LEP’s it is unclear what motivation exists for reciprocity. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We hope that this evidence will be useful to the Committee. We would be pleased to elaborate, provide any supporting evidence by additional documentation and verbally in front of the Committee
[normal].
