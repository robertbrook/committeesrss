"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nSarah \nCheffins\n (CYS0072)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI am a careful cyclist who has had four years experience of cycling in rush hour traffic in a built up urban area as well as more rural areas\n plus touring holidays across the UK and France\n.  During these four years I have experienced a lot of near misses (thankfully no hits) due to careless driver behaviour from passing too close, overtaking and then turning right across my path, undercutting another vehicle into my path, \npulling out across\n my path because they didn’t see me \nand many others.\n&#xa0;\nI have also done a two week cycle tour in France where none of the above happened because the laws relating to cyclists and motorists are very different with the onus of cycle safety resting very defini\ntely on the motorist.\n&#xa0;\nThe French laws should be put into action in the UK and this alone would sort out much of the problem.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
